"Benjamin Netanyahu has received support in the form of action movie star Chuck Norris, who claims the Israeli leader's re-election is crucial for the safety of the country. In a short YouTube video called Please Vote For Prime Minister Netanyahu, Norris, 75, said: 'I watched Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech before Congress, and I saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul. I also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the Israeli people. 'I have done three movies in Israel – 'Delta Force' being my favorite – and I formed many friendships while there. You have an incredible country, and we want to keep it that way. 'You have an incredible country, and we want to keep it that way': Chuck Norris, 75, has made an intervention into the Israeli election, calling on Benjamin Netanyahu to be re-elected . 'Courage and vision': Norris believes that Netanyahu is the leader who can stand up against the 'evil forces' threatening both Israel and the United States . 'That's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only Israel but also the United States. 'You see, we, the American people, need Prime Minister Netanyahu as much as you do. Weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on America, too. 'So I ask you, please, for the sake of Israel and the whole Middle East, vote for Prime Minister Netanyahu on Election Day. 'And as far as those in the U.S. and the rest of the world, in this season of Easter, it's good to remember what the Hebrew Scriptures say about Israel and those who support her: ""Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: May they prosper who love you"" (Psalm 122:1).' Norris, star of Way of the Dragon, Walker, Texas Ranger; and the subject of countless internet memes and jokes, backed Mr Netanyahu during the last Israeli election. He is also not the only Hollywood star to lend his support to Mr Netanyahu. Jon Voight, the Oscar winner and father of Angelina Jolie, released a video last week voicing his support as well as his disdain for Barack Obama, saying 'President Obama does not love Israel'. He follows this up by saying: 'His whole agenda is to control Israel. In this way, he can be friends with all of Israel’s enemies.' He further says in the Just Jared video: 'He [Obama] doesn’t want Bibi Netanyahu to win this upcoming election. America has not been the same since his presidency. I beg all of you to understand the truth.' Mr Netanyahu meanwhile reiterated an appeal to hard-liners, posting on his Facebook page that high Arab voter turnout was endangering his right-wing party's dominance. 'Arab voters are going to the polls in droves. Left wing organizations are bringing them in buses,' he said. He also called on supporters to vote for him to 'narrow the gap' between Likud and the Zionist Union. 'With your help, and with the help of God, we will build a nationalist government that will protect the state of Israel,' he said. A new joint list of Arab parties, unifying four factions, has energized Arab voters and is poised to make big gains in the race. Israel's Arabs make up 20 per cent of the population. Celebrity backer: Jon Voight has also intervened in the Israeli election, saying Barack Obama's 'whole agenda is to control Israel. In this way, he can be friends with all of Israel’s enemies.' Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday there would be no Palestinian state if he were reelected. He's pictured here giving a statement during his visit on Monday to Har Homa, an Israeli settlement in annexed east Jerusalem . Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint List, an alliance of four small Arab-backed parties, prepares to vote in Haifa, Israel on Tuesday. Israelis are voting following a campaign largely focused on economic issues . Mr Netanyahu, who is seeking a third consecutive term, has vowed he would never allow the Palestinians to establish a capital in the city's eastern sector and pledged to build 'thousands' of settler homes. He told public radio the two-state solution was now irrelevant, saying the 'reality has changed' and 'any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical Islamists'. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as capital of their future state, and continued settlement building has incensed the international community, which sees it as an obstacle to peace. Throughout his campaign, Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly accused Zionist Union leaders Isaac Herzog and former peace negotiator Tzipi Livni of being ready to abandon Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its indivisible capital. Mr Netanyahu's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing NRG website if it was true that there would be no Palestinian state established if he was re-elected. 'Indeed,' said Mr Netanyahu, who in 2009 had endorsed the idea of two states living side by side. Mr Netanyahu has based his campaign solidly on security issues, notably the Iranian nuclear threat, giving short shrift to the focus on economic issues in centre-left campaigning. 'If Tzipi and Bougie set up the next government, Hamastan 2 will be established on these hills here,' he said in Har Homa, using the nickname of his key challenger, Labour leader Mr Herzog. 'Hamastan' is a derogatory term used by Israeli politicians to refer to the Gaza Strip, which has been ruled by Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas since 2007. Mr Herzog, meanwhile, has dismissed Mr Netanyahu's jibes. On Sunday he pledged to 'safeguard' Jerusalem 'in actions, not just words, more than any other leader', and on Monday insisted Jerusalem would remain forever Israel's 'undivided capital'. Former prime minister and Labour leader Ehud Barak came out in support of Mr Herzog, calling him 'experienced and responsible' and someone who could be relied upon to ensure Israel's safety. The outgoing Israeli parliament and the latest opinion poll showing who should end up with what . Supporters Netanyahu,attend his campaign meeting on Monday in Rabin Square in the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv . Despite Mr Netanyahu's rhetoric, the Zionist Union is tipped to come out on top in the election. Final opinion polls published late last week put the Zionist Union ahead with 25-26 seats with Netanyahu's Likud taking 20-22 in the 120-seat Knesset. The leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier - as in 2009 when the centrist Kadima party then headed by Livni effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought Netanyahu to power for a second term. 'In 2009, (Likud) had a 100-percent chance of forming a government while the leader of the largest party, Tzipi Livni, had no chance whatsoever - and therefore she was not nominated,' Diskin said. Under Israel's complex electoral system, the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes, but to the MP or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61.","Action hero says Netanyahu is the 'strong leader' Israel needs .

"An 80-year-old driver who killed a grandmother when his foot slipped on the accelerator was seen laughing outside court after being handed only a £500 fine and a two-year driving ban. Thomas Gidman hit his neighbour Irene Wills, 75, in his Ford Focus, crushing her against a wall. The grandmother of three had to have her leg amputated and died in agony in hospital six days later, leaving her husband of 52 years bereft. Yesterday Joe Wills, 77, told of his anger and astonishment that Gidman had escaped ‘scot-free’ with only a ‘slap on the wrist’ over his wife’s death last September. Wheelchair-bound Thomas Gidman, 80, from Stoke-on-Trent, (pictured above with friends outside court) was sitting in his stationary car when  his foot slipped on the accelerator and the vehicle crashed into Irene Wills . 'A two-year driving ban and a £500 fine for taking my wife's life is ludicrous,' he said. ‘I’m not an awful person but if you lose your wife you expect more than this. 'Everybody thought it was going to be in the crown court but he has been given a slap on the wrists. Mr Wills, from Norton, Stoke-on-Trent, did not attend court earlier this week after being told by police that the matter was likely to be transferred to the Crown Court. However, Gidman pleaded guilty to causing Mrs Wills’s death through careless driving at his first appearance at North Staffordshire Justice Centre, and was immediately sentenced by magistrates. 'I was waiting for the case to be sent off to crown court - I thought it was impossible when I heard he had been sentenced on Tuesday,' said Mr Wills. 'The charge should have have been much more serious - it is shocking. ‘I actually thought they were kidding me. He has got away scot-free for killing my wife. ‘We had the best life together and it was cruelly snatched away like this and all he gets is a slap on the wrist, and has the cheek to laugh about it. I am still distraught and really very angry that justice has not been served. I will love Irene until the day I die. I just cannot believe that a life can be that cheap.’ Irene Wills (pictured above with her husband Joe), died aged 75, after being pinned against a wall by Gidman's car after his foot slipped on the accelerator. She had a leg amputated but died from her injuries . Chairman of the bench Howard Ball told Gidman: ‘We feel no amount of fines or other community activity is going to change this very, very sad situation.’ Outside court, wheelchair-bound Gidman was seen laughing with friends. Magistrates heard Gidman was waiting for his daughter in his car in a doctor’s surgery car park when his foot slipped on to the accelerator. The car leapt forward in a 90-degree arc, propelled by ‘high-level harsh acceleration’, crossed a road, then hit Mrs Wills, a retired kitchen assistant, as she walked just yards from her home. The court heard how witnesses reported a 'high-level harsh acceleration' of a car before it crashed into Mrs Wills. She was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire where medics were forced to amputate one of her legs but she died six days later. At the court hearing yesterday, prosecutor Andrew Bodger said: 'Mr Gidman had been to the surgery close to the scene of the accident. He got in the car, which was an automatic, while his daughter went to a chemist's shop nearby to fetch a prescription. 'The Ford Focus with the defendant at the wheel shot forward out of the car park in a 90 degree arc and ended up hitting Mrs Wills who was walking along Knypersley Road. Gidman (pictured outside court) admitted causing death by driving without due care and attention and was handed a two-year driving ban and fined £500 . 'She suffered very severe injuries and had to have part of her leg, above the knee, amputated. 'Right from the outset the defendant said his foot had slipped from the brake pedal on to the accelerator.' Mr Wills, a retired National Union of Mineworkers regional president, met his wife when they were teenagers. They married in 1962, aged 21 and 23, and had one child, Valerie, three years later. Their daughter, who lives in San Francisco with her family, said Mrs Wills had only stepped out for a ‘breath of fresh air’ when she was struck by the car. Police investigators found Gidman’s vehicle had no mechanical defects. Simon Dykes, defending, said Gidman suffered a ‘momentary lapse in concentration with tragic circumstances’. He added: ‘Mr Gidman knew the lady involved in the collision which makes it more difficult for him. He has been absolutely devastated by what has occurred.’ The court heard Gidman handed in his driving licence the day after the collision. He was not using a wheelchair at the time. All driving licences expire when the holder turns 70. To continue driving, motorists need to renew their licences before they turn 70, then every three years after that. But there is no requirement for them to re-take their driving test or have their licence reviewed because of their age. Sarah-Jane Martin, of road safety charity Brake, said: ‘Statistically, older drivers are less likely to be involved in a crash as they are more experienced and tend to take fewer risks. ‘However ... Brake believes fitness to drive regulations need to be strengthened to prevent needless tragedies, particularly through the introduction of compulsory sight checks. ‘When someone admits causing death by their own careless driving, it should warrant a penalty that properly reflects the severity of the crime and its impact on others. ‘Anything less is likely to serve as an insult to bereaved families, and does little to encourage people to take greater care behind the wheel and prevent future tragedies.’ Joe Wills, 77, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said he had lost 'the best wife in the world' and expressed disappointment at Gidman's punishment. He said: 'A ban and a £500 fine for taking my wife's life is ludicrous' As well as being banned from the road for two years and fined £500, wheelchair-bound Gidman was also told to pay £85 costs at the hearing. Irene's daughter Valerie, who has three children, said: 'I'm heartbroken. My mum was my best friend. 'Even though I live in California we would speak every day.I'm really going to miss her. When she went outside - it was just to get some fresh air. 'My mum was a kind, caring and incredibly loving. Her grandchildren love her to bits and call her Grammy. 'She loved my dad. They were inseparable. They were best buddies and it breaks my heart because now my dad's on his own.'","Thomas Gidman sitting in stationary car when foot slipped on accelerator .

"David Cameron has said that he will remain in Parliament as an MP even if he is forced to leave Downing Street after the election. The Prime Minister said that he 'loves public service' and would continue to serve his constituents even if he is 'hoofed out' of Number 10 in May. In contrast to Tony Blair, who left Parliament when he stopped being prime minister in 2007 and has made a personal fortune, Mr Cameron said he planned to 'stick with' voters in his Witney constituency. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron said he will remain in Parliament as an MP even if he loses the election . Mr Cameron insisted the Conservatives could win a majority and said that no one on his team was preparing contingencies for a hung parliament . He said: 'I love serving my constituents, I love public service, I think it's what I care about. It's a vocation for me. 'In the unhappy event I'm not Prime Minister on May 8, the people of West Oxfordshire I hope will stick with me and I'll stick with them.' Asked what he would do if he was no longer Prime Minister in an interview with the website BuzzFeed, Mr Cameron said: 'I'm not going to think about that because I've got 50 days to fight the vital election and want to win re-election. 'I think this Government is doing some good things for our country and I want to keep on doing that. 'It's the country's choice, if they hoof me out and go for the other guy, I'll have to think of something else. But I hope I hope I'll still be a Member of Parliament.' He insisted that the Conservatives could win a majority and said that no one on his team was preparing contingencies for a hung parliament. During the online interview, Mr Cameron said he was proud of the 'genuinely ground-breaking' work the Government has done on internet safety and spoke about his own children. He said: 'Now when you set up your account the filters are automatically on. I' ve got three children of primary school age and they get to find out the code on your iPad pretty quickly. 'It is reassuring to know the Government has done some very good things on this. I think having the filters switched on is good.' Mr Cameron said that his children do not have unfettered access to mobile phones. He said: 'My daughter has got an iTouch but everything is quite strictly controlled in terms of screen time and we have the filters on for things like my iPad. 'But this is a conversation every parent in the country is having with their children. What age should they be when they should have a Facebook account and unfettered access to a mobile phone? 'We've got an 11-year-old, a nine-year-old and a four-year-old so we're not at that stage yet.' Mr Cameron dressed down for the event in front of trendy advertising and new media types by wearing an open-necked shirt for the interview with BuzzFeed in central London . Mr Cameron said that he personally has an iPhone 'which is basically for family and friends' and a BlackBerry that he uses for work emails. He said that he was not a user of the popular phone app SnapChat, but he said that he sometimes looked at the messages people send him on Twitter, adding: 'You have got to take the rough with the smooth in this job.' When asked if he ever sneaks out of Downing Street without his security detail, Mr Cameron said: 'No because they are trained killers.' Questioned on the four schoolgirls from east London who are thought to have fled to Syria to join the so-called Islamic State, Mr Cameron said: 'I think they're deeply misguided and potentially joining a criminal organisation that could make them part of a terrorist conspiracy. 'We want to get them back and try to get this radical nonsense out of their heads.' Mr Cameron disclosed that - like Ed Miliband - he has two kitchens in his London home. But the Prime Minister said he had the second kitchen installed in his house in Notting Hill for the benefit of the carers who looked after his disabled son Ivan, who died in 2009. Mr Miliband last week faced accusations that he was out of touch following the disclosure that he had two kitchens after he and his wife Justine were filmed in the smaller of the pair for a BBC interview. Mr Cameron said: 'We actually had to extend into the basement and we put in an extra kitchen, not least because I had a very disabled son, Ivan, and his carers were there and they looked after him and so we did that for them as well has for him. 'The point is not whether you have got two kitchens, but whether you have a photocall in one of them and pretend it's your kitchen. That's the issue.' The interview was part of the American website's BuzzFeed Brews series that usually sees people answer questions over a beer. Mr Cameron dressed down for the event in front of trendy advertising and new media types by wearing an open-necked shirt, but he declined an alcoholic drink and instead sipped water during the interview in central London. He told the audience that he was a 'big fan' of popular television series Game of Thrones. BuzzFeed, which is well-known for its list-based articles, has become increasingly popular with young people on both sides of the Atlantic, but Mr Cameron faced embarrassment at a No 10 Christmas drinks party in December last year when he asked a group of the site's writers: 'What is 'the BuzzFeed'?'","Mr Cameron says he plans to 'stick with' voters in his Witney constituency .

"The shooting of two police officers during protests in Ferguson was 'a professional job' by a sniper-style gunman, witnesses have claimed. Both officers were struck outside the police headquarters by shots believed to come from across the street from up to 120 yards away, possibly from a rooftop building. One was shot in the right shoulder, with the bullet exiting through his back. The other in the right cheek, just below the eye. The bullet lodged behind his ear. Speculation is now growing that it must have been the work of a highly skilled shooter possibly using a rifle. Scroll down for video .

The witness, who did not give his name, claimed that the shots came from the rooftop of a building across the street from the police headquarters. Gabe Crocker, head of the St Louis Police Association, said the circumstances of the shooting suggest that the gunman may be someone with weapons experience. Protesters called for calm but vowed to keep pushing for change in Ferguson a day after the shootings. Dozens gathered for a candlelight vigil last night, where they expressed sympathy for the wounded officers. They also prayed for peace as Ferguson moves forward in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report on racial bias in its law-enforcement practices.

A larger crowd of about 200 protesters gathered later outside the police department, but the scene was a marked contrast to the previous night, when fights broke out before the shootings. Some called for specific changes: the resignation of Ferguson's mayor or the disbanding of the police department. Others were there to remember 18-year-old Michael Brown, whose shooting death by a Ferguson police officer in August made the city a national focal point. 'We'll not be derailed in the pursuit of justice by anybody or anything that wants to get in our way,' said the Rev Traci Blackmon, a member of the state's Ferguson Commission who led the prayer vigil at a public plaza in downtown Ferguson near the police department. 'We refuse to stop.' Officers from the St Louis County Police Department and the Missouri Highway Patrol were summoned to bolster security but largely stood idle in the distance.

Taking a stand: A protester wearing a Guy Fawkes mask holds a sign as demonstrators march through the streets of Ferguson . They marked the first time in more than seven months of tension in Ferguson that officers were shot at a protest, and the bloodshed threatened to inflame the already fraught relationship between police and demonstrators. Both wounded officers were released from the hospital Thursday, but St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar - who called the attack an ambush - said they could have been killed. One was shot in the right shoulder, the bullet exiting through his back. The other in the right cheek, just below the eye. The bullet lodged behind his ear. Several people were taken in for questioning but were later released and no arrests were made by late Thursday. Three people were rounded up and taken from their home in a pre-dawn raid carried out by a SWAT team. Lamont Underwood, 47, Iresha Turner, 22, and Martez Little, 25, were handcuffed and questioned, but they were eventually released without charge. All three were taking part in a rowdy demonstration in front of the Ferguson Police Department when shots rang out in the crowd, sending protesters running for their lives and leaving two offices wounded. Speaking to The Guardian, Underwood and Turner denied playing any part in the shooting, but said that they drew suspicion because they fled the scene. In the early hours of Thursday morning, a heavily armed SWAT team surrounded the Dade Avenue home shared by Underwood, Little and Turner and climbed over its roof in search of the cop shooter and the gun used in what St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar described as an 'ambush' attack. Officers scoured the home and seized a gun from the attic, which Turner said they have been keeping for protection and self-defense. 'I feel disrespected,' said Underwood. 'I kept telling them I didn’t know anything about who shot the cop. Eventually they said they believed me.'

The 47-year-old Ferguson resident described the SWAT raid as terrifying and disturbing. Underwood said officers barged into the house with their guns drawn and yelled at him and the others that they were the target of the raid. Iresha Turner recounted how she and the other inhabitants of the house, including her 6-year-old son, were awakened at 3am by the sounds of police pounding on the door. ‘We were forced outside. I looked down at my chest and there was a red dot on my chest. I said, “I surrender I surrender please don’t shoot me,”’ the young mother recalled. In Washington, President Barack Obama took to Twitter to relay his prayers to the officers and to denounce violence against police. 'Path to justice is one all of us must travel together,' Obama wrote, signing the tweet with his initials to indicate the president personally composed it. Attorney General Eric Holder said the gunman was 'a damn punk' who was 'trying to sow discord in an area that was trying to get its act together, trying to bring together a community that had been fractured for too long.' In a statement, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and the city council said that although they respect the right to protest peacefully, 'we cannot continue to move forward under threats of violence and destruction to our community. 'We ask our residents and clergy in this area to partner with us as we make our way through this process.'

She said: 'I looked down at my chest and there was a red dot on my chest.' The calls for healing and reconciliation weren't received favourably by all. As participants gathered before the prayer vigil Thursday night, shouts of 'white power' came from a passing pickup truck. Brown's August shooting by former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson prompted protests locally and across the nation, and tensions escalated in November after a county grand jury declined to prosecute Wilson. Justice Department investigators concurred with that finding in a report released March 4. The Justice Department also released a separate report that day that found racial profiling in the city police force, and a municipal court system driven by profit, largely on the backs of black and low-income residents. Police Chief Tom Jackson's resignation on Wednesday marked the sixth departure or firing in the week since the release of that report. Ferguson's court clerk was fired and the municipal judge, two police officers and the city manager voluntarily stepped aside. Wilson resigned in November.","Witnesses claim shooting during protests outside police station was 'a professional job' by a sniper-style gunman .

"Downton Abbey is one of Britain's most successful television dramas. And it seems the show has even influenced affluent households thousands of miles away in China. Young Chinese people are paying £140 per day to train as butlers as an increasing number of wealthy families hire help, the People's Daily Online reported. Students at the International Butler Academy, in Chengdu, are drilled daily on ironing perfect creases into tablecloths, polishing silverware and identifying the correct cutlery to accompany an eight-course banquet. Students at the International Butler Academy in Chengdu, China, pay £140 per day to train as butlers as an increasing number of wealthy Chinese families hire help . Tasks also include balancing a platter  and placing food on a plate using just a fork and spoon. Thomas Kaufmann, head instructor at the school, said: 'Downton Abbey is so famous here in China, that is the standard we are measured at. 'In the last few years the demand for butlers has become bigger and bigger. So it is logical for us to have teachers here.' Mr Hu is one of dozens of students who have enrolled in the school's six-week course, which costs 40,000 yuan (£4,300). He previously worked for U.S. casino magnate Steve Wynn, where tasks included wiping fingerprints from his phone and picking out particular chocolates from assortment packs. He said: 'In the whole world there are more and more rich people. And especially in China, they want someone to take care of the smaller things. They are drilled daily on ironing perfect creases into tablecloths, polishing silverware and identifying the correct cutlery to accompany an eight-course banquet . Students must also be able to put food on a plate just using a fork and spoon. Above, a pupil uses plastic balls to train . The boom in butlers matches a growing interest in British television drama Downton Abbey. Above, head butler Carson and Mrs Hughes in the hit show . 'Butlers don't only serve wealthy families, but also multinational bosses. These people are successful. To make these kind of people feel relaxed and happy, I get a sense of achievement.' Each morning classes start with a round of dusting, cleaning and polishing. Students are also expected to be able to correctly position a water jug. A butter-knife laid a centimetre out of place can lead to failure. Using rulers to make sure the distances are correct is not unknown. Another student Chrissy Yan described the training - especially laying a table - as 'hard'. But she said: 'I want to lead a team of Chinese butlers which will be known worldwide. I want to be asked to travel the world.' The Academy, a beautiful house, opened in response to the increasing demand for domestic servants . Men and women are allowed to train as butlers and complete the same tasks before they finish. Above, two students pour tea . Cutlery, plates and jugs have to be perfectly in line and students fail if they are a centimetre out of place . A butler can typically expect to earn 20,000 yuan (£2,150) a month. Their duties also include more mundane tasks such as fetching groceries, walking the dog, organising cleaning staff and polishing furniture and shoes. The Academy is Dutch-run but partly backed by a Chinese real-estate firm, which offers butler services to potential homeowners as the property market gets tougher. Mr Kaufmann added: 'It is easier to train a Chinese person in the butler trade than it is to train a Western butler in Chinese language and culture.' China is home to more than a million people with assets above £1million, according to wealth publisher Hurun. Between 2004 and 2010 the number of Chinese billionaires rose from three to 64 . A short stroll away from the Academy a billboard for a new housing estate shows a grinning man in a suit and bow tie, promising to bring 'the elegance of British butlering service into everyday life'.

"Tens of thousands of comic book fans decked out in fancy dress gathered in London today for one of the UK's biggest celebration of animated culture. The London Super Comic Book Convention, which kicked off last today, saw fans donning elaborate and often skimpy costumes in homage to their comic book favourites. Comic super-fan and television presenter Jonathan Ross was among the celebrity guests for day one alongside Storage Wars' Sean Kelly and John Romita Junior- son of comic book legend by the same name- who draws for DC comics. There were a number of tributes to Guardians of the Galaxy's tree-like character Groot and characters from the Lego Movie. Among the best-dressed were also a trio who posed as Batman and his nemeses the Joker and Harley Quinn. A total of 25,000 fans are expected to pay the Excel Centre, in east London, a visit over the course of the event, which lasts until tomorrow. The annual event, now in its four year, is the biggest comic book themed event in the UK, and the third for pop culture. One of the event organisers, Gary Morris, said: 'It's been an incredible first day. The atmosphere has been amazing and the level of costumes has been out of this world. 'People have really brought their A-game this year. 'The market for these sort of events is definitely growing. Just look at the films which are in the box office at the moment- they're all based on comic books. We like to look at the heritage that led to that.'

"Out there in celebrity land, in the mink-lined nurseries of the filthy rich, a new breed of fearsomely spoilt children are being raised by their fearsomely spoilt parents. These indulged tots are hatched into a world where budgets have no bounds and reality is a misty blur on the ever-golden horizon. Look at them. They are in furs before they are five, Chanel before six and in bed by seven. And while dressed in the finest of clothes, they eat in the best restaurants, are entertained like emperors and hot-housed in luxury that would make a sultan blush. Meanwhile, the gruesome irony of being given designer shoes before they can walk and expensive birthday parties before they can talk seems to be lost on their crazed, doting, cash-scattering parents. Scroll down for video . First birthday bling: Tama Ecclestone's little girl Sophia . Thank goodness the tots always have a gem-encrusted rattle to hand, perhaps to shake at the folly of it all. Take Tamara Ecclestone. You can always depend on Tams to raise the pamper bar to hitherto unheard of heights of deluxe lunacy — and this week she did not let us down. The 30-year-old daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone and her husband, Jay Rutland, have just returned from a holiday in Italy to celebrate his birthday. Before their next holiday, they had the small matter of celebrating daughter Sophia’s first birthday this week — and Tamara was determined it was an event that would never be forgotten. Not by Sophia, who is too young to have a coherent thought running through her gorgeous little head. But by everyone else who goggled at the £70,000 or so spent on turning the front courtyard of their London home into Sophia’s very own petting zoo, complete with puppies, Shetland ponies and a baby zebra. A rather glum-looking zebra, to be honest, but in terms of competitive party-throwing, the little critter certainly earned his stripes. There was also a real live princess, complete with a wimple, and a platoon of security men delivering gift-wrapped presents for the lucky baby. In pride of place was a rather garish gazebo made entirely of pink balloons with Sophia’s initials picked out in white. As well as a petting zoo with puppies, Shetland ponies and a baby zebra, Sophie was also lucky enough to have a decadent princess palace created out of pink and white balloons . If you have ever wondered what a doctor would see while performing liver surgery on Mr Blobby, wonder no more. Tamara also posted photographs on social media of Sophia enjoying her birthday breakfast in her couture pyjamas, surrounded by giant soft toys and a whispering forest of helium balloons. Another gift, wrapped with a pink velvet ribbon, awaited her perusal on her high chair tray. What and who was all this lavish fuss for? Certainly not for the child, who would have been as puzzled as the zebra about what was going on. However, events like this somehow seem to be more about making an affluent statement than celebrating a birthday. That’s not to say Tamara is not a lovely mother. Her utter joy and delight in her baby is clear for all to see. Yet one wonders what will happen to all these poor little rich kids, barely out of the crib before they are bombarded by all the good things in life — and then some. This torrent of luxury is supplied by no doubt well-meaning parents who seem not to know the meaning of restraint, the value of a pound or the concept of modesty. Few of them have ever had to worry where the next million is coming from and sometimes there is the uncomfortable thought that children are just another accessory, a toy to pamper, a blank canvas upon which they can express how very, very rich they are and how very, very different their lives are from ours. A few years ago, women like Paris Hilton indulged themselves by carrying around teacup dogs in their handbags; now we have the likes of Kim Kardashian dressing her little girl North West — she wasn’t even given the dignity of a decent name — as a mini-me version of herself. And you don’t have to look far to see where Tamara found inspiration for her sumptuous birthday party. Last year North — the child of Kim and her husband, the rapper Kanye West — had a first birthday party themed on California’s annual Coachella rock festival. There was a karaoke stage, a Ferris wheel, a groovy three-tier birthday cake decorated with tie-dyed icing — and a very confused little birthday girl herself, togged out in hippie fringes and a headband. Not only was Sophia treated to a fancy birthday breakfast in couture pyjamas but she even had a real zebra attend her first birthday party . Elsewhere, Jay-Z and Beyonce gave their daughter Blue Ivy a horse for her second birthday. Not just any old nag or cute Shetland pony. Blue Ivy was given a full blood Arabian stallion — and you don’t get many of them for sixpence. ‘Blue expressed an interest in having a horse,’ said an insider, explaining why Mr and Mrs Z went to such extravagant lengths. Did she really? The kid probably just shouted ‘Horsey-horsey!’ at something on the TV — and the rest is birthday history. What on earth are they going to do if she shows an interest in dinosaurs? The Beckhams — perhaps the UK’s answer to the Kardashians — once spent a spent a six-figure sum on building son Brooklyn a brick castle playhouse, complete with drawbridge and tower, at their old Beckingham Palace estate, just outside London. For daughter Harper’s first birthday, they bought her Damien Hirst’s Daddy’s Girl painting costing £600,000. The pink heart-shaped artwork, complete with butterflies, now hangs in her bedroom, squeezed in beside her designer wardrobe of gorgeous kidult clothes. The Beckham children, particularly little Harper, always look like they have stepped off a kiddie Milan catwalk — but what else are rich, fashion-conscious millionaire parents going to spend their money on? At least they are beautifully turned out — and genuinely look like a loving, well-adjusted family. Somehow they have negotiated their way through the wealth maze with sense — not everyone is quite so smart. When the singer J.Lo and her then partner Marc Anthony had twins, their godfather Tom Cruise threw a ‘welcome to the world’ party for them. The bash cost more than £100,000, not including the diamond rattles he gave them as gifts. And there is no shortage of excess with his own daughter Suri, the child he had with ex-wife Katie Holmes. Suri was wearing high heels before she went to school and has a wardrobe of designer clothes that would make Naomi Campbell jealous. When her parents split in 2012, her father bought her a mansion in Manhattan. Not a place for Suri, now eight, to live, but as a kind of luxury warehouse to stash and store all the presents and toys he has bought for her over the years. Tamara Ecclestone and husband, Jay Rutland (pictured), threw a lavish bash this week to celebrate their daughter Sophia's first birthday . As a temple to parental excess, it has no peer. Still, the new breed of wealthy celebrities are hardly going to be counting out the Maltesers and wondering if they have buttered enough Marmite sandwiches for their darling little one’s birthday party, are they? The impulse of any parent to spoil children and give them the best is understandable — but some extravaganzas go too far. Once upon a time, in a world long gone, a child’s birthday party was a simple affair. Sandwiches and cake, balloons and Smarties, musical chairs and then home before bedtime. Younger readers may be astonished by this, but we didn’t even get a party bag. If you got a clip on your ear on your way out the door, you would consider yourself lucky. Look at these children, as the diamonds rain down on their tiny shoulders and zebras clop up to their front doors. It might be fun for the doting parents to show off and bask in all the luxury — but what chance do these children have of growing up normally, with even a faint grasp of reality? Answers on a birthday card, please. An expensive one.","Tamara Ecclestone had a zebra at daughter, Sophia's extravagant bash .

"Arrested: Lieutenant Governor candidate Johnathan Masters was booked this week - apparently over an overdue library book . A candidate hoping to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky claims he was arrested for not returning an overdue library book. Johnathan Masters, 33,  was pulled over by a state trooper on Wednesday and apparently taken to jail over a book he withdrew 11 years ago. Masters - who says the charge is nonsense - claims the officer initially pulled him over for having expired tax stickers on his car . An online booking record for Masters says only that he was arrested for an outstanding warrant. But he says he was told the reason was a theft charge, linked to allegedly borrowing the book and never giving it back,  the Huffington Post reported. Masters denies the apparent charge - theft by failure to make required disposition of property - and says he will clear his name in court. Defending himself to Fox News, he said he had never even withdrawn a library book in Kenton County, where he claims the charge originates. Of the arrest, Masters said: 'I thought he was going to let me go because he was real friendly, but then he went back to his patrol car and was gone for about 15 minutes. 'When he came back, he asked me, ""Did you take out a library book 11 years ago?"" 'I started to laugh, but he said, ""This is serious!"" and he took me to jail for three hours. I plan to fight the charges.' Masters was let out of jail after paying a $100 bond, and is expected to appear in court later this month. He has been beset by legal troubles since his candidacy emerged. He is the running-mate of Geoff Young, who mounted a failed bid for Congress in 2014. Governor's race: Masters is running with Geoff Young, left, in the Democratic primary against front-runner Jack Conway, the state's Attorney General (right) The two hope to defeat front runner Jack Conway, the state Attorney General, in the Democratic primary elections this May. As part of his campaign, Young issued a lawsuit against Conway and other leading Democrats, accusing them of ignoring his campaign to secure victory in the primary. In the legal complaint he compares incumbent governor Steve Beshear to Stalin. Should they win, they would then face the Republican candidate in November's general election. According to the Louisville Courier-Journal, Masters is also waiting for his day in court on harassment charges. He is accused of making expletive-laden calls to an associate dean at Spalding University, demanding his money back after being kicked out of the school. The paper also reported that there is a pending arrest warrant over claims he threatened to beat up a principal after being told he couldn't enter a school to conduct a survey. He reportedly yelled 'come out here so I can kick your ass' in the December 17 visit. He has yet to be served with the warrant in the second case. Masters runs a political blog called The Freedom Skool. His entries include several long posts about the medicinal benefits of marijuana, and a string of multi-colored, edited photographs of his running-mate. In response to the harassment charges, Patrick Hughes, chairman of the Kentucky Democrats, told the Courier-Journal that Masters and Young 'don't have a snowball's chance' of victory. Speaking to Daily Mail Online today, Young said he is 'standing behind' Masters despite the accusations. Of the library book, he said: 'I don't think it says much about whether he's fit for office'.","Johnathan Masters, 33, was pulled over Wednesday by state troopers .

"A doctor at a border hospital in Reyhanli, Turkey, holds up a prosthetic hand being made for a baby who has fled the conflict in neighbouring Syria along with its family. The hospital is caring for some of the 1.6million Syrian refugees who are estimated to have crossed the border since the start of the armed conflict in 2011. Turkey has one of the largest populations of Syrian refugees, and resources in border towns such as Reyhanli are being stretched near its limits. Heartbreaking: A doctor holds a prosthetic hand being made for a Syrian baby in a temporary border hospital in Reyhanli, Turkey . Recreating life: Abdulaziz Bastin, a prosthetics technician from Belgium, works on a new prosthetic leg for a young Syrian man in his mobile clinic at the Reyhanli border hospital . Help: Omar Hawt lost his left leg in a barrel bomb attack on Aleppo in Syria, and is one of thousands who have arrived in Reyhanli . Syria's conflict has left more than 210,000 people dead and 11.4 million displaced since it began in March 2011 with peaceful anti-government protests, eventually escalating into a full-blown civil war after the regime brutally cracked down on the demonstrations. More than 12.2 million people in the war-torn country need life-saving aid and 3.9 million of those displaced have become refugees in neighbouring countries and further afield. Last week, the The United Nations children's fund said Thursday that 14 million children are paying the price for warfare in Syria and neighbouring Iraq, with violence and hardship shaping their future. 'With the conflict in Syria now entering its fifth year, the situation of more than 5.6 million children inside the country remains the most desperate,' UNICEF said in a statement. Rebuilding: Abdulaziz Bastin checks the fit of the new leg he has made for Syrian refugee Omar Hawt . Turkey has one of the largest populations of Syrian refugees fleeing the ongoing civil war with official estimates currently at 1.6 million, and border towns such as Reyhanli have received a large number of refugees though other refugees have settled as far afield as Istanbul . Emergency aid: A surgeon talks to two Syrian women in the temporary border hospital in Reyhanli, Turkey . The agency said up to two million children were living in areas of Syria largely cut off from humanitarian aid, and around 2.6 million children were out of school. Almost two million Syrian children are living as refugees in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and other countries, 'in addition to the 3.6 million children from vulnerable communities' in the host countries, UNICEF said. 'For the youngest children, this crisis is all they have ever known. For adolescents entering their formative years, violence and suffering have not only scarred their past; they are shaping their futures,' said UNICEF chief Anthony Lake. UNICEF said conflict in Iraq has also forced more than 2.8 million children from their homes. At least 13 people were killed and 30 wounded as rebel and government forces exchanged fire in Syria's second city Aleppo earlier today. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, put the death toll at 13, including five children. The group reported at least 33 people wounded and said the death toll was expected to rise because of the number of seriously injured. The Observatory said the rocket fire hit several neighbourhoods in the government-controlled west of Aleppo, and came a day after at least four people were killed in similar rebel fire.","Nearly four million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries, 1.6 million are in Turkey .

"She may have been thrown from the ninth floor of an apartment building, but this cute cat has certainly landed on her feet with plenty of loving friends to help her recover from her nightmare fall. Christened Hei Hudie - meaning Black Butterfly - because of the black fur on her face and body, the unlucky moggie fell 32 feet down to the fifth floor of the block in the city of Chongqing, southwest China. Her cruel assailant had reportedly stepped on her before flinging her to what could well have been her death, as reported in People’s Daily Online. But the resilient feline survived the fall, which fractured her spine, and after four major operations in six months the eight-month-old kitty she is able to get around again using a wheeled brace. The poor cat has lost the use of her hind legs and requires daily physiotherapy following the fall in the Jiulongpo Shiqiaopu area of Chongqing in November last year. Eight-month-old Hei Hudie, or Black Butterfly, has to be encouraged to get around on her wheeled brace with cat food after suffering a terrible fall in the city of  Chongqing in southwest China . She can no longer use her back legs as a result of plummeting 32 feet - a fall which also fractured her spine . She has been inundated with well wishers at the Yu Bei Area Animal Hospital, including an anonymous woman who has put more than 10,000 yuan - nearly £1,100 - towards helping Black Butterfly recover. Because of her frailty the director of the hospital, Cheng Yu, placed her in her office to make it easier to take care of her. When she sees a stranger, Black Butterfly will hide her head under her blanket. Cheng has to gently take her out to pet her and before attaching the wheels to her back legs and encouraging her to walk with them attached using food as an incentive. Black Butterfly weighs 2kg and the wheels make up almost 30 per cent of that weight. With her wheels attached she is able to gingerly walk on her two front legs and after a few steps she will stop for a rest then start over again. Cheng said: 'She is still on the slow road to recovery and needs to exercise her front legs daily to develop the strength in them. The unlucky cat has made many friends since her fall, including one benefactor who gave nearly £1,100 . Black Butterfly needs daily physiotherapy and has had to undergo four major operations in six months . 'Last year we operated on her three times and had to repair her spleen, liver and bladder as well as amputate her hind legs.' Cheng said that earlier this month Black Butterfly suddenly developed a swollen cheek and to save her life they had to operate on her again on March 8 to remove a gland under her tongue. She is currently in good health. After going under the knife four times she is not able to relieve herself in the normal way anymore and will have to use nappies every day. Cheng added: 'Black Butterfly is lucky to survive the fall of more than 10 metres, not to mention the stress of four operations in the space of six months. 'From my more than 10 years as a vet I can say she has the strongest will to live of any animal I have seen.' The director said last week she told the story of Black Butterfly to an American client called Alison. Since then Alison has been coming almost every day to help with the lucky cat's recovery process. Cheng says 'Alison also has some problems with her back and comes every day to accompany Black Butterfly through her exercises on the mechanical wheels.' With her wheels attached Black Butterfly is able to gingerly walk on her two front legs and after a few steps will stop for a rest before starting over again . Alison is a full time mother and her husband a car engineer and two years ago they moved to Chongqing together. They have an eight-year-old daughter called Claire who studies at an international school in Chongqing. The family already keep four stray cats and dogs at their home. As soon as Alison heard of the plight of Black Butterfly she immediately put out a call for help on Facebook and hopes one of her American friends in Chongqing may adopt the tough little cat. Alison, her daughter and two of Claire's classmates have been to the animal hospital to visit Black Butterfly. Claire is concerned that the mechanical wheels for Black Butterfly are too heavy and the length is not suitable and needs to be fixed. Alison said: 'I am very proud of my daughter.At home she helps with the cleaning, feeding and walking of our four strays. 'Helping these animals will instil a stronger sense of empathy in her and will encourage her to be friendly to strangers. 'I will do my best to help Black Butterfly.' Alison said she will get all of her daughter's class to care for Black Butterfly and hopes that she can quickly find a home of her own.","Unlucky moggie has been christened Hei Hudie, meaning Black Butterfly .

"They were both Liberal prime ministers who rode in on large majorities, but no one would say Malcolm Fraser and Tony Abbott saw eye-to-eye at the end. In his final months, the late former prime minister had no qualms about telling the world just what he thought about the nation's current leader. Mr Fraser this year posted a series of angry messages to his Twitter account where he was scathing of Mr Abbott's administration. In one message, critical of the government's treatment of Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs, Mr Fraser said the Prime Minister was 'behaving like a dictator'. He added: 'get rid (of) Abbott'. Scroll down for video . Passed on: Malcolm Fraser, the nation's 22nd prime minister from 1975 to 1983, was unimpressed with various aspects of Tony Abbott's administration. The former Liberal shifted considerably to the left during his time in power . Target: Mr Fraser was no fan of Mr Abbott's administration, regularly flaying him in tweets this year . In a statement on Friday afternoon, Mr Abbott was generous in his remarks about the 22nd prime minister, praising his work in establishing Australian institutions such as the Federal Police. 'Abbott dangerous to harmony, peace, a destroyer of wisdom': Mr Fraser was very critical of Mr Abbott, posting links to foreign news outlets and adding his own criticsms . 'No idea of what a nation should be': Mr Fraser was never afraid to stand up for what he believed . At various other points, he said the government 'has no idea of what a nation should be' and that Mr Abbott was 'dangerous to harmony, peace, a destroyer of wisdom'. In February, he remarked that Mr Abbott was steering his party 'backwards' and appeared particularly upset with the prime minister's latest thoughts about Islam. He posted a link to an Al Jazeera article titled 'Tony Abbott's unambiguous anti-Muslim bigotry' and added that someone had said to him it was 'reminiscent of 1930s Germany', the period before Hitler rose to power. In a statement on Friday afternoon, Mr Abbott was respectful in his remarks about the 22nd prime minister, praising his work in establishing Australian institutions such as the Federal Police. He said today was particularly sad day for those who had followed Mr Fraser's efforts to stop a 'bad government' in 1975. Mr Fraser's politics shifted after he left Parliament, with him resigning from the Liberal party in 2010. Malcolm Fraser, pictured here at the White House as Prime Minister in 1980, left Australia bitterly divided after catapulting to office off the back of a constitutional crisis . Prime Minister Fraser was deeply unpopular with many of the left wing - particularly after the 1975 Dismissal of Gough Whitlam . Mr Abbott said he had sought Mr Fraser's wisdom in long conversations as recently as last year - but the two disagreed on several issues. 'I had quite a number of long talks with him since then, most recently late last year,' Mr Abbott told reporters. 'I didn't always agree with all of his positions. In fact, I often disagreed with his positions. 'But I always appreciated his insights and the wisdom born of long experience.' In an interview with The Australian in 2013, Mr Fraser said he had 'never had any cross words with Tony Abbott'. But there was a catch. 'I suppose I've said some fairly harsh things about some of his attitudes on turning the boats back.'","The late Malcolm Fraser posted a series of furious tweets about Tony Abbott this year .

"The most amazing thing about Murray State University pitcher John Lollar's ridiculous wind-up is that it feels totally natural to him. Before every pitch the 6-foot-1 lefty kicks his leg so high it appears for a moment that he's doing the vertical splits. Lollar gained attention last week during his game against the University of Kentucky when a photographer for scouting site AllWildcats.com captured a shot of him at the height of his wind-up. Defying physics: Photographer Jeff Drummond captured John Lollar in the middle of his incredible wind-up during his game against the University of Kentucky last week . John Lollar became an internet sensation for his incredible wind-up mechanics that show him kicking his leg up to his head for every pitch . The Murray State University pitcher, seen here on spring break with girlfriend Haley Atkins, lost the game to the Wildcats, but won national attention for his unique movement . The sophomore appeared to defy not just bio-mechanics and physiology, but also the laws of physics. He told Yahoo Sports: 'My dad always told me to do whatever felt natural and whatever came easy for me.' He says he's emulating Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan - who surely had a high leg kick, though nothing like Lollar's. Despite exaggerated mechanics, of his pitch, Lollar was unable to hold off the Wildcats. He gave up four runs on eight hits over five innings. Murray State fell 4-1. But the result didn't matter. The picture made him famous overnight - for something he says was perfectly natural to him. Lollar says he patterns his movements after Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan (left), though his MLB idol didn't quite get his left as high as the Murray State pitcher.

"The award ceremony at Crufts was overshadowed by a protester who ran onto the stage as the winner of Best in Show was presented with the trophy after a competition of seemingly never-ending drama. As Rebecca Cross and her Scottish terrier Knopa were handed the trophy at the prestigious dog show, the suited man charged in front of the winning pair, holding aloft a sign which read 'Mutts Against Crufts'.

And just when it seemed the dog show could not get any more dramatic, it emerged that winning owner Ms Cross almost did not make the grand finale after her flight from America was delayed. According to Dogs in the News, the proud owner said: 'I can’t believe it, I am in complete shock. I almost didn’t make it, my flight was delayed, and I thought I wouldn’t make it in time. 'Knopa is one in a million. She was Best of Breed here in 2013 and it’s been a really wild ride. It hasn’t sunk in yet, I really can’t believe it. She was supposed to retire today so if so this was her retirement show.'

"The heartbroken parents of a beautiful four-week-old baby boy who died due to complications arising from whooping cough have been forced to defend themselves from online trolls. After urging other parents to get themselves and their children immunised against the deadly disease, Greg and Catherine Hughes have been inundated by messages from strangers - but not all of them have been kind. ‘To all the strangers sending me Facebook messages and asking why my son wasn't vaccinated. He was 4 weeks old!!! Too young to be vaccinated!,’ mother Catherine wrote on Facebook. ‘Go learn something about immunisation and stop bothering me. Our whole family was vaccinated but we live in the state with the worst vaccine rates and sometimes family vaccination just isn't enough to protect our babies,’ she added. Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . Riley's parents Greg and Catherine Hughes have been inundated by messages from strangers . In the comments section of a Daily Telegraph article online a man named Rich also asked ‘if the mother of baby Riley was immunised and breast feeding?' 'This is one of the simplest ways to protect a child too young to be vaccinated,' he said. ‘Thank you for questioning me. I was fortunate to breastfeed my daughter for two years and my son Riley for the four weeks of his little life until he had to use a feeding tube in hospital, where I then expressed milk,’ Catherine responded. ‘I was also vaccinated as a child and received the booster shot three years before his birth, and was told my medical professionals this was sufficient. - Riley’s Mum.’ The couple, from Perth, who set up a Facebook page to honour their son Riley Hughes after he ‘passed away peacefully in the arms of his mummy and daddy’ at 2pm on March 17, aged just 32 days, publicly spoke about their son’s death in the hope it would help prevent more children dying from the preventable disease. Riley’s father Greg posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’ Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital . ‘Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,’ Riley’s dad Greg wrote on the Facebook page Light for Riley. Catherine Hughes has stood up to people who questioned her online . The newborn, born on February 13, died in Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital as a result of pneumonia-based complications arising from whooping cough. The brave family have now raised an incredible $36,000 for the Princess Margaret Hospital Foundation after setting up a fundraising page in honour of baby Riley. Greg Hughes wrote: ‘It was with a mixture of tears and joy that I logged on early this morning to see that we'd surpassed our initial goal of $32,000! The last few days have been unbelievably difficult for my family, but this incredible show of humanity has kept us occupied and given us a drive to change the world.’ Updating the more than 50,000 who now follow the Light for Riley Facebook page, Greg said ‘We're hearing that across Australia many Medical Practitioners, Pharmacies and Suppliers are completely out of the vaccine. ‘We've seen change in WA and NSW with whispers that other states are hopefully set to follow suit. None of this could have been achieved without the phenomenal response from the people on this page. The support has been worldwide and humbling to say the least. ‘Thank you so much for your continued support, please continue driving the message and donating to this worthwhile cause. We're just getting started.’ Two days before his death, his mother Catherine posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough. The heartbroken parents of baby Riley have been forced to defend themselves from online trolls . Riley's father Greg appeared on Sunrise on Monday morning to thank the community for their fundraising and support . ‘If you haven't been immunised against whooping cough (pertussis) please consider getting it done. Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle with it at PMH please keep him in your thoughts!,’ she wrote. 'If you're anti-immunisation/anti-logic/anti-duty of care to your society as a whole, then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing,' Greg added. On March 17 Catherine then posted the tragic news that Riley had died. ‘We are devastated to let everyone know our gorgeous sweet month-old son Riley John Hughes lost his battle with whooping cough at Princess Margaret Hospital earlier today,’ she wrote. ‘He passed away peacefully in our arms after a tough fight. The staff at PMH were amazing and did everything they could to save his little life but the whooping cough was too severe. RIP Riley. Forever in our hearts.’ His mother Catherine Hughes posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for doing 'everything they could to save his little life' 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle,' Catherine Hughes wrote as she urged people to get themselves immunised . Riley’s father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’. Greg wrote that Riley was ‘cruelly cut down before his life had an opportunity to start’. ‘I'm an absolute shell of a man without my baby boy and I'm truly not sure how I'll cope,’ he said as he honoured ‘the short but enormous legacy this little man has left behind’. The Facebook page Greg and Catherine have set up already has over 25,000 likes. Greg wrote that the family’s long-term goal is to ‘be the drivers of change within this country surrounding the treatment, management and long term eradication of this horrific disease. We invite you to share this page with anyone and everyone.’ Catherine told Mamamia that her whole family is immunised and that they had also asked their friends and families to have boosters. The Department of Health says it does not know how the child contracted the respiratory disease, also known as pertussis. Whooping cough is part of the routine vaccination schedule for babies at two months, four months and six months of age. Booster doses are given at 4 years and 10-15 years. Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' Whooping cough (also known as ‘pertussis’) is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The government health website says the disease is 'highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months'. Babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine (minimum 4 months old) as the mother’s antibodies do not provide reliable protection. It’s very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do, it’s usually not as serious. Symptoms . The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive ‘whooping’ noise, which is how the condition gets its name. The early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include: . These early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks, before becoming more severe. The second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing. Each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes. Infants younger than six months may not make the ‘whoop’ sound after coughing, but they may start gagging or gasping, and may temporarily stop breathing. Information supplied by HealthDirect.gov.au . The devastated parents have set up a Facebook page that already has over 25,000 likes . He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. 'It's important to listen to the experts,' Mr Senanayake said. 'Whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough, it's a nasty infection.' According to the department's notifiable disease report, there have been 244 cases of whooping cough in WA in the year to date, compared to 292 cases for the corresponding period last year and 232 cases in the first 10 weeks of 2013. Data recorded on immunisation rates across Australia on the Department of Health's website shows, in 2012, WA had the lowest vaccination rates for whooping cough and for immunisation overall. In WA 91 per cent of children were immunised against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis by 12 months of age and 90.2 per cent were fully immunised. In 2013, the Department of Health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program, 'pertussis remains highly prevalent in Australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases'. 'Epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years. In unvaccinated populations, these outbreaks can be very large. In vaccinated populations, outbreaks are smaller, with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity, and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced,' the report said.","Riley Hughes died in a Perth hospital at just 32 days old on March 17 .

"A gay couple looking to adopt a baby have made a parody of Meghan Trainor's hit song Dear Future Husband, in the hopes it will find them a child. Titling their own rendition of the song Dear Future Baby, Joe Morales and Joey Famoso from Minneapolis, Minnesota, re-wrote Ms Trainor's lyrics  to outline what great parents they will be, and are hopeful a potential birth mother will see the video and reach out to them.

'Looking back, we were lucky… we could have had her longer, fallen deeper in love, promised her more; but regardless of whether you have a child for ten minutes or for the rest of your life, you have been changed with their presence. 'It was a rough Thanksgiving… and an even harder Christmas… but by the time January was upon us, we were ready to start again.

"Prejudice defies logic. Lots of people loved Peter Mayle's A Year In Provence but it made me more determined than ever to spend summers in Britain. While some of us had to work for a living, off he went in the late Eighties with money in the bank; bought a dilapidated house; charmed the locals and wrote whole chapters about eccentric French plumbers. The cash rolled in, but Provence became a cliché. Envious? Moi? Absolutely. Scroll down for video . View from the top: The creamy village of Gordes in the Luberon (best seen once the coaches have left) That's why, for 25 years, I gave the region a wide berth. But that's nothing compared to Susan, my 80-something mother-in-law, who hadn't been to France for half a century. Then, to my horror, as soon as the Eurostar pulled out of St Pancras, Susan produced a crumpled copy of Mayle's book and quickly became engrossed. Getting there is a doddle. In high season the train goes all the way from London to Avignon. We picked up a hire car at Avignon station and headed for our villa just outside pretty L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, which straddles five tributaries of the River Sorgue and was once a centre of the cloth industry. L'Hirondelle, as our villa is called, is owned by a Hungarian couple. They have done a fabulous job: traditional (terrace sheltered by vines, pool, hewn stone floors, lavender) but also big on technology (huge TV showing all the main UK channels and fridges galore). A region of colour and aromas: Rolling fields of lavender are a welcome sight for visitors to Provence . I was just uncorking the first bottle of rose and about to toast our good fortune when Susan noticed her suitcase was not the one that she'd left Norfolk with. It was my fault. I'd picked up an entirely different one on arrival in Avignon. Now we all know France is in crisis. But, what I hadn't quite appreciated, is how frustratingly inefficient it is. Lost and Found offices only operate Monday to Friday; there is no number you can call and the police look at you wearily when reporting something missing. Luckily, it was market day on Sunday in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue (once described as the 'Venice of Provence', which is a little overstating things) and so we bought several new frocks for Susan, before settling down to lunch by the river. She was a little down about it all, but her spirits picked up no end that evening when we drove to the hill-top village of Menerbes (Gothic-style church, corkscrew museum, teenyweeny streets and, yes, the backdrop to Mayle's literary money-spinner) and looked out over the Luberon National Park, with the Vaucluse mountains in the distance. Two kilometres away is the ravishing La Bastide de Marie, a 14-room hotel (including one gypsy caravan) set in acres of its own vineyards. Misty highs, lovely lows: Mont Ventoux provides a beautiful backdrop to the pretty villages of Provence (left) - while lunch in the medieval enclave of L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue (right), above the River Sorgue, will perk up the soul . The restaurant (£50 a head, including wine) is open to non residents - and the food and service assuaged any lingering negativity about the indifference of the French to missing suitcases. Aix en Provence is an hour south east. My wife was insistent that we should visit its famous market and so off we went, only to discover it closes at 1pm. How on earth will Monsieur Hollande ever get this country back to work? Then we had the car towed away. Things could only get better but we'd not expected fullblown rapture when we stopped off for dinner at Crillon le Brave, an exquisite collection of 16th and 17th century buildings which over the years has been turned into a hotel occupying a prime spot. With its creamy stone, bleached shutters and imposing church, it is everything you could want in Provence - and more. Frankly, dinner went straight into my top ten list. We conquered Mont Ventoux. At 6,273ft metres it's the highest point in Provence, the arid summit way above the tree line. It wasn't a difficult climb - by car, that is. Others were doing it on foot or on racing bikes, the latter inspired by the Tour de France, which passes this way most years. A familiar sight: Mont Ventoux has often played host to the Tour de France - and is also great for non-cyclists . Just before you reach the summit, there's a grave by the side of the road, a memorial to the great British cyclist Tommy Simpson, who died from heart failure in 1967 on one of the hottest days ever recorded in the race. His last words were: 'Put me back on the bloody bike.' Mont Ventoux is an essential outing. So, too, is Gordes, as long as you go there once the tourist coaches have left. The village is irresistibly pretty, so much so my father-in-law very nearly bought a set of those plastic place-mats with scenic photographs complete with a Greetings from Gordes inscription. I told him that for the same price we could have a cocktail on the terrace of La Bastide de Gordes, the famous old hotel that tumbles down the rock face just off the main square. And that's what we did. We stayed on for a thrilling dinner, during which we learned that the hotel is about to close for a €16 million refurb (reopening June 17). A week in Provence might not have the same ring to it as the title of Mayle's book, but a mere seven days here works wonders for the soul. Susan even forgave me for the suitcase debacle.

"Eat sensibly, never count calories and don't keep bathroom scales at home. Those are breakfast TV queen Lorraine Kelly's top tips for keeping in shape after three decades in front of the cameras.

"Paul Gambaccini: No charges were brought . Men accused of rape and other sex crimes should remain anonymous until they are charged, MPs demand today. They have urged a shake-up of the law after several high-profile figures were arrested and named, only to see their cases dropped. Last year, BBC Radio 2 DJ Paul Gambaccini told of the ‘12 months of horror and trauma’ he suffered after his name was dragged through the mud following sexual assault accusations. Police eventually told him he would not be charged. In January, Tory MP Mark Pritchard called for those accused of rape to be allowed anonymity until they are charged after an accusation against him was dropped by police. But critics warned the move risked reducing the chance of serial rapists being convicted, and could endanger women who do not know a man has been accused of rape. They said that if predatory paedophiles such as Rolf Harris and Stuart Hall had been granted anonymity as suspects, other victims may not have come forward to help convict them. Lifelong anonymity is granted to anyone who complains to police that they have been sexually assaulted. In May 2010, the Coalition vowed to reintroduce anonymity for rape suspects after it was dropped in 1988. But ministers faced huge opposition to the idea and axed it. In a report today, the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee warned that a man accused of rape can suffer irreparable damage to his life, even if charges are never brought. It concluded that because of the stigma attached to rape accusations, it was unacceptable for suspects to have their identities publicised before they were charged. The MPs face being accused of trying to curb the freedom of the Press by calling for zero tolerance of police who confirm the names of suspects to journalists other than in ‘exceptional cases’ – such as public safety. Chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘Suspects deserve to remain anonymous until charged. Police use of the “flypaper” practice of arresting someone, leaking the details then endlessly re-bailing them in the vague hope that other people come forward is unacceptable and must come to an end. Critics say other victims may not have come forward if predatory paedophiles such as Rolf Harris, pictured left, and Stuart Hall, pictured right, had been granted anonimity . ‘It is inexcusable that information about suspects is released to the media in an unattributed way. We have seen how destructive this can be to a person’s livelihood, causing irreparable reputational damage and enormous financial burden.’ The committee also said police bail should be capped initially at 28 days to end the scandal of officers leaving suspects to languish in legal limbo, sometimes for years. Around 303,000 suspects a year are given police bail while officers investigate a crime. Around 19,600 were bailed for more than six months – often with curbs on their freedom. But Chief Constable Chris Eyre, criminal justice spokesman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘Some cases are complex, involving computers, forensics, CCTV, interpreters, medical evidence or cross-agency work. These processes are time consuming. An initial 28-day time limit would be unhelpful. We are working to ensure all cases are concluded as swiftly, fairly and transparently as possible.’","MPs have urged a shake-up in the law surrounding men held over rape .

"Andreas Lubitz bought two Audis in the weeks before Tuesday's crash and was planning to give one to his girlfriend . Germanwings pilot Andreas Lubitz bought two brand new cars several weeks ago and was going to give one of them to his girlfriend, it has been claimed. Lubitz, 28, purchased the Audis from a dealership on the outskirts of Dusseldorf, near the apartment where he lived with his girlfriend. One of the cars had been delivered last weekend, just three days before the tragedy. Focus magazine said it was not known whether the car which was delivered last weekend was for Lubitz or his girlfriend. However, despite the gift, German media claimed that Lubitz's relationship was in trouble and the couple may have split up. This has been seen as a contributory factor to Tuesday's tragedy. The woman, who has not been named, is understood to be staying with family while German investigators conduct a full forensic search of the property in Dusseldorf. The couple lived in a smart top floor apartment on the outskirts of the city. Habibalah Hassani, 53, who runs a pizza restaurant close to their flat said he had often seen them together. 'They were a very nice, friendly young couple. She was a polite and attractive woman. They would come in once maybe twice a week. 'He used to tip well, he was very generous. He had told me about his trip to San Francisco. I hadn't seen them for a couple of months before this happened.' Scroll down for video . German investigators removed dozens of boxes from the Dusseldorf apartment Andreas Lubitz shared with his girlfriend searching for clues which could possible explain the reasons behind Tuesday's disaster . Investigators found a torn up sicknote which was valid on the day of the crash among other evidence . Another neighbour who declined to be named confirmed he lived at the flat with his girlfriend. 'I think she will be with her family grieving at the moment. It is very sad.' German media claimed that Lubitz was receiving treatment for depression and had been certified sick on the day of the disaster. Ralf Herrenbrueck of the Dusseldorf prosecutors' office said the discovering of sicknotes inside the property 'support the current preliminary assessment that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and colleagues'. Mr Herrenbrueck said other documents found he was suffering from 'an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment'. Prosecutors claim they have not found any evidence linking Lubitz to terrorism or any form of religious extremism. The thorough search has failed to find any suicide note among dozens of boxes removed from the apartment and Lubitz's family home in Montabaur. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Lubitz knew the area in the Alps where he crashed the Airbus A-320 because he used to visit the area to fly gliders. Dieter Wagner of Montabaur flying club said: 'Andreas has participated in one of his courses in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence with my niece, who was a good friend to him. He was passionate about the Alps and even obsessed. I'm sure he knew the area of the crash well because he had flown in a glider.' Ernst Muller, also a member of the club added: 'I am certain that Andreas has participated at least once or two internships with us in Sisteron (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence)'.","One of the cars was delivered just three days before Tuesday's tragedy .

"A prisoner who asked warders for a Bible was offered pornographic magazines to help him ‘get to sleep’, a report has found. Academics conducting ground-breaking research into sex among inmates in British prisons said the incident proved that it was often tolerated by staff. Sex is not allowed in jails but former prisoners and reform groups say it is widespread and mostly unprotected. A prisoner who asked warders for a Bible was offered pornographic magazines to help him ‘get to sleep’, a report has found (file picture) The study, for a commission established by the Howard League For Penal Reform pressure group, said some jails were not providing inmates with condoms to stop the spread of sexually-transmitted infections behind bars. Even though sex between prisoners or with staff is not allowed, inmates are supposed to have free access to condoms if they are thought to be at risk of catching a disease. The Commission on Sex in Prisons was established amid concerns ministers were burying their heads in the sand over the issue of sex behind bars despite the World Health Organization claiming health risks are a ‘serious problem’. Researchers were refused permission by the Ministry of Justice to interview current prisoners. Instead, they spoke to 26 former prisoners who claimed sexual behaviour was ‘tacitly accepted’ by prison staff. The report said: ‘One interviewee recalled how, feeling “overwhelmed and nervous” on his first night in prison, he asked the night staff for a Bible. ‘After some time, an officer returned and apologetically explained that he could not find a Bible but he could lend instead a selection of pornographic magazines “to help you get to sleep”.’ Sex is not allowed in jails but former prisoners and reform groups say it is widespread and mostly unprotected (file picture) Gay and bisexual male prisoners said they were ‘fairly’ or ‘totally’ open about their sexuality on the wing, while being discreet about their sexual relationships and activities. The research project found that the availability of condoms to minimise the risk of STIs – and the potential for them to be passed on to future lovers in the general population – was varied among prisons. Some prisoners who were indebted to others or who had limited money for tobacco, other commodities or illegal drugs would offer sexual favours in lieu of payment, said the report. It also claimed rapes and sexual assault in prison may be more widespread than acknowledged by the Ministry of Justice, which said there were 170 reported attacks last year. The Howard League has spent two years looking at all elements of sex in prisons in England and Wales, from consensual to coercive sex. Ministers insist that sex is not common in jails but that condoms are available to all prisoners from qualified members of the healthcare team.","Prisoner was nervous on his first night so asked for a Bible, report says .

"An Afghan woman who was savagely beaten to death in the streets of Kabul was murdered because she spoke out against a controversial local cleric, witnesses have claimed. Farkhunda, 27, was pushed from a roof, run over by a car and set on fire before her body was thrown in the Kabul River - in full view of several policeman - last Thursday. It was initially claimed that the crowd had beaten the religious scholar to death because she had burned a copy of the Koran - an accusation even senior police officials  admitted they believed to be false after detaining 18 people over the murder and suspending 13 police officers.

Countering the claims of Koran-burning, locals have come forward to say that Farkhunda was brutally murdered after accusing a mullah of encouraging desperately poor women to waste money of charms and amulets at the shrine. An argument is said to have ensued, during which Farkhunda was accused of not being a proper a proper Muslim and then, most seriously, of burning a copy of the Koran. 'Based on their lies, people decided Farkhunda was not a Muslim and beat her to death,' Mohammed Nadir told AP. The policeman who saw the incident, Sayed Habid Shah, said Farkhunda had denied setting the Koran on fire. 'She said I am a Muslim and Muslims do not burn the Koran,' he said. 'As more people gathered, the police were trying to push them away, but it got out of control,' he added. Within minutes the crowd began to savagely beat Farkhunda, and ended up pushing her from a roof, running her over with a car and setting her on fire before throwing her body in the Kabul River. Having their voices heard: Women are seen protesting Farkhunda's murder in central Kabul this morning. It is highly unusual for so many women to take to the streets in protest in the city .

Members of civil society organizations chant slogans during a protest to condemn the killing of 27-year-old Farkhunda. They wear red paint on their faces to symbolise the murder victim's bloodied face . An official investigator has admitted there was absolutely no evidence Farkhunda burned the Koran. 'Last night I went through all documents and evidence once again, but I couldn't find any evidence to say Farkhunda burnt the Holy Koran,' General Mohammad Zahir said at her funeral on Sunday. 'Farkhunda was totally innocent.' Police say they have detained 18 people over the incident, and expect to be arresting more peoppe over the coming days. 13 policemen have also been suspended for failing to stop the murder taking place. On Sunday, grieving women carried the religious scholar's coffin through the streets of the Afghan capital in a dramatic departure from local custom. Pallbearers are traditionally men. It comes as protesters wearing masks of  Farkhunda's bloodied face have marched on Kabul to demand justice for the young teacher. Members of Farkhunda's family have denied reports that she was mentally ill, claiming this was a made-up defence to protect her reputation. Her father said the 27-year-old worked as an Islamic studies teacher studies and could recite the Koran by heart. He insisted she was not involved in burning the Muslim holy book. Protesters hold banners as they shout slogans during a rally over Farkhunda's murder in Kabul this morning . Taking to the streets: In unprecedented scenes grieving women in the Afghan capital of Kabul carried the coffin of a woman savagely beaten to death after being falsely accused of burning the Koran . Anger and tears: A leading investigator said that there is no evidence to support the claims that the 27-year-old Islamic studies teacher had burned the Koran . Farkhunda was a deeply religious girl. She used to recite the holy Koran and pray five times a day,' her brother Najeebullah Malikzada said over the weekend. Protesters who gathered near the Shah Doshamshera mosque today demanded the government prosecute all those responsible for the death of Farkhunda, who like many Afghans used only one name. Yesterday activists planted a pine tree on the riverbank where Farkhunda's body was set alight. The demonstrators, many of them members of the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan, blocked the road outside the mosque and marched along the riverside route, starting from where the attack began. Many women in the crowd wore masks of Farkhunda's battered and bloodied face, which has appeared widely on social media. They carried a banner accusing the government of broking promises to end corruption and bring rule of law to Afghanistan. Palwasha, who described herself as a social activist, said: 'We demand that the government ensure that all those involved are arrested and that they face an open trial so that justice is implemented and they become an example for others.' Savage: The mob could be seen stamping on the woman while some stamped on her repeatedly and battered her body with pieces of wood and bricks . Brutal: Mobile phone footage of the attack on Thursday began circulatin on social media this weekend . Killers: One of the attackers can be seen repeatedly striking the woman with a piece of wood while another was filmed hurling a brick at her as she lay on the ground . Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who took office in September voicing support for women's rights, is currently in Washington on his first state visit to the United States.  Before his departure, he called the killing of Farkhunda a 'heinous attack,' and ordered an investigation. Ghani's wife, Rula, who has spoken up on women's rights, has yet to make a public statement — disappointing some rights activists including film director Sahraa Karimi. 'This is typical of the women in positions of influence in Afghanistan —talking talking no action. How can they be our representatives,' Karimi said . More demonstrations are planned throughout the week to maintain pressure on the authorities to ensure that women's constitutional rights to equality and protection from violence are respected at every level of society, activists said. Farkhunda's funeral was attended by dozens of women's rights activists, several of whom also helped carry her coffin, demanding justice for the young teacher.","Farkhunda, 27, was savagely murdered by a rampaging mob last Thursday .

"A woman accused of decapitating her 3-month-old daughter in Ohio pleaded not guilty Thursday to a charge of aggravated murder. Deasia Watkins, 20, was arraigned on the charge in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court, where her attorney entered the not-guilty plea for her. Judge Charles Kubicki ordered that Watkins be transferred to the Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare facility in Columbus for psychological evaluation and he increased her bail from $500,000 to $5 million. Scroll down for video . Deasia Watkins is seen in her booking photo . Watkins 'stabbed and beheaded her daughter Janiyah (above) at her aunt's home in College Hill last Monday before going to bed' Watkins was arrested last week after police, responding to a 911 call on March 16, found Jayniah Watkins decapitated on the kitchen counter in the home of an aunt who was temporarily caring for her. Authorities said the baby had been stabbed multiple times with a large chef's knife and that she also had a fractured arm, and the knife had been placed in her hand. Authorities say Deasia Watkins appeared to be suffering from serious mental issues when police found her covered in blood in a bed at the aunt's home. Prosecutors have already said they won't seek the death penalty . Watkins was considered a threat to her child and had been 'acting crazy' and talking about demons when a juvenile court judge earlier in March placed the baby in the custody of Hamilton County Job and Family Services. Janiyah had been placed in the aunt's custody (her home above) after Watkins was hospitalized for psychiatric problems in January . Social workers later placed the baby in the aunt's care, warning her to keep the mother away from the child unless social workers were present, authorities said. Prosecutors said the county welfare agency followed court orders in finding a relative to care for the baby and checking on her numerous time, but they said social workers didn't know the mother apparently moved into the aunt's home about a week before the slaying. Court documents also show that Watkins was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis, and doctors declared her unsafe around the child unless she took prescribed medication.","Deasia Watkins, 20, appeared before a judge in Hamilton County, Ohio on Friday morning and pleaded not guilty to murder .

"A tiny Scottish restaurant that's open only six months a year, has been crowned the joint winner of the UK's most sustainable venue by the 2015 Sustainable Restaurant Awards. Beating highly acclaimed restaurant's The Hawksmoor, The Pig and Italian chain Carluccio's, sea-food venue The Captain's Galley, run by husband and wife team Mary and Jim Cowie, was praised for its green credentials alongside Daylesford, which runs three organic cafes. Situated in Scotland's most north-eastern county of Caithness, The Captain's Galley lies in the town of Scrabster, a 30-minute drive from the airport of Wick. Jim Cowie's The Captain's Galley has beaten  top eateries to be named the top sustainable venue in the UK . Mary Cowie, left, tends to the herbs in the restaurant's poly tunnel, while Jim Cowie, right, prepares an oyster in the venue's sustainable kitchen . The couple  renovated the town's old  Ice House and Salmon Bothy in 2001 - dating back to the early 1800s - and opened their doors in October 2002. They worked exclusively with local tradesmen to build the 30-seat restaurant, and saved one of Caithness's most interesting buildings from falling into ruin. All of  the restaurant's seafood is from wild, sustainable non pressure stock species, in season, from local like minded, inshore fishermen. 'Few restaurants can boast that their supplier and best friends  are all the same people,' says Jim Cowie. The Captain's Galley is situation in Scrabster, Caithness, one of the most northern points of Scotland . The cosy Old Bothy is where guests have drinks before sitting down to their meal in the restored Ice House . 'We think more of our customers than to fill them up with chemicals [from fish farms] of which nobody knows the long-term effects.' Mr Cowie was a fish auctioneer on fish markets for 35 years. He saw the decline of the fish industry years ago and at the age of 52 decided to completely change career. He went to the North Highland College to train as a chef, and his wife Mary gave up her nursing career of 30 years to work beside her husband as front of house. Their son Ashley, a TV host on The History Channel and recently dubbed 'Scotland's Indiana Jones' is also a director of the company and is as hands on as possible when he is up from London. 'From time to time, on a full moon, I go rod fishing for wild sea trout,' he says. 'It is so delicious and Dad is thrilled when I bring some home for him to cook for the restaurant.' An expert in local history, Ashley explains the suitability of the restaurant: 'Caithness was the first area in the UK to adopt farming as a lifestyle around 4000BC.' 'The Captains Galley maintain this tradition by selecting and serving the best veg from the richest agricultural soils in the UK. 'My father is a more a craftsman than a chef. Where most chefs spoil fish by over cooking it and smothering it with sauces, he gently cooks the fish and let's the wild sea taste speak for itself.' All of the restaurant's seafood is from wild, sustainable non pressure stock species . Mr Cowie goes down to the docks every morning to personally hand pick the fish for his restaurant . TV host Ashley Cowie, the owners' son, is a director of The Captain's Galley and goes fishing for the kitchen . 'I wake up at 6am and pick herbs and green leaves from our poly tunnel,' he says. 'I then drive around Caithness handpicking veg from organic growers, and i'm at the fish market at 10am where I buy  fish and shellfish directly from fishing boats.' Nothing is wasted at the restaurant and almost everything is grown by the couple. 'We have chickens at our cottage which provides the restaurant's eggs,' explains Mrs Cowie, 'and we grow fennel, rosemary, thyme, raspberries, strawberries, garlic and lemongrass ourselves.' The Ice House seats 30 people and its domed ceiling adds to the romance of the remote loaction . 'We aim to achieve zero waste hence recycle and reuse as much as possible,' explains Mr Cowie. 'We reuse paper, cardboard, glass, plastics, cans, and recycle small electrical items.' Mr Cowie smokes all of his own fish by hand outdoors on a smoke machine he built himself. 'I keep used egg cartons for my fish smoker and the centre of toilet rolls to support young plants. 'All our wild game and seafood arrive whole, we adopt the nose to tail approach using every part, using the bones for stocks,' he says. 'When filleting I select the most suitable for my fish stock, the rest are given to my crab and lobster boats and used for baiting their creels. Mr Cowie's menu is filled with fresh seafood and locally sourced Scottish ingredients . Jim Cowie and Angela Mackay from the Kyle of Tounge Oysters collecting seaweed, winkles and oysters . 'We also filter the oil in our fish and chip pans, keeping it clean and healthy, adding fresh as required,' he says. 'I even run my car on the old oil from the restaurant!' At certain times of year when the specific foods are in season, Mary and Jim can be found down on the shore sourcing food. 'We collect winkles, oysters and seaweed which  Jim uses for his home made sushi served in the restaurant,' says Mrs Cowie. Open from Easter to October to accommodate the short tourist season, reduce energy expenditure and because of the seasonality of the food, The Captain's Galley has welcomed diners from a far afield as Australia and North America through its doors. 'We always can help them find accommodation,' says Mr Cowie. 'Our favourite spots are sustainable guesthouses Pentland House and Pennyland House in Thurso, a few minutes down the road.'

"Last October, Lynda Bellingham died in her husband Michael Pattemore’s arms after a battle with bowel cancer. Six months on, the property developer, 60, has spoken about life without his soulmate. Appearing on ITV's This Morning, Michael said he still cries everyday for Lynda, who was 66 when she died, but said his 10 years with the actress were the best of his life. Scroll down for video . which claimed the life of his wife, who he describes as his soulmate . 'I still cry everyday but I manage laugh a lot as well,' he said. 'Now I laugh more than I cry now, which is good.' Talking of the couple's 10 years together, he said: 'It was fantastic – it was the best 10 years of my life. And from what I can gather from her friends, I think I gave her 10 good years too.' Talking to hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford, Michael admitted he knew his wife would not survive to see last Christmas, as she had so desperately hoped. 'I didn’t think it was going to happen that week, but I knew that was never going to make it to Christmas. But I thought maybe we’ll have an early Christmas,' he said. 'The week she died I took her in on the Friday night - we had the bed at home arranged for her and everything - but suddenly I knew.' Heartache: Michael (pictured with Lynda at the Olivier Awards in 2013, left, and after her final interview, right in October last year) said he wasn't ready to let his wife go but realised he was being selfish wanting her to go on . Talking to hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford, Michael admitted he knew his wife would not survive to see Christmas, as she had so desperately hoped . In an emotional confession, Michael then said: 'I have to be honest, I went to the church that Saturday and Sunday night and prayed for him to take her. 'Sixteen months ago I wanted Lynda right to the end, but it's about quality of life. That's one thing I learnt. 'If there's no quality of life there's no point going on.' Talking of her inspirational spirit, Michael told how even when Lynda was at death's door, she insisted on always making Sunday lunch. 'One week she asked me to get out a bottle of Champagne. When I asked why she said. ""Lets have a drink to cancer!"" That’s the type of women she was,' he said. Michael appeared on the show to raise awareness for bowel cancer, which claimed the life of his beloved wife, one of Britain's best-loved actresses. Michael believes a colonoscopy could have saved Lynda's life and urged viewers to get checked . 'You mustn’t be frightened to go an get colonoscopy,' he told viewers and said he believed the procedure to check for bowel cancer could have saved Lynda's life. 'Lynda had a health examination every year. But a colonoscopy could have saved her,' he said. Highlighting the guidelines to be checked regularly over the age of 50, he said:  'Lynda died at 66, if she’d gone at 63 every five years...' Paying tribute to her colleague and fellow  Loose Women panelist, Ruth said: 'She will live forever in the hearts of those who loved her. Until the very end Lynda was her exceptional self.' Lynda died just 10 days after the publication of her memoirs, There’s Something I’ve Been Dying To Tell You, in which she revealed for the first time she had terminal bowel cancer. Along with Michael, who was Lynda’s third husband and Lynda’s two sons from her previous marriage, actor Michael Peluso, 31, and his younger brother Robert, 26, a hotel guest relations manager, 300 people attended the funeral in Crewkerne, Somerset, where Michael grew up. Lynda OBE: With Michael (to her right) and her sons Michael and Robbie (on her left) and stepson Bradley, she smiles proudly as she holds her OBE medal during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in March this year . It was the tenth anniversary of the day Lynda had first met Michael, whom the actress affectionately called Mr Spain after the country where they met. Talking to Helen Weathers in an interview for the Daily Mail shortly after the actress passed away, Michael described how Lynda wanted her family to remember her how she was — as a vibrant, happy and whole woman in her prime — rather than let them see her ‘die a little sad old lady’. ‘Her quality of life was horrific,’ Michael said in what was his first interview last November. ‘She was in terrible pain and had ulcers in the mouth and all down her throat. ‘Her sparkle had gone. The cancer was killing her, but so was the chemo. She hated what was happening to her and didn’t recognise herself any more.’ Michael added: ‘Lynda wanted to die with dignity with everyone remembering her the way she was, so Justin [oncologist, Professor Justin Stebbing] told us he would cut Lynda’s chemo by half to improve her quality of life. ‘Within weeks, the ulcers had gone and the old Lynda was back. She started enjoying life again and asked me: “Can we go on holiday?” She was looking forward to Christmas and, my God, Lynda loved Christmas. ‘Every year she bought a huge tree and enough decorations to light up Regent Street. She was a fantastic cook, and she’d lay out the table for a banquet for 25 people. ‘I really thought she’d make it. I even thought that if her quality of life improved, come November she might want to continue with the chemo. But her cancer was so aggressive, she didn’t make it to the end of October.’ Memoirs: The television presenter passed away in Michael’s arms ten days after the publication of her book, There’s Something I’ve Been Dying To Tell You, in which she revealed she had terminal bowel cancer . Talking of the funeral said: ‘When we carried Lynda in, everyone was crying, but when we carried her out everyone was laughing, which is what Lynda would have wanted. ‘On our last holiday to Corfu in September, Lynda was worried I’d be lonely without her. She said to me: “You should go to Australia after I die to see your step-sister.” She went: “You’ve got your iPad here — let’s book it now.” ‘I said: “Hang on Lynda, have you got a hot-line to God?” She replied: “What do you mean?” and I said: “We don’t know when you’re going to die.” And she said: “Oh yes!” But perhaps she knew the end was closer than I did. Michael also admitted: ‘The house is so empty without her, and I haven’t stopped crying since she died. I keep expecting her to walk in. Lynda’s handbag is still lying exactly where I put it after she died. Her diary is still open on the table, filled with her plans for the future. Lynda loved making plans. ‘I can’t believe that just two years ago she was as fit as fiddle. She was in better shape than most women her age, and happier than she’d ever been, and now she’s gone.’ Michael was running an estate agency in Spain when he met Lynda in 2004, arranging a mortgage for her best friend who was buying an apartment there. Lynda, a single mother to her two sons for 12 years, wasn’t looking for a new relationship as her last marriage had been marred by domestic violence, leaving her traumatised. Michael insisted she visit her private GP in July 2013 after noticing she was becoming breathless while walking on holiday in Italy and cycling during a family trip to Center Parcs. A scan revealed she had a mass in her bowel.","Michael Pattemore spoke about the life without wife Lynda .

"In the words of Robin Williams: ‘Your mother knows how to push your buttons because she installed them.’ The relationship between a mother and daughter is a complex one – some hate each other and can barely spend a Christmas lunch in their company, while others go on spa trips, talk daily and even share clothes. According to a new book called The Daughterhood there are nine different types of daughter, ranging from the Busy Daughter and the Daughter of Narcissism to the Dependent Daughter. According to a new book called The Daughterhood there are nine different types of daughter (file photo) Irish author Natasha Fennel decided to write the book after her mother came down with with a serious illness. Sat outside the hospital after visiting one day, Natasha wondered how she would cope when her mother was gone. Had she been a good enough daughter? Would she have enough time to do all the things she wanted to do with her mother before she died? Natasha knew she couldn't be the only one feeling this way. She began her research and quickly learned that other daughters had similar fears and had never spoken about them before. She put out a request in journalist Roisin Ingle’s newspaper column in the Irish Times for other women who had difficult relationships with their mother and got hundreds of responses. After whittling the group down to nine women, who Natasha believed best portrayed all of the main tribes of daughters, they started to regularly meet in the kitchen of Natasha’s home in Dublin. Eventually, their stories formed the basis of The Daughterhood - nine daughters coming together to talk about their mothers and the joy and despair that this relationship bring, with the aim of improving those relationships. A daughter's relationship with her mother is one of the most influential of her life (file photo) Natasha said: 'Every daughter still yearns for the approval of her mother, at the end of the day, it is one of the relationships that really matters . 'For daughters, the relationship with their mothers is one of the longest of their lives, longer than with our partners and our children. 'Your mother is your first female role model, so that has profound influence on how you’re shaped and you view the world from an early age - your mother is integral to that. She has a massive influence on you because she brings comfort and joy and she’s the one you turn to when in trouble - she’s your safe haven. When she starts to get older and nears a time that she might pass away, that safety net is pulled out from underneath you and it’s like a juggernaut coming down the road. The Daughterhood is about resolving that for yourself. Natasha Fennel, who wrote The Daughterhood . So which daughter are you? Read on to find out… . THE BUSY DAUGHTER . You don’t always answer the phone when your mother rings, you make promises you can’t keep, when she rings the door you hide and you try to get your mother off the phone as quickly as possible when you do pick up. Has your mother become the person that you say, ‘Oh don’t worry, it’s only my mother’ about when she calls or makes plans that you want to avoid. THE DAUGHTER OF MADNESS . When your mother has been diagnosed with a mental illness, but when you’re younger you don’t realise why they are behaving oddly. You might crave a mother who would make you feel secure and cherished and as you get older, you cannot rewrite the past. This can make it very difficult when you come to deciding whether you want a daughter of your own. THE DAUGHTER OF NARCISSISM . Your mother is totally self-absorbed, constantly criticises you and makes you feel like a nuisance. She shouldn’t have been a mother at all. THE BECOMING-MY-MOTHER DAUGHTER . A lot of people have this. You begin to hear phrases, expressions and tones of her voice in things you say that you swore that you’d never say or do. It happens most often when you speak to your partner, children or dog. You’ve got to decide how bad that could be though – is it the worst thing in the world that you turn out like your mother? THE GRIEVING-AS-SHE-LIVES DAUGHTER . This is the daughters who once had a relationship with their mother and one day that is taken away because of an illness like Alzheimer’s and they have no control over it. You have to accept it, you’ve lost her and you’re grieving as she is living. The dedicated daughter is a daughter who spends plenty of time with her mother, goes travelling with her, cooks with her and listens to her (file photo) THE DEPENDENT DAUGHTER . This is ‘Dial M For Mother’. You ring your mother at every chance you get. You rely on her for everything from your washing on the weekends to advice on cooking, and when you can’t cook the dinner yourself, you go over and eat at her house. You always talk about yourself and never ask how your mother is. You she still sees your mother as a mother, not a person in her own right because you haven’t made that transition where you see her as a friend. You might even be leaning on her to the point where you’ve become a bit of a burden, even though she’ll never say that because she’s your mother. THE DEDICATED DAUGHTER . You cook with her, travel with her want to get to know her more than you already do. You might even have already spoken about what she would like at her funeral. You take her as an individual, ask her what the things are that she wants to do in this chapter of her life and you try your best to accommodate them. You have made the transition from mother and daughter to friends, but are also conscious that there is very little time left. Your behaviour sometimes this spills over into dis-empowering your mother though, telling them what they should be doing. The reluctant daughter is a daughter who resents having to visit her mother and spend time with her (file photo) THE RELUCTANT DAUGHTER . Even though she knows she should do the right thing by her mother, she doesn’t want to – she has to be dragged kicking and screaming. This particularly happens with an only child – if your mother gets sick, there is only you to look after her, but you are doing it with resentment and bitterness. You don’t like your mother and don’t think she deserves it. You visit them but don’t want to, then feel guilty about feeling that way. It is often the behaviour of a reluctant teenager, not wanting to go home and help out with the house, wanting to hang out with your friends instead. The Daughterhood is out now, priced at £12.99 . In this relationship, then the daughter is in her 20s, 30s and 40s it gets much better, but then as her mother gets much older the relationship becomes fractious again.

"Police have apprehended an imposter who dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow and allegedly threatened a security guard with a knife on the Gold Coast set of the latest Pirates Of The Caribbean film. Queensland Police said the man was arrested in the suburb of Palm Beach 10.15am on Wednesday, almost a day after he broke onto the set. The man was shirtless but had the same live parrot on his shoulder that he was spotted with on the set of the blockbuster film.

The young man was shirtless but had the same live parrot on his shoulder that he was spotted with on the set of the blockbuster film . Not only does the young man resemble Johnny Depp's character Captain Jack Sparrow (pictured), he also has the same disregard for rules . The pair were taken to Coomera Police station and the man is currently being questioned by police, but he has not been charged. The young man broke onto the Pirates Of The Caribbean set on Tuesday wearing an extravagant pirate costume, complete with a live bird, dreadlocks and heavy eye-liner. The impersonator's costume was so convincing he was initially mistaken for one of the film’s extras. Police were alerted to the incident at 12.30pm after the intruder threatened a security guard with a knife. It was initially reported that the wannabe buccaneer brandished a sword. He fled the set into nearby bushland and went on the run for 22 hours. A sizeable police and dog squad were called to the set.

"A heroin dealer has boasted of his soft life in jail with an illegal selfie shot and photos of his cell – complete with cigars, a TV and two games consoles. Jason Crocker, 36, is thought to have uploaded the images online after taking them with a prohibited mobile phone smuggled in to prison. One shot shows a cell door wedged shut from within with a broom handle, and others show toiletries, DVDs and family photos, plus newspaper headlines about him. Jason Crocker, 36, was jailed for five years but has been taking the selfies in his cell showing his cushy life . The headline 'Heroin Kingpin Put Behind Bars', appears in pride of place, stuck on his cell his wall . It is a crime to use a phone in prison and those caught can face having up to two years added to their sentence. Crocker was jailed for five years in December 2013 for supplying heroin from his Plymouth flat. Last year he admitted having a BlackBerry mobile phone in prison and was given a further six-week sentence for using Skype and dating websites from jail. The photos appear to show two different cells used by Crocker, one with grey tiling with a calendar dated October 2014 and one with blue tiling, suggesting he has been moved at some stage and took his phone with him.

Commenting on the photos online, family members laughed off Crocker’s antics. On Facebook, Kayleigh Crocker posted: ‘Go on dad hahahaha.’ But others have expressed anger at the lifestyle he seems to be enjoying. Hevaa Makemsonn wrote: ‘Basically has a bedsit rent-free. Good one, government.’ It is not known where Crocker is serving his sentence but sources said the pictures were not HMP Dartmoor, near Plymouth. Philip Davies, Tory candidate for Shipley, said it showed ‘how soft and lax’ prison has become. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘This behaviour is totally unacceptable. Anyone caught accessing social networking sites will be subject to strict disciplinary action.’ Creature comforts: Crocker has a bathroom area and an assortment of bread, sugar and various condements . Reveling in his 'king-pin lifestyle' the dealer has a New York City bedspread and keeps his tabacco nearby .

"Sydney siege victim Joel Herat has returned to work at the  reopened Lindt cafe on Friday  just three months after he was held hostage inside the Sydney store along with 17 other people. A bear-hug from the premier heralded the start of the 21-year-old's first shift back at the Martin Place cafe, which has been restored to its former glory with the shelves adorned with chocolates in time for Easter. Of those staff members caught up in the fatal siege, only Mr Herat chose to return to work on reopening day, but Daily Mail Australia has been told by Lindt management 'that several others are expected to take up shifts in the coming weeks, it will be entirely their decision when to come back'.

The boss of Lindt Australia wants the reopening of the Martin Place cafe in Sydney to be a 'happy day' after three months of sadness following the fatal siege . The siege claimed the lives of cafe manager Tori Johnson (left) and barrister Katrina Dawson (right) The boss of Lindt Australia wants the reopening of the Martin Place cafe in Sydney to be a 'happy day' after months of sadness following the siege, adding that counsellors would be on site for staff if needed. The cafe's doors reopened to the public at 10am on Friday - around the same time a shotgun-wielding Man Haron Monis ordered the doors locked shut on December 15 last year. Monis held 18 staff and customers captive for 16 hours before the siege was ended in a hail of gunfire, which claimed his life and the lives of cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson. NSW Premier Mike Baird visited the café before it officially opened on Friday morning, where he spoke with staff and gave Mr Herat a hug. 'Joel is in there today - I don't think any of us could imagine what that would be like and I said to him that the city was very proud of him,' Mr Baird told journalists in Martin Place. 'Proud of him being able to be strong in spite of what he went through and that's very clear the thoughts in relation to Tori and Katrina are strong in there. 'There's a strong sense of comradeship that says we can get through this together, we are stronger together, just as the city has marched forward today.' NSW Premier Mike Baird visited the café before it officially opened, where he gave Mr Herat a hug . Two plaques  at the store were unveiled on Friday to commemorate the lives of Mr Johnson and Ms Dawson . Staff members prepare chocolate at the Lindt Cafe just over two weeks before Easter . Operations Manager Sarah Anderson (right) said: 'We are very positive and there's a great feeling of support' The fact the reopening coincides with another celebratory time, Easter, was not lost on Operations Manager Sarah Anderson, after the events 10 days before last Christmas. 'Absolutely it's an important time - we are very positive and there's a great feeling of support,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Another Lindt employee, Lauren Tench, was off shift that fateful day but she wore a beaming smile as she went through last minute checks of table settings. 'It's good to see everyone again, definitely great to see the people waiting outside for us to open,' she said. 'Just before Easter, that means everything to us.' Former Lindt employee Karen Cox, who worked alongside Tori Johnson for many months helping to set up the store in Martin Place, will host a private function at the Lindt Café on Saturday for 30 people, to pay homage to the late manager and also remember Katrina Dawson. Ms Cox left Lindt in November of last year, a month before the fatal siege, but returned on Friday for the reopening.

Standing at the back of the line of up to 100 people, with a bouquet of flowers was Alan Sexgon (pictured). 'Terrorism will fail as long as the people experiencing it don't let it divide them,' he said . 'For me I was very, very, shaky when I was first standing in line and walking into the store but I knew I had to do it because I was supporting the Lindt team,' she said. 'Tori was a wonderful person, I knew him from the things I'd implemented for the store, he always took care of us, even working with Tori implementing the store I knew how lovely he was, he was chosen because how brilliant he was. 'I knew him very well and I also knew Katrina very well, as well.' Ms Cox said Mr Herat's decision to come back to work straight away took a lot of courage. 'Just wonderful, they all decided on their own if or when they wanted to come back, I think it's a wonderful thing that they want to and the fact Lindt has supported them. 'It just proves how strong we are as an Australian community and that we all bond together like we did when it happened. 'When it first happened we were devastated, very sombre, but they are in there today and they are working their butts off.' Man Haron Monis held 18 staff and customers captive for 16 hours before the siege was ended in a hail of gunfire, which claimed his life . Monis forced his hostages to hold an Islamic flag in the window of the cafe . One of the many customers waiting outside - first in line - was Praveen Swarup. 'It's about the solidarity,' he said. 'I'm not intentionally here to be the first person - it's to be here with everybody and to show our support and that nothing will dampen our spirits. 'We wanted this cafe to reopen, it's in a premium location and we love our city and I enjoyed visiting this before,' he added. Security was tight but heavily armed police stood aside, mostly out of view but holding a watching brief across all corners of Martin Place. Standing at the back of the line of up to 100 people, with a bouquet of flowers was Alan Sexgon. 'Terrorism will fail as long as the people experiencing it don't let it divide them - we are very proud to be Australian and are united,' he said . 'I'm very surprised I'm the only one bringing flowers but I think the flowers say something they are very important.' Martin Place was home to a sea of floral tributes in the week following the fatal siege . AMay date has been set for a two-week inquest into the deaths of Katrina Dawson, Tori Johnson and gunman Man Monis in the Lindt Cafe siege . Two plaques were unveiled at the store on Friday to commemorate the lives of Mr Johnson and Ms Dawson. Lindt Australia chief executive Steve Loane said Mr Johnson's plaque contained the image of a sunflower and Ms Dawson's the image of a tree - the symbol of the Katrina Dawson Foundation. 'Let's just make it a really happy day, and hopefully the staff have a great day and by the end of it we're all in a really good place,' Mr Loane told ABC Radio on Friday. Mr Loane said the company was committed to making 'today a happy day to celebrate that we're back and we're open with the support of all the staff'. 'But really they're in a great mood and they're ready to go, and they really want to welcome customers in,' Mr Loane said. Staff members voted on the return date and the 10am opening. Regular trading hours begin on Saturday. The store has undergone a refit since the events of last December and workmen have plastered over bullet holes and other damage that was suffered at the dramatic end of the 16-hour siege. It follows a one-day session in January that heard Ms Dawson was killed by ricocheting fragments of a police bullet or bullets after officers stormed the Sydney cafe following the execution of Mr Johnson by Monis . Renovations have been carried out on the Martin Place cafe since the tragedy . Labor Leader Luke Foley will take time from the NSW election campaign to wish Lindt staff  well later in the day. Premier  Baird, who visited the cafe at 9.30am, recently told AAP he was still uncomfortable passing by the cafe, which is nearby to his office and state parliament. 'I can't really look at the cafe without feeling these pangs of despair at what took place,' he said. 'I know over time that will heal but ... the impacts are still pretty raw.'

The first part of the hearing, which will run from May 25 until June 5, will focus on the background of Monis and related issues, a spokesman for the NSW Coroner's Court said on Wednesday. More than 60 witnesses and experts are expected to appear during the entire cafe inquest, which is being presided over by State Coroner Michael Barnes and will run throughout the year. Findings are expected to be delivered in early 2016. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Lindt cafe at Martin Place reopened to the public at 10am on Friday .

"A small but growing number of parents are bucking the trend of moving to the suburbs when they have children, and are pushing cities to be more welcoming to families. Parents in cities across the country, including Seattle, Minneapolis and Denver, are banding together to advocate for new downtown schools, more playgrounds and more affordable family-friendly housing. 'The benefit of living in the city so far outweighed what we would get by moving out to the suburbs,' said Jenny Kelly, 32, a marketing consultant who helped form a parents group in 2013, now called Parents for a Better Downtown Seattle. Scroll down for video . Jenny Kelly walks with her daughter, Elea, 2, near their loft apartment in Seattle's downtown: A small but growing number of parents are bucking the trend when it comes to raising their kids in the suburbs . She and her husband Michael moved downtown in their 20s and stayed when they had 2-year-old Elea. Both walk to work from their loft apartment in Pioneer Square, where the laundry room doubles as the toddler's bedroom. Kelly and other parents recently pushed for a public school downtown, and they lobbied to include a playground in a redesign of the city's waterfront. Seattle offers developers near downtown the chance to build taller if they provide space for a school, though no one has taken up the offer. Some cities are trying to respond to families, albeit slowly. Portland revised building codes to allow courtyard housing, considered an amenity for families. And Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has pledged to grow her city by 10,000 families. 'Families with children are indicator species about the health of an urban neighborhood,' said Gary Johnson, Seattle's city center coordinator. For decades, Seattle has had a well-earned reputation as a childless city. In the 1960s and 70s, as more families moved to the suburbs, their numbers in the city dropped. Jenny and Michael Kelly's two-year-old daughter Elea stands in her crib, which is housed in a laundry room off her parents' bedroom . Children still make up a much smaller percentage of Seattle's population, compared with the rest of the state or the U.S, but recent trends suggest Seattle is doing a better job of holding onto those kids, according to Sightline Institute, a Seattle-based think tank. The city is growing its share of kids under 15 at a time when that percentage is declining elsewhere. 'We seem to be closing the child gap,' said Eric De Place, the group's policy director. Between 2007 and 2012, the number of downtown kids enrolled in kindergarten to eighth grade jumped nearly 30 per cent, according to the Downtown Seattle Association, a business group that has worked to get more families downtown. Parents used to stay until their kids reached age 5 and half would leave downtown, said Jon Scholes, the association's CEO who is raising 5-year-old twins downtown. But he's starting to see parents staying longer than before. Schools, parks and other amenities matter, he said. In Minneapolis, Melissa and Aaron Whitney downsized from a 2,700-square foot five-bedroom home in the suburb to an apartment half that size in downtown. Parents in cities across the country, including Seattle (pictured above), Minneapolis and Denver, are banding together to advocate for new downtown schools, more playgrounds and more affordable family-friendly housing . 'We drank the Kool-Aid. We thought once we got married, we had to buy a house in the suburb,' said Aaron Whitney, 40, a technology consultant. They quickly realized they didn't want to spend their time on home repairs or yard work and already spent so much leisure time downtown that they moved back with their son, who is now 2. The couple said they wouldn't mind more green spaces and affordable housing in the city. A new school opens up in downtown this fall, and they're watching its progress to decide where they'll enroll their son. Bradley Calvert, 33, who moved from Atlanta to Seattle with his wife and toddler last year, joined other parents in pushing for a downtown public school. The district last month lost a bid on a vacant federal building downtown. He said a downtown school and more affordable housing will be keys to keeping families in the urban core. A city benefits when there's a diverse mix of people downtown, said Calvert. Attracting families, not just young professionals or empty-nesters, creates a sense of community. The Kelly family live in Seattle's downtown Pioneer Square neighborhood: The city offers developers near downtown the chance to build taller if they provide space for a school, though no one has taken up the offer . Lindsey Carillo, 31, grew up in a suburb of Detroit but wanted to expose her kids to city living. 'It gives them a different way of living,' said the mother of two kids, who are 8 and 1. 'I want my kids to have a cultured experience growing up.' Her family of four shares a two-bedroom high-rise apartment in downtown Seattle. Occasionally, her son wishes he had a backyard and could walk to school, but 'he loves to show off where we live as well,' she said. Paul Hughes and his wife Heidi didn't want to give up on urban living when they had a son. The couple likes that their second-grader son, Silas, is exposed to more experiences in the city. They would like the city to do more, including adding playgrounds and a school. And they wouldn't mind having more playmates for their son in their building, either. 'It's nowhere near as challenging as people think it is,' Hughes said. 'The more people see it working, the more they think it's possible.' 'The benefit of living in the city so far outweighed what we would get by moving out to the suburbs,' said Jenny Kelly, 32, who helped form a parents group in 2013, now called Parents for a Better Downtown Seattle .","A small but growing number of parents are bucking the trend when it comes to raising their kids .

"A number of pilots at low-cost airline Germanwings refused to fly today following yesterday's crash in the French Alps that killed all 150 people on board. Their decision came as it emerged the Airbus A320 that dropped out of the sky and ploughed into a mountainside had been grounded over technical fears just 24 hours before. Helicopter  operations continued for a second day in the grim search for debris and bodies - including those of three British nationals  -  that have been scattered over acres of mountain terrain. Reports revealed the aircraft had suffered technical issues, including a landing gear problem, just a day before it was due to fly from Barcelona to Dusseldorf. Scroll down for video .

Burning candles and pins of German airlines Condor, Germanwings and Lufthansa are placed by crew members in commemoration of the victims of Germanwings flight 4U9525 AT the Germanwings headquarters . Urgent safety checks are now being carried out on other A320s, while passengers were left stranded at Heathrow, Stansted and Manchester yesterday after several Germanwings crews refused to work. A spokeswoman for the airline's parent company, Lufthansa, said one Germanwings flight from Dusseldorf to Barcelona was cancelled because the pilots 'don't feel they are in a position to fly'. She declined to say how many pilots declined to work today, adding that all Lufthansa flights were going ahead as planned. Staff at Germanwings and Lufthansa wept during an emotional minute's silence for victims of the disaster at their respective headquarters in Germany this afternoon. A spokesman for the pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit, Joerg Handwerg, insisted the decision was not because of concerns about safety. 'It has nothing to do with safety. The pilots have friends and colleagues who have died,' Handwerg said on public television. 'That is such a heavy emotional burden that it's better not to get into the cockpit.' Obliterated: Search and rescue teams sift through the wreckage of the Germanwings plane as the recovery operation enters its second day .

Show of solidarity: French President Francois Hollande (centre) embraces Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as German Chancellor Angela Merkel (second right) looks on while they walk on a field near the crash site of Germanwings Airbus A320 near Seyne-les-Alpes . Yesterday, Germanwings had reported 'occasional flight disruptions within its route network' as pilots were too shocked to fly following the news of the crash of an A320 Germanwings jet. It was the first fatal accident in the history of Germanwings and the deadliest on the French mainland since 1974. 'We understand their decision,' said Germanwings executive Thomas Winkelmann. Industry experts also sought to reassure Airbus A320 pilots that they will be safe. Steve Landells, a safety specialist from the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) who is himself a former A320 pilot, said the aircraft is ‘incredibly reliable with a good safety record’. Grim task continues: A French Gendarmerie helicopter takes off for another search and rescue operation from Syne Les Alpes after a Germanwings Airbus A320 crashed into a mountainside in the French Alps killing all 150 people on board . He told MailOnline that hundreds of A320s are flying today and pilots should have ‘no qualms getting on one today’. A spokesman from BALPA told MaiOnline: 'BALPA has gained information from the German pilot union that Lufthansa and Germanwings are giving pilots time off for grief. ‘British pilots sympathise with their German colleagues and completely understand. ‘Pilots have to be fit to fly, and if they feel emotionally unfit to fly, it is important they do not take to the air. It appears the company are doing the right thing in supporting them.’ In a separate development, experts claimed the Germanwings plane may have crashed because the windscreen cracked, causing a sudden drop in oxygen levels that rendered the pilots unconscious. Reports circulating on professional pilot forums suggested the black box on the Airbus A320 had been analysed and revealed that a 'structural failure' was responsible for the disaster. This Germanwings Airbus A320 carrying 144 passengers and six crew which crashed in the French Alps . Flight 4U 9525 dropped out of the sky and ploughed into a mountainside in the French Alps at more than 400mph yesterday, killing all 150 people board. In the latest theory to emerge, it is thought the windscreen gave way, incapacitating the pilots and leaving them unable to send out a distress call. That may explain what happened in what top French official Segolene Royal has described as the crucial minute between 10.30am - when the pilots were apparently chatting away - and 10.31am when contact was lost. Flight radar data revealed the plane started its nosedive at 10.31am from an altitude of 38,000 feet. However, experts are also discussing other theories including faulty speed sensors and technical problems related to the age of the aircraft. France's transport minister says work had begun on retrieving vital data from the cockpit voice recorder, although first pictures showed it had been badly damaged and it was not clear how much, if any, information could be analysed. This afternoon, the Foreign Office named 28-year-old Paul Bramley, originally from Hull, as one of the three Britons killed. Another was earlier identified as Martyn Matthews, a father-of-two and businessman from Wolverhampton. Marina Bandres, a Spanish-born mother from Manchester, and her seven-month-old baby, Julian, who is  a British national, were also among those who died.","One Germanwings flight cancelled because pilots 'didn't feel able to fly'

"A former professional boxer was part of a gang jailed for 77 years today for smuggling £11million of cocaine into the UK with the help of corrupt British Airways workers. Stephen O’Meara, 31, formerly of Datchet, Buckinghamshire was today locked up for 13 years for conspiracy to supply cocaine in February and August 2013. The drugs were transported in two loads and flown on British Airways flights to Heathrow Airport, Southwark Crown Court heard. Jailed: Stephen O’Meara, 31, was today locked up for 13 years for conspiracy to supply cocaine. He was was part of a gang jailed for 77 years in total . Drugs and ammunition: Police intercepted 40 kilos of cocaine (left) together with 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition . In total, police intercepted 40 kilos of cocaine with purity levels of more than 90% and a street level value of £11 million, together with 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition. Gang leader Harvinder Sanghera, 33, of Heston, Hounslow, London was caged for 30 years for importing cocaine and ammunition, while his ‘right hand man’ Savdeep Atkar, 33, of Grays, Essex was sentenced to 21 years for importing cocaine. Former boxer and personal trainer O’Meara was handed a 13-year sentence, as was David Brown, 51, of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire for supplying cocaine. Mark Graffius, defending O’Meara, said the former professional boxer met Sanghera while acting as his personal trainer. Sanghera and Aktar would watch O’Meara as he took part in sparring sessions, the court was told. Father-of-two O’Meara was a ‘gifted and dedicated’ boxer boxer who was ‘literally on the very cusp of becoming a top level international,’ according to Mr Graffius. He was managed by leading boxing promoter Frank Warren and had planned to move abroad to Spain where he was on the threshold of a ‘major, life-changing event.’ Sanghera was described as a ‘family man’ with two small children, who accrued a number of large debts through gambling. Jailed: Savdeep Atkar (left), David Brown (centre) and Harvinder Sanghera (right) were sentenced with Stephen O’Meara today . It was said Sanghera, who previously worked on a perfume production line in Acton, joined the drug conspiracy because he ‘owed debts to people you shouldn’t owe debts'. Aktar was described as a man brought up by a ‘hard-working’ and ‘god-fearing’ family. Brown was said to be a person who ‘tends to say yes to people.’ Sentencing the men, Judge Robbins said: ‘You four in your own different ways played your parts in ensuring that some very large quantities of cocaine were imported into this country. ‘You know very well the devastating effects these drugs may have on poor individuals. ‘The wholesale value of 40 kilogrammes of cocaine would have been more than £2m, but the street value much higher. ‘This was a sophisticated, well organised, and determined criminal network. ‘Those towards the top end of the organisation, Atkar and Sanghera, were capable of masterminding and resourcing such an operation.’ Police intercepted the drugs and ammunition. This picture shows the officers' search of a Surrey address . A total of 40 kilos of cocaine (left) together with 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition (right) were smuggled into the UK . Judge Robbins said he agreed that the two disrupted importations were indicative of a much larger operation. He added that Sanghera was ‘closely associated’ with the producers of the drug in Mexico, and had made numerous trips to North America to meet them. Judge Robbins described Atkar as Sanghera’s ‘right-hand man’ and ‘lieutenant,’ who had encouraged British Airways employees to abuse their positions of trust. ‘The smuggling of firearms is every bit as significant and dangerous as smuggling drugs,’ said Judge Robbins of Sanghera’s firearms offence. There was sobbing in a packed public gallery as sentence was passed.","Stephen O’Meara, 31, was locked up for 13 years for supplying cocaine .

"Disturbing questions were being asked last night about four judges caught looking at pornography at work. Fearing a cover-up, MPs and legal experts want to know whether the four were looking at X-rated material while presiding over trials. Two are known to have overseen cases in which the charges related to pornography or sex offending. Three were viewing explicit material in their chambers. Andrew Maw, left, resigned before he could be sacked while Immigration judge Warren Grant, right,  confirmed today he lost his job for viewing porn on official judicial equipment . But senior judges and the judicial disciplinary board refused to give any detail about the ‘inappropriate’ activities of the judges. And officials declined to say whether criminal charges had been considered or whether their summary departures will affect their judicial pensions. A criminal charge of misconduct in public office can be brought when a public officer ‘wilfully misconducts himself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust’. London immigration judge Warren Grant, district judge Timothy Bowles of Romford county court and recorder Peter Bullock, who worked on the north-eastern circuit, were all sacked for viewing pornographic material. Recorder Andrew Maw, who worked at Lincoln county court, resigned before he could be forced out. An official statement said he had ‘viewed similar inappropriate material via his judicial IT account’ and would have been removed from office ‘had he not resigned before the conclusion of the disciplinary process’. David Green, a criminologist at the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘We need to know what kind of cases they were dealing with and whether the material they were looking at was relevant to those cases. That is how their behaviour could have become a matter of conduct in office. ‘The issue is: What do we know about the cases they were hearing? This could be important for the administration of justice. Sex scandals being regularly unearthed have made us all suspicious about the behaviour of public officials.’ Recorders are qualified to preside over crown court criminal trials. But the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, which handles disciplinary complaints against judges and magistrates, refused to give any information about the misconduct or the cases the judges dealt. This means no one can know whether their judge was watching pornography during recesses in their own case or whether cases that might have involved complicated sexual issues were being run by a judge who was using pornography in his office during the trial. The dismissal of so many judges in one day – and behind closed doors – provoked disquiet in Westminster and among legal experts. Liberal Democrat John Hemming, who campaigns for open justice, said: ‘I am concerned about the lack of transparency in the running of the judiciary. We know little about what happened here, but it was considered serious enough for the judges to be dismissed. This is one key aspect of concern over transparency in the judiciary.’ Sacked: Three judges have been fired and one resigned after being caught watching porn on work computers . Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘It is a cardinal rule that British justice is not just done, but also seen to be done. Those upholding the law need to be held to similar standards of transparency and accountability.’ One of the four judges jailed a teacher for downloading child pornography and another sentenced a Peeping Tom for using a mobile phone to film women in swimming pool changing rooms. A statement from the Investigations Office said the three men ‘have been removed from judicial office following an investigation into an allegation that they viewed pornographic material on judicial IT equipment in their offices.’ It said the judges were not linked in any way. The statement added that ‘the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice were satisfied that the material did not include images of children or any other illegal content, but concluded that this was an inexcusable misuse of their judicial IT accounts and wholly unacceptable conduct for a judicial office holder’. The sackings came less than two months after the Lord Chief Justice told MPs of the seriousness with which he regards ‘extreme’ pornography. Lord Thomas told the Commons justice committee he believed a recent murder case illustrated ‘that the peddling of pornography on the internet had had a dramatic effect on an individual’ and that is what is available now to download and to see … is simply horrific’. The secretive disciplinary process culminated in the dismissal rulings by Lord Thomas and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who make the final decision when serious allegations are made against judges or magistrates. No details were given about how the allegation of viewing pornography on office computers came to be made against judges in four different courts. There was speculation the judges’ misuse of office computers could have been noticed as part of security checks of IT systems. The disciplinary process run by the JCIO was revamped in 2013 when the organisation ceased to be known as the Judicial Complaints Office. It has 15 staff, headed by Judith Anckorn, and took disciplinary action in 58 cases from more than 2000 referred to it in the 2013/14 financial year. Judges may be called in to supervise investigations, and judges who are facing serious allegations have a right to be heard by a disciplinary panel, which is held behind closed doors. Yesterday’s statement said that the pornography viewed by the judges did not have illegal content, but it did not say whether other criminal charges were considered in their cases. The action against the judges is not thought to have included measures to curb or confiscate their pension entitlement. An immigration judge in London currently earns an annual salary of £121,450 and a district judge commands £115,489. The judicial pension scheme has long offered equivalent to half the judge’s salary after 20 years of service. They sat in judgment over sex offences . One of the four disgraced judges once jailed a teacher caught downloading child pornography. Matthew Curtis was arrested after the FBI found he had paid two American sellers for child porn in 1999. The teacher at Bourne Grammar School in Lincolnshire said he was not responsible for the 17 images found on his school computer. But ANDREW MAW jailed Curtis for eight months in 2004 and told him: ‘Were it not for these matters, I am sure you would have risen high up in your chosen profession. ‘It is only by your actions that you have thrown it all away.’ Mr Maw was a recorder sitting at Northampton Crown Court at the time. He retired from the bench in September, before the investigation into the misuse of his own computer was concluded. The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office said he would have been sacked had he not retired. Mr Maw, 66, a married father of three, lives in Lichfield, Staffordshire. The former judge was admitted as a solicitor in 1973 and was appointed a recorder in 2000. Mr Maw attended the former Wintringham Grammar near Grimsby. Andrew Maw was a recorder sitting at Northampton Crown Court (pictured) in 2004 when he jailed a teacher caught downloading child pornography . He was chairman of the Grimsby Everyman Club. He was also a member of the Grimsby St James Rotary Club before relocating to Lichfield. He was most recently recorder at Lincoln county court, dealing with civil and family cases, but also sat on criminal cases at the crown courts in Derby and Grimsby. Another of the disgraced judges, PETER BULLOCK, once banned a pervert from swimming pools after he was caught filming women undressing on his mobile phone. He ordered the offender not to enter any municipal pools and gave him a three-year community order. Mr Bullock, 70, was a deputy district judge and recorder on the north-eastern court circuit before his dismissal. The father of two lives in Cramlington, a small town in Northumberland. He refused to comment at his detached £275,000 home yesterday. A relative said: ‘He doesn’t want to talk.’ The third judge sacked for viewing porn on his work computer said he had been suffering from ‘severe and undiagnosed depression’ at the time. WARREN GRANT, 60, a married father of five, was an immigration judge in London and believed to be earning £128,000 a year. In a statement released yesterday, he said: ‘I do not wish to comment save to say that for some years before, and during, the period covered by the conduct which formed the subject of the complaint laid against me I was suffering from severe and undiagnosed depression. I request that the privacy of my family and myself be respected so that we are allowed to continue with our lives.’ Mr Grant lives in Golders Green, North London. He attended the independent Royal Grammar School in Newcastle before studying law at St Catherine’s College, Cambridge. He speaks five languages including French and Hebrew and also plays in a jazz band. TIMOTHY BOWLES, 53, was a district judge at Romford county court.

"REACHING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE . by Allan Ropper & B. D. Burrell . (Atlantic £17.99) Some years ago a policeman stopped a driver who had been circling a roundabout for nearly an hour. When he asked him if there was anything wrong, the man replied: ‘I don’t know how I got here.’ Ropper gives a fascinating account of his work as a neurologist in Boston (stock image) The confused driver, a salesman, was taken to hospital, where a junior doctor found nothing wrong with him, apart from memory loss. He concluded that it was an episode of transient global amnesia (TGA), a dramatic, but harmless condition. The junior doctor asked Dr Allan Ropper, then the hospital’s senior resident in neurology, to authorise the patient’s discharge, expecting that his memory loss would, as usual in incidents of TGA, return within hours. Ropper examined the man himself. Together, they worked out that the roundabout incident had come at the end of a 12-hour drive. The patient recalled only getting in his car that morning and heading for somewhere completely different. He couldn’t retain the names of the doctors examining him or what he’d just eaten. Unconvinced by the TGA diagnosis, Ropper decided to keep him in overnight, suspecting a stroke. The following morning, the salesman’s memory had returned, but with huge gaps: had he been suffering only an episode of temporary amnesia, it would have returned completely. After 23 hours, the patient’s speech became slurred and Ropper knew instantly he was suffering a stroke. An arterial blockage was restricting blood flow to part of his brain. Treated with anticoagulants and other drugs, the man quickly recovered with only minimal memory difficulties. Ropper’s fascinating and gripping account of his work as a neurologist at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts reveals what a mysterious and little understood organ the brain is, not least in the list of all the things that can go wrong with it. Sometimes it simply seizes up because of psychological pressure, as in the case of a 23-year-old woman who was admitted after suddenly losing the power of speech. Extensive testing showed no evidence of brain damage, seizure or stroke. But questioning of her family revealed she’d broken up with her boyfriend that day. Next day, she’d recovered. So-called hysterical symptoms that have no basis in disease often present like neurological diseases. They include paralysis, the inability to walk or talk, blindness, deafness and weakness. Spotting genuinely serious malfunctions and distinguishing them from merely harmless tics and tremors is far from easy, but there are some symptoms a neurologist doesn’t want to see. In the case of a young mother admitted with what appeared to be a severe asthma attack, Ropper’s heart sank when he spotted the muscle between her thumb and forefinger twitching. He knew he was looking at ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, a fatal illness that would see her body begin to shut down until it was kept alive solely by machines. At some point this woman would have to decide when her life became so unbearable she would ask for the machines to be switched off. Quite how someone works with that kind of trauma almost every day is unimaginable to the layman. What comes over in this remarkable book is Ropper’s humanity and his unremitting sympathy for his patients. If only all doctors were like him.","Ropper gives a fascinating account of his work as a neurologist in Boston .

"A woman who created a popular app promoting an alternative lifestyle after she was diagnosed with cancer has not donated the funds raised through sales of the app to charity as promised, it has been revealed. Belle Gibson, 26, is the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry recipe and health app, which she created after she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. She shunned traditional treatments to combat her cancer and instead opted for a wholefood and holistic approach after trialing chemotherapy and other modern medical procedures. However despite publicising that large amounts of the profits from her app were going to charity, the money was never handed over according to Fairfax Media. Scroll down for video . Belle Gibson, 26, the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry recipe and health app, publicly said $300,000 in profits would go to charity, but they never did . The 26-year-old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business' profits were being donated to charity, last year claiming that $300,000 had been donated . The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges $3.79 for the app . The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges $3.79 for the app. At least five charities who purportedly had money raised for them through a number of campaigns run by Ms Gibson never saw any funds. The app, which has been downloaded over 300,000 times, proved so popular she was flown out to Silicone Valley last year where she was told her app was to be included on the Apple Watch. The 26-year-old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business' profits were being donated to charity, last year claiming that $300,000 had been donated. However Ms Gibson told Fairfax Media this week that those donations had never been made, citing disappointing app sales and miscalculated profit margins. Neither Melbourne’s Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and One Girl - who were donated $1000 after questions were raised - received any money from Ms Gibson and the former were not even aware money was being raised in their name. Ms Gibson, pictured with her son Oliver, created the app after she was diagnosed with brain cancer . She has also released a cookbook version of the creations following the success of the app . There have been revelations that The Whole Pantry business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises . Apparently only $7000 had reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated. There were also revelations that the business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises, which could draw huge fines and potential jail time. Daily Mail Australia has contacted The Whole Pantry for comment and while they could not be reached at the time of publishing, they had earlier posted a lengthy response on social media addressing claims made in the original article. In the post to their Facebook page the company clarified they were a 'for-profit' company to the surprise of many of their followers, and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry. 'We have, like all start ups, struggled with managing all facets of a new business, biting off more than we could chew, juggling internal and external priorities with little staff. 'We have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external Business Manager and Accounts team, an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses. Ms Gibson has appeared across a number of networks (pictured on Sunrise) speaking about her approach to healing . Last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new Apple Watch . Apparently only $7000 of a projected $300,000 has reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated . 'They have been working over our finances for the last five months, and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight. We were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward,' the post read in part. 'Our books are taking longer to bring up to date than anticipated. TWP forecasted income in October 2014 which was not fulfilled, creating cash-flow issues and unforeseen delays on finalising three discussed charitable donations,' another section of the post read. Also citing 'cash flow issues' as Ms Gibson did when explaining the business model and why charities had received no donations, the lengthy response garnered harsh criticism from commenters. 'Appalling - your organisation not the media. Money for charity doesn't go into ""cash flow"" - that is beyond unethical, surely it's illegal?', one angry subscriber posted. 'You have skipped the entire point in your very long and wordy response. YOU took money from people who GAVE you the money believing it would go to said charities, you FAILED to forward on the money,' another poster wrote. '... That my friends is dishonesty / theft in the highest degree and takes advantage of peoples good natures. SHAME on you,' the comment continued.

"Timothy William Maness, 28, admitted to recording young women through their bedroom windows at the University of California, Santa Cruz . A peeping tom admitted to recording young women through their bedroom windows at a California university after a victim snapped a photograph of him and posted it all over the neighborhood. Timothy William Maness, 28, turned himself in on Thursday at the Santa Cruz Police Station. He admitted he was the man in the photographs taken by a young woman on Tuesday after he looked through her bedroom window and attempted to enter her home. Haley Woolford, 19, said Maness removed panels from her backyard fence and walked through the gap to enter the private patio area. The University of California, Santa Cruz student spotted Maness as he opened her bedroom window and reached through it to try and enter the residence, according to police. That's when Woolford pointed a flashlight at Maness and screamed before running out of the house to confront him. 'He realized he was caught and said some stuff, then he told me his excuse was his hat had fallen in my backyard,' Woolford told KSBW. Woolford then yelled at Maness to get off her property and snapped five photographs of him as 'he walked away calmly,' she said. The student made fliers with the suspect's picture and posted them throughout the neighborhood. Police also helped distribute the fliers and the photographs were published by local media outlets.

"The eerie remains of a Japanese warship that lay undiscovered on the ocean floor for more than 70 years have been captured on film. Musashi was attacked by the US Navy in 1944 and went down with more than 1,000 members of crew on board. Despite numerous witness accounts its exact location remained a mystery for decades. But the ship was discovered earlier this month after Microsoft's billionaire co-founder Paul Allen spent eight years searching for it with his personal submarine. Scroll down for video . The remains of a Japanese warship that sunk more than 70 years ago have been captured on film for the first time . Allen has now released footage showing the huge warship, which was the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleship ever constructed, on the floor of the Sibuyan Sea - nearly two miles under the surface. He is hoping the discovery  'brings closure' to those who lost relatives aboard the ship, according to his website. His yacht, the M/Y Octopus, has a remote operated probe Octo ROV that initially located the Musashi at the beginning of March. The Octopus is also outfitted with an exploration submarine. Allen and his research team used the historical records of four different countries in order to pinpoint the location of the ship. Musashi was attacked by the US Navy in 1944 and went down with more than 1,000 members of crew on board. Despite witness accounts it was never found or disturbed . The amazing footage shows coral and barnacles growing on the huge warship, which was the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleship ever constructed . The inside of the ship can only be glimpsed at throughout the video. Above, the camera looks through a hole . After discovering it Allen posted a photo of a valve from the wreckage, which he described as the 'first confirmation' that it was of Japanese origin. He wrote in a tweet: 'RIP (rest in peace) crew of Musashi, approximately 1,023 (lives) lost.' He promised that  he would soon post video of the ship's catapult and valve areas. The Sibuyan Sea - at the heart of the Philippines' central Visayas islands - now covers busy shipping lanes and lies on the path of most tropical storms that cross the country from the Pacific Ocean. But in 1944, it was the scene for a battle considered the largest naval encounter of the Second World War - a battle which would be the Musashi's last. Paul Allen, one of Microsoft's co-founders, was able to find the ship using his private yacht and sub the M/Y Octopus. Above, one of the ship's 15 tonne anchors . The Musashi was the Japanese Navy's biggest battleship during the Second World War . The battleship, which weighed 73,000 tonnes fully loaded, and was armed with nine 45 Caliber Type 94 main guns, was sunk by American warplanes on October 24, 1944. It was the height of the Battle of Leyte Gulf - in which US and Australian forces defeated the Japanese. About half the crew died when it went down. Sister ship the Yamato was damaged in the fighting, according to the US Navy, and American warships finally sank it a year later as it attempted to reach Okinawa. Mr Allen took to Twitter to reveal he had found the wreck of the Musashi, sunk in 1944 . American warplanes sank the Musashi on October 24, 1944, at the height of the Battle of Leyte Gulf . An enormous 'float plane' lies on the sand of the ocean floor covered in coral and other animals . Submerged: Allen and his team believe this to be an inverted type 89, 12.7 centimeter gun turret . The battle was considered the largest naval encounter of World War II. Pictured: The Musashi being attack . The Musashi was sunk on the second day of fighting between the two sides. The graphic shows its movements in the days before it was attacked . For Seattle-born Allen, 62, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, the discovery of the Musashi is a thrilling moment. 'Since my youth, I have been fascinated with World War II history, inspired by my father’s service in the U.S. Army,'  Allen said. 'The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel and, as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction. 'I am honoured to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honouring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her.' Allen, the 51st richest person in the world with a net worth of $17.5billion, according to Forbes Magazine, is known for his love of history - and also his generosity with the Octopus to help other exploration missions. Luxury: The remote operated probe of the Octupus (pictured) located the Musashi on Monday . Submarine: Director James Cameron has also used Allen's submarine, to dive to the depths of the ocean . Parties: Allen's yacht is not just for exploring, however, it is also luxurious enough to entertain his friends - pictured here leaving the boat for the Olympic opening ceremony . In 2012, Allen loaned the same ship that located the Musashi to the British government to locate HMS Hood bell from the bottom of the Denmark Strait. The search was eventually called off due to bad weather. The Octopus has also collaborated on Google Earth’s 'Explore the Ocean' feature, and has helped the Discovery Science Channel capture footage for a documentary to study the effects of nuclear detonation on the marine environment. Director James Cameron has also used it, for a seven-hour solo journey to the earth's deepest point back in 2012. But Allen is not confined to undersea exploration, either. Glamour: The Octopus also hosted parties in Cannes. Allen pictured here with George Lucas in 2005 . The American is also working on a project called Stratolaunch, which aims to put 'cost-effective' cargo and manned missions into space. He launched SpaceShipOne, the first privately built craft into suborbital space in 2004. Spokespersons for the Philippines' navy and coast guard told AFP they were not informed of the discovery. For four days in October 1944, the seas around the island of Leyte bore witness to what some believe is the biggest battle in naval history. The Battle of Leyte Gulf, formerly known as the Second Battle of the Philippine Sea, began on October 23, pitting the combined force of the U.S. and Australian forces against the Imperial Japanese Navy. Three days earlier, the Americans had launched an attack on Leyte; the Japanese responded with Sho-Go - an operation designed to lure U.S. forces away from the San Bernardino Strait. But the Japanese navy was attacked by U.S. submarines as it moved into position on October 23 - the first of four major encounters over the battle. The Musashi survived this first encounter, but the next day, as it passed through the Sibuyan Sea, came under bombardment from the U.S. warplanes. It was first hit at 10.30am, and then again in a second wave. However, the ship did not finally disappear under the waves until 7.30pm that evening. It had been struck by at least 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes during the battle. By October 26 - the end of the battle - the Japanese lost 26 battleships, but only sank six of the U.S.'s ships. The Japanese had also suffered huge numbers of casualties: more than 10,000 men are believed to have died. The Allied Forces, on the other hand, lost around 1,500.

"A 72-year-old woman created her own 'no parking' zone outside her home after becoming frustrated with the number of cars being left in front of her driveway. The grandmother, who does not want to be named, said she took action after being repeatedly blocked in by parents on their way to pick up and drop off their children at a nearby school. She paid to have a white line painted on the road in front of her home on Culmington Road, Birmingham, and 'no parking' written on the pavement.

The woman also placed traffic cones on either side of her driveway. Parents of pupils at Albert Bradbeer Primary School, which is less than half a mile away, have branded her decision 'ludicrous'. The grandmother-of-five called the police during a dispute last week with a couple who she claims parked in front of her home twice on the same day. She said: 'The couple deliberately came and parked and blocked me in. They have children at the school - two little children - and I went to see who was parking there and blocking me in. 'In the afternoon he came back again. I said ""You again? I'm calling the police"".' She claimed the man started racially abusing her and mimicking the way she talked. She added: 'I had to get the police involved. They told me to put something visible up so people would know there's no parking.' 'I have lived here 20 years and this is the first time I have had any trouble. 'Sometimes you overlook things. I don't mind people parking on the public bit but not parking on my driveway that I paid to make.' Parents at the school have branded the woman's decision 'extreme'. One mother, Katey Large, who walks her children to school along the road every day, said: 'There have been days when the lady who lives there sits outside in a chair underneath the window and tells people they can't park there and she's gone to extremes now by painting that on the road. 'People with drop kerbs don't want people parking on them but to go to the extreme of painting it yourself is ludicrous. 'As if Birmingham doesn't have enough litter on the streets, we're are teaching people it's OK to paint lines on the footpath. It's crazy.' Taking a stand: The grandmother-of-five also placed traffic cones on either side of her driveway . 'Ludicrous': Parents of nearby Albert Bradbeer Primary School have branded her measures 'extreme' But she added: 'You quite often see parents in the morning walking up the road and sniggering, but if it was outside their house they wouldn't be laughing about it.'

The Coast Guard says the tugboat called Sea Bear sank at about 2 p.m. Saturday . Three male crew members in immersion suits were rescued by the Coast Guard from the water a mile off a section of the island known as Fire Island Pines. Coast Guard officials say the body of the fourth crew member was recovered shortly after 5 p.m. following a search by three Coast Guard boats, a helicopter and two other tugboats. Coast Guard Command Duty Officer Mark Averill says the victim was not wearing an immersion suit. Averill says the water temperature was 37 degrees. The victim's name was not immediately released. Rescue: The Coast Guard says the tugboat called Sea Bear sank at about 2 p.m. on Saturday in icy and stormy waters about a mile off Fire Island on New York's Long Island . A search was underway for a missing tugboat crew member after three others were rescued Saturday when their boat sank in icy and stormy waters about a mile off Fire Island on New York's Long Island, authorities said. One of the crew members managed to make a cellphone call to the Coast Guard at about 2 p.m. as the tugboat Sea Bear was sinking, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Morgan Gallapis. She said the man said their boat was sinking and they needed assistance. 'They had only seconds to let us know before they sank,' Gallapis said. Three male crew members in immersion suits were rescued by the Coast Guard from the water a mile off a section of Fire Island known as the Pines, Gallapis said. But another man was missing as a search continued by three Coast Guard boats, a helicopter, two other tugboats and Suffolk County Police Marine Bureau boats, authorities said. Suffolk officers on the beach assisted in the search. One dead: Coast Guard boats (not pictured) saved three crew members and later found one dead crew member floating in the frigid waters without a protective suit . Gallapis, based in the New Haven, Connecticut Coast Guard station, said the three men who were rescued were treated for hypothermia at the Fire Island Coast Guard station but otherwise had no physical injuries. She did not know what caused the boat to sink. The accident occurred during a storm. Suffolk County police said inclement weather prevented their aviation officers from flying and police Marine Bureau boats were hampered by heavy ice in the water. The petty officer said the tugboat that sank was among three heading back to their New York City base after completing a project on Long Island. 'This tug was in the back of the line when it sank,' she said. 'The other tugs continued without seeing them. They heard the distress call and headed back to assist in the search.'","The Coast Guard says the tugboat called Sea Bear sank at about 2 p.m. on Saturday .

"It may look like a treat for those with expensive tastes but this marshmallow topped with 24 carat gold really is a sweet deal. The silky smooth strawberry Champagne marshmallow is swirled with Belgian chocolate and topped with pure edible 24-carat gold. Yet despite its striking appearance a pack of four will only set buyers back a bargain $14.99 (£10). The Golden Riviera marshmallow is made from strawberry champagne and topped with 24-carat gold . Champagne with your whiskey? The posh marshmallow is the perfect side for an Irish coffee . The posh treat is the creation of Vivéltre, an independent sweet maker, and and is hand-made using 100 per cent natural ingredients. The US-based company has named its creation the 'Golden Riviera' and this isn't the only unusual sweet treat it has on offer. The flavour combinations are certainly not what you would expect to see in your local corner shop with 14 different varieties ranging from the Nutella to the luxurious 'French Riviera', flavoured with rose Champagne and fresh strawberries. There is even a sweet treat inspired by the heated marshmallow, chocolate and cracker combination - the s'more. Viveltre's new marshmallows contain Champagne and are topped with edible gold leaf . The boutique sweet shop in Florida have created a range of inventive flavoured marshmallows . Made using vanilla marshmallow infused with chocolate chips and biscuits, it is all the flavour of the real deal minus the mess while camping. Irina Bromberry is the creative mind behind Vivéltre who started making the inventive marshmallows after she was encouraged to by her son. She said: 'We are thrilled to showcase our expertise with this new and exciting item. 'We have made it possible for lovers of gourmet confections everywhere to embark on an epic flavour journey. The unusual flavours include Nutella, the popular hazelnut spread . 'This unique item is another example of our continued commitment to letting customers enjoy handcrafted marshmallows in entirely new and unexpected ways.' Two years after he asked her to make the fluffy sweets, Irina started Vivéltre from her home in Miami, Florida and she has been overwhelmed with the demand. Irina says that coming up with the different varieties is something very personal and can take up a lot of her time. 'I come up with the different flavours in all sorts of ways. Sometimes it's based on things that have sentimental value in my life - like the caramel and Nutella flavours - so I look for ways to integrate them into marshmallows.' Irina Bromberry (pictured) says that people refer to her as the dessert alchemist . Irina began creating the marshmallows for her son two years ago and has since turned her creativity into a successful business, pictured here- Chocolate ganache flavour . Once Irina has an idea for a new type of sweet she has a meticulous method of constructing the marshmallow, making sure the flavour balance is perfect. 'But other times I think of a flavour first and use complicated algorithms to find the perfect ratio of ingredients like I did with the Ultimate S'mores. 'They call me dessert alchemist around here.' Four months ago the company raised enough cash to launch via Kickstarter and hope to use their success to expand in to different treats. Irina's marshmallows often include added texture to create an authentic flavour: pictured above, Caribbean rum coconut flavour .","The fancy marshmallow, which comes in a box of four, is by Vivéltre .

"Aggressive ground assaults aided by a flurry of Coalition airstrikes have forced ISIS from its territory in Syria and Iraq. 10 separate bombardments in a 24-hour period helped Kurdish and Christian fighters recapture a strategic village from the militants in north-eastern Syria. And a 20,000-strong force in Iraq is reportedly 'one week away' from taking back the city of Tikrit - former President Saddam Hussein's home town. Scroll down for video . Battle: Despite ISIS propaganda on its social media channels (pictured), it has lost control in both Iraq and Syria thanks to aggressive ground attacks by regional soldiers . Under attack: Islamic State has been forced out of the strategic village of Tal-Maghas in Syria's Al-Hasakah province (pictured) Propaganda: The militants have released pictures of YPG targets in Al-Hasakah being destroyed (pictured) but the reality is they have been dispelled from the province which lies near the border with Iraq . Strategic: Losing the territory is a massive blow to ISIS due to its proximity to the Iraq border, which gave them an easy supply route to the country . A joint force of Christian and Kurdish soldiers have now seized control of Tal-Maghas in Syria's Al-Hasakah province. Previously under Islamic State's tyrannical control, the village which lies just 200km east of its adopted capital of Raqqa gave them an easy supply route into neighbouring Iraq. Syria's main Kurdish force  the People's Protection Unit (YPG) called for air support in the region on Friday following weeks of intense ground fighting which killed dozens on both sides. Airstrikes since the request have struck one of Islamic State's tactical units and destroyed a 'fighting position', the US military has revealed. While in Iraq, four separate strikes took out a 'large fighting unit', two tactical units, four buildings and vehicles near the northern city of Kirkuk. Soldiers on the ground have had to pause their charge through the ISIS-held city of Tikrit as they wait for reinforcements. Despite taking areas to the north and south, Islamic State fighters still hold about half the city, have booby-trapped buildings and laid roadside bombs making it a death-trap to traverse. The pro-government force desperate to drive the extremists out of the city comprises 3,000 Iraqi troops, 20,000 militiamen and smaller factions of tribesmen.

Advantage: Taking Tikrit - former President Saddam Hussein's home town - could be a major turning point in the war against ISIS, Iraq's Defence Minister told . Even though pro-Iraqi soldiers (pictured) have taken areas to the north and south of Tikrit, Islamic State fighters still hold about half the city . One militia group's leader said ISIS still hold about 70 per cent of Tikrit's town centre but they would 'liberate' it even if street-to-street fighting was needed. Taking Tikrit could be a major turning point in the war against ISIS, Iraq's Defence Minister  told the BBC. Khaled al-Obedi said the city was a stepping stone to other ISIS-held territory which includes the country's second largest city Mosul. He added: 'The liberation of this city [Tikrit] and province will serve as a launch pad for reclaiming the north and the west of Iraq. ISIS is also on the back foot in northern Iraq where militia forces and Kurdish peshmerga  stepped up their offensive on the oil-rich city of Kirkuk on Friday. They began attacking the militants' positions near the city on Monday and have since retaken territory and a number of villages to the south-west. Kurdish commanders said they faced weak resistance but were held up by home-made bombs the extremists laid in the city before retreating to their stronghold of Hawijah.

Charge: Kurdish commanders said they faced weak resistance but their forces (pictured with a captured ISIS flag) were held up by home-made bombs the extremists laid in the city . The Kurdish YPG militia has emerged as the US-lead Coalition's main partner in combating ISIS on the ground in Syria. It has made staggering advances in recent weeks and months by seizing a major supply route from Iraq and dispelling the militants from the city of Kobani. The battle for Kobani was the first public example - and success - of Western forces closely coordinating with a regional ground force to battle ISIS. The terror group tried to reassert its dominance last week when it retaliated using tanks and heavy weapons on YPG locations close to the Turkish border. Its spokesman said the bombardment fell close to the town of Tal Tamer on Friday night through to Saturday morning. The UN estimates that 220,000 people have died as a result of Syria's horrific conflict which began five years ago. Its special envoy and actress Angelina Jolie marked the tragic anniversary by urging 'governments around the world to put aside their differences and mount a new attempt to solve the conflict politically'. She said: 'I appeal for urgent steps to demonstrate that the international community is serious about accountability in Syria, to show that we will not turn a blind eye to war crimes, and that we will not fail refugees, the displaced and the survivors.","Western coalition forces have carried out 10 airstrikes in a 24-hour period .

"This week, China presented its toughest and bravest women to the world. The country's first ever female SWAT team, known as 'Snow Eagle', was unveiled on Wednesday in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in western China, according to the People's Daily Online. The crack team of female soldiers has been trained by the Chinese border police before they were picked to form the specially-created division. Scroll down for video . Snow Eagle: China's first female SWAT team was formed this week, consisting of 34 members . 'To pull out the gun, I only need 0.3 seconds and then make the first shot in another 0.3 seconds,' said Liu Siqi, who is the team's top marksman and has served in the border police for four years. Miss Liu said the shooting skill is the result of continuous training for at least six hours every day all through the year. She has already fired over 10,000 shots during three years of training. Taking aim: The Team's top marksman can pull out a gun and shoot down the target in 0.6 seconds . Climbing higher: The members demonstrated a series of combat during the inauguration ceremony . 'When I had really good shooting scores, sometimes full scores, I would be so thrilled,' said another member, Mi Xue. 'I would take the target sheet back to my dorm and pin it on the wall. I would smile whenever I see it.' The 34 members all sport the same 'basin' haircut and wear bright-red berets, which has earned them the nickname 'Little Red Caps'. Intense training: Members have gone through continuous training on shooting for at least six hours every day . Special force: The team is set to be tasked with responding to any emergency situations in times of possible future terror attacks . During their inauguration ceremony this week, the women demonstrated a series of combat and shooting skills. They also showed a softer side and performed music to the media with a zither and ukulele after training. According to Chinese media, the team will conduct further training camps and be tasked with responding to any emergency situations including terror attacks. 'Snow Eagle' is based in China's troubled far west region, Xinjiang, where ethnic conflicts between Uyghur and Han have caused unrest in the past. Zhang Chunxian, the Communist Party Secretary of the autonomous region, confirmed this week there have been individuals from Xinjiang travelling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS, reported the People's Daily Online.

"In the latest chapter of their international 'bromance', an American journalist has finally met the man in China who was using his stolen phone and uploading pictures to their shared iCloud account. Matt Stopera found fame in the country after writing a BuzzFeed article about how his  iPhone went missing in New York and ended up in China. It fell into the hands of an unknown Chinese man who unknowingly posted countless selfies of himself in front of orange trees to Matt's photo-stream. People in the country helped Matt track down Li Hongjun from the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province and the pair began to communicate over social media. Matt eventually agreed to fly out and meet Li and yesterday - at Guangdong Jieyang Airport in southern China - the unlikely friends shared an embrace for the first time. Scroll down for video . First meeting: Matt Stopera (left) finally got to meet Li Hongjun, the man from China who happened to acquire his stolen phone and began posting selfies on their shared iCloud account . Bizarre: Matt first realised his phone was no longer in the country when his iCloud account began became populated with countless selfies of a man in front of an orange tree . Lost property: A year after losing his phone in a New York City bar, Matt finally caught a glimpse of the iPhone that somehow ended up in China and propelled him to internet fame . New friendship: After writing a BuzzFeed article about how his iPhone had ended up in China, people in the country helped him track down 30-year-old restauranteur Li . Adventure: Matt connected with Lee on social media and agreed to fly out to Guangdong Jieyang Airport in southern China to meet him in person . Connecting: Matt's tale was shared hugely on Chinese social media site Weibo, where users helped him track down Li . The odd couple have been hanging out in China since. Stopera's Weibo account already features pictures of himself eating porridge, planting a tree and even taking a selfie with Li in front of a tangerine tree. According to the People's Daily, they will also visit a museum dedicated to the local Hakka culture, meet a famous local footballer, make their own Hakka wine and watch a puppet show. Matt has said the most important thing was the amazing friendship he developed with his Chinese friend and the visit to China will be one of the most valuable travels in his lifetime. 30-year-old Li - who has affectionately earned the nickname Brother Orange -  says his nephew gave him the second-hand phone but he had no idea where it came from. Despite the global attention directed at the two men, Li says his life has not changed much since meeting Stopera. He said: 'It's no big deal if customers want to take pictures with . me. People call me Brother Orange, or take pictures of me when . I'm walking on the street. It doesn't bother me. It feels really . good.' Matt's flight landed at 9pm local time in southern China where 'Brother Orange' had been eagerly waiting. The American used the Mandarin phrase 'Ni Hao' to greet his online friend and the pair burst out laughing when Li produced the phone that has propelled both of them to internet fame. Incredible journey: Buzzfeed writer Matt Stopera (pictured) said he was stunned when he learned his stolen iPhone had ended up in China . Someone else's memories: Images of Chinese store fronts (left) and firework displays (right) also began appearing on Matt's photo stream . In his BuzzFeed article, Stopera described how - a year after his phone was pinched from a Manhattan bar - he started seeing images of Li on his iCloud account and set off to investigate how they got there. Stopera first noticed hundreds of unfamiliar photos on his phone in early February and told CBS: 'I was going through my photos and I was like, ""Oh my God, who is this person?""' The photos showed his new friend Li posing in front of orange trees, as well as images of fireworks, stores and menus. Then more images appeared of people on motorbikes, children pointing at chickens and stock photos of models, plants and cars. When he mentioned the bizarre happenings to a friend, they told Stopera that most stolen iPhone's end up in China and told him to head to an Apple store immediately to report it. New-found fame: After sharing his story online, it was picked up in China and after he joined Chinese social networking site Weibo (pictured), hediscovered hundreds of messages of help . Found! After the story was shared, people managed to track down Li Hongjun - the man in the photographs . He explained on BuzzFeed: 'They were confused. I got sent around the store until some guy made me log into my iCloud account. Sure enough, there was my old iPhone on network. 'That was it. There it was. My stolen iPhone had gone from the East Village to China. Incredible.' After sharing his story online, it was found by readers in China who shared it on their version of Twitter, named Weibo. People started calling the anonymous man 'Brother Orange' because of the selfies beside the orange tree. Stopera learned of his new-found internet fame in China when users contacted him to say the story had been viewed thousands of times across Weibo. Chinese internet users found out that the photos had been snapped in Guangdong and got to work finding out the real identity of Brother Orange. Stopera soon received a photo of his old iPhone. Life-changing: After contacting the man - known as Brother Orange because of his poses beside the orange tree in the photo feed - Stopera was invited to China and said he now hopes to visit the country . Greetings: Stopera shared this image of him saying hello to his new friend in China and is now planning his trip . 'Apparently Orange Man's nephew heard about the story and posted pictures of my phone and pictures of his uncle on Weibo,' Stopera wrote in a follow-up article. A Chinese blogger connected the two and said that Brother Orange wanted to invite Stopera to his home and 'prepare the famous local food for you'. 'Matt, you are welcome to come to my house to taste downight Meizhou Hakka vegetables,' Brother Orange wrote on Weibo in a message that has since been translated. Stopera said he is now planning a trip to China. 'I think it's actually going to happen,' he told CNN, adding that he has been overwhelmed by the kind messages he has received from so many Chinese internet users. 'It's getting me really excited to visit China,' he said.

"A cowboy builder who charged vulnerable pensioners up to 20 times more than they should have paid for work on their homes has been jailed. Ronald Connors charged on woman £140,000 for work that should only have cost just £6,000 at her home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. Cardiff Crown Court heard he lavished the money on new cars - including a £32,000 Range Rover. Ronald Connors charged on woman £140,000 for work that should only have cost just £6,000 at her home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff . His victims also included an 80-year-old woman from Whitchurch and a man aged 60 from Porthcawl with mental health issues. A judge yesterday told the father-of-five, from Newport, that he was a 'thoroughly dishonest businessman' as he jailed him for 15 months. He said it would have been longer had Connors, 39, who admitted three charges of aggressive business practice, not paid all of the money back. Prosecutor Lee Reynolds said: 'He was a rogue trader preying on the elderly and the vulnerable, charging them extortionate prices for substandard work and sometimes for work not done at all. 'One woman was charged 20 times the value and the other, 10 times. 'The third person didn't hand over any money but became upset and almost buckled under the aggressive behaviour from the defendant.' The work in Rhiwbina took place over many months with the victim in the end having difficulty in recalling all the jobs her workmen claimed to have done. Mr Reynolds told the court: 'It all started with weeds growing through the block paving in her drive and her being told there were problems underneath. Cardiff Crown Court heard he lavished the money on new cars - including a £32,000 Range Rover. Pictured is his luxury home . 'She was given a quote for £6,000 which she agreed to pay but as the work was being done, some rendering fell off and they offered to re-render for £15,000. 'Then there was a wobbly window in her garage and the garage ended up being almost rebuilt and she was told there was damp. 'They looked in her loft and gutters and weather boards were replaced. 'By that time she had paid about £70,000 to £90,000 - she says she lost track and told the police 'they just kept finding things to do'.' Mr Reynolds said: 'She paid out £52,000 in February 2012 and that month Ronald Connors bought a £32,000 Range Rover and in March a Ford Fiesta costing £10,000.' In 2011, his other elderly victim paid Connors cheques totalling £22,000 for work valued at £2,000. A judge yesterday told the father-of-five, from Newport, that he was a 'thoroughly dishonest businessman' as he jailed him for 15 months . Mr Reynolds said: 'The inside of her flat did need redecorating but when it was viewed later, the work which included damp-proofing, fitting lighting and two heaters was valued at £1,900 to £2,000.She had paid 10 times the true value.' In Porthcawl, a neighbour was looking out for the 60-year-old who had already been targeted by cold callers. Mr Reynolds said that when he was given a quote from Connors to tidy up his garden, alarm bells rang. 'He was advised to cancel the agreed quote for £7,000, his neighbour helped him write a letter which was posted by recorded delivery but a few days later the defendant turned up saying he was going to do the work. 'He was aggressive, threatening and abusive.' Henry Hughes, defending, said Connors had no previous convictions and had built up his business since the age of 18. But at the time he was under financial pressure and sub-contracted jobs to others, not realising the work they were doing was deficient. 'He thought it was being done properly' Mr Hughes told the judge. 'He had no idea it was of poor standard. He now accepts he was too aggressive in his practises.' The court heard claims that Connors had taken out a bridging loan to repay the victims and that had cost him £30,000. Recorder George Bull QC told Connors: 'You are a thoroughly dishonest businessman preying on people and you chose your victims carefully and it was going on over a period of time. It was despicable conduct and you should be thoroughly ashamed of yourself.' Connors was ordered to pay the £18,832 cost of his prosecution by Cardiff council. A Criminal Behaviour Order also bans him from canvassing the elderly door-to-door in future. Speaking after the hearing, Cardiff cabinet member Councillor De'Ath said: 'Our key priority was to recover the money that had been conned from Ronald Connors' victims and I am pleased this has been successful. 'The sentence should also send a strong message to all rogue traders that we will investigate all complaints made, with a view to recover the proceeds of their crimes and prosecute them through the courts.'","Ronald Connors preyed on old and vulnerable, Cardiff Crown Court heard .

"St Lucia's police force kept 'death lists' of suspected criminals and planted guns at police shootings to make them look legitimate, according to a report. The Caribbean island's prime minister Kenny Anthony said a team of Jamaican investigators had delivered an 'extremely damning' report on the deaths of 12 people shot by officers in 2010 and 2011. Mr Anthony said the report, which has not been made public, revealed that the shootings were 'staged by the police' but reported as murders by unknown assailants. St Lucia's (pictured) police force kept 'death lists' of suspected criminals and planted guns at police shootings to make them look legitimate, according to a report . Guns were allegedly planted by officers and members of the force's high command may have been involved in covering up the truth about the extra-judicial shootings. In a national address late last night, the Caribbean country's leader said: 'The report confirms that 'the blacklist or death lists' referenced by the media, human rights organisations, victims' families and citizens alike did exist.' Alleged tampering with evidence didn't just happen at scenes of police-related fatalities, Mr Anthony disclosed. St Lucia's Prime Minister Kenny Anthony said the report was 'extremely damning' During the investigators' probe, they found that the internet server used by some police commanders was 'deliberately tampered with,' he said. The dozen killings occurred during a police mission called 'Operation Restore Confidence' as the tourism-dependent island grappled with a worrying rise in violent crime. At the time, former prime minister Stephenson King publicly warned criminals that 'no stone will be left unturned and there will be no hiding place for anyone.' Five of the dozen men fatally shot by police were killed in a single operation in the southern town of Vieux Fort. The prime minister said the courts would now decide whether to prosecute officers involved in the shootings. The Jamaican investigation came a year after the U.S. withdrew all assistance to island police, citing concerns about allegations of unlawful killings. Cameron Laure, president of St Lucia's Police Welfare Association, said he was inundated with calls from officers about the 'killings'. 'I don't even know how to react at this point. I will have to meet with the commissioner of police as well as the other members first before making a full statement,' he said.","St Lucia's police allegedly staged shootings of 12 suspected criminals .

After a 14-hour operation to remove the tumour, she said: 'That Fruit Shoot bottle saved my life. 'Had I not opened it with my teeth, I would not be here. 'I've lost my looks and feel disfigured. People stare at me in the street but I'm alive and I can watch my kids grow up, so it's a small price to pay. 'Now I want others to be more aware of mouth cancer - because I had never even heard of it.' Scroll down for video . Lisa Epsom, 34 (left, before falling ill), was horrified to learn she was just weeks from death with a rare form of mouth cancer. She had only been diagnosed after breaking her tooth opening a bottle of Fruit Shoot and her dentist noticing a growth inside her mouth. She has since undergone surgery to cut the tumour from her face . Upon being diagnosed with cancer, Ms Epsom underwent tests to see how far the cancer had spread. She was devastated to learn she would need immediate surgery to remove a golf ball sized tumour under her nose and cheek . Her problems began in September 2013 while at home with her baby daughter Tiffany and young son Maison. Ms Lisa, 34, recalls: 'I opened a bottle of juice with my teeth and when I felt one break,  I could have kicked myself for being so silly. 'I was cross with myself because my teeth had been weak since my last pregnancy. I spat the tooth into the sink and made an appointment to see the dentist in three weeks' time.' But when the dentist examined her teeth, he seemed more concerned about a red patch on the roof of her mouth and gave her a mirror to look at it. She says: 'Right away, alarm bells began ringing in my head. I'd spotted it about a year before but a GP said it was nothing to worry about. 'Now I could see it was bigger, about the size of a 5p coin, with veins coming out of it.' The dentist arranged a test and Ms Epsom feared the worst. 'I had a bad feeling and just knew it was cancer. I had smoked when I was younger,' she said. The following week she went to hospital for a biopsy and, five days later, she was told the result. She says: 'The consultant's face said it all - it was cancerous. During the operation surgeons removed most of Ms Epsom's cheekbone and palate, then used tissue from her thigh (right) to rebuild her face. She said: 'When I woke up I felt like I'd been in the boxing ring' 'He said I could be dead within weeks. The first thing I thought about was my kids and who would look after them if I died. I was only 33 at the time.' Ms Epsom, of Abbey Wood, South East London, was told she had adenoid cystic carcinoma of the hard palate, a rare form of mouth cancer requiring urgent treatment. Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is where a tumour develops on the surface of the tongue, mouth, lips or gums. Tumours can also occur in the salivary glands, tonsils and the pharynx (the part of the throat from your mouth to your windpipe) but these are less common. Symptoms of mouth cancer include: . * red or white patches on the lining of your mouth or tongue . * ulcers . * a lump . See your GP if these symptoms do not heal within three weeks, especially if you are (or were) a heavy drinker or smoker. Source: NHS Choices . The single mother of four and son from a later relationship who live with her — says: 'After the doctor told me it was cancer, I went home and went through all the motions, giving my two younger children their tea, bathing them and reading their bedtime story. 'But inside I felt like a robot. All I could think about was not being alive to do these things with them. 'My two older kids needed me too, so I knew I had to be strong. As well as being mother to Maison, six and Tiffany, two, Ms Epsom, a single mother, has two older children, Sarah, 14, and Natasha, 12, who live with their father. She said: 'Dying just wasn't an option for me. One of the consultants even joked that chipping my tooth wasn't so unlucky after all.' CT and MRI scans were arranged to see how far the cancer had spread - and there was bad news when a biopsy through her revealed a golf ball sized tumour under her nose and cheek. Ms Epsom was horrifed to be told that had she gone another six to eight weeks without treatment, she would have died. She said: 'I had no idea I had been so close to death. It was so shocking because I'd felt so well.' Two weeks later, in December 2013, she underwent major surgery. She said: 'I had no idea I had been so close to death. It was so shocking because I'd felt so well' 'I kissed the kids goodbye with tears in my eyes. I was petrified that I might not see them again. 'I looked at their gorgeous faces and made my Mum promise to be there for them if anything happened to me.' During the operation surgeons removed most of Ms Epsom's cheekbone and palate, then used tissue from her thigh to rebuild her face. She said: 'When I woke up I felt like I'd been in the boxing ring. My whole face throbbed with pain. 'I asked for a mirror straight away and the nurses hesitated but I needed to know how I looked. 'I'd been warned I would look different but nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. I did't recognise myself. 'I gasped and broke down in tears - I thought I looked like a monster. 'My face was so swollen and disfigured. I just didn't look like me any more.' As a result, it was three weeks before she allowed her two younger children to visit her in hospital. She said:  'My mum tried to prepare them by showing them photographs of how I looked, but it was still a huge shock for them. 'Tiffany was terrified and hid from me. That broke my heart — she was scared of her own mummy. 'Maison asked if my face would ever go back to normal and I had to explain that even though I looked different on the outside, I would still be the same mummy on the inside. 'He just shrugged and said ""I know"" and jumped on to my lap for a cuddle.' Ms Epsom (pictured before surgery) says she now avoids looking in the mirror. 'My confidence has gone but it's a small price to pay. I'm learning to live again and I'm alive, and that's more important than anything' Eventually Tiffany got used to her mother's new appearance. Ms Epsom said: 'I can't pretend it didn't bother me, but if I had to choose between my looks and watching my kids grow up, there really is no contest.' She left hospital a month after her operation, though she still had to have six weeks of radiotherapy, from January to March 2014. And because the surgery had made it difficult to eat, she lost 4st, shrinking from a size 12 to a tiny size 4 and ending up being tube-fed. But, finally, in July last year, scans showed she was cancer-free. Now, eight months on, she has started going out in public again, but says people's stares are hard to cope with. She also avoids looking in the mirror. Lisa says: 'My confidence has gone but it's a small price to pay. I'm learning to live again and I'm alive, and that's more important than anything. 'I've learned so much about what's important and that I have amazing family and friends who have supported me every step of the way. 'I also know it's vital to visit the dentist regularly. Mine saved my life.'","Mother-of-four Lisa Epsom broke a tooth opening her son's juice bottle .

"Rape charges have been filed in Las Vegas against former NFL safety Darren Sharper, who already faces sexual assault charges in Los Angeles, New Orleans and the Phoenix area. Sharper's Las Vegas attorney, David Chesnoff, appeared Friday before a Las Vegas judge on two sexual assault charges stemming from allegations that he forced sex on two women in January 2014 while they were incapable of resisting. Details of the Las Vegas allegations weren't immediately available. Scroll down for video . Former NFL safety Darren Sharper appears in Los Angeles Superior Court (file photo) Sharper carrying the NFC championship trophy in 2010 as a member of the New Orleans Saints . Chesnoff declined to comment on the charges but said Justice of the Peace Janiece Marshall set another court hearing for April 3. Each count carries a possible sentence of 10 years to life in Nevada state prison. Sharper, 39, is sought on a warrant in Las Vegas, but he has been jailed since Feb. 27 in Los Angeles, where he was due for a preliminary hearing Friday after pleading not guilty to drugging and raping two women in 2013. He faces rape allegations in New Orleans, where he's accused of sexually assaulting three women in 2013. He has also been indicted in Arizona on charges he drugged three women and sexually assaulted two of them in November 2013 in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. Sharper is also under investigation in Florida for sexual assault. Exact details of the Las Vegas case have not yet been made public, but they are likely similar to the other three cases in which after a night out he would allegedly take a woman or women home who later reported they believed he served them a drink mixed with an illicit substance. He would then engage in sexual intercourse with the woman or women. Sharper retired in 2010 after a 14-year All-Pro career as a defensive safety with the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints.","Darren Sharper has been accused of rape by two women in Las Vegas .

"A heroic World War Two pilot who survived almost 70 missions against the Germans and was still in the cockpit at the age of 90, is in hospital fighting for his life after being knocked down by a hit and run driver. Doug Gregory, 92, is believed to have been making his normal trip to the shops when he was knocked down by a silver Nissan outside a petrol station in Blackfield in Hampshire. The former RAF pilot, who still holds all his licences to fly, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after he survived 67 missions into Nazi-controlled Europe during the Second World War. He also survived a brain haemorrhage in 1947 and only retired from his job as a stunt pilot at the age of 90. War veteran Doug Gregory survived almost 70 missions across Germany and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. He is now in hospital in a serious condition after being a victim of a hit and run in Hampshire . Mr Gregory was taken to Southampton General Hospital after suffering a head injury and is believed to be in a serious condition. Police said they were treating the incident as a hit and run because the car failed to stop after the accident. However they said a female motorist had come forward to officers shortly afterwards. Mr Gregory had just bought a paper at a newsagents and was starting to walk home when he was hit by a silver-coloured Nissan on Monday morning. Mr Gregory was struck by a car which failed to stop outside the petrol station in Blackfield in Hampshire . Part of the road was closed while police investigated the collision and officers spent almost five hours at the scene. They also visited a nearby Tesco Express store and asked to view CCTV footage in case the accident had been caught on camera. A broken wing mirror found in the road was taken away for examination. At the age of 90 the pensioner said he would give up work as a stunt pilot but would still continue flying . Mr Gregory was a member of the RAF during World War Two and survived a number of missions over Nazi territory. He is pictured in 1945 in his uniform (left) and flying gear (right), shortly before he was sent to India . Sergeant Darren Ord, senior investigating officer from Hampshire Police, said: 'An elderly gentleman was crossing from the newsagents to the petrol station when he was in collision with a car coming from his right. 'He suffered a serious head injury and was taken to Southampton General Hospital. His wife and son are with him.' A woman working at the newsagents said: 'I saw a man lying on the ground, surrounded by people on their mobiles.' The stunt pilot is pictured in his RAF uniform beside the plane he built himself at a cost of around £5,000 . Mr Gregory said two years ago he had no plans to stop flying but is now in a serious condition in hospital . As well as his achievements during World War Two, Mr Gregory's love of flying continued after the war. He defied the odds to recover from a brain haemorrhage and get back to the skies again - constructing his own aircraft, which he flew for nine years in the Great War Display team. He became Britain's oldest stunt pilot  until he decided to give up his role at the age of 90 in 2013. At the time the pensioner said: 'Flying has been my favourite thing all my life, especially aerobatics. I don't do any other kind of sport. Flying is quite enough to keep me going.' He joined the Royal Air Force as early as he could, at the age of 18, and has been flying for seven decades. Mr Gregory also holds all the relevant licences, meaning he can still fly and said he plans to never stop. Police closed the road in Hampshire (left) for five hours and Mr Gregory (right was taken to hospital .","Doug Gregory was in the RAF in World War Two and survived almost 70 missions against the Germans, being awarded Distinguished Flying Cross .

"Researchers  found a link between milk consumption and higher levels of anti-oxidant which might minimise damage to brain cells . Drinking three glasses of milk a day could help stave off diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, say researchers. A new US study shows a link between milk consumption and higher levels of a naturally-occurring antioxidant called glutathione in the brain in older, healthy adults. The powerful antioxidant may minimise damage to brain cells from free radicals, destructive groups of atoms made as a by-product of metabolism that can damage cells. Antioxidants help to neutralise this type of oxidative stress in the body. The study was carried out at the University of Kansas Medical Center by associate professor of neurology In-Young Choi and Debra Sullivan, professor and chair of dietetics and nutrition. Dr Sullivan said ‘We have long thought of milk as being very important for your bones and very important for your muscles. ‘This study suggests that it could be important for your brain as well.’ Altogether 60 adults enrolled in the study were asked about their diets in the days leading up to brain scans to monitor levels of glutathione in the brain. The researchers found those who said they had drunk milk recently had more glutathione in their brains. Those who drank around three glasses a day had highest levels, says a report in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (must credit). Oxidative stress is known to be associated with a number of different diseases and conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and many other conditions, say the researchers. Dr Choi said ‘Antioxidants are a built-in defence system for our body to fight against this damage, and the levels of antioxidants in our brain can be regulated by various factors such as diseases and lifestyle choices.’ Dr Sullivan said ‘You can basically think of this damage like the build up of rust on your car. ‘If left alone for a long time, the build up increases and it can cause damaging effects. ‘If we can find a way to fight this by instituting lifestyle changes including diet and exercise, it could have major implications for brain health.’ For the study, researchers used high-tech brain scanning equipment housed at KU Medical Center’s Hoglund Brain Imaging Center. Study found people who drank three glasses of milk a day had the highest level of anti-oxident glutathione . Dr Choi said ‘Our equipment enables us to understand complex processes occurring that are related to health and disease. ‘The advanced magnetic resonance technology allowed us to be in a unique position to get the best pictures of what was going on in the brain.’ An editorial in the journal said the study presented ‘a provocative new benefit of the consumption of milk in older individuals’. There have been mixed findings in studies on the health benefits of milk. A study from Oxford University suggested milk drinking might mitigate neurological damage leading to diseases such as Alzheimer’s due to its vitamin B12 content. A randomised, controlled trial that seeks to determine the precise effect of milk consumption on the brain is still needed and is a logical next step, the researchers said.","New study shows a link between milk and antioxidant called glutathione .

"These are the horrific injuries suffered by a greyhound which was dumped by the roadside covered in dog food after being used as bait for illegal dogfights. Bentley was left to die in a quiet country lane with puncture wounds over his body, including deep cuts to his neck and wounds to his legs. The five-year-old greyhound was found on the border between West Boldon and Sunderland on Monday night with biscuits attached to his collar and his body smothered in dog food. This led to suspicions that he was used as bait in a dog fight and another animals may have attacked him. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Bentley was left to die in a quiet country lane with puncture wounds over his body, including deep cuts to his neck and wounds to his legs . He was taken to the King's Road Veterinary Practice in Sunderland by freelance dog warden Lisa Scott and is now recovering after emergency surgery. 'Everyone is absolutely disgusted by what has happened to this dog. It looks like Bentley was used for dog fighting,' said Miss Scott. 'It appears someone has set another dog onto him. This other dog was probably kept starving and has been attracted by the smell of the food smothered over Bentley and the biscuits around his neck. He has then been attacked badly and suffered terrible injuries.' Bentley is now recovering at the home of volunteer Beverley Reed, from South Shields. He was found with biscuits attached to his collar and his body smothered in dog food, leading to suspicions that he was used as bait in a dog fight . The greyhound is slowly being nursed back to health after surgery and is being cared for by Beverley Reed (pictured) from South Shields . She said: 'Bentley is such a gentle and lovely dog. When I first brought him home, he was unsettled at first but he had a good sleep the next night. 'He is also eating well now and is a lot brighter. The vets have been fantastic in helping him to recover from such nasty wounds. 'There is still some way to go but he's getting there.' Northumbria Police investigated the incident and said there is no evidence of a criminal offence. Bentley's ordeal prompted dog lovers from across the region and other parts of the country to donate more than £1,500 to help towards his care. Susan Oliver, 42, of Wardley, said: 'Bentley's injuries were horrific and made me sick to the stomach. I can't believe someone would do this to the poor animal. 'Those responsible should be found and punished severely.' Bentley's ordeal prompted dog lovers from across the region and other parts of the country to donate more than £1,500 . Mark Brown, manager of MyPetStop, said: 'Everyone has been horrified by what happened. We can't believe Bentley has suffered such injuries. So we decided to give him a big treat. 'Our main business is boarding and looking after pets, but we also have a grooming salon and hydrotherapy pool. 'Once Bentley is feeling better we will invite him here, give him a bath, groom him, give him a swim in the pool and offer him treats from our shop. 'We want to show that there are still people out there who care for animals.' Leanne Plumtree, RSPCA spokesman for the North East, said: 'We haven't had any calls to our cruelty line about Bentley the greyhound, but it sounds like he was in a terrible state when he was found. 'If anyone has any specific information about Bentley they can contact us on the RSPCA's inspector appeal line 0300 123 8018 and leave a message for RSPCA chief inspector Michelle Charlton.' A police spokesman said: 'The dog has been treated and it is believed no criminal offences have been committed.'

"As the clock to 2016 ticks down, Democrats are fretful that Hillary Clinton and her team aren't prepared for the rigors of a bruising presidential contest based on their botched response to what is now being called 'email-gate.' Clinton is widely expected to launch her presidential bid in the next several weeks. Other than Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has adamantly said she's not running, Clinton is seen as the only Democrat with enough credibility and name id to weather a national campaign. While many Democrats continue to stand with Clinton, others are questioning the wisdom of the party's  approach as it seeks to win the Oval Office for a third consecutive time. Scroll down for video . Democrats are fretful that Hillary Clinton and her team aren't prepared for the rigors of a bruising presidential contest based on their botched response to what is now being called 'email-gate' 'My view of the electorate is, we react badly to inevitability, because we experience it as entitlement, and that is risky, it seems to me, here in America,' former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told the New York Times. 'I want Democrats to win.' Democrats have never been particularly comfortable with handing Clinton the party's nomination. Buying into that notion of 'inevitability' is how the former New York senator lost her 2008 bid to Barack Obama, and it could lead to defeat for the party at the polls next November. But if not Clinton, then who? 'There is no one else — she’s the whole plan,' Sarah Kovner,a high-dollar Democratic fundraiser based out of New York told the Times. 'She is by far the most experienced and qualified person we could possibly nominate. Not even on the horizon but on the far horizon.' Clinton has been hit hard throughout the last two weeks from politicians and pundits all across the political spectrum for her use of a private email system while serving as secretary of state. Republicans, and Democrats who worry about Clinton's viability as a candidate, contend that the calculated move to avoid using an email address directly registered to the federal government will intensify the public perception that Hillary and her husband, Bill, are secretive and therefore potentially untrustworthy. Clinton has said that she sent the State Department copies of all her work-related emails, but there's no way to verify her statements, as she retains the rights to both her inbox and the computer server she ran them through. And the White House said on Thursday that the federal government neither reviewed Clinton's personal email nor was it 'particularly interested' in doing so to make sure she hadn't tossed out anything of importance. If not Clinton, then who?: While many Democrats continue to stand with the former secretary of state, others are questioning the wisdom of the party's approach as it seeks to win the Oval Office for a third consecutive time . Still a candidate-in-waiting, Clinton had to tackle the controversy over her emails this week with limited resources. She held a press conference to address the matter on Tuesday at the United Nations' headquarters in New York after a speech, allowing her to push much of the advance work onto the venue's staff and off her small band of aides. The former secretary of state has already built a network of campaign staff, but they, like her, must continue to linger in the wings until Clinton's candidacy becomes official. That will reportedly happen sometime in April, as early as the first day of the month, according to a report in the Guardian this week. The gap in staffing helped cripple Clinton's ability to strike back in real time to verbal assaults on her character throughout the last two weeks as fury over her email practices reached its peak. House Select Benghazi Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, like-minded House Republicans and not-yet-announced GOP presidential contenders, who are using their leadership PACs as cover until they declare their own candidacies, pounced on the weakness and flooded the media with statements attacking Clinton. 'Given State's delay in disclosing the fact Secretary Clinton exclusively used personal email to conduct State business, there is no way to accept State's or Secretary Clinton's certification she has turned over all documents that rightfully belong to the American people,' he said in a statement on Tuesday after hew news conference. Then-senator Hillary Clinton is pictured here at a rally at Cal State University in East Los Angeles during her 2008 campaign for president. She is expected her announce her 2016 candidacy in the next few weeks . House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who took the gavel from California Rep. Darrell Issa in January, Wednesday that in light of the recent developments, Oversight would open a new investigation into Clinton, having already concluded its review of the 2012 terrorist strike on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, before the current session of Congress. Chaffetz believes Clinton may have violated the Federal Records Act with her conduct - an offense that would fall under his committee's jurisdiction. 'I’d rather not have to subpoena her, but if she’s fully cooperative there wouldn’t be a need,' he told the Wall Street Journal. Campaign staff or no campaign staff, Democratic heavy-weights have said that Clinton should have publicly reacted to the email crisis much quicker. 'Had this story been responded to in two or three days instead of in eight days, it would not be as big,' President Obama's first White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, told the Washington Post. 'They are the ones who put air in this balloon in a way that was not necessary at all. . . . It’s clear they lack an apparatus. She’s a candidate without a campaign.'","Dems are fretful that Clinton and her team aren't prepared for the rigors of a bruising contest based on their botched response to email-gate .

"Crufts has become embroiled in a second controversy, after two competitors were accused of animal cruelty over the way in which  dogs were handled. Animal lovers have accused the show's organisers of 'turning a blind eye' after footage emerged showing U.S competitor Rebecca Cross, who won the Best in Show accolade, picking up her Scottish terrier Knopa by its neck and tail. Following a competition which has already seen more than its fair share of scandal, 160,000 people have now signed online petitions, calling for Ms Cross to be stripped of her prestigious title. Animal lovers have accused the Crufts organisers of 'turning a blind eye' after footage emerged showing U.S competitor Rebecca Cross picking up her Scottish terrier Knopa by its neck and tail . 160,000 people have now signed online petitions, calling for Ms Cross to be stripped of her prestigious title . The Kennel Club explained that it had warned Ms Cross not to pick up the dog in that manner but that it was 'customary' to do so in the U.S . It comes as the RSPCA announced it would be investigating separate allegations, which involved a dog being beaten by an overseas competitors in the  car park at the Birmingham NEC. The Kennel Club, the show's organisers, also launched a probe into the allegations, following the circulation of photos online which purported to show the incident. The two incidents are the latest controversies to hit the world famous competition. Yesterday, it emerged that six dogs who took part in the competition had been reportedly poisoned, including Irish setter Jagger, who died at his Belgium home on Monday. After the footage emerged of Ms Cross handling her dog, Crufts issued an almost immediate apology. The Kennel Club explained that it had warned Ms Cross not to pick up the dog in that manner but that it was 'customary' to do so in the U.S. Ms Cross also issued an apology, saying she ‘didn’t do it on purpose, it was just habit.’ She added: 'It's just one of those things. It happened and I tried to really think about it and not do it, but it's habit.' One of the petitions claims Ms Cross (right), whose prize-giving was interrupted by an anti-Crufts campaigner (left), is guilty of ‘behaving discreditably and prejudicially to the interests of the canine world’ Ms Cross (pictured in the arena) apologised, saying she ‘didn’t do it on purpose, it was just habit' But the anger continued to grow, with the petitions gaining nearly 160,000 in around 24 hours. This morning, 105,000 had signed a petition on 38degrees, while 55,000 had supported one on change.org. The first petition claims  Ms Cross is guilty of ‘behaving discreditably and prejudicially to the interests of the canine world’. But, in a second statement, the Kennel Club said it would not be 'fair' to strip the dog of its Best in Show title, solely due to the  behaviour of its owner. A Kennel Club spokesman added that, although there was 'clear guidance' that dogs should not be handled in this way, it would be reviewing its procedures in light of the incident. The RSPCA confirmed it was also investigating allegations that an overseas competitor had mistreated his dog outside the showground, pictured . They said: 'We completely understand the concerns about how Knopa, the Best in Show dog, was handled on the judging table. 'A decision will be made by committee about what action may be taken within the current rules and guidance. In this specific case an investigation is underway and a decision will be made by committee about the actions that have been taken by the exhibitor at Crufts and the next steps. 'The judge’s primary focus is on the dogs themselves and we do not believe it would be fair to strip the dog of its Best in Show title because the dog was awarded this prize based on its own merits in the show ring.' It added: 'Prior to this incident the guidance related to handling has been followed by those showing their dogs but in light of this situation we will be reviewing our rules and guidance and how they may need to be amended going forward. Jagger, who is co-owned by Belgian Aleksandra Lauwers and Leicester-based breeder Dee Milligan-Bott, died in his owner's arms on Friday, after returning home to Belgium . The owner of this chamption Myter, Eye to Eye, also believes the dog was deliberately poisoned after she was found vomiting and shaking in pain shortly before it was due to be judged on Friday . Meanwhile, the RSPCA confirmed it was investigating allegations that an overseas competitor had mistreated his dog outside the showground. In a statement it said: 'The RSPCA is urging anyone with information about the alleged dog beating to contact us directly, in confidence on 0300 123 8018. The Scottish Terrier was initially bred as a working dog by farmers to eradicate vermin and hunt small animals underground. It has a very long and strong tail which owners traditionally used to pull it out of holes. It is not said to hurt to pick them up in this way. 'We received a complaint about this the day after the incident (9 March 2015) and would urge anyone who witnessed the alleged incident to contact us urgently.' The Kennel Club added: 'The Kennel Club has been made aware of an alleged incident outside the NEC during Crufts, which has led to accusations of cruelty in the way a man was treating his dog. 'We understand that a photograph purporting to show the man in question mistreating the dog, is circulating online and the Kennel Club is looking into this as a matter of priority, as any type of animal cruelty will not be tolerated. 'We will be liaising with the NEC to gather any evidence of what happened and until that time we are not in a position to comment further.'","Rebecca Cross was filmed picking up five-year-old Scottish terrier Knopa .

"Robin Williams' daughter Zelda has denied claims made by her step-mom Susan Schneider that she and her siblings have taken items from home where he committed suicide in August. On Monday, attorneys for Schneider, who married the late comedian in 2011, and his three children from previous marriages - Zachary, Zelda and Cody - headed to court in a battle over the late comedian's estate. Schneider argued that she is entitled to keep the tuxedo he wore to their wedding, the wedding gifts he gave her and the photos from the couple's wedding. Scroll down for videos . Susan Schneider has agreed to settle a legal challenge against  her late husband Robin Williams' children that would have barred them from taking things out of his house in Tiburon, California. Susan is seen with Williams and his daughter Zelda (right) in 2011 . Schneider had filed a motion seeking to bar her stepchildren from taking those items and anything else from the late actor's Tiburon, California, home. She also claimed some of Williams' personal items were taken from his home without her permission. The children responded by arguing that their step-mother - the actor's third wife - was 'adding insult to a terrible injury' by trying to change the trust and rob them of their farther's possessions. Zelda also posted a seperate statement on Monday in which she denied going to her father's home in Tiburon to take items. 'My brothers and I have not at any point since dad's death been invited to or visited his and Susan's house in Tiburon, nor have we removed anything from it,' she said in a statement posted on Instagram. Following Monday's meeting between lawyers for the two sides, both parties have agreed to settle the matter out of court. Zelda Williams (pictured with brother Zack) posted a statement on Monday in which she denied going to her father's home in Tiburon to take items . As per the actor's will, his three grown children - age 31, 25 and 23 - will get most of his jewelry, memorabilia and other belongings, including his awards. However, Susan Williams asked a judge to exclude the belongings in their 'marital home' in Tiburon from the list of belongings the children are allowed to take. Both the children and the trustees of the estate took exception to the request. 'The Williams children are heartbroken that petitioner, Mr Williams' wife of less than three years, has acted against his wishes by challenging the plans he so carefully made for his estate,' the lawyer for Williams' children wrote. On Monday, following a scheduled court appearance in San Francisco, the two sides agreed to work out a solution out of court and return in June to report back to a judge. Most of Williams' $50million estate goes to his children. Susan, who married Williams in 2011, had a prenup agreement that gives her a slice of his fortune and the home outside San Francisco, where he killed himself on August 11. Susan Williams' attorney said she was only seeking guidance from the court about the meaning of certain terms in the trust. Williams' children; Zachary (second from left), Cody (third from left) and Zelda (right) pictured with Williams' ex-wife Marsha (second from right); said their step-mother's legal action is 'adding insult to terrible injury' Schneider's lawyer said she was only hoping for a judge to clarify Williams' $50million will . Williams died at his home in Tiburon north of San Francisco in August. The coroner ruled his death a suicide that resulted from asphyxia caused by hanging. Susan Williams has said the actor and comedian was struggling with depression, anxiety and a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Williams' trust granted his children his memorabilia and awards in the entertainment industry among other particular personal items, according to court documents. Susan Williams says that because he wanted her to continue to live at the Tiburon home, it makes sense that he intended only for his children to have the specific personal items he delineated that were kept at another home he owned in Napa. The two sides also disagree over items put in storage, watches Williams owned and his memorabilia.","Susan Schneider has filed an injunction seeking to bar his children from taking anything from his house in Tiburon, California .

"In 2001, then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Bernard Kerik was like a brother to him, at the police commissioner's NYPD retirement ceremony. But just five years later, as he was accused of ethics violations and conspiracy charges, Kerik learned that Giuliani's friendship was anything but as strong as blood. In his new memoir From Jailer to Jailed, due out Tuesday and excerpted in the New York Daily News, Kerik details his fall from grace and how Giuliani cut ties not only with him, but with his wife and daughters - one of whom is Giuliani's goddaughter. From friends to strangers: Disgraced for New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik says ex-NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani abandoned him and his family once he was hit with legal woes in the mid-2000s. The two pictured above on Saturday Night Live following 9/11 (Kerik on the left, Giuliani on the right) Abandoning his own goddaughter: Kerik says Giuliani completely cut ties not only with him but with his family, including his daughter Celine who is Giuliani's goddaughter. Kerik pictured above with his family in New York City in December 2006. In the photo, Kerik holds daughter Angelina, with his arm around daughter Celine, next to wife Hala . When the first accusations against Kerik were lodged in 2006, his old pal Giuliani was gearing up for the 2008 presidential election and the two appeared to still be close. But in June of that year, Kerik went from being a 9/11 hero to a corrupt city official on the cover of tabloids when the Bronx District Attorney's Office hit him with two ethics code violations - one for not disclosing a personal loan on his conflict-of-interest report and the other for accepting renovations on his home from a New Jersey company vying for city work. It was in November that Kerik first started to feel the cold shoulder from the Giuliani camp. Writer: In his memoir From Jailer to Jailed (cover, left), due out Tuesday, Kerik details how he sent Giuliani a Bronco Buster statue (stock image right) for Christmas in 2006 and had the gift sent back with no explanation . Kerik says he was sitting in his office one day when his then 6-year-old daughter Celine came in and asked to send her godfather a present - one befitting a possible future president of the United States. 'Given that my daughter Celine was only six years old at the time, she had no idea of the difference between a Democrat and a Republican. All she knew was that people were saying that her godfather was going to be the next president of the United States. Disgraced: Kerik was sent to prison in 2010 after pleading guilty to felony tax and false statement charges. Pictured above at a press conference in November 2007 . 'She was talking about it twenty-four hours a day, as if that were the only thing going on in her little world. She had no idea of what this really meant, of course, but she was convinced that Rudy was going to be president,' Kerik writes. Remembering a previous visit to the White House to meet President George W Bush, Celine asked to give her godfather a Bronco Buster statue - just like the one she saw in Oval Office during her visit. The two picked out a statuette and sent it to Giuliani with a handmade card from Celine ahead of Kerik's out-of-town trip to London. By the time he returned though, Kerik was having a hard time getting in contact with Giuliani. Kerik had promised his daughter that they could see her godfather during their annual holiday-time stay in New York City and when Giuliani didn't return his calls, Kerik 'didn't have the hard to tell Celine'. Kerik fully got the message when soon after he found a box containing the statue returned to his front step. 'I just didn’t understand it. What bothered me more than anything was that whoever sent it back took the girls’ card and didn’t have the courtesy to send a note back with the box,' Kerik recalls. What's more - Giuliani failed to send his daughters birthday or Christmas cards like he did every year - and they haven't received one since. The next year, Kerik was hit with even more allegations - this time for conspiracy, tax fraud and making false statements during his Department of Homeland Security appointment. In 2009, he pleaded guilty to eight felony tax and false statement charges and was sent to the minimum-security prison camp in Cumberland, Maryland on May 17, 2010 - where he spent the next nearly three years. Kerik says what bothers him most about his sudden estrangement from Giuliani, is the fact that the former NYC mayor abandoned his wife and daughter when they needed his support the most. ' During my time in Cumberland, Rudy never once called Hala [Kerik's wife] to speak with the girls. He never tried calling any mutual friend of ours to check up on them, ask how they were doing. There were no Christmas or birthday cards. 'My safe guess is that as a former U.S. attorney Rudy had a sense of what the separation of incarceration does to families — yet not once did he call to help in any way,' Kerik writes. Before he was jailed, Kerik  held positions as the corrections commissioner of New York City, New York City police commissioner and interim Iraqi minister of the interior. Giuliani ran as a Republican in the 2008 presidential primary but lost the party nomination to Arizona Senator John McCain.","Bernard Kerik was imprisoned for three years in 2010 when he pleaded guilty to felony tax and false statement charges .

"Fallen AFL star Ben Cousins has been taken into police custody for the third time in two weeks. He is currently in the emergency department of Armadale Hospital awaiting a mental health assessment and remains in a stable condition. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. Scroll down for video . Former West Coast Eagles captain Ben Cousins was assessed in the mental health ward at Perth's Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital after being caught on an SAS base in Western Australia on March 15 . The priest tried to confront Cousins before he took off again and stopped a few metres ahead to take photos of the temple. 'Again, I tried to talk to him and he started his car,' Mr Singh said. 'I called the police and then I followed him again and he stopped his car in the middle of the road and then some cars almost hit him.' Mr Singh then became alarmed by the behaviour and left it to the police. 'He was not looking stable.' Before they arrived however, Cousins had moved onto another person's house and opened the door before realising Mr and Mrs. Singh were still watching him from their yard. He allegedly jumped fences and scaled a two-story home and paced along the roof. The police arrived ten minutes later and talked Cousins off the room before arresting him in Shreeve Road at 11am. CCTV has shown Cousins attempting to flee from police. 'I was pretty panicked - I locked the doors and we stayed inside in one of the bedrooms until I could get confirmation from police that it (the arrest) was done,' Witness Jenny Wilson told Network Ten. Ben Cousins, in 2007, after he was charged with drug possession and refusing a drug test . Cousins, who returned to the AFL with Richmond after the league banned him for one year, saw the latter stages of his career overshadowed by controversy . On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. The premiership star and former West Coast Eagles captain was apprehended at the Campbell Barracks near Perth at 11pm, according to Nine News. He was later assessed in the mental health ward at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital where he was reportedly being held under 'mental health watch'. The 36-year-old was moved out of the hospital on the afternoon of March 16 but doctors remain concerned about his mental health, Seven News reports. Cousins was arrested the week prior for allegedly driving erratically and not stopping when requested by police. He is scheduled to face the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8. Cousins retired from the sport in 2010. He appeared in court in 2012 after being charged with drug possession . Cousins, 36, was arrested last week after allegedly being caught driving recklessly and failing to give a breath test. He is scheduled to face the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8 . The Brownlow Medalist's off-field antics have created headlines for almost a decade, due to well-publicised troubles with drugs and criminal connections. In 2005, Cousins and teammate Michael Gardiner became embroiled in police investigation into a nightclub shooting. The following year he was charged after abandoning his car and running away from police to avoid a booze bus. He entered rehab for 'substance abuse' in 2007, being later being suspended by the AFL for bringing the game into disrepute. Cousins returned to the game with Richmond in 2009, before he retired at the end of the 2010 season. In 2012, the then-retired star was charged with possession of methylamphetamine with intent to sell or supply by police located near a drug rehabilitation centre he was attending.

"The sobbing that cooks have endured while chopping onions in the kitchen could soon be a thing of the past. Scientists say they have managed produce a tear-free version of the vegetable thanks to cutting-edge technology. Japanese scientists disabled the production of the powerful substance that an onion releases as the knife slices into it, cutting down on the pungent fumes that bring tears to the eyes. No more tears: Scientists say they have managed to disable the production of a powerful substance an onion releases as the knife slices into it, cutting down on the pungent fumes that bring tears to the eyes . In a press release, scientists said that the typical burning sensation of a raw onion was reduced too. The enzyme responsible is known as lachrymatory factor (LF) synthase. When an onion bulb is cut it causes a chemical reaction that generates propanthial S-oxide. This makes up the LF enzyme and is responsible for causing tears. This reaction also creates thiosulphinate, which creates the onion’s distinctive flavour. When an onion bulb is cut it causes a chemical reaction that generates propanthial S-oxide (pictured left).

"All party leaders dream of getting their hands on the keys to Number 10. But David Cameron has emerged as the most popular party leader families would like to seeing moving in next door to them. The Prime Minister topped a poll of which senior politicians people would most like to have as a neighbour, although Ukip's Nigel Farage was the most popular among the under-25s. David Cameron has emerged as the most popular party leader families would like to seeing moving in next door to them . With fewer than 60 days until the general election on May 7, attention is focussing on the party leaders as they set out their pitch to voters. While policies will always be important, the personality of the leader could be key to securing the support of swing voters. A new YouGov opinion poll sought to find out which party leader UK homeowners would most like to have as a neighbour. Among those who expressed a view - excluding don't knows - Mr Cameron came out on top with 31 per cent, well ahead of his Labour rival Ed Miliband on 23 per cent and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg on 20 per cent.

And Green party leader Natalie Bennett, who has been criticised for faltering media performances, was favoured by only 10 per cent of homeowners. Mr Farage, who once sparked controversy for saying people would be concerned if a group of Romanians moved in next door, was the top choice of the 18-24-year-olds, backed by 25 per cent. But the Ukip leader slumped to fourth place among the 25-34 and 35-44 age group, but was third for 45-54 and 55+ voters.

"One of Australia’s leading country musicians has claimed that Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s recent ‘lifestyle choices’ comment put ‘race relations back 100 years’. Speaking on ABCs Q&A programme Troy Cassar-Daley, the son of a Maltese-Australian father and an Aboriginal mother, blasted Mr Abbott for backing a plan in Western Australia to close more than 100 remote communities and move more than 1,000 people. 'What we can't do is endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices,’ Mr Abbott controversially said. It was a remark that angered the Indigenous musician. Scroll down for video . Australian country singer Troy Cassar-Daley could not hide his shock and anger on ABC’s Q&A programme . The Indigenous musician was reacting to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comment about living on remote communities being a lifestyle choice . ‘Lifestyle choices, wow, what a comment – it took race relations back a hundred years,' Cassar-Daley said. 'It really did. To be spiritually connected to the land you live on is not a lifestyle choice. ‘You are part of that country and you want to live your life the way your ancestors did. Maybe take your kids into the bush and show them how to hunt. But if you’re in a welfare cycle it’s very hard to break from it. ‘But if these people are being displaced again from land it would just be destroying them. It destroys culture. What other option do they have? Casser-Daly believed that being 'spiritually connected to the land you live on is not a lifestyle choice' Assistant Minister for Health, Fiona Nash, listens on as Cassar-Daley reacts to Mr Abbott's comments on ABC's Q&A programme . ‘Do they go into town and get into trouble and become a burden there to the police force and everyone else? Or are they allowed to stay on the country where their spirit is happiest?’ Assistant Minister for Health, Fiona Nash, was also appearing on the programme. She was asked if what the Prime Minister had said was a hard phrase to defend, to which she replied: 'It's probably not a phrase I would have used.' Cassar-Daley believed that Western Australia was such a mineral rich place, that the mining companies could help these communities and give them a reason to stay on the land. ‘The optimum goal should be to keep these people in these communities,’ he said. Tony Abbot's ‘lifestyle choices’ comment came in for huge criticism from Indigenous leaders . The multi-award-winning country musician from to Grafton in north-eastern New South Wales, was worried that the Prime Minster may got these ideas from a focus group. ‘These people haven’t been out into the regions to see how these people live, they haven’t seen how happy the kids are,’ he said. ‘They haven’t seen the power of the elders being able to sit down in their own environment and impart stuff to these kids. ‘That can’t happen on city streets. To me it’s a criminal act to take people off land again and push them aside like they’re not wanted.’ The singer also said he'd also like to know what the government in Western Australia wanted to do with that land anyway. The multi-award-winning country musician believed that every effort should be made to keep the people in these Western Australia communities . The Prime Minister’s contentious ‘life choices’ comment was aimed at people living in remote places that are ‘not self-sufficient or self-sustaining’. Many were angered by his remarks that governments could not 'endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'. Mr Abbott tried to clarify this by saying he was focused on the practical impacts of living in remote settlements such as access to schooling, jobs and services. Cassar-Daley (right) explains to the Q&A panel why he thinks Mr Abbott's remarks were out of line . Mr Abbott said he was focused on the practical impacts of living in remote settlements such as access to schooling, jobs and services .

"More than 1,500 airline passengers may have been exposed to rubella, after an air stewardess unknowingly contracted the disease. The unnamed China Airlines flight attendant began developing symptoms for the disease - also known as German measles - on March 14. Four days later, doctors confirmed she had German measles and was placed in quarantine, the People's Daily Online reported. Incubation: The air stewardess on the China Airlines flight (not pictured) contracted the disease in February . But the woman, from northern Taiwan, may have infected a number of people during the incubation period - including passengers on the flights. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control (CDC) is now hoping to follow up with 1,558 people who travelled on China Airline's flights between February 21 and February 28, according to Asia One. It is thought 686 Taiwan nationals and 872 international passengers came into contact with the stewardess. But so far, it has only managed to contact 72 of the individuals - and has encouraged anyone who may have travelled on the flights to come forward. Six of the flights were international - four between Taiwan to Japan, and two between Taiwan and Singapore. The CDC is contacting the appropriate authorities in each country to track down the last of the international passengers.

German measles is one of a number of similar viral infections that children commonly pick up at school. These infections, called enteroviruses or adenoviruses, cause fine pink rashes and mild fevers. Rubella - sometimes known as German measles - can cause serious damage to a developing baby if caught by a pregnant woman so it is important to keep an infected child away from pregnant women. The condition has an incubation period of two to three weeks, but actually only lasts for three to five days. An infected child will be infectious from a week before symptoms of the illness appear until four days after the patient appears to have recovered.

"The teenage girl at the centre of the Bali body in the suitcase murder has been smuggled out of hospital by police and lawyers clutching her tightly wrapped baby in her arms. Heather Mack, 19, accused of murdering her wealthy socialite mother, Sheila Von Weise-Mack, 62, held on to her baby tightly this afternoon as she left hospital under police guard to be returned with the child to Bali's notorious Kerobokan prison. She has already made it clear that she intends to keep her daughter, named as Stella Schaefer after her co-accused Tommy Schaefer, 21, in prison with her for the first two years of the child's life - a mother-baby relationship that jail authorities allow. Miss Mack gave birth to the 6lb 1oz baby last Wednesday in a Caesarian operation - several weeks ahead of time. Scroll down for video .

Miss Mack was taken from hospital in a wheelchair (left) while she struggled to keep her baby covered (right) It was believed that because of the baby's premature delivery the child would have to remain in an incubator at the Sanglah Hospital while her mother was returned to prison, where she is being held as her trial and that of her boyfriend proceeds through the Denpasar district court. But in a flurry of movement at the hospital this afternoon a prosecutor's car arrived and Miss Mack was ushered into it after being transported out of the hospital in a wheelchair. Despite the emotional scenes, administrative affairs had to be dealt with - one of Miss Mack's legal team had to settle the hospital bill, paying $6000 with his credit card, which he will claim back from the many thousands of dollars that have been released to him from Miss Mack's Trust account. She clutched her tightly wrapped daughter throughout under cover of a large shawl as photographers and camera crews followed her closely, continuing to film her once she was inside the car. When Miss Mack reached the prison the shawl around the baby's head slipped away as she struggled to release her seat belt, giving a handful of people outside  the first glimpse of the youngster, who had become famous before her face had even been seen. Ironically, it was the mother Miss Mack has been accused of murdering in the upmarket St Regis Hotel, in Bali's Nusa Dua beachside suburb, who set up the Trust account to be available for her legal expenses.

Mrs von Wiese Mack's badly-beaten body was found in a blood-spattered suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the St. Regis Hotel on August 12. She had been on vacation with her daughter and Schaefer at the time. The couple have told police that Mrs von Wiese Mack objected after finding out about her daughter’s pregnancy and during a fierce argument, Schaefer struck Heather’s mother with the metal handle of a fruit bowl while her daughter hid in the bathroom. The grandmother of Miss Mack’s newly-born daughter has been having ‘intense discussions’ with the teenager about the future of the baby girl who is destined to spend the first two years of her life behind bars in Bali . Ms Kia Walker has flown from her home near Chicago to stay in the hospital where Miss Mack has given birth to the daughter. Ms Walker, Mr Schaefer’s mother, is understood to be concerned the baby girl will remain with Miss Mack in prison when a court verdict is delivered in the next few weeks. Since this shot was taken Miss Mack has been smuggled out of hospital and back to Bali's notorious Kerobokan prison along with her baby daughter, with whom she is being allowed to stay for now . A Schaefer family member is pictured at the hospital on Wednesday, smoking and talking to Mack. Tommy Schaefer's mother Kia Walker has allegedly been pressuring the teen to let her take care of the newborn . In a desperate attempt to come to an arrangement for her granddaughter’s immediate future, it is understood Ms Walker has been talking in detail to Miss Mack about her intended plans to keep the baby with her in the prison for the full two years that babies are allowed to remain there with their mothers. ‘The discussions have been pretty intense,’ said a hospital source. ‘There has been a lot of pressure on Heather to think again about keeping a baby in a prison cell for the first years of her life.’ It has not been revealed whether Ms Walker has offered to look after her grandchild - or whether the same offer has been made from Miss Mack’s relatives. 'There is no doubt she is concerned about the welfare of the baby,' said the source. Mr Schaefer’s mother has been seen through a hospital window talking to her at length, and has also been observed standing on a hospital balcony, smoking cigarettes.

"Three quarters of us drink tea every day but many of us are too impatient to let it steep properly. Steeping is the act of letting the flavour of the tea infuse into the water, and scientists claim it should be left for a minimum of two minutes. But a study has found that 80 per cent of tea drinkers can't wait that long -  and 40 per cent of us drink it immediately meaning we don't get the best flavour from our cuppa. Researchers asked 1,000 people about their tea-drinking habits and found that only 16% of people let the water brew, or steep, for the recommended time of between two and five minutes. Nearly half (47 per cent) leave their tea to cool for five minutes after they have removed the tea bag before drinking it . The study was commissioned ahead of British Science Week -  a 10-day programme of science, technology, engineering and maths events across the UK that started on 13 March. Researchers asked 1,000 people about their tea-drinking habits and discovered that English Breakfast made without sugar and drunk from a ceramic mug is the most popular method. Only 16 per cent of people let the water brew for the recommended time of between two and five minutes. But this time varies depending on the type of tea. And nearly half (47 per cent) leave their tea to cool for five minutes after they have removed the tea bag before drinking it. Herbal teas (stock image) should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F) Steeping tea is the process of soaking a solid - in this case tea leaves - to extract flavours and soften it. For standard black tea, freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95°C (203°F). Water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea, with a recommended temperature of 74°C to 85°C (160°F to 203°F). Oolong tea is best steeped in 85°C (185°F) water. Herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F). Regardless of the temperature, the standard explained that tea should be steeped for six minutes. Elsewhere, the age-old debate of water or milk first was found to vary depending on how the tea is being drunk. If the tea is being made in a cup or mug the milk should be added last, and more than two thirds (69 per cent) of tea drinkers use this technique. But when made using a tea pot, the milk should be added to the mug before the tea-infused hot water is poured into it. The study additionally found that the over 65s are more likely to add milk first. Mark Miodownik, Professor of Materials and Society at University College London said: 'This may be controversial, but the British do not understand how to make tea! Or at least they’re not doing it properly. 'And it’s because they don’t understand the variables. Expediency is causing us to throw chemistry out of the window; we’re not allowing our tea to brew for long enough, to release the flavours properly.' The decline in use of the teapot is another factor,' Professor Miodownik added: 'What you make tea in, and drink it out of, is also important. It alters the taste.' These findings follow reports last month that said to make the perfect cup of tea - according to the British Standards Institute guidelines - the milk should be put in the cup first, the pot must be made of porcelain, there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served. And these guidelines explained that black tea should be steeped for at six minutes. The BSI is the business standards company best known for the BSI Kitemark. This mark is an internationally recognised symbol of excellence and is seen on everything from manholes to aircraft. Elsewhere the experts said that if tea is being made in a cup or mug the milk should be added last, and more than two thirds (69 per cent) of tea drinkers use this technique. But when made using a tea pot, the milk should be added to the mug before the tea-infused hot water is poured into it . To a tea: Experts say many of us Brits are not leaving our tea to steep for long enough . The institution's best practice when it comes to making a cup of tea is called 'Preparation of a liquor of tea for use in sensory tests.' According to this standard, two different sized pots made of porcelain or glazed earthenware are recommended, alongside two corresponding small and large 'bowls' - or cups. The first, large pot should measure be between 74mm and 78mm wide and stand between 83mm and 87mm tall. It should also have a lid. The ideal smaller pot should be between 61mm and 65 mm tall and ideally 64mm wide. The larger cup is should be between 57mm and 63mm tall by 109mm - plus or minus 3mm -compared to 49mm and 55mm wide. Either way, the large pot should not exceed 318ml, and the small pot must have a maximum capacity of 159ml. These findings follow reports last month that said to make the perfect cup of tea - according to the British Standards Institute guidelines - the milk should be put in the cup first, the pot must be made of porcelain, there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served . On average, a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves so at least two should be used for a small pot and at least four should be used for a larger pot. When being made with milk, the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to at least 2.5ml milk in the bowl . To make tea without milk, 2g of tea should be used for every 100ml of water. Pour freshly boiled water into the pot up to 4mm and 6mm below the brim. The tea should then be left to infuse for six minutes. Lyons Tea recently released this tongue-in-cheek colour chart to help friends and family make tea to a person's preferred strength . On average, a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves, so at least two bags should be used for a small pot of tea and at least four should be used for a larger pot. When made with milk, the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to milk in the cup. At least 2.5ml milk is recommended for use with a smaller pot, and 5ml milk is advised for the larger pot. This helps the milk mix more evenly though the 'liquor' when the tea is added to the bowl. To make sure the water doesn't scald the milk, the BSI explained that its temperature should not exceed 85°C (185°F), but should be above 60°C (140°F) for optimum flavour and sensation. The standard does explain that different sized pots can be used, but these measurements are recommended. If milk is added first and the teabag is dropped into the milk before it has infused with the water, then the steeping process is affected. It doesn't affect the brewing process, but it will cool down the liquid which will directly impact the effectiveness of the steeping. Dr. Stanley Segall at Drexel University, Philadelphia said: 'When you steep tea leaves in hot water, water-soluble materials are extracted to produce the tea. 'Changes in brewing temperature affect extraction of colour- and flavour-responsible chemicals exponentially.' He explained that reaction rates generally double for every rise in temperature of 18°F, and decrease by the same factor when the temperature is lowered.","The study was commissioned ahead of British Science Week .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State have now turned their savagery on the dead, tearing down graves and smashing tombs at a cemetery in Syria. Not content with the rape and massacre of the estimated four million brutally oppressed people living under the terror group's control in  Syria and Iraq, ISIS jihadis are now victimising the dead.

Location: The chilling images are believed to have been taken in the Syrian province of Raqqa and shows a hilltop cemetery overlooking what appears to be farmland . Two camouflage-wearing militants are seen pulling over gravestones at the cemetery in Raqqa province . The chilling images emerged as thousands of Syrians fled Idlib province over the weekend, fearing government reprisals a day after opposition fighters and a powerful local Al Qaeda affiliate captured the northwestern town, activists said. Idlib, with a population of around 165,000 people, is the second provincial capital to fall to the opposition after Raqqa, which is now a stronghold of the Islamic State group. Its capture by several factions led by the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front underscores the growing power of extremist groups in Syria, who now control about half the country. The Nusra Front and Syrian rebels have controlled the countryside and towns across Idlib province since 2012, but Assad's forces had maintained their grip on Idlib city, near the border with Turkey, throughout the conflict. Now that the city is in the hands of rebels, who stormed government buildings and tore down posters of Assad, many residents fear that troops will retaliate harshly.

Muayad Zurayk, an activist based in Idlib province, said via Skype that 'residents are fleeing the city to nearby villages and towns.' He added that the situation was relatively quiet in the city yesterday despite some government shelling. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, confirmed some people were fleeing the city. Also in Idlib, activists said members of a Syrian security agency killed more than a dozen detainees before withdrawing from a detention center in the city. The activists said the killings were conducted shortly before rebels took the so-called security compound in Idlib on Saturday. The Idlib Media Center showed a video of what it said were at least 12 bloodied bodies inside a room at the Military Intelligence Directorate. The Observatory said 15 men were found shot dead inside the compound. The group said 53 other detainees, including two women, were freed by the rebels in the compound. More than 220,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, which began with an Arab Spring uprising in March 2011 and turned into an insurgency following a brutal military crackdown.","Militants parked motorcycles at gates before destroying hilltop cemetery .

"Civil rights activist Diane Nash has said that she didn't participate in a march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama on Saturday because of former President George W. Bush. Nash revealed her reason to opt out of the Saturday event in an interview with NewsOne Now. 'I refused to march because George W. Bush marched and was in the photograph,' Nash said. Scroll down for video . Skipped: Civil rights activist Diane Nash has said that she didn't participate in a march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama on Saturday because of former President George W. Bush (2011 photo) Appearance: Former President George W. Bush sat between his wife Laura Bush and First Lady Michelle Obama in Selma, Alabama, on Saturday . Nash later said in the interview she made the choice 'when it was apparent that he was going to be part of it. I think the Selma movement was about non-violence and peace and democracy.' She continued, claiming 'And George Bush stands for just the opposite, for violence, and war, and stolen elections.' NewsOne Now reported that Nash 'is widely considered the architect of many of King’s campaigns, and one of the only women in his inner circle.' Tessa Thompson played Nash in the 2014 film Selma, the website pointed out. Nash was a leader in the Freedom Riders movement, having been one of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founders and the Nashville Student Movement Ride coordinator,PBS reported. Nash recently told WLS that she and James Bevel, to whom she was married at the time, 'tried for several months to persuade Martin King and Andy Young, who was the executive director of [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] at the time, to go into Alabama on a voting project and we were not successful. 'It always seemed to be some type of thing that needed to be done right away. So Jim and I decided that he would take the car and some of his staff and start organizing. It was a big sacrifice for me because I was expecting a baby and had a toddler at the time.' She told the television station that the pair couple drafted the first plan for the Selma voting rights movement after a 1963 church bombing which killed four children. Nash told WLS 'I never considered Dr. King my leader. I always considered myself at his side and I considered him at my side. I was going to do what the spirit told me to do. So If I had a leader, that was my leader.' History: The events of 'Bloody Sunday' prompted a follow-up march led by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. that spurred the 1965 Voting Rights Act. King is seen here at the March 26, 1965 march in Selma . On Saturday, President Barack Obama declared the work of the Civil Rights Movement advanced but unfinished  during a visit to the Alabama bridge that spawned a landmark voting law. Obama, the first black U.S. president, said discrimination by law enforcement officers in Ferguson, Missouri, showed a lot of work needed to be done on race in America, but he warned it was wrong to suggest that progress had not been made. 'Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet finished, but we're getting closer,' Obama said, standing near the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where police and state troopers beat and fired tear gas at peaceful marchers who were advocating against racial discrimination at the voting booth. The event became known as 'Bloody Sunday' and prompted a follow-up march led by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. that spurred the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 'The Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing, but they gave courage to millions. They held no elected office, but they led a nation,' Obama said. 'What they did here will reverberate through the ages ... because they proved that nonviolent change is possible.' After his remarks, Obama and his wife Michelle, daughters Malia and Sasha, and mother-in-law Marian Robinson joined some of the original marchers along with former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, to walk across the bridge. Commemoration: Obama is seen hugging Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who was at the 'Bloody Sunday' march 50 years ago . The marchers sang songs including 'We Shall Overcome' as a crowd of some 40,000 people looked on. The anniversary comes at a time of renewed focus on racial disparities in the United States, including discrimination from police against black citizens nationwide. Obama condemned the city of Ferguson on Friday for 'oppressive and abusive' actions against black residents that were revealed in a U.S. Justice Department report accusing police and court officials of racial bias. On Saturday, he criticized efforts to limit voting rights that have sparked a clash between Republicans and Democrats across the country. 'Right now, in 2015, fifty years after Selma, there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote. As we speak, more of such laws are being proposed,' he said. 'Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence ... stands weakened.' Rev. Raphael Warnock, the 45-year-old pastor of the Atlanta church led by King at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, lamented that the measure was now in limbo. 'I'm glad to see a parade of politicians here, but two years later we still are waiting on reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act,' he said. 'You can't celebrate lessons of history from one period while standing on the wrong side of history today.' Others reflected on how much had changed since the violence of a bygone era. 'Fifty years ago if we were standing here we would be surprised if a police officer did not beat us,' said Dick Gregory, 83, who was on the bridge 50 years before.","Diane Nash has said that she didn't participate in a march across the Edmund Pettus bridge  on Saturday because of the former president .

"Dull train journeys have become a thing of the past in one Chinese city where  carriages have been decorated with intricate 3D designs for a very unusual reason. The stunning art in the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line in the city of Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province was actually advertising sanitary towels, according to The People's Daily Online. Photographs of the beautifully decorated carriages were shared widely on social media and the PR stunt, which coincided with International Women's Day, won praise from commuters. PR stunt: The stunning art in the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line in the city of Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province was part of an advertising campaign . Rainforest: One of the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line has been made to look like a rainforest with green designs on the floor, walls and ceiling . Psychedelic: Each of the carriages contained different images, ranging from traditional blossom trees to more psychedelic designs . Tao Chin, a spokesman for the underground line, said: 'We wanted to make the experience of travelling on carriages more enjoyable, and so the 3D effect covering various subjects was introduced with a good reaction from our customers. 'We make sure that the decorations cover not just the walls but also the windows, doors and roofs to maximise the effect.' There were five different themes used, including an amusement park, European castles and a fairy tale world. Passenger Sying Tsao told local media: 'I didn't see them advertising things and then suddenly when I turned up for work one morning I saw that the carriages had this great new 3D designs. 'They were very realistic, I saw one child nervous about stepping on a 3D floor. 'I have seen three or four different designs, I like the cherry blossom best because I haven't seen any so far this year, and it was really nice and calming, not just for me but for everyone on the tube I think.' Mr Li, manager at the care products company's head office, said using 3D adverts in the carriages not only promoted their products, it also encouraged the 'heads-down generation' to look up and enjoy the scenes around them. But while the colourful designs were appreciated by commuters, most had not realised the carriages were actually advertising sanitary towels.

"The internet has reacted in typical fashion to today's double blow that Zayn Malik is quitting One Direction and Jeremy Clarkson has been sacked - by suggesting the 54-year-old job seeker becomes the boy band's fifth member. Dozens of hilarious memes have been spread across social media showing the group posing together with Zayn replaced by the petrol head in an array of publicity and performance shots. Mostly consisting of Clarkson's head photoshopped onto Zayn's body, other images include Clarkson with his arms draped across his fellow band members' shoulders, or performing on stage alongside Harry Styles. Scroll down for video . A promotional poster for the band's On the Road Again tour was edited to include Clarkson being part of the line-up . The internet memes showed the boy band with its fifth member being recently-sacked Clarkson (centre). Here he is pictured wearing Zayn's shirt and braces . Another image showed the group wearing suits, with Clarkson donning a dark brown jacket . Clarkson, wearing a white long-sleeve shirt, poses alongside the band members in another hilarious photoshopped image . It follows this afternoon's announcement that Zayn, 22, would be quitting the group a week after he was pictured holding hands with a blonde Essex girl during the group's tour in Thailand. After five years with the band, the singer has bowed out, leaving Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson to continue as a four-piece. Just hours previously, Lord Hall, the Director General of the BBC, had announced Clarkson was sacked after the corporation's internal investigation found he had punched producer Oisin Tymon with such force Tymon had to go to A&E. The corporation's internal investigation concluded the star, 54, launched an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on Tymon because he was offered a plate of cold cuts instead of steak and chips. However, with Clarkson now looking for work and One Direction appearing to have a vacancy, sharp witted Twitter users quickly created a series of memes in a light hearted attempt to solve both problems. In announcing his decision to quit the group, Zayn said: 'My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. 'But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart.' The Department for Work and Pensions also tweeted about the news, offering Zayn some job seeking tips .

'I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world.' The Best Song Ever hitmakers will record their fifth album in Zayn's absence and will continue with the remaining dates on the band's forthcoming world tour. Meanwhile, the BBC found Clarkson spent 20 minutes verbally abusing producer Tymon in a luxury North Yorkshire hotel before launching a 30-second physical assault that led to another member of staff dragging him away. Mr Tymon said today after the sacking: 'He is a unique talent and I am well aware that many will be sorry his involvement in the show should end in this way'.

"They share the bond of a grandfather and granddaughter, but in the 18 years they have known each other, have never actually met. Until now. When she was 11-years-old, New York girl Nicole - who asked that her surname not be published - was given a school assignment to write to a pen pal, with an ad placed in different newspapers calling for people in other states interested in corresponding with the students. Norman Fikes, a writer from Bastrop, Texas, came across the ad and responded, subsequently beginning an exchange that would - and continues to - last a lifetime. That was 1996, and Norman - then 61 - and his wife, Bobbie, started to eagerly await letters from their young pen pal, Nicole, KVUE TV reported. Finally: Nicole and Norman have been writing to each other for the last 18 years, but have only just met each other in the flesh in Batrop, Texas . First meal: The two decided to meet for dinner and share their first meal together. Both were in tears . Both would send photos in their letters and celebrate birthdays and holidays with each other from afar. One year Norman playfully told Nicole he wanted either a Cadillac or Rolls Royce for his birthday. Nicole then sent a toy car of each make. The couple witnessed Nicole grow up through her letters, and Norman has kept all of them, even a poem Nicole wrote for him when she was young. However, much to his dismay, Norman, now almost 80, was forced to stop writing back to Nicole recently, as his Parkinson's Disease worsens and his hands are too shaky to put pen to paper. Unwilling to be cut off from her surrogate grandparents, Nicole traveled the 1,600 miles from New York to Bastrop, to finally meet them. A reunion of sorts: Norman Fikes and his wife Bobbie (together) finally got to meet Nicole (center left) and her family, after Nicole traveled from New York to meet with the couple . Norman sat anxiously in the restaurant where they planned to meet. 'I'm so excited. I'm nervous,' he told KVUE TV. Then Nicole, now a 29-year-old woman, finally arrived. She ran in with tears streaming down her face and her arms outstretched. 'We made it,' she said. 'How are you? Can you believe it?' Norman was crying just as much. 'I've never had anybody go to this much trouble to see me before,' he said. Celebration: Together with their families, Nicole and Norman (back left) have now finally met . Once the tears stopped, the two shared their first proper conversation and meal. They have now agreed to speak over text, with Bobbie helping her husband type and read the messages. Nicole acknowledged that, with technology the way it is now, other children won't get to have an experience like she did. 'The connections you make are way more important than anything you're going to learn in a book,' she said.","Nicole, 11, of New York, started writing to Norman, 61, of Texas, in 1996 .

"Drinking coffee may reduce the risk of cancer in heavy drinkers, research has found. A new study shows the hot drink can protect against liver cancer, which is often associated with alcohol abuse. For each cup consumed a day, there is about a 14 per cent decreased risk of liver cancer, found the study by the World Cancer Research Fund. But although the research found strong evidence that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of the disease, the report did not recommend the amount that should be drunk. The report comes after research published by the same team in 2013 found drinking coffee reduces the risk of womb cancer. Scroll down for video . Benefits: For each cup of  coffee consumed a day, there is about a 14 per cent decreased risk of liver cancer . And a study by the American Cancer Society found drinking four cups of coffee a day almost halves the risk of deadly mouth cancer. The popular drink has already been linked with reducing the chances of getting bowel cancer, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. However, drinking too much may increase heart rate and blood pressure and pregnant women are advised to limit their intake because of concerns that excess coffee may increase their chances of having small babies. The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) report warned that while coffee might protect against the effects of alcohol abuse, just three alcoholic drinks a day can be enough to cause liver cancer. The increase in risk per 10g of alcohol consumed – around one alcoholic drink – is about 4 per cent, says the World Cancer Research Fund. As a result three or more drinks pose a significant cancer risk. The review also found a strong association between obesity and liver cancer and that physical activity and fish consumption may also decrease the risk of liver cancer, although more research is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached. The WCRF's continuous update project reviewed global research into the relationship between diet, weight and physical activity, and liver cancer. In all, 34 studies were analysed covering 8.2million people of whom more than 24,500 had liver cancer. Previous research by the project has shown alcohol to be strongly linked with a range of cancers, including liver. Risk: Previous research has shown alcohol to be strongly linked with a range of cancers, including liver . The WCRF recommends women should try to limit their alcohol intake to one drink per day and men to two. Amanda McLean, director of WCRF UK, said: 'Around three or more drinks per day can be enough to cause liver cancer. Until now we were uncertain about the amount of alcohol likely to lead to liver cancer. But the research reviewed in this report is strong enough to be more specific.' Globally, liver cancer was one of the five most common sites of cancer diagnosed in men in 2012, according to World Health Organisation figures. The disease caused 745 000 deaths worldwide in the same year, it warned. To prevent weight gain, if you want to have a coffee, it’s wise to choose unsweetened versions with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, according to the World Cancer Research Fund. But when it comes to liver cancer risk, although there’s strong evidence that coffee may be beneficial, it's not clear why, says the charity. We all drink coffee in different ways and it could be how much you drink, how regularly, the type of coffee or what you add to it that has an effect. The report estimates that nearly a quarter of cases could be prevented if people kept a healthy weight and did not drink. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said: 'The findings from this study further demonstrate the urgent need for mandatory health warnings on alcohol products.' Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser for alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said the research revealed a worrying link with obesity, but some people had a 'blind spot' when it comes to the calories in alcohol. She added: 'To help reduce the risk of getting alcohol-related liver cancer, it is best to drink within the lower-risk guidelines of 2-3 units a day for women, that's a 175ml glass of 13 per cent wine, or 3-4 units a day for men, a pint and a half of 4 per cent beer.' Sir David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor of the public understanding of risk, University of Cambridge, said that while the increase in risk of liver cancer per 10g of alcohol consumed was about 4 per cent, that level of alcohol was 'extremely unlikely to cause cancer', especially as the report says the increase in risk only starts at levels above 5.5 units a day. He added: 'Liver cancer is rare: about one in 100 men and one in 200 women get it. So if you already drink a lot, and then drink even more, your risk goes up a small amount.'","Study, by the World Cancer Research Fund, found strong evidence that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of the disease .

The Washington Post reports that the men had been at a bar to celebrate the retirement of departing Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan. Connolly and Ogilvie have declined to comment, though it is believed that the incident was likely caught on Secret Service video, which feeds to the agency's command center. According to witnesses, the two men had their flashing lights on and were showing their badges as they tried to get through a section of the grounds that had been closed as a suspicious package was being investigated at around 10:30pm. It was then that they struck the barricade, after also driving through some security tape. It is illegal to use the flashing lights on a government vehicle without a security reason, or to drive a vehicle after consuming any alcohol. In 2013 a civilian who crashed into a barricade at the White House was chased by police and shot and killed. 'The Secret Service is aware of the allegations of misconduct involving two of our employees at the White House complex,' said Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary, a spokesman for the Secret Service. 'If misconduct is identified, appropriate action will be taken based on established rules and regulations.' Also commenting on the situation were House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and member Elijah Cummings of Maryland who said in a statement; 'The fact that this event involved senior-level agents is not only embarrassing but exhibits a clear lack of judgment in a potentially dangerous situation. 'The Committee as a whole remains committed to restoring the integrity of this elite agency and improving accountability at all staff levels.' The crash investigation is the latest embarrassment for the agency tasked with protecting the president. In the last six months, several top agency officials, including former Director Julian Pierson, have been forced out amid revelations of multiple, serious presidential security breaches. In September, a Texas man armed with a knife was able to climb a White House fence and run deep into the executive mansion before being apprehended. An internal investigation and an outside panel report both described serious problems within the agency. A four-member panel of former senior government officials concluded in a report released last year that the agency was too insular and starving for leadership. The panel recommended an agency outsider to replace Pierson, but Obama earlier this year tapped Clancy, a retired agent who led the agency on an interim basis after Pierson's ouster. January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the crone hobbyist lost control of the device. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for while being filmed by cameras for their reality show.","An investigation has been launched to determine if two Secret Service agents drove their car into a White House barricade last week .

"Toilet paper has become the barometer for how confident people are in their economy and whether they can afford a minor splurge - like a luxury brand . Sales of luxury toilet paper are being heralded as the newest way to measure the economy - and judging by our current spending habits things in Britain are looking up. Spending on products for short-term use is crucial in revealing how confident a country's population are in their own economic prospects - and luxury loo paper sales  suggest the recession is well and truly over. A report by market intelligence firm Euromonitor International found the UK stands out among the European countries as only 5.3 per cent of £1.9billion toilet paper sales were made up from the cheaper brands. The analysts found although top brands like Cushelle, Andrex and Velvet are a little pricier, they are a luxury most people can afford. They said in the report: 'While the idea of luxury toilet paper may be slightly odd, its performance suggests otherwise.' They added that toilet paper has become the barometer for how confident people are in their economy and whether they can afford a minor splurge. Waitrose recently announced that premium toilet tissue sales are up 12 per cent year on year. Victoria Fletcher, the store's paperware buyer, told The Times: 'It's the little luxuries which are sometimes the best.' Abid Ditta from Star Tissue UK told newspaper: 'We have definitely seen an increase in demand for better quality products since we have invested in a new state-of-the-art toilet tissue production line.' Meanwhile sales of luxury toilet paper are also being enjoyed in the US with the market hitting $1.4 billion last year - and sales are still growing. With the recovery of the UK economy consumers have gone back to buying branded products . A report by Euromonitor International found the UK stands out among the European countries because only 5.3 per cent of total toilet paper sales were made up from the cheaper brands - like this Morrisons Value pack . The Washington Post reported luxury toilet paper sales have grown more than 70 percent since 2000. The analysts from Euromonitor wrote in their report: 'Higher growth is expected out of the luxury segment as the improved economy allows consumers to satisfy their desire for comfort.' Toilet paper is not the only unusual way to measure the economy. The Hemline Index was established by economist George Taylor at Wharton School of Business in 1926, when he noticed a correlation between good times and short skirts. When the economy was good women would wear higher hemlines to show off the more expensive hosiery compared to rough times where the skirts would become longer so women could hide their cheap stockings. Autumn/Winter 2015 collections from the biggest fashion houses saw high hemlines at Topshop, Julien MacDonald and Giles - while flares were also a big hit, implying there is money to spend on additional material. Hairstyles are another economic indicator. MailOnline reported earlier this month that the the growing popularity of shorter haircuts is a sign of economic recovery, since they require more frequent trips to the salon and are costlier to maintain. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, who is the face of L'Oreal, debuted her new layered bob just last week on the Graham Norton Show, while Kim Kardashian also recently braved a shorter cut. Toilet paper sales in the UK have grown by 2 per cent over the last year - the industry is worth £1.9 billion .

"From Twilight to Star Wars, fans of sci fi and fantasy franchises are known for their levels of dedication. They immerse themselves in the world of their favourite characters by dressing up as them, collecting the merchandise and even going to conventions to meet others who share their passion. But some take it even further than this, spending thousands of pounds and travelling the world in pursuit of the actors who brought their favourite character to life. It's something actor Tom Felton, 27, is familiar with having grown up on screen playing Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter series. Scroll down for video . Tina Davies has been a fan of Tom Felton and his Harry Potter co-stars for years and has collected their autographs by meeting them at events and premieres over the last 15 years . He was only 12 when he found fame thanks to the JK Rowling books being turned into films and when he started going on the publicity trail to promote the films, he noticed a certain fan was always there. Her name was Tina Davies and she would be waiting for him outside hotels, film premieres and events he attended desperate for a glimpse of the star and hopefully a picture or autograph. Tom said: 'Tina follows me to every event I attend. I'm sure she has the best intentions but it is a little unnerving. 'I first spotted her when I had a press tour in Paris and I noticed this women following me around, she seemed to have an obsession with me and always seems to know where I am. 'Why does a middle-aged woman have an obsession with back then, a teenage boy?' He added that he knows Tina means no harm and he finds her 'sweet' but he said: 'She has followed my career for seven years, ultimately I am baffled as to why she wants to see me and what she wants from me.' Once, Tina, 56, from Swindon, waited for four hours outside an event he was attending to give him a card telling him she was sorry his dog had died after the star revealed he'd lost a pet on social media. So intrigued as to why Tina follows him around the world at her own time and expense, Tom decided to investigate the psyche behind the superfan for a BBC documentary that airs on BBC Three tonight. He even visited Tina's house and, surrounded by signed pictures of himself and posters of his friends and Harry Potter co-stars, he learnt why he has come to mean so much to Tina. She explained: 'I went out and brought the first one after that, that was it, it spiralled. 'When I saw Chamber Of Secrets and saw this blonde slimy git after Harry, I thought ummm I'm going to start watching him. I think to start off with it was the character Draco I liked and then gradually I got to like you, you're lovely. Tina said the actors feel like family to her because she has watched them grow up on screen . Tina said she has enjoyed watching Tom grow up from being a boy as Draco Malfoy in the first Harry Potter films, left, to the man he is today, right . Tom with (from left to right) Michael Gambon, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe, Bonnie Wright, Jessie Cave and Jim Broadbent promoting Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince  in 2009 . 'I wanted the autographs to feel closer to you, it was like a little connection. I have never had a family and following Harry Potter and watching you all grow up it was like seeing my own family grow up and I got attached. You seemed like a big family and I wanted to be part of that.' Tom got a taste of just what this is like when he joined fans outside a Broadway theatre to catch a glimpse of Rupert Grint aka Ron Weasley. He experienced the excitement, anticipation and the buzz the fans get from meeting their favourite star. He spoke to his Harry Potter friends and co-stars and author JK Rowling to see how they have dealt with this kind of attention. Harry Potter himself, actor Daniel Radcliffe, said: 'It's definitely a weird thing when are aware you account for a large part of someone's life who you don't know and who doesn't know you - but thinks they do. 'Having an obsession with a character in a book is fine but when you are obsessed with someone you don't have anything about... I'm more comfortable with people being obsessed with Harry Potter than obsessed with me.' Actor Tom Felton meets Steve, the 'world's biggest Harry Potter fan' who has spent thousands on merchandise and even has JK Rowling's autograph tattooed on his arm . Tom tried to get inside the heads of superfans by joining in a Star Wars convention . On the show he also meets other Harry Potter superfans and learns that many of them have found solace in the world of Hogwarts when their own lives have been difficult. In Pittsburgh he meets Steve who calls himself  the 'world's biggest Harry Potter fan'. He has spent $13,000 (£8,756) on merchandise he has been collecting for 15 years and has so many Harry Potter costumes, he can wear Harry Potter clothes every day for three months without wearing same thing twice. Steve told Tom his obsession started when he was bullied at school. 'I didn't fit in, I was a skinny nerd who liked to dance rather than play baseball. I really identified with who Harry is.' But the film fan admitted it's the characters, not the actors who play them, he loves but most of all he adores writer JK Rowling. So much so that he has her signature tattooed on his forearm. The actor also dressed up as Batman's The Joker to experience the thrill of being a fan . He said: 'If JK Rowling walked through the door now you would see me lose it completely, shaking, crying freaking out. I went to New York in 2006 to see her and she signed my arm and I got it tattooed over.' The author herself had her own theory on why readers become so obsessed with her books. She said: 'You can travel every deeply into why as a society you need famous people. I totally get the Potter thing as your childhood and teen years are such an important formative part of your life and the things that matter do you then, stay with you.'

"Michelle Obama has had an awkward start to her visit to Japan as she was pictured towering over Emperor Akihito and stumbling as she tried to bow, shake his hand and curtsey at once. The First Lady, dressed in a florid combination of a blazer and skirt, dwarfed the Emperor in her silver stilettos, while he maintained his composure and smiled politely. She then squatted slightly while shaking his hand, seemingly trying to disguise the difference of height between them. Mrs Obama, who is 5ft 9in tall, also caused embarrassment earlier in the day when she grabbed Akie Abe, wife of Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in a hug-and-handshake combination while the Japanese First Lady was trying to bow. Scroll down for video . I'm going in: Michelle Obama stumbles as she attempts an awkward combination of curtsey, western handshake and Japanese bow when meeting Emperor Akihito in Tokyo. Matters were not helped by the fact that she towers over him . Just nod and smile: The Japanese Emperor is the height of politeness as he greets Mrs Obama, who squats slightly as she tries to disguise the dramatic height difference between them . Don't look down on me: Mrs Obama is back to her full height, but the incline of her head indicates that she remains intensely aware of the fact that she is at least a head taller than Emperor Akihito, centre, and his wife, Empress Michiko, right . Excessive physical contact is frowned upon in Japan, and strict traditions govern the practice of bowing. Despite intensive etiquette coaching, successive U.S. officials have famously got it wrong. In 2009, President Barack Obama was was photographed bending to nearly a 90 degree angle when he greeted the Japanese Emperor at the Imperial Palace. His efforts were widely mocked. In another example of over-enthusiastic bowing, the President was pictured bowing to a robot in 2014 while the Japanese people around him remained upright. In 1994, then-President Bill Clinton went to the other extreme, causing offence by inclining his head and shoulders forward and mysteriously pressing his hands together when he met the Emperor. Awkwardness and tension underpins much of the First Lady's visit. Her three-day trip is being described as a 'makeup call' after she 'snubbed' the Japanese by failing to accompany her husband during his state visit to Japan last year. Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzō Abe, is due to make a reciprocal visit to America next month. Mrs Obama's previous no-show  upset members of the Japanese establishment so deeply that one politician, Kazuyuki Hamada, made the outrageous claim that the Obamas were getting divorced, as the president had been using Secret Service agents to cover for his extramarital affairs. Worried: Japan's first lady listened attentively to Mrs Obama's speech, but it is likely that in the back of her mind, she was concerned about the prospect of further hug-and-handshakes .

Big in Japan: Mrs Obama waves upon her arrival at Haneda International Airport in Tokyo, wearing a green printed dress from Kenzo’s Fall 2014 collection, which costs around $700, offset by a chunky belt. Her visit is being described as a 'makeup call' after she snubbed the country last year . Mrs Obama's trip comes at a time of high tension for Americans in Japan, as Tokyo police investigate phone calls threatening to kill U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and Alfred Magleby, the U.S. consul general based on the southern island of Okinawa. Her arrival also coincides with a visit by former president Bill Clinton, who is in the country to deliver a keynote speech at the JFK International Symposium held at Waseda University in Tokyo. During the five-day trip, Mrs Obama will also visit Cambodia - whose leader, Hun Sen, has a reputation for ruthlessness, and where child prostitution and human trafficking is rife - to highlight a campaign supporting education for girls. There were so far no details on the cost of the trip, but the First Lady's group spent $222,000 over two days in hotel expenses during her 2014 trip to China, the Washington Examiner reported. Mellow yellow: Mrs Obama leaves the plane and heads for her motorcade in Tokyo where she will meet with Japanese first lady Akie Abe to discuss her education initiative . Mrs Obama will then become the first sitting U.S. first lady to visit Cambodia, one of 11 countries participating in the Let Girls Learn initiative. Cambodia's government is led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has a reputation for ruthlessness and little tolerance for dissent. The country also has child prostitution and human trafficking problems. Evan Medeiros, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, told reporters that while in Cambodia, Mrs Obama plans to discuss the need for open and inclusive politics and highlight basic values and principles that are important to the U.S. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, Mrs. Obama called it a 'tragic waste of human potential' when 62 million girls worldwide are not in school. 'It is also a serious public-health challenge, a drag on national economies and global prosperity, and a threat to the security of countries around the world, including our own,' Mrs. Obama wrote in her online travel journal. 'This visit is part of a journey that began decades ago, back when I was a little girl.' YouTube celebrity Michelle Phan is joining Mrs. Obama in Tokyo to help spread awareness for the Let Girls Learn campaign, and pose questions to the first lady submitted through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

"Technology that might have averted the Germanwings tragedy by remotely seizing control of the plane has existed for years – but has been resisted by the aviation industry, it emerged last night . Support for real-time monitoring of jets from the ground has stalled amid airline fears of the dangers of eliminating pilots and the possibilities of a so-called cyber-hijack by terrorists. Unions representing pilots are also against the move. The 9/11 attacks on the US, in which terrorists used hijacked aircraft as weapons, sparked calls for new systems to prevent a repeat of the atrocity. Scroll down for video . Recovery: Teams working in the difficult Alpine terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings . Grief: Relatives of the victims overcome with emotion after attending a tribute in honour of their loved ones in Le Vernet, France on Thursday . Philip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International, said the tragedy was partly due to 'knee-jerk' controls introduced after 9/11. He told The Independent: 'The ill-thought reinforced cockpit door has had catastrophic consequences.' Mr Baum said thinking about airline safety had been skewed by the 2001 terror attacks, adding that there had been 'excessive attention given to terrorism' and a 'failure to address other threats to aviation security'. Manufacturers in Europe and America have worked on ways of creating a ‘hijack-proof’ aircraft. In 2006, Boeing was awarded a US patent for an ‘uninterruptible autopilot system’. This would allow pilots, ground controllers or security agencies such as the CIA to activate an automatic flight mode that cannot be turned off by anyone on board. The system could also switch itself on if terrorists tried to fight their way into the cockpit, with pressure sensors on the door responding to excessive force. Eight previous crashes have been caused by suspected pilot suicide, leading to 416 deaths. November 29, 2013: Mozambique Airlines Flight 470 crashed in Namibia, killing 33 people. October 31, 1999: 217 people died after Egypt Air Flight 990 from New York crash-landed in the sea. October 11, 1999: An Air Botswana pilot grounded for medical reasons took off and crashed his plane. He was the only fatality. December 19, 1997: 104 people were killed when Silk Air flight 185 crashed in Indonesia. August 21, 1994: A Royal Air Maroc pilot flew into the Atlas Mountains, killing 44 people. July 13, 1994: A Russian Air Force engineer crashed a plane he stole at a military base, killing himself. August 22, 1979: A recently sacked mechanic crashed a stolen plane in Colombia, killing four. September 26, 1976: Twelve died when a Russian pilot directed his plane at his ex-wife’s flat. The aircraft’s flight path could be radioed to it by ground control, and it would be brought safely down at a nearby airport using existing automatic landing aids. Sources at Boeing claimed at the time that the anti-hijack equipment could be fitted to planes all over the world by 2010. But this has failed to happen amid safety concerns from pilots and airlines, and the technology remains unproven. The ability to direct pilotless aircraft from the ground is well established – military drones have long been used for surveillance and targeted missile attacks. In 2013, a 16-seater Jetstream airliner became the first passenger plane to fly ‘unmanned’ across UK civilian airspace. It was controlled remotely from the ground for the 500-mile journey, though a pilot on board handled the take-off and landing. But the idea of flying a plane carrying hundreds of passengers without any human intervention continues to worry experts. Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority said there was no remote control system currently available that could cope with navigating the country’s crowded skies. A spokesman added: ‘There are companies working on it, but the technology doesn’t exist in a practical or useable form yet.’ Pilots’ union Balpa fears using pilotless planes or allowing authorities to remotely take control of a stricken or hijacked aircraft – and believes it could leave planes in danger of being ‘hacked’ from afar. A spokesman said: ‘Having at least two pilots on the flight deck has helped make flying an incredibly safe form of public transport. The focus in the wake of this tragic accident is likely to be on ensuring that both pilots always have access to the cockpit and cannot be prevented from re-entering. ‘With this and any other measures we must act with careful consideration to ensure we don’t create new safety risks or concerns such as those raised by the vulnerability of any form of remote control of a passenger aircraft.’ Aviation safety analyst Chris Yates said there had been frequent calls for remote-controlled aircraft takeover systems since 9/11. But he also argued that this could pose more risks to passengers, with ground controllers unable to see all that a pilot on board could see. There is also a danger the technology would allow cyber-terrorists to hack into an airliner’s controls. Mr Yates added: ‘There has always been a desire to have the ability to control planes from the ground … But the ground element of that was entirely pooh-poohed by the aviation industry for a whole variety of reasons, not least of which is aircraft safety. ‘Questions will always be posed as to whether pilots should be taken out of the equation in the event of something like this so ground control would take over … I personally would not feel comfortable getting on any airliner where control could be taken away from the pilots and co-pilots.’ Youngest victim: Seven-month-old Julian Pracz-Bandres, pictured with his mother Marina Bandres (also right), died when the Airbus crashed . 9/11 rules allowed tragedy to happen . The disaster was made possible because of rules introduced after the 9/11 attacks to keep hijackers out of aircraft cockpits. Here SAM MARSDEN and RAY MASSEY analyse how co-pilot Andreas Lubitz took advantage of his colleague’s toilet break to crash the plane . When are pilots allowed to leave the cockpit? The days when aircraft captains wandered through the cabin chatting to air hostesses and children are long gone. In general both pilots must remain in their positions at the controls of at all times, and on short-haul flights they generally do not budge. But once the jet is safely in the air, they can get up to use the toilet as long as they are not absent any longer than is necessary. Patrick Sonderheimer, the pilot of the Germanwings plane, waited to reach cruising altitude  before stepping out of the cockpit, pictured . Patrick Sonderheimer, the pilot of the Germanwings plane, waited to reach cruising altitude at 38,000ft before stepping out of the cockpit. Why was Lubitz allowed to remain on the flight deck on his own? It is considered best practice to ensure that there are always two people in the cockpit to avoid tragedies like Tuesday’s. A relief pilot travels on some long-haul flights so the other crew members can get some sleep. Access to the cockpit door on the Germanwings Airbus A320 (like the one above) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking . Many airlines have a rule that another crew member must replace the pilot or co-pilot while they go to the toilet. But, in line with German aviation authority requirements, Germanwings did not stipulate that a pilot could not be left alone in the cockpit. Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority yesterday changed its guidance in light of this week’s disaster and now urges UK airlines to enforce the two-person rule. Several European airlines, including easyJet, have announced that they will now insist that two crew remain in the cockpit at all times. Why was the pilot unable to get back into the cockpit? The black box voice recorder recovered from the wreckage reveals that Mr Sonderheimer first knocked gently on the door seeking to get back in after his brief toilet trip. As the minutes passed and he realised his crazed co-pilot was steering all 150 people on board to their deaths, he became increasingly desperate and attempted to smash the door down. But Lubitz was able to barricade himself inside the cockpit thanks to an armoured bullet-proof door designed to protect passengers by keeping out terrorists. These were made mandatory after the 9/11 terror attacks on the US. To save weight, the reinforced cockpit doors often contain bullet-proof Kevlar and other super-strong composite compounds, as well as metal. The Airbus A320 has a keypad outside the cockpit which allows cabin crew to gain access by tapping in a secret code if the pilots become incapacitated for some reason. But the pilot can flick a switch to lock the door from the inside, which deactivates the external keypad for between five and 20 minutes. What screening did Lubitz undergo before being allowed to fly? Top airlines use psychological testing to check that would-be pilots are able to cope with stressful situations as well as possessing the skills needed to fly a large aircraft. Anyone found to have a history of alcohol or drug addiction or a serious mental health problem faces being rejected. Flight crew have regular medical check-ups. Those under 40 are examined once a year, while older pilots undergo tests every six months. Doctors look for health issues, including signs of stress, fatigue, drug or alcohol abuse that may point to deeper psychological problems. Without their medical certificate pilots are not allowed to fly. Aviation psychologist Professor Robert Bor said: ‘Every time they arrive at an airport they have to check-in and meet with other staff – to not spot a pilot with mental health problems would be rare.’ Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, said its air crew were chosen extremely carefully and subjected to psychological vetting.","Technology that might have averted Alps tragedy has existed for years but has been resisted by aviation industry .

"The lawyer for a 17-year-old Connecticut boy charged with stabbing a classmate to death in school on their prom day says he intends to use an insanity defense. Christopher Plaskon is charged with murdering 16-year-old Maren Sanchez in a hallway at Jonathan Law High School in Milford in April 2014, just hours before the junior prom. Police are investigating whether it was related to Sanchez's refusal to be Plaskon's prom date. Lawyers for Christopher Plaskon, 17 charged with stabbing a classmate to death in school on their prom day says he intends to use an insanity defense. Plaskon is charged with murdering 16-year-old Maren Sanchez, right, in a hallway at Jonathan Law High School in Milford in April 2014, just hours before the junior prom . Plaskon's lawyer, Richard Meehan, released new court documents on Monday saying he intends to pursue a defense of 'mental disease or defect and/or extreme emotional disturbance.' Meehan has said in court that Plaskon was taking anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety medications. Plaskon is due in Milford Superior Court for a pretrial hearing on Tuesday. Sanchez, 16, was a member of the National Honor Society who was active in drama and other school activities. She had organized the dance herself and was set to be prom queen, her friends said. A witness saw Plaskon on top of Sanchez during the attack and tried unsuccessfully to pull him away, and another saw him discard a bloody knife, according to a police affidavit.

"Rebel fighters in Syria are developing their own hand-made weapons as they battle the government regime. Fighters from the Suqour al-Sham Brigade are setting up weapons factories in caves to make shells and rockets as they take on the might of President Bashar Al-Assad's regime. These pictures show men developing mortar shells from gas canisters and making their own rockets using welding materials. Shell: A man works on a mortar shell inside a cave used as a weapon factory operated by rebel fighters from Suqour al-Sham Brigade .

The Suqour al-Sham Brigade were established in 2011 and are believed to be a mix of military defectors and civilian volunteers . They are understood to have approximately 400 fighters in their ranks, and are aligned with the Free Syria Army. The brigade are based in the Idlib Province in north-west Syria, which has come under sustained attack from the government's forces during the long-running civil war. Last week, Syrian activists and the Western-backed opposition accused the government of carrying out a devastating chlorine gas attack against a rebel-held town in Idlib that killed at least six people and left dozens, including children, choking and gasping for breath. The reported use of poison gas on the town of Sarmin was the first alleged chemical attack since the U.N. Security Council approved a  resolution  that condemns the use of toxic chemicals such as chlorine in Syria. But a Syrian military official in Damascus denied any government role in the attack and blamed it on rebels, adding: 'The army did not and will never use any internationally-prohibited weapon.'

"Female high school students from Darwin have hit out at teachers after claiming they were told not to wear clothes that were 'distracting to a lot of the boys'. Students at Casuarina Senior College say they were sent home from school for wearing tights, leggings and bike shorts in hot weather, the NT News reported. The students posted signs on Facebook and Instagram in protest of the rules, after they were taken down from a reception area in the school on Tuesday. But CSC principal Paul Mathews denied that staff had said any female student's clothing was 'distracting', and said teachers were simply enforcing the school's uniform code. Female high school students from Darwin have hit out at teachers after claiming they were told not to wear clothes that were 'distracting to a lot of the boys' The students' signs read: 'Don't stop girls from wearing tights, legging, shorts and skirts in hot weather,' the posters read. 'Instead teach male faculty and students to not over-sexualise female body parts. I don't think my thighs, legs and a** should be distracting. 'Dress code only enforces the idea that girls should cover up because 'boys will be boys'. 'What a girl wears has nothing to do with her intelligence of self respect. 'I refuse to obey rules that enforce rape culture and sl*t shaming and keep our sexist society in place.' Students at Casuarina Senior College say they were sent home from school for wearing tights, leggings and bike shorts in hot weather . Images of the signs were again shared on social media, with students saying that boys at school were allowed to wear shorts of any length while female students had to wear shorts and skirts that measured below the knee. But CSC principal Paul Mathews said tights, leggings and bike shorts were not part of the school's uniform code, and denied that staff said any female student's clothing was 'distracting'. 'Yesterday was the end of a very long communication process with students and parents reminding them about the CSC dress code,' Mr Mathews said. 'If you look at the dress code policy it doesn't at all talk about boys or girls – it says no bike pants or leggings and that shorts need to be of appropriate length . 'Can I really state that this is not an issue of gender, this is about the high standards and expectations the college has in all areas. 'My view is that a very small number of girls have chosen this method to communicate their displeasure about something they don't agree with.'","Female high school students from Darwin have hit out at uniform rules .

"For most people advancing in years,  old age is about donning a pair of comfy slippers and taking life at a steadier pace. However, one group of mischievous seventysomethings, the stars of a new series of Channel 5 show OAPs Behaving Badly, are determined to rage against the stereotype. Among those behaving badly is former popstar Lee Graham. The 75-year-old, who had a smash hit in 1968 with 'Little Arrows' under his stage name 'Leapy Lee', is refusing to put his carousing days to bed. Scroll down for video . Give us a kiss! One-time sixties pop star Lee 'Leapy Lee' Graham admits growing old disgracefully with his Danish girlfriend Bettina, who he describes as 'very sexually active' Living in Mallorca, Lee admits to sharing a saucy sex life with his much younger girlfriend Bettina, 49. The couple make it clear in the show that they are still very much full of life, with Danish Bettina at one point presenting her lover with a penis pump after visiting a sex shop. Lee said: 'Tina is a very sexually active young lady, she is quite fit and she's quite a big girl. She's just a very healthy young lady and I'm delighted to have her. 'I suppose you could meet ladies of your own age but 75 year old ladies are a lot different to 50 year old ladies.' Lee admits to creaking bones but says his new lover has given him a fresh take on life. Singing to a different tune: Lee and Bettina argue over who has the most energy. She says her 75-year-old boyfriend is 'never tired' Having fun! Lee entertains locals in Mallorca with his old tunes and says: 'I think the game is to just, just make the most of it really' He said: 'As far as age is concerned - I know that old cliché ""it's just a number"" - but it is just a number isn't it really? 'After meeting Bettina and everything it's like a bit of a new lease of life.' It seems that there's life in the old dog yet. Bettina admits to often having trouble keeping up with her pension-age lover. She said: 'I'm tired all the time he's not. He's almost never tired.' Lee keeps busy by belting out his tunes to the ageing party animals in Spain and still has plenty of female admirers - something which turns Bettina green with envy. He said: 'Over the years I suppose I've played to hundreds and hundreds and thousands of people, because I have been here thirty odd years.' 'I think as far as the future is concerned when you get to my age what's behind you gets longer and what's in front of you gets shorter. 'I think the game is to just, just make the most of it really. 'And with Bettina's help who knows.' The series also follows the fortunes of other outrageous pensioners including swinging professor Colin and 'spiritual healer' Raimondo, who is on the hunt for a younger lover.

"Laser beams could help detect cervical cancer at an early stage, say researchers from China. The new technique involves firing pulses of light, more of which is absorbed by cancerous cells than by healthy tissue. The way the cancer cells react to the light means they can then be picked up on an ultrasound scan. The scan can show not only if someone has the disease, but also potentially how advanced it is. The way the cancer cells react to the light from the laser beams means they can then be picked up on an ultrasound scan . More than 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK, with around 1,000 women dying from it. Almost all cases are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), often spread during sex. There are more than 100 types of HPV, many of which are harmless. But some can disrupt the normal functioning of the cells of the cervix and can eventually trigger the growth of cancer. Cervical smear tests are used to screen for abnormal cells — and the results may lead to a physical examination (where the cells are examined in situ using a microscope) and then a biopsy. A CT or MRI scan is performed only if the biopsy suggests there is cancer. Although cervical screening — offered to all women over 25 — has led to a large drop in the numbers affected by cervical cancer and in deaths, lesions can be missed and visual examinations can also lead to unnecessary biopsies. The new technology, known as photoacoustic imaging, requires neither a biopsy nor a smear test. It works on the principle that cancerous tissues (and possibly even pre-cancerous cells) absorbs more light than healthy tissue. This is because of changes in cancerous tissue such as the formation of new, abnormal blood vessels and fewer collagen fibres (a tough, connective tissue). Cervical smear tests are used to screen for abnormal cells — and the results may lead to a physical examination (where the cells are examined in situ using a microscope) and then a biopsy . The cancerous tissue can then be picked up on an ultrasound scan because the extra energy absorbed from the light is converted into heat, which causes the cells to expand and affects the way soundwaves bounce back to the scanner, creating an image of the cells with cancerous changes. Photoacoustic imaging could also identify the stage of the disease without a biopsy, say the researchers. This is because the more advanced the disease, the greater the amount of light and energy absorbed by the cells; these areas then look even more pronounced on a scan. The technique has so far been tested on tissue samples from 30 women — some with cancer and some who were healthy — which showed that it can distinguish between the two. ‘We have shown for the first time that photoacoustic imaging has the potential to make better diagnoses and help save lives,’ say the researchers from Central South University, China. The study is published in Biomedical Optics Express, the journal of the Optical Society of America. The same technology is also being investigated for detecting and monitoring other cancers, including breast and skin. Fiona Osgun, Cancer Research UK’s health information officer, said: ‘This small study is at a very early stage and we are a long way from knowing if this technique could diagnose cervical cancer. Cervical screening is the best way to detect cervical changes early before they develop into cancer.’ _____________________________________________________________ . Meanwhile, a special red‑light laser could banish bad breath. Halitosis is typically caused by bacteria in the mouth which produce unpleasant smelling chemicals as they break down food. A team of researchers from the University Nove de Julho in Brazil found that low-level laser light, which can kill bacteria, cut levels of bad breath-causing chemicals by around a third in 60 minutes. The light is used in conjunction with a special light-sensitive dye on a patient’s tongue, in order to target the bacteria-killing effects of the laser.","More than 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in UK .

"Three crew members have safely returned to Earth after spending 167 days on the International Space Station. They returned in a Soyuz capsule, landing southeast of the town of Zhezkazgan in Kazakhstan at 2.07am GMT (8.07am local time) this morning. One the ISS three crew members remain, and another three will join on 27 March - including two who will become the first to spend a year continuously on the station. Scroll down for video . What a view: Three astronauts have returned from the ISS after a six-month stay aboard the orbiting space station. The Soyuz TMA-14M (shown) took slightly more than three hours to return after leaving the ISS. This stunning image was taken from a helicopter as the capsule parachuted back to the ground by Nasa photographer Bill Ingalls . This landing brought to an end Expedition 42, carrying with it commander Barry Wilmore of Nasa and flight engineers Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos). Serova was the first Russian female cosmonaut to work on the station in two decades . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. The Soyuz TMA-14M spacecraft, which brought them back to Earth, departed from the space station at 10.44pm GMT on Wednesday. It took them just over three hours to return. 'We wish you a good flight and a soft landing,' the remaining crew on the ISS said to the departing crew. After a few hours of free flight, the Soyuz burned its engine for four minutes and 41 seconds, reducing its velocity enough for it to plummet through the atmosphere, with the crew module separating from the other superfluous sections. Once through the atmosphere, a parachute deployed and brought the Soyuz to a relatively gentle - but still quite bumpy - landing on the ground. Extracted from the capsule, which was charred on re-entry, the three were seated in semi-reclined chairs for a breath of fresh air and first medical checks, bundled up in blankets to protect them from frigid temperatures. 'Everything is great, thank you. The guys are great and worked very well,' said a smiling Serova while a female doctor measured her pulse and blood pressure. 'Congratulations on the recent holiday,' a rescue and recovery team officer said to Serova, referring to the International Women's Day marked on 8 March. 'Everything is fine. I am drinking real tea with lemon,' Samokutyaev said with a smile. 'I am glad to be here,' Wilmore said in Russian before the three got into all-terrain vehicles and were taken to individual helicopters to be evacuated from the landing area. This landing brought to an end Expedition 42, bringing with it commander Barry 'Butch' Wilmore (right) of Nasa and flight engineers Alexander Samokutyaev (middle) and Elena Serova (left) of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos).

The Soyuz capsule landed 91 miles (146km) southeast of the town of Jezkazgan, or Zhezkazgan, in Kazakhstan at 2.07am GMT . 'Everything is fine. I am drinking real tea with lemon,' Samokutyaev, pictured, said with a smile after the landing . While on the station, the crew participated in a variety of research focusing on the effects of microgravity on cells, Earth observation, physical science and biological and molecular science. One of several key research focus areas during Expedition 42 was human health management for long-duration space travel, as Nasa and Roscosmos prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station. On 27 March, Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly and Roscosmos cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko will undertake the first year-long stay aboard the International Space Station, to prepare astronauts for long-duration missions to Mars. The mission is designed to see how astronauts cope with such a prolonged stay in space - previously, crews only spent a maximum of six months aboard the station before returning to Earth. Expedition 42 also tested the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), which provides data to improve scientists' understanding of the structure and evolution of Earth's atmosphere. This may lead to enhancements to spacecraft launches, landings and communications systems; help guide future atmospheric investigations of Mars, Jupiter or other worlds; and help researchers model and predict climate changes on Earth. The station crew also welcomed three cargo spacecraft with several tons of scientific investigations, food, fuel and other supplies.

The Soyuz TMA-14M spacecraft is seen as it lands with the Expedition 42 crew near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan today. The crew returned after almost six months onboard the International Space Station where they served as members of the Expedition 41 and 42 crews . A fleet of ground vehicles and aircraft, such as the helicopter in the distance, are used to secure the Soyuz and rescue the crew when it lands . After a brief rest, the three got into all-terrain vehicles and were taken to individual helicopters to be evacuated from the landing area . Pictured from left to right in this photo of the entire Expedition 42 crew are Yelena Serova, Barry Wilmore, Alexander Samokutyaev, Anton Shkaplerov, Terry Virts and Samantha Cristoforetti . In January, the trio helped grapple and connect a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft on the company's fifth contracted commercial resupply mission to the station. The Dragon returned to Earth in February with critical science samples. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo craft docked to the station in October and February, while the fifth and final European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), bearing the name of Belgian physicist Georges Lemaître, considered the father of the Big-Bang theory, departed the station in February. During his time on the orbital complex, Wilmore ventured outside the space station with Nasa astronaut Terry Virts on three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future US commercial crew spacecraft. Wilmore also completed a spacewalk in October with fellow Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman to replace a failed voltage regulator. Samokutyaev conducted one spacewalk during his time in space. During his time on the orbital complex, Wilmore ventured outside the space station (pictured) with Nasa astronaut Terry Virts on three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future US commercial crew spacecraft . Having completed his second space station mission, Samokutyaev now has spent 331 days in space. Wilmore, having previously flown as a shuttle pilot on STS-129, has spent 178 days in space. Serova spent 167 days in space on this, her first flight. Expedition 43 currently is operating the station, with Virts in command. Flight engineers Anton Shkaplerov of Roscosmos and Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa are continuing station research and operations until their three new crewmates arrive in two weeks.

"Tragedy: Sailor Tindall was found dead inside her home on Saturday . A 41-year-old fashion student was found dead from wounds to her throat and wrists on Saturday, inside her luxury Manhattan apartment. Sailor Tindall was discovered lying on her bed with her throat slashed after police were called to check on her. The NYPD said that they had conducted a 'wellness check' after her concerned parents asked because they had not heard from her. Police have said they are trying to establish if the death is suspicious and one source indicated to the New York Daily News that they have not found a suicide note. 'Her parents hadn't heard from her in a while, so they called on us to check on her,' a police source said. However, police sources have also said that no signs of a struggle have been found inside the sixth-floor apartment in Liberty House - where homes can reach up to $1 million. Friends burst into tears as the body of Tindall was taken out on Saturday by officials from the city coroner's office. They even unzipped the body bag to give one female friend a last look. NYPD officers discovered Tindall's body on her blood stained bed at around 5.30pm and a knife was located nearby, said police sources to the New York Daily News. The medical examiner will carry out an autopsy on Sunday to determine the cause of death of Blinn College graduate - who was studying fashion and design in New York City. Former students of the progressive college include one-time child actor Henry Thomas who starred as Elliot in Steven Spielberg's E.T. in 1982.

"Many of us may feel, and look, older than our years. But our biological age – which can vary significantly from our real age – often remains a mystery. Now scientists say they can accurately estimate biological age by creating a 3D scan of wrinkles and other facial features. Scientists say they have discovered a way of finding out that age by creating a 3D scan of facial features. These 3D images are a composite of two sets of male faces, showing the average facial structure for each age group. The left image shows the average of the 17-29 year-old man,  and the right 60-77 year-old man . Mouth width, nose width and the distance between the mouth and nose increase with age, while the corners of the eyes start to droop. Young faces are smoother and thinner, while people with older faces had more fat build up and fuller cheeks, as well as sagging skin. They also discovered signs in people's blood associated with the markers of aging that appear on people's faces. Women with older-looking faces, for example, tended to have higher levels of 'bad' cholesterol, the study found. Men older-aged faces often had lower levels of albumin in their blood samples, a protein found in plasma. Jing-Dong Han and colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences collected 3D images of 332 Chinese people between the ages of 17 and 77 using a camera called the 3dMDface System. Using the data, the authors created a map of the ageing human face and were able to develop a method to find patterns of ageing based on certain facial features. According to the study, mouth width, nose width and the distance between the mouth and nose increase with age, while the corners of the eyes start to droop. Young faces are smoother and thinner, while people with older faces had more fat build up and fuller cheeks, as well as sagging skin.

Women with older-looking faces, for example, tended to have higher levels of 'bad' cholesterol, the study found. Men older-aged faces often had lower levels of albumin in their blood samples, a protein found in plasma. '3D facial images can really tell your biological age,' the study's senior researcher Jing-Dong Han, told LiveScience. 'It's really more accurate than a physical exam.' Jing-Dong Han and colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences collected 3D images of 332 Chinese people between the ages of 17 and 77 using a camera called the 3dMDface System. The left image shows the average face of a 17-29 year-old women, and the right 60-77 year-old female . Pictured is a heat map of weight values for older men (right) and women (left). Young faces are smoother and thinner, while people with older faces had more fat build up and fuller cheeks, as well as sagging skin . They found that up until the age of 40, people of the same chronological age could differ by up to six years in facial age. Over the age of 40, variation in facial age increased. The technique was used to identify participants who were physiologically ageing faster or more slowly than their chronological age would suggest. These results were supported by indicators for health and age in blood samples taken from the volunteers. The researchers say their model could help identify people who age physiologically faster and tailor treatment to their needs. The results could be different among different ethnicities, and the researchers now hope to conduct a further study among a sample that includes Americans. Pictured are the average profiles of the predicted slow-ager, well-predicted and fast-ager female and malesubjects in age groups younger than 40 years old. Mouth width, nose width and the distance between the mouth and nose increase with age, while the corners of the eyes start to droop .","Scientists scanned faces of 332 Chinese people aged between 17 and 77 .

"Life on Earth may have been kickstarted by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago. Chemists claim they may have finally solved the riddle of how life first got going on Earth. They have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - DNA, proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light. Meteorite impacts, like the one in the illustration above, may have triggered the creation of hydrogen cyanide that scientists have found can create the three basic building blocks of light in reactions powered by sunlight . Their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams, coming together to form the first cells. This suggests that life may well have first emerged here on Earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. It is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids. RNA is formed from strings of nucleic acids, the same building blocks that create DNA. Genetic information in a cell flows from DNA through RNA to proteins. DNA is considered the 'blueprint' of the cell and RNA is what helps translate it. Some life, like viruses, only use RNA and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on Earth used this molecule. Proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids. These carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick. Lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles. They form the membrane 'walls' of every living cell and give them structure. They are also essential for sending signals out of the cell. But the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence. They claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the Late Heavy Bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide. This poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions, along with hydrogen sulphide, driven by ultraviolet light. Professor John Sutherland, a chemist at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge who led the study said: 'Although it necessarily has to be painted with broad brushstrokes, the picture that emerges is of an overall reaction network developing over time in separate streams and pools, according to a dynamic flow chemistry scheme. 'The various products would be synthesized by subtle variations in the flow-chemistry history of the streams and the order in which they merged or ran into pools. 'Although the overall scheme would not involve all the steps of the reaction network taking place simultaneously in ‘one pot’, the various products would end up mixed together in pools.' Scientists have long believed that the building blocks for life first began occurring one after another although the debate for which came first has been controversial. Meteorite fragments and bedrock in craters like this one could have reacted with hydrogen cyanide dissolved in pools of water to create salts that react with heat and ultraviolet light to create RNA, lipids and amino acids . The researchers behind the new paper propose a number of geochemical steps shown above that could have seen hydrogen cyanide start a series of reactions that led to the creation of amino acids, nucleic acids and lipids necessary for life. First the hydrogen cyanide is dissoved in water (a) and then reacts with metals to create salts (b). These are left behind by evaporation and then undergo changes due to geothermal heating (c). The resulting molecules are swept away by steams and accumulate in ponds where they react further (d). The researchers behind the latest study, which is published in the journal Nature Chemistry, found they could make nucleic acids - a precursor for RNA and DNA - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and UVlight. They also found the same basic ingredients could also lead to the creation of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and lipids which form the protective membranes around biological cells. The conditions necessary to create all of these were found to be the same, meaning a single set of chemical reactions could have given rise to life's basic building blocks simultaneously. Professor Sutherland and his colleagues argue that the early Earth would have been a favourable setting for these reactions. Hydrogen sulphide is thrown out in volcanic eruptions like the one above and may have been a vital ingredient in the formation of the first biological building blocks needed to create living cells, according to new research . One of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on Earth is how complex organisms began to take shape. Theory should hold that 'short' fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance, leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind. But new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic 'pores' on the young Earth - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today. The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature. They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began. One crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures. These, in turn, had to be capable of reproducing themselves, storing genetic information in a chemically stable form. Creating longer strands of RNA to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply wouldn't have been possible in most conditions on Earth. But LMU physicists led by Dr Dieter Braun showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity, namely hydrothermal vents, could have served as reaction chambers for this RNA. Hydrogen cyanide would have formed in large amounts due to the bombardment of comets raining down on the Earth a few hundred million years after it formed. Hydrogen sulphide was also thought to be common on the early Earth - thrown out by volcanic eruptions - while the sun would have provided more than enough ultraviolet light. Metal containing minerals that could have catalysed the reactions were also abundant while metal meteorites could also have caused the formation of other crucial elements like phosphate. In their paper, the scientists set out a series of geochemical scenarios that would have led the reactions in different directions to produce each of the necessary building blocks. Evaporation for example could have caused salts for form that could have then been washed into streams where solar radiation would have driven further chemical reactions. Over time the different products would have been mixed together as streams met and mingled into pools. Jack Szostak, a molecular biologist who studies the origin of life at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and was not involved in the study, told the journal Science: 'This is a very important paper. 'It proposes for the first time a scenario by which almost all of the essential building blocks for life could be assembled in one geological setting.'","Scientists created precursors to RNA, proteins and lipids in basic reactions .
Their tests used hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light .
These chemicals would have been plentiful on the Earth 4 billion years ago .
Hydrogen cyanide would have been created by  meteorite debris reacting with the nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere during repeated space impacts .
Hydrogen sulphide gas was probably thrown out by erupting volcanoes .
The research was conducted by chemists at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge ."
"Jonathan Disegi vomited at a New York City restaurant and bar on Saturday afternoon . A New York advertising executive drank so much that he threw up in front of diners at Bergdorf Goodman's restaurant. Jonathan Disegi, who is Commonwealth/McCann's executive VP, vomited on the bar and customers on Saturday afternoon. It appeared he had already been drinking when he arrived at the bar alone, reports Page Six. A witness said that he was 'bragging to strangers around him that he was in advertising. They said he ordered more alcohol, but then when he went to the bathroom the woman eating at the bar asked the staff not to serve him anymore. The onlooker said that when Disegi came back to the bar, he sat down but promptly vomited. 'He put his head down, and it splashed on the counter, dripping on the floor, and onto a woman's expensive Burberry jacket. Staff rushed to clean it up with napkins.' The witness told Page Six that Disegi paid the bill, got up and left the restaurant. It appeared he had already been drinking when he arrived at the bar (pictured) alone . The witness said when he went to the bathroom the woman who were at the bar asked the staff not to serve him anymore, because he was so drunk . Disegi said to Page Six in an email: 'Yes, I had too much to drink. It was a mistake. Publishing this would not be good for my career, and I really beg you to be discreet here. I made a mistake, and I feel terrible.' The incident brought comparisons of when Mad Men's Don Draper vomited at a funeral and when Roger Sterling threw up at the New York City agency after a restaurant visit. Disegi, who leads the company’s Chevrolet account, joined in January. He previously worked at JWT New York, where he spent over four years serving as global planning director and worked with clients including Microsoft Bing, Kleenex, Nokia, Schick and HSBC. Commonwealth/McCann told Daily MailOnline that the agency does not comment on personal matters.","Jonathan Disegi, who works at Commonwealth/McCann, vomited on the bar and customers on Saturday afternoon .

"Toy giant Lego has come under fire from parents after publishing an article in its own-brand magazine which offered a range of 'insulting' beauty tips to young girls. The March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine included a feature called 'Emma's Beauty Tips', which suggested that young girls who are 'ready to change up their looks' should consider opting for a more flattering haircut that would better suit their face shape. 'You, yes you, are beautiful, but if you're ready to change up your look, read on for some tips and tricks on how to get the best haircut for the shape of your face,' the article reads. Outrage: This 'beauty tips' feature in the March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine has caused fury among parents . The feature then lists five different face shapes, from 'heart faces' to 'oval faces', suggesting which type of hair cut would be bested suited to each shape. And while those with heart-shaped faces are advised to choose 'long, curly layers and thinned out curls' in order to accentuate their 'angular cheeks', those with oval faces are told that they are lucky enough to be able to 'have almost any style haircut' because 'almost everything looks great on this face shape'. Unsurprisingly, the article has hit a nerve with parents of the young girls reading the magazine - with one mother, Cleveland-based writer Sharon Holbrook, writing a piece for the New York Times slamming the magazine's 'insulting' feature. '[My daughter] is seven,' she wrote. 'My little girl, the shape of her face, and whether her haircut is flattering are none of Lego’s concern,'  It wasn’t even her concern until a toy magazine told her to start worrying about it.' Mrs Holbrook goes on to quote from the Lego Friends website, which states that the range is aimed at children between the ages of five and 12 who are, she writes, 'far too young' to be told that their face shape might mean they need a new haircut in order to 'soften the edges' of their faces. Unnecessary: The 'overtly girly' Lego Friends line, including this Heartlake Hair Salon, has previously come under fire from parents for suggesting that young girls should not be playing with traditional Lego models . Calling for change: Writer Sharon Holbrook (pictured) wrote a piece about the Lego feature in which she insisted that children as young as five should not be worrying about whether they have a flattering face shape . The online article has prompted a flurry of furious activity on social media, with parents across the country calling for Lego to abandon its 'sexist' marketing campaigns and 'overtly girly' toy ranges in favor of returning to the 'powerful messages' it once offered to  young girls who were so eager to play with their products. 'Go back to this [message] of 1981 instead of ""beauty tips for 5-12 year-olds"" c**p,' one person wrote on Twitter, alongside a picture of a 30-year-old Lego ad campaign which encouraged young girls to 'build for fun'. Another added: 'Nonononono. Damn it, LEGO. Girls don't need another source of beauty tips, let alone from you.' One parent went as far as to say she would boycott Lego until the brand does something to address its 'sexist' campaigns, tweeting: 'Hey @LEGO_Group, your sexism is getting out of control. I’m buying @Tegu blocks until you check it (sic).' 'The ultra-girly Lego Friends line caused a flap from the beginning, and I wasn’t at all sure whether I liked it,' Mrs Holbrook added. 'Why can’t girls and boys both play with traditional Legos? When I was little, Lego used to even market them to all children, magnificently so...' Go back: Parents are calling for Lego to return to the positive messages it once sent out to young girls, such as the one in this ad campaign from 1981 . Fury: Many parents have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment at the overtly 'sexist' Lego Friends line . In a statement provided to Mashable, Lego spokesman Michael McNally insisted that the copmany was taking onboard all of the feedback offered by 'readers', adding that the brand 'sincerely regrets' any offense caused by the feature. 'Our Club team is always striving for new ways to engage with Lego fans based on insights we gather from our Club audience,' Mr McNally said. 'One particular thing that readers asked us to include was an ""Advice Column"". In the most recent magazine, we attempted to deliver against this request by elaborating on a current Lego Friends story line. 'We sincerely regret any disappointment it may have caused. We value this feedback and have already shared with the Lego Club team in order to positively impact future stories.' It is not the first time that the Lego Friends line, the range of toys on which the beauty tips article was based, has come under heavy criticism from parents. Shortly after the range debuted in 2011, many people spoke out to express concern about its seemingly sexist suggestion that young girls needed their own line of feminine toys, rather than being able to play with the traditional building blocks also used by boys. Instead of the more conventional themes many associate with Lego blocks, the Lego Friends line focuses on shopping, beauty products, homemaking and cooking.","The March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine included a feature on how young girls could change their hairstyles to be more flattering .

"Fall: 21-year-old  Cameron Smook fell off the Carnival Glory cruise ship Sunday near the Bahamas. He was a senior at Virginia Tech university . A Virginia Tech student's spring break cruise of the Bahamas turned dark this weekend when he fell off the ship and disappeared in the tropical waters. Engineering student Cameron Smook was caught on cameras falling off the Carnival Glory ship Sunday morning and he hasn't been seen since. His family from Glen Allen, Virginia authorized the university to release his name on Wednesday, and said he was on the cruise with a group of friends. The U.S. Coast Guard spent three days searching for Smook near Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas, but suspended the search Tuesday evening. On Tuesday, Virginia Tech confirmed Smook attends the school, which is currently on spring break until March 15. He was in his senior year, studying  mining and minerals engineering in the school's College of Engineering, and was scheduled to graduate this spring. Smook's parents say he had already accepted a job offer and 'was looking forward to a very bright future'. Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen says no foul play is suspected in Smook's disappearance. Scroll down for video . On camera: The cruise line was able to confirm that Smook fell off the ship with security footage. Above a picture of the Carnival Glory at port in Miami last year . Group trip: Smook pictured on the right with two friends in a photo posted to Facebook in August 2014. His parents say he boarded the Carnival Glory in Miami on Saturday with several friends . No sign: The U.S. Coast Guard suspended their search for Smook near Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas on Tuesday . The Miami-based Carnival Glory departed Saturday on a seven-day Caribbean Cruise. On Sunday, Carnival informed Smook's family that he was missing at sea on the first leg of the journey. The ship was diverted back to the spot where it's believed Smook went missing, and helped search the area with other boats and the Coast Guard, including fellow Carnival ship Ecstasy. Both ships have since been released from search duty and have continued with their planned journey. Carnival's CareTeam is currently providing support for the missing student's traveling companions and family. 'We extend our heartfelt sympathy and concern for the family and loved ones of our missing guest,' the company said in a statement. In a statement, his family thanked the cruise line 'for their outstanding service and for keeping us informed throughout this ordeal'. Before attending Virginia Tech, Smook graduated from Deep Run High School in Glen Allen. Our son, Cameron Smook, and several of his friends departed from Miami on Saturday, March 7 aboard the Carnival Glory for a Caribbean cruise. On Sunday morning, March 8 we were notified by Carnival Cruise Line officials that Cameron had accidentally fallen overboard during the night and was missing at sea. The United States Coast Guard was notified and began search and rescue efforts. After conducting an extensive air and sea search these efforts were suspended last evening pending further developments. We thank the Coast Guard for their outstanding service and for keeping us informed throughout this ordeal. Cameron, 21 years of age, is a graduate of Deep Run High School in Glen Allen, Virginia, and was scheduled to graduate from Virginia Tech this spring with a degree in Mining Engineering. He thoroughly enjoyed his experiences at Virginia Tech, had just accepted an employment offer, and was looking forward to a very bright future. Our family sincerely appreciates your continued prayers and support at this most difficult time. We also request privacy and ask not to be contacted by members of the media. Memorial service details will be shared at a later date.","Security footage captured the moment 21-year-old Cameron Smook fell off the Carnival Glory on Sunday morning .

"More than 60 cultural artifacts illegally smuggled into the U.S. from Iraq were returned to the Iraqi government during a ceremony  in Washington D.C. on Monday. The move follows a culmination of investigations led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in New York, Baltimore, Austin, Texas, and New Haven, Connecticut. Among the items salvaged were a gold-plated door knocker, water urn and soap dish  from Saddam Hussein's private airport and palace. More than 60 cultural artifacts illegally smuggled into the U.S. from Iraq have been returned to the Iraqi government - Among the items salvaged were a door knocker, water urn and soap dish from Saddam Hussein's private airport and palace (above) Investigators were alerted to the belongings when a source tipped them off that gold-plated artifacts from the former president's properties were on the market. 'They're invaluable to the host country,' said Bruce Foucart, the agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations in New England. The artifacts were returned to their home country at a special event held at the Embassy of Iraq. One of the most significant objects on show was the head of a statue representing King Sargon II. The limestone carving was recovered in New York in 2008 by agents who broke up a smuggling ring operated by a dealer in Dubai. The move follows a culmination of investigations led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in New York, Baltimore, Austin, Texas, and New Haven, Connecticut . The artifacts were returned to Iraq at a ceremony at the Iraqi consulate in Washington on Monday . In Iraq, the Islamic State group has destroyed a number of shrines and ancient artifacts in order to eliminate what they view as heresy. Lukman Faily, Iraq's ambassador to the U.S., said Monday's ceremony sends a message to Islamic State that Iraq and its allies are committed to rebuilding the country and preserving its cultural heritage. Faily said the return of the looted items is 'a national project and we call upon all countries to help us in preserving this heritage which is not only valuable for Iraq but for all mankind.' The Smithsonian has trained a cadre of Homeland Security Investigations agents in how to research the provenance of cultural artifacts as they investigate smuggling. Iraqi Ambassador to the US Lukman Faily (right) speaks in front of a sculpture of the head of Assyrian King Sargon II . The limestone statue was recovered in New York in 2008 by agents who broke up a smuggling ring operated by a dealer in Dubai . The artifacts recovered by the New Haven, Connecticut-based agents were brought to the U.S. by a government contractor who handed them over when confronted by investigators, Foucart said. The investigation began with a tip in April 2012 and Foucart said his agents became involved because Connecticut was a possible destination for the items. Among the other items recovered by multi-year investigations are an ancient bronze axe and 21 clay reliefs. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement unit has reportedly returned more than 1,200 items to Iraq in four repatriations since 2008.","The move follows a culmination of investigations led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents .

"Dog owners have been warned that their animals could be at risk from a popular brand of pet food which is at the centre of a multi-million-pound lawsuit. Purina Beneful is accused of making dogs violently ill, causing seizures, kidney failure, sudden weight loss and even death. Distraught pet owners across North America are now suing Nestle, the brand’s owner, for $5million (£3.3million) over the allegedly unsafe dry dog food - which can also be bought in the UK. Scroll down for videos . Companion: Loss: Jean-Francois Menicucci from Montreal told MailOnline his 240lb mastiff Rex ate Purina Beneful after a family member brought it back from the store one day. He believes it led to his beloved dog's premature death . Terrifying ordeal: Rex devoured the product in August 2013 and then suddenly started having a seizure . The company strongly denies the allegations, calling the lawsuit ‘baseless’, although thousands of dog owners have complained about the effect of the food on their pets. They claim the dry food product contains toxic chemicals including propylene glycol, which can be used as an anti-freeze, and mycotoxin. All of the customers involved in the class-action lawsuit, which was filed last month in California, are from the US or Canada. However, Beneful is also available in Britain - four varieties of the brand’s dry food are listed for sale on Amazon.co.uk, and it can also be bought from other leading pet food retailers online. Pet owners who are worried about their animals becoming ill as a result of their diet should consult a vet in order to determine whether there is any risk. Seizure: Mr Menicucci describes how Rex was fitting for hours and couldn't even move him to get him to the vet. Before they could get him help he was gone . Heartbreaking: Mr Menicucci said Rex just stopped breathing and keeled over in front of him . A number of dog owners in the US and Canada who believe their animals have suffered as a result of Purina Beneful have shared their experiences with MailOnline. Jean-Francois Menicucci, from Montreal in Canada, said his 240lb mastiff Rex ate Beneful after a family member brought it back from the store in April 2013. ‘My other dog, Tally, refused to eat it,’ he said. ‘But Rex devoured it.’ He described how 40 minutes later Rex, who was three years old at the time, went into a seizure for hours without stopping. He could not move him to take him to the vet. ‘Suddenly he died in front of my eyes. He stopped breathing and he was gone.’ He filed a complaint to the authorities, suggesting his dog’s death was caused by Beneful. Officials then came and collected samples of the food. Purina subsequently sent him an apology and 24 Canadian Dollars (£13). ‘At the time, my mother came out from a seven-month coma in the ICU,’ he added. ‘She woke up with her two legs partially paralyzed, she was working very hard to regain mobility, because her dream was to walk Rex again. Imagine when I told her he had died. I just want justice for Rex.’ Concern: Mike Garnett-Zero posted a horrifying video of friend Cassandra Angelique comforting a dog who they said had been given Purina Beneful . During their youth: Ms Angelique holds her two beloved dogs as puppies . Horrifying: Michael Dowling described how his niece's English Bulldog called Pippa (pictured) had to be 'put to sleep' after suffering from kidney failure. Their vet said it was down to the dog being fed Purina Beneful . Propylene glycol is regularly used as a flavouring ingredient in drinks and food as E-1520. It is found in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, but regulations of its use differ between the US and the EU. In October, for example, Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey was pulled from the shelves across Europe because it contained the substance, as it was in breach of European regulations. However it remained on the shelves in the US. In the US, the chemical is 'generally recognised as safe' by the Food and Drug Administration, and Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey claims up to 50 grams per kilogram can be used, though it states it uses far less in its drink. Popylene glycol is also found in automotive and aircraft anti-freeze, for its ability to lower the freezing point of water. The substance is also released alongside nicotine when smoking e-cigarettes. Denial: The company say the lawsuit is 'baseless' Another dog owner, Mike Garnett-Zero, uploaded a horrifying video of friend Cassandra Angelique comforting their dog Melody, who they said had just eaten Purina Beneful. It shows the animal lying on the floor of its cage unable to get up. Underneath the video posted on Facebook, he wrote: ‘Beneful’s line of pet food and treats has poisoned our beautiful pets for the last time. Please boycott this brand and never feed it to your loved ones.’ They also posted another showing Melody barely able to stand and losing balance as she walks, so Mr Garnett-Zero has to hold her on his lap. In February, Michael Dowling told his followers on GooglePlus what had happened to his niece’s English Bulldog called Pippa. Next to a picture of the pet wearing a pink top hat, he described how his niece had to ‘put their dog to sleep’ due to kidney failure. Dowling says that the dog’s deteriorating health may have been prompted by eating the product. Cheryl Harmon wrote on Facebook how her Chihuahua, called Darcie, died at the age of six as a result of what she believes was poisoning from the product. Julie Hyde, 39, of Sandwich, Illinois, said her six-year-old pitbull called Bossy was as ‘healthy as a horse’ before she started eating the food. However she believes it was extremely detrimental to her health thereafter. ‘You could see her spine and ribs’, she said. ‘For her to lose that much weight dramatically there was something definitely wrong.’ After taking her to a vet, the animal was diagnosed with diabetes because her sugar levels were ‘sky-high’. Despite treatment, Bossy’s health continued to deteriorate and she had to be put down last December. The company has vehemently denied the allegations and insists customers should continue buying the product. A spokesman for Nestlé Purina PetCare said: ‘We are aware that a class action lawsuit was recently filed against Beneful in the United States. ‘We believe this lawsuit to be baseless and intend to vigorously defend our high quality, nutritious food which is backed by Purina’s strict quality controls and comprehensive food safety programme. Purina dog foods are enjoyed by millions of dogs every day and pet owners can continue to feed them with total confidence.’ Another alleged vicitim: Morgan Malone, 19, of North Carolina, told NBC News her dachshund called Doc got 'super sick' and died within the space of a week after eating the product . Memory: She posted pictures of her beloved dog on Facebook with friends offering her messages of support . Pet owner Frank Lucido filed the lawsuit on February 5 in US District Court in the Northern District of California against Nestle Purina PetCare Company. Lucido claims he fed his three dogs Beneful ‘kibble’ style dog food, and within a short period of time, two were sick and one was dead. The suit alleges the food contains propylene glycol, which it says is an animal toxin used in automobile antifreeze, and mycotoxins, a group of toxins produced by fungus that occurs in grains. In the suit, Mr Lucido alleges that in the past four years, there have been more than 3,000 complaints online about dogs becoming ill or dying after eating Beneful, having shown ‘consistent symptoms,’ including stomach and related internal bleeding, liver malfunction or failure, vomiting, diarrhea, have not yet been released. The suit asks the court to expand the case to include other dog owners whose dogs were sickened or died. It asks for unspecified damages and restitution, although it says the claims exceed $5million. In recent years, Beneful has faced two lawsuits that were dismissed by the courts, according to Purina’s statement. However, in a lawsuit settled in May, Purina and Waggin’ Train LLC agreed to create a $6.5 million fund to compensate pet owners who claimed their pets were sickened after eating China-made jerky treats. At the time, US officials said the pet treats were linked to more than 1,000 deaths in dogs and more than 4,800 complaints of animal illness. Passed away: Darcie, owned by Cheryl Harmon, is also died after eating the food. Vets allegedly told the owner Purina Beneful was the cause .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

'They shuffle around, rest, and start squealing when feeding time comes and they're hungry. 'To be there, in the middle of their habitat, was a really great experience.

"A new two-part television show will offer a glimpse into the harsh reality of life for those living on Darndale, dubbed Ireland's toughest estate. The first episode of Benefits Estate airs tonight and viewers will see how some of the 600 residents of Darndale struggle to make ends meet on the estate where unemployment is high and drugs and crime rife. One of those appearing in the first episode is new mother Gemma Geraghty, who is struggling as she balances the demands of a newborn with decisions on whether to spend her benefits on lighting or food. Scroll down for video . Teenage mother Gemma Geraghty cradles baby Alfie on the first episode of Channel 5 show Benefits Estate . The 19-year-old faces a daily battle to make ends meet as she cares for her mum, Roseanne, and newborn son Alfie on the estate where teenagers ride horses bareback through the streets. 'I get 100 Euros a week, which is nothing really, not with a baby to care for,' says Gemma, who also shares the house with her brother, sister, two dogs and two cats. 'By the time I've bought things for him, there's not much left. 'Running the house entirely on benefits is a constant struggle. We haven't run out of heating yet. But every Monday and Wednesday the lights go out. New mother Gemma (centre) with her sister Rebecca, brother Anthony, baby Alfie and her friend James . The teenager is one of a number of residents who will be seen on Benefits Estate tonight on Channel 5. 'I got most of my baby's clothes off my sister whose own baby has just passed away and from nice people on Facebook,' said Gemma. 'And when I'm done with them I'm going to hand them over to whoever wants them.' One of the Gemma's two cats sits on top of the rubbish that is piling up because the family can't afford to have it collected . Her mother, Roseanne, cradling four-week-old baby Alfie, said she had been battling depression for a long time and rarely went out. 'On a bad day I won't get out of bed at all,' she said. In Ireland, families have to pay to get their waste removed, and  as they haven't had any spare cash to do this, the rubbish has piled up, says Gemma. A mouse, which had been scurrying over the rubbish, is caught by one of the cats . 'The rubbish has got stuck in the drains and flooded the garden, so we can't do any washing,' said Gemma. 'I don't know what that rubbish carries, it's unhygienic!' Roseanne says she is embarrassed by the amount of litter in bin bags.' 'It's embarrassing for me and when you suffer from depression, things just get on top of you.' Two horses stand outside a house on Darndale . Single mother, Angelique, who has a young son, Brody, has spent her whole life on the estate and knows the alleyways well. 'As a kid if you wanted to be a bully, you would go in the alleyway and not let anyone pass until they gave you money,' she said. 'Or the boys and girls would each have their own bit of alley where they would go. It was all kids stuff, but then you grow up into the big bad world.'

"With central London now affordable only to the super-rich, everyone outside the top 1 per cent who wants to live in the capital is heading further out. And this graphic shows how a ‘middle-class migration’ is seeing affluent buyers leave Kensington and Chelsea in favour of Chiswick and Clapham. Herne Hill and Kensal Rise are the new ‘nappy valleys’, while well-off couples  who cannot afford to live where their parents did are heading to Kilburn. But with the average house price in the capital now at £460,000, most properties are still out of reach for the majority of buyers on normal incomes. This map shows how London is now split up - with red showing the central market, blue for the established market, and yellow for the emerging market. Location, location, location: The established prime markets outside central London, with Hampstead/Highgate topping the list for house prices . Up and coming: These are the top areas in London for emerging prime markets, ranging from Teddington in the west to Thameside in the east . Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, said younger people tend to form the group who ‘pioneer a new area’ when looking to buy. But he told MailOnline: ‘It can take a decade easily for these areas to go through a period of transformation - it tends to be a relatively long time.’ Mr Cook added that buyers who want to be close to their friends but cannot afford to live in a certain place will often move to neighbouring areas. However, he warned that emerging areas see a high proportion of people in the top few socio-economic groups - which is reflected in house prices. Mr Cook said: ‘For the people buying with a 75 per cent mortgage, often you will be looking at two relatively high-earning professionals.’ Prices in prime central London have soared by 180 per cent in ten years, making properties there affordable to only the top 1 per cent of earners. Changing places: Herne Hill (left) and Kensal Rise (right) are the new ‘nappy valleys’, as domestic buyers in the capital look outside the centre . Despite an average price of more than £1.6million, about 20 per cent of buyers do not even need mortgages, according to Mr Cook's research. He added: ‘To borrow 75 per cent of the purchase price in central London on four times earnings, you would need a household income of £306,000.’ The old established ‘comfort zones’ have an average price of £873,000, requiring a £164,000 household income on a 75 per cent mortgage. But even in the ‘up-and-coming sweet spots’, an income of £115,000 is needed with an average price of £615,904, reported The Daily Telegraph. While prices in all of these areas have more than doubled in a decade, they are now rising fastest in the emerging areas – up 17 per cent last year. New locations: Affluent couples who cannot afford to live where their parents did are heading to Kilburn (above), according to the Savills study . The top three traditional comfort zones in London are Hampstead and Highgate; Swiss Cottage, Belsize Park and Primrose Hill; and Fulham. The average house price for all three of these is around the £1million mark - with Wimbledon and Barnes not far behind, at about £900,000. Meanwhile, for the up-and-coming areas, Hammersmith and Shepherd's Bush are top - but the average price is still a whopping £738,000. Behind this area is Thameside at £715,000; then Finchley and Mill Hill at £639,000; and Dulwich and Herne Hill at £635,000. Luxury living: Hampstead (pictured), along with Highgate, is the top traditional comfort zone in London - with an average price of £1.04million . Research published last week in the Mail found one in five homes in Britain has 'earned' more than its owner over the past two years. And the most dramatic example was in Hammersmith and Fulham, where house prices rose by £143,232 more than their owners earned in the period. Homes there went up by £199,930 - or 40 per cent - in 2013 and 2014, easily exceeding average take-home earnings in the area of £56,698. In 2007, the average age of someone buying their first home was 29 years old, but for the last few years the average first-time buyer has been 30.

"This is the comical letter that a schoolboy penned to his teacher after being told off for talking during a German lesson. Rather than being apologetic and remorseful the defiant 13-year-old brazenly tells his language master, 'I am not sorry.' In the hastily written note, scrawled on a scrunched up piece of lined paper, he says he was only speaking to a friend for a 'few seconds' was not 'constantly talking.' The teen, who has not been named, added 'I do not like German' and signed off the letter with 'I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch.' This is the defiant handwritten note that a schoolboy penned to his teacher after being told off for talking . The hilarious letter was uploaded to Twitter by the boy's brother, and was retweeted thousands of times in just 12 hours. The picture was uploaded with the caption 'My brother had to write an apology to Mrs *****. Look what he's put down.' The boy is a pupil at Oldmachar Academy, in Aberdeen, Scotland. The full note reads: 'I turned around and talked to ****** for a few seconds. I was not talking constantly. Also, everyone else was talking too and I got this work for speaking to ****** for a second. 'I don't think it's fair and I'm not sorry.. I already done the work. I do not enjoy German. 'I need to write to that line down there but I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch yesterday.' The cheeky chap's father said: 'He does hate German. I had no idea that he had written this letter and this is all news to me. 'I turned around and talked to ****** for a few seconds. I was not talking constantly.

'I need to write to that line down there but I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch yesterday.' 'I don't know if he would have had the guts to hand it in.' Twitter users found the letter hilarious, and it has so far received over 2,000 'favourites'. One user wrote: 'At least Mrs ***** knows what he had for lunch. That's something anyway.' Another added: 'This is sensational.' Someone else wrote: 'That's brilliant.' Other examples of hilarious letters written by children include one from a student which read: 'Dear Mrs Storz. You are the best music teacher ever because my last music teacher choked a boy.' One letter from one pupil to another reads: 'Dear Brody. Miss P made me write you this note. All I want to say sorry for is not being sorry because . I tried to feel sorry but I don't.' There was no one available at the school for comment.

"Scientists have found that pollution coming from Asian countries is affecting weather in the United States. The effect that pollution in Asia may have on other parts of the world has been examined by both NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) and the California Institute of Technology, NASA's Earth Science News reported. Jonathan Jiang, who is part of JPL, and Yuan Wang looked at the potential link between more intense storms in the Northwest Pacific, deeper clouds over the Pacific Ocean, and Asia's period of economic growth -- all of which happened in the same 30-year period, according to the news outlet. Research: Scientists have found that pollution coming from Asian countries is affecting weather in the United States. A hazy Shanghai skyline is seen in this file photo . 'We found that pollution from China affects cloud development in the North Pacific and strengthens extratropical cyclones,' Wang, who is a postdoctoral fellow, told Earth Science News. Jonathan Jiang, pictured, was one of the researchers involved in the project . Wang told the news outlet that more powerful extratropical cyclones likely played a role in 2013 winter weather on the East Coast. He also said that during extratropical cyclones, a larger amount of water undergoes condensation on aerosols -- due to greater pollution. Heat released from the process can contribute to a cloud becoming both larger and deeper, Earth Science News explained. Jiang told the news outlet 'Before, we thought about the North-South contrast: the Northern Hemisphere has more land, the Southern Hemisphere has more ocean. 'That difference is important to global atmospheric circulation. 'Now, in addition to that, there's a West-East contrast. Europe and North America are reducing emissions; Asia is increasing them. 'That change also affects the global circulation and perturbs the climate.' Speaking to the Weather Channel, Jiang said 'During the wintertime, human-induced pollution such as coal burning in many Asian cities can create smog that lasts for weeks. Cold conditions: Postdoctoral fellow Yuan Wang has said that more powerful extratropical cyclones likely played a role in 2013 winter weather in the East. (A woman is seen in Boston in this February 2013 file photo) 'Under favorable wind conditions, pollution particles can be transported downwind across the North Pacific, where winter storms are prevalent.' However, Jiang told NPR that he does not know to what extent powerful Pacific storms can cause severe weather in other parts of the United States. 'We have not reached a final conclusion yet,' he told the media outlet.","Scientists have found that pollution coming from Asian countries is affecting weather in the United States .

"Rome wasn't built in day, and it certainly wasn't for rural postman Ferdinand Cheval, who dedicated 33 years of his life constructing an incredible limestone palace, complete with pillars, buttresses and grottoes. The widower would often find unusually shaped rocks as he delivered mail in France, and ended up pushing a wheelbarrow each day on his 18-mile route to collect stones of beauty. What started as a small hobby, soon became a life project in 1879, resulting in one of the most magnificent amateur architectural structures to date; Le Palais idéal. Scroll down for video . A postman in France spent 33 years constructing a lavish grotto, complete with pillars, towers and buttresses . Le Palais idéal features mythical creatures, inspired from the postcards and magazines he had to deliver on his postal route in France . From a glance you would be mistaken for thinking this was an Angkor palace, as the grotto has  influences from Hinduism . Ferdinand Cheval left school at age 13 to become a baker's apprentice, but ended up delivering mail in the Hauterives area. The idea for the elaborate cathedral came when he tripped over an unusually shaped rock in his 30s. He later wrote in his journal: 'I wanted to know the cause. In a dream I had built a palace, a castle or caves. I told no one about it for fear of being ridiculed and I felt ridiculous myself. 'I said to myself: since Nature is willing to do the sculpture, I will do the masonry and the architecture.' Cheval would haul his findings to a site in Hauterives every day after work, and thus began the ambitious 33 year project, completed with no outside help. The dedicated builder would often have to work well into the night, by the light of an oil lamp, but that didn't deter him from his mission. Cheval would construct the palace at night, after work, by the light of oil lamps. In 1969, André Malraux, the Minister of Culture, declared the Palais a cultural landmark and had it officially protected . The website for the palace states it was built with no architectural rules and is regarded as a great example of outsider artwork . Due to the long hours of the project, the widower left his son in the care of godparents, in order to be able to focus his energies on his work. The outer walls, measuring 24 metres in length, and 10 metres high, took 22 years to complete, with Cheval binding the stones together with lime, mortar and cement. Le Palais idéal is as intricate as it is vast, and includes sculptures of exotic animals and mythical creatures, which were inspired by the postcards he delivered, and with influences from Christianity and Hinduism. The structure is beloved by visitors today, 100 years after it was constructed, and was even featured on the french stamp in 1986 . When Cheval died, he requested that he could be buried at the palace. Sadly it was not permitted and the talented constructor ended up building his own mausoleum for himself in the cemetery where he was buried after his death in 1924, a year after finishing the palace. The structure is beloved by visitors today, 100 years after it was constructed, and was even featured on the french stamp in 1986. Perhaps most poignant explanation for the architectural wonder is the inscription carved into the palace by Cheval: 'The dream of one man.'","Rural postman Ferdinand Cheval collected stones in a wheelbarrow during his 18-mile post route .

"Ivanka Trump has shared another picture-perfect snap from her family vacation in Aspen, this time of herself and her seven-year-old niece Kai Madison. Just hours after posting an image of her adorable three-year-old daughter Arabella building her first snowman, the 33-year-old heiress took to Instagram again to express her pride at Kai's impressive skiing skills. 'I'm so proud of my niece Kai for carving up the mountain today! #LittleShredder' she commented alongside an image of the duo posing atop an Aspen mountain in their full ski gear. Scroll down for video . Little shredder: Ivanka Trump posted this image of herself with her seven-year-old niece Kai on Monday afternoon, after the pair spent the day 'carving up the mountain' together . Family affair: Ivanka's older brother Donald Trump Jr (L), tweeted this image of himself and his wife Vanessa (C), taking their nine-month-old daughter Chloe (R) on her first ever gondola ride . Kai is the eldest child of Ivanka's older brother Donald Trump Jr and his wife Vanessa. The two siblings are currently enjoying a spring break getaway together with both of their families, including Ivanka's children - Arabella, three, and Joseph, one - and Donald's five children - Kai, Donald John III, six, Tristan, three, Spencer, two, and Chloe, who is just nine-months-old. Earlier this week, Donald shared a snap of his youngest child Chloe enjoying her first ever gondola ride, explaining to his Twitter followers that the tot was a 'ski bum in the making'. 'Chloe's first gondola ride with @MrsVanessaTrump #Aspen ski bum in the making,' he commented alongside the image of himself, wife Vanessa and Chloe. The 37-year-old businessman added: 'Après ski ain't what it used to be!' Over the weekend, Ivanka took a break from the slopes in order to help her daughter build her very first snowman yesterday during their family vacation in Aspen – and, unsurprisingly, Arabella chose to name her snowy creation after a character from Frozen. The 33-year-old businesswoman shared an image of her precious daughter decorating her masterpiece with pine cones while she kept warm in a bright fuchsia snow suit and a knit hat topped with a pom pom, while commenting that the process of creating the snowman wasn't as easy as she thought it would be. Magical moment: Ivanka, 33, snapped this photo of her three-year-old daughter Arabella making her first snowman on Sunday, which she named after the Frozen character Olaf . Disney inspired: Last summer, Arabella had a Frozen-themed birthday party where she dressed as Elsa . 'Making a snowman was much harder than I expected! Alas... meet Olaf (big surprise on the name selected). Arabella's very first snowman!' she captioned the Instagram photo yesterday. Nearly 10,000 people commented on the snapshot of Arabella's smiling face, with one fan writing: 'Family and cousin bonding in Aspen... can't get any better than that. Love the pine cone placement.' Another person praised Ivanka's parenting style, saying: 'She is just so pretty. I admire the hands-on mom that you are.' This isn’t the first time that Arabella’s fondness for the hit Disney movie Frozen has been documented on her mother’s Instagram account; last summer, the mother-of-two threw her daughter a Frozen-themed birthday party, posting a picture of the youngster posing in front of a Frozen-themed cake, while wearing a Princess Elsa costume. Last week, the dedicated mother-of-two skipped a session at the gym in favor of indulging in a unique 'spin' session with her two children at home. Ivanka shared two images of herself spinning Arabella and her one-year-old son Joseph around in an office chair, commenting on the Instagram snap that the trio's playtime session was serving as her morning workout. Work those arms! Ivanka Trump spent last Thursday morning playing around with her two children, rather than opting for a session at the gym . Throwback: Ivanka shared this childhood image of herself enjoying a skiing session with her mother Ivana . 'Nothing like a morning spin session to get my day started right!' she wrote, before adding: 'Their adorable squealing was the best part!' The adorable photos, which were uploaded as one collage, have already received numerous comments from Ivanka's followers, with many praising the busy mom for her ability to balance her work life with having fun at home. 'My new role model lol. Bad a** hot business woman like me (sic),' one person wrote. Another added: 'You are a great role model for so many young women! Thank you!' And it seems that the fun picture may have made Ivanka feel a bit nostalgic; just a few hours after sharing the image with her 500,000 followers, the former model posted one of her own childhood snaps, apparently taken on one of the Trump family's skiing vacations. 'This picture makes me smile - some of my favorite childhood memories took place on the slopes,' she commented on the throwback picture, which shows her as a young girl enjoying a session on the slopes alongside her mother Ivana. Happy families: Ivanka has been married to real estate investor Jared Kushner (pictured with their children) for four years . She then added: 'In honor of next week's family vacation to #Aspen, this #TBT features my first (and favorite!) ski instructor. #thanksmom #familyvacation' No doubt the family's holiday will continue to provide plenty of material for Ivanka's Instagram account, which regularly features candid snaps of her two children - and their father, Ivanka's husband of four years, Jared Kushner. Earlier this month, Ivanka spoke with Vogue magazine about how her decision to convert to Judaism has actually helped her to spend more quality time with her two children. 'I really find that with Judaism, it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity,' she told the magazine. 'We observe the Sabbath. From Friday to Saturday we don’t do anything but hang out with one another. We don’t make phone calls.' Ivanka added that turning her phone off for 25 hours is something  her children have really learned to appreciate as well. 'For Arabella to know that she has me, undivided, one day a week? We don’t do anything except play with each other, hang out with one another [and] go on walks together. Pure family,' she said.","Kai Madison is the eldest child of Ivanka's older brother Donald Trump Jr and his wife Vanessa .

"Two neighbouring ancient craters thought to be have been formed by the same impact event are now thought to have been created by two separate asteroids. The extremely unlikely formation theory was reached after scientists re-analysed rocks at the site, and found dates for the two were vastly different. While both had been thought to be 285 million years old, it now appears one of the craters is actually 450 million years old but, by chance, was created in almost exactly the same spot. Scroll down for video . The two Clearwater Lake craters in Canada may not have been formed by a binary asteroid. Its thought the East crater asteroid impacted a marine environment during the Ordovician period, 490 million years ago. The West crater was created in the Permian period 285 million years ago and impacted the landmass Pangaea . Researchers from the University of Western Australia say the Clearwater lakes in Canada were formed by two separate events in a 'pure coincidence'. The remarkable finding, if confirmed, has important implications for other so-called 'doublet' craters in the solar system, previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time. And the huge difference in time between the two events is even more amazing as, at the time the first crater was made, the location of the second was underwater. The research was published in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta and reported by Astrobiology Magazine. Impacts that leave behind a 62-mile (100km) diameter crater or less, such as those that struck the Clearwater lakes, are widely thought to have no global effects. In fact, impacts can even increase biodiversity. For example, the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, which saw an explosion in the number of animal species around 470 million years ago, has been linked to frequent impact events at the time. This is possibly due to the fact that an impact could disrupt local life just enough to let another species dominate, or because slowly cooling craters can provide habitats for life. Even if the Clearwater Lakes impacts were caused by a double impact, the extra energy released by two bodies smashing into the Earth simultaneously would have had no significant effect on life. While the fireball and earthquake would have decimated any life within a few hundred kilometers, the impacts were not big enough to cause much chaos on a global scale. The Clearwater lakes in Canada are a pair of lakes labelled as West and East. The smaller eastern crater is about 16 miles (26km) in diameter, while the western crater is about 22 miles (36km). In the original theory, a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago. But the researchers say the original methods used to date the East lake, by measuring amounts of argon-40, were inaccurate. Upon analysing new samples at the site, they found a maximum age of 460 million years, far older than the West Clearwater Lake, which is 285 million years old. 'The close spatial arrangement of the two Clearwater Lakes is most likely pure coincidence,' the researchers wrote in their paper. A similar figure was reached by researchers in 1990 by a separate research team, but at the time the findings were dismissed as incorrect due to a supposed contamination from excess argon. But with four different rock samples from various parts of the lake now studied, the researchers say it is highly unlikely they would all yield the same false age. 'We think that the accurate age for the East Clearwater crater was, in fact, already measured back in 1990,' said geologist and lead author Dr Martin Schmieder of the university. The smaller eastern crater is about 16 miles (26km) in diameter, while the western crater is about 22 miles (36km). In the original theory, a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago, but that is now believed to be inaccurate . The remarkable finding, if confirmed, has important implications for other so-called 'doublet' craters in the solar system, previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time. Shown is a map of the location of the Clearwater Lakes . It's unlikely that the event that formed the Clearwater Lakes had any significant impact on life. Even if the Clearwater Lakes impacts were caused by a double impact, the extra energy released by two bodies smashing into the Earth simultaneously would have had no significant effect on life . Further evidence for the latest findings comes from the amount of chlorine in the two craters. This part of Canada - referred to as Laurentia - had less land 460 million years ago than it did 285 million years ago, when waters receded, forming the landmass called Pangaea. The rocks from the East crater have more chlorine than the West crater, suggesting they formed on a coastline when water was still abundant in the area. Despite the fact that it is statistically very unlikely for the two craters to have been formed in two separate impact events, the new evidence unearthed by the team shows that in this case the more unlikely scenario is true. 'Overall, the doublet theory has been so compellingly advocated over the decades that alternative scenarios seem to have been abandoned,' said Dr Schmieder. 'In our view, there is a whole line of geologic evidence that argues against the double impact.'","Two craters in Canada may not have been formed by a binary asteroid .
The Clearwater Lakes were thought to have both formed 285m years ago .
But analysis of rocks suggests the East lake is much older .
It is thought to have been created separately 460 million years ago .

"British parents are choosing increasingly unusual names for their children - including Dior, Daiquiri, Hiya and Reem. National records for 2014 show thousands of babies are now the only person in the country to have their name. The trend for calling youngsters something completely unique has led to some bizarre examples, such as Godstreasure, Diamond-Leigh and Spartacus. Babies in the UK are increasingly being given unique names including Neymar, Dior, Reem and Daiquiri (file picture) The number of unique names chosen last year  topped 4,800 and accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total number of names. Those chosen for boys included Alp, Daily, Egor, Kasper, Lake, Scout and Sherlock. A boy was also called just the letter 'M' while others were named Papa and Spurgeon. The names of footballers also proved popular with one boy being called Neymar after the Brazilian Barcelona player and others called Strachan, Pirlo and Zola. Girls' names included Hiya, Ariel, Fox and Prayer. Eight girls were called Valentina, seven were called Crystal and five were named Monroe. Place names also proved popular with boys called London, a girl called Camden and four girls called Paisley. Musicians also featured with four girls called Rihanna, a boy called Presley and two girls each called Lulu and Shakira. Responding to the announcement of names in Scotland, parenting groups said mums and dads often gave children unusual names to make them feel special, but warned some of the names could give rise to problems in later life. Records show the trend for one-off names led to more than 4,800 unique children's names last year . Lisa Penney, of Bounty, the UK's largest parenting club, said: 'Celebrities like the Beckhams are renowned for choosing unusual names for their off-spring and today's parents are quick to follow a trend in a bid to make sure their choice of baby names stands out from the crowd. 'But baby name trends can change quickly and names that first seem unusual can quickly become common in the classroom. 'Just a couple of years ago Ava and Isla were pretty uncommon as a baby girl's name, yet now they regularly feature in the top ten. 'Likewise for boys, a decade ago the names Jacob and Noah were rarely considered, but nowadays parents look beyond previously traditional biblical names like Matthew, Luke and Adam. 'Whilst certain baby names can quickly rise to fame they can just as easily fall from favour. Take Tilly, Lexi and Lacey for example, now that they are more common in classrooms across the country they no longer make the grade for new parents who want a name that no other child is likely to have in the playground.' A list of the top 100 names for boys and girls was published in December, showing Jack and Emily were the most popular.","Study of records shows boom in parents giving youngster's unique names .

'This is about protecting the intellectual rights of people who have ideas. 'This applies to fashion, music, design . . . anything.'

Explaining that 'everything that's around you in a room' was inspired by something or someone else, he said: 'If you kill that, there's no creativity.' He said he and Thicke were considering their 'next steps', but declining to comment on whether or not they would appeal against the verdict. Robin Thicke (left) and Pharrell Williams (right) were ordered to pay $7.4million after a jury ruled that their hit Blurred Lines copied elements of Marvin Gaye's (pictured center) 1977 song Got To Give It Up . Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013 and it sold more than seven million tracks in the United States. Pictured, the wildly popular music video starring model Emily Ratajkowski . Marvin Gaye's family filed an injunction in court on Tuesday that could end the sale and distribution of 'Blurred Lines' - the wildly successful song that they claim was ripped off of Gaye's 1977 hit. The injunction by Nona Gaye, Frankie Gaye and Marvin Gaye III would prevent the copying, distributing and performing of the hit single, which sold millions worldwide and also featured T.I. Pharrell and Thicke were ordered to pay nearly $7.4million to the three children after a jury determined last week that Blurred Lines copied elements of Gaye's song. Gaye's family also sought Tuesday to amend the verdict to include rapper T.I. - whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr - as well as labels Universal Music, Interscope Records and Star Trak Entertainment. The injunction against Blurred Lines could give Gaye's family leverage to negotiate for royalties and other concessions, such as songwriting credits. The family said in a statement released Wednesday: 'With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist. Pharrell (pictured performing with Thicke and T.I.) said the judgement would stifle creativity in the industry . Marvin Gaye's (pictured) family have filed an injunction that could end the sale and distribution of Blurred Lines . 'It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued.' The children claim the lawsuit could have been avoided if Thicke and Pharrell had spoken with the family before the song was released, The Wrap reported. The family said: 'Like most artists, they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage. 'This did not happen. We would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work. 'This also did not happen.' Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013.

"David Duckenfield admitted calling for police dogs instead of ambulances as fans were being crushed to death . The police chief on duty during the Hillsborough disaster has admitted calling for police dogs instead of ambulances as fans were being crushed to death. But David Duckenfield denied his mindset was focused on hooliganism rather than safety at the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans during the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989. The retired officer,  70, has already made a series of admissions about 'mistakes' he made, confessed that he lied in the aftermath and apologised 'unreservedly' to fans' families. He said he initially thought the problem was crowd disorder and only realised it was a 'medical emergency at 3.04pm' - 12 minutes after the crush started on the terrace. But at that time transcripts of tape recordings made in the police control box where the match commander was stationed showed a subordinate officer calling for police dogs. Rajiv Menon QC, representing families of the victims, said: 'You must have asked him to do this. It's a medical emergency. Can you explain that? Why on earth do you need dogs at the stadium?' Mr Duckenfield said he had 'no idea' other than he wanted to create a 'secure area' for the rescue operation. Mr Menon asked: 'So dogs requested, ambulances yet to be requested. Correct?' The witness replied: 'It would appear so.' At 3.06pm Mr Duckenfield called for operational support, a request for all available officers in the force area to go to the stadium. Mr Menon asked: 'Why more manpower?', to which Duckenfield replied: 'To help the rescue.' The QC representing the families said responded: 'What rescue? You have yet to call for ambulances or fire crews.' The inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend Hillsborough was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back-up from dog-handlers. On the day of the disaster, police became overwhelmed by fans at the turnstiles as kick-off approached and Mr Duckenfield gave the order at 2.52pm to open gates to let them in. Around 2,000 fans poured in through Gate C, many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them. But Mr Duckenfield, as match commander, had not ordered this to be closed, which was a 'blunder of the first magnitude', the inquest jury heard. The tunnel led directly to the already-full central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace. Some 96 Liverpool fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded Leppings Lane terrace . Around 2,000 fans poured in through Gate C (pictured), many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them, which had not been closed off by police . Ninety-six Liverpool fans died in the ensuing crush minutes later on the terraces of Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest kicked off. Mr Menon said police records did not record Duckenfield declaring a major incident, which would have triggered a disaster rescue plan by emergency services. Mr Duckenfield insisted he had done so and there was an 'omission' in the records. Jurors were also told that an officer at the scene of the disaster made a call at 3.13pm for fire crews equipped with cutting gear to attend the scene. Mr Menon pointed out to Mr Duckenfield that the request for fire service assistance came up to eight minutes after the semi-final was halted. Mr Duckenfield agreed that the eight minutes represented a 'serious amount of time' lost in the effort to save lives but said he was making decisions in a 'very critical' situation. During the closing minutes of his questioning of the retired officer, Mr Menon asked him if he felt it necessary to be present on the pitch. Mr Duckenfield replied: 'Not at all. The incident commander remains in the control room because if I am not in the control room I can't make decisions.' The inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend Hillsborough was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back-up from dog-handlers . Accusing Mr Duckenfield of showing little, if any, organisation or control while in the control box, Mr Menon asked the witness: 'Your leadership and co-ordination and emergency response was woefully inadequate from start to finish?' Mr Duckenfield answered: 'I disagree, sir.' Rejecting claims that he was involved in 'building' South Yorkshire Police's case that drunken fans caused the disaster, the former policeman said: 'After the disaster I was marginalised and I took no part in anything like that at all.' Mr Menon then asserted: 'Your mistake (in failing to foresee where fans would go or close the tunnel) was the most terrifyingly bad mistake that fell woefully below the standard to be expected of a reasonably competent match commander, wasn't it?' Mr Duckenfield responded: 'Sir, I have made my admissions, I take it no further.' Mr Menon continued: 'It was gross negligence and ultimately it caused the disaster and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, didn't it?' Mr Duckenfield answered: 'No, sir. My view is it was an oversight, a mistake.' At an earlier hearing he told the jury he was a Freemason at the time of the accident, but said he hoped that was not a factor in his promotion to the position of chief superintendent. He denied taking part in a 'cover-up' designed to divert blame from the police by ascribing the disaster to Liverpool fans' bad behaviour. The former officer also admitted he was 'possibly in denial' over his misleading statement that a gate had been forced open by fans, leading to a deadly crush on the terraces of the Sheffield stadium.

"It has found the 'God particle', and could soon reveal a mysterious force known as 'dark matter'. But when it turns on next week, some scientists are betting the Large Hadron Collider will detect something just as exciting; a parallel universe. This is according to a new study that claims miniature black holes - a key sign of a 'multiverse' - could be detected in Cern's LHC in Geneva. Scroll down for video . It has found the 'God particle', and could soon reveal a mysterious force known as 'dark matter'.But when it turns on next week, some scientists are betting the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva will detect something even more exciting; a parallel universe . The Rainbow Gravity theory suggests that gravity's effect on the cosmos causes different wavelengths of light to behave differently. This means that particles with different energies will move in space-times and gravitational fields differently. The theory was proposed 10 years ago in an attempt to reconcile difference between the theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics. One consequence of rainbow gravity is that our universe stretches back into time infinitely with no singular point where it started. 'Just as many parallel sheets of paper, which are two dimensional objects (breath and length) can exist in a third dimension (height), parallel universes can also exist in higher dimensions' Mir Faizal from the University of Waterloo told Dailymail.com. 'We predict that gravity can leak into extra dimensions, and if it does, then miniature black holes can be produced at the LHC.' Professor Faizal and his team have calculated the energy at which they expect to detect these mini black holes in gravity's rainbow, according to a report by Lisa Zyga at Phys.org. 'If we do detect mini black holes at this energy, then we will know that both gravity's rainbow and extra dimensions are correct,' added Professor Faizal. When it's activated, the energy with which the LHC smashes particles together will be twice what it was during the time when it made the discovery of the Higgs boson. Billions of particles flying off from each LHC collision are tracked at Cern detectors to establish when and how they come together and what shapes they take. The Cern theoreticians say this could give clear signs of dimensions beyond length, breadth, depth and time. At such high energy gravity many be even tracked disappearing into them. Parallel universes can exist within these dimensions, the thinking goes, but only gravity can leave our universe into these extra dimensions. If extra dimensions do exist, the study suggests that they would lower the energy required to produce black holes which the LHC could pick. Professor Faizal suggests the reason these black holes have yet to be detected is because our current model of gravity gets modified at very high energies. According to Phys.org, in the latest study, the new theory of gravity's rainbow has been used to account for why the LHC has not yet found tiny black holes. The new theory of gravity's rainbow has been used to account for why the LHC has not yet found tiny black holes. Einstein's theory of relativity states that gravity is caused by space and time curving. Gravity's rainbow says that space and time curve differently for particles of different energy . Einstein's theory of relativity states that gravity is caused by space and time curving. Gravity's rainbow says that space and time curve differently for particles of different energy. So, gravity's rainbow suggests that gravity's effect on the cosmos causes different wavelengths of light to behave differently. This means that particles with different energies will move in space-times and gravitational fields differently. Using gravity's rainbow, the scientists found that more energy is required to detect mini black holes at the LHC than previously thought. So far, the LHC has searched for mini black holes at energy levels below 5.3 TeV. But the latest study says this is too low. Instead, the model predicts that black holes may form at energy levels of at least 9.5 TeV in six dimensions and 11.9 TeV in 10 dimensions. If mini black holes are detected at the LHC at the predicted energies, not only will it prove the existence of extra dimensions and by extension parallel universes, said Ahmed Farag Ali from Florida State University. 'If black holes are not detected at the predicted energy levels, this would mean one of three possibilities,' Mohammed Khalil explained to Phys.Org . 'One, extra dimensions do not exist. Two, they exist, but they are smaller than expected. Or three, the parameters of gravity's rainbow need to be modified.' The holographic model suggests gravity in the universe comes from thin, vibrating strings. These strings are holograms of events that take place in a simpler, flatter cosmos . The universe is a hologram and everything you can see - including this article and the device you are reading it on - is a mere projection. This is according to a controversial model proposed in 1997 by theoretical physicist Juan Maldacena. Until now the bizarre theory had never been tested, but recent mathematical models suggest that the mind-boggling principle could be true. According to the theory, gravity in the universe comes from thin, vibrating strings. These strings are holograms of events that take place in a simpler, flatter cosmos. Professor Maldacena's model suggests that the universe exists in nine dimensions of space, and one of time. In December, Japanese researchers attempted to tackle this problem by providing mathematical evidence that the holographic principle might be correct. The holographic principle suggests that, like the security chip on a credit card for example, there is a two-dimensional surface that contains all the information needed to describe a three-dimensional object - which in this case is our universe. In essence, the principle claims that data containing a description of a volume of space - such as a human or a comet - could be hidden in a region of this flattened, 'real' version of the universe. In a black hole, for instance, all the objects that ever fall into it would be entirely contained in surface fluctuations. This means that the objects would be stored almost as 'memory' or fragment of data rather than a physical object in existence.","Scientists predict gravity can sometimes leak into an extra dimension .

"Former member of 'The Real Housewives of Miami' cast Ana Quincoces was arrested Sunday in Key Largo for driving with a suspended license - an incident she blamed on a cockroach infestation at a friend’s home. But a 911 call from an earlier incident involving Quincoces suggests that unrequited love may have set her on the path to jail. The 50-year-old lawyer and cookbook author from Coral Gables was pulled over in her Subaru SUV by a Monroe County sheriff's deputy at mile marker 99 on US 1 at around 3.40am. Busted: Former member of 'The Real Housewives of Miami' cast Ana Quincoces, 50, (pictured left in her mugshot) was arrested Sunday in Key Largo for driving with a suspended license . TV star: Quincoces (second from left) starred on Season 2 of the Bravo reality TV show in 2012 . The officer wrote in the incident report, cited by Keys Info Net, that he stopped Quincoces because he recognized her from a previous encounter that took place just hours earlier. Police responding to a ‘disturbance call’ on Bahama Avenue confronted Ms Quincoces and informed her that her license had been suspended indefinitely February 9 and 'she was not to drive.' In the early hours of Sunday morning, the same deputy stopped Quincoces outside the Courtyard by Marriot Hotel in Key Largo and demanded to know why she was driving after being explicitly told not to get behind the wheel. The reality TV star was taken to the Plantation Key jail on a misdemeanor charge of driving with a suspended license and released just after 5am on her own recognizance. Quincoces starred on Season 2 of the Bravo reality TV show in 2012 and also made several appearances on the program in 2011 and 2013. Multi-talented: Quincoces, a lawyer by trade, pictured here last October at a charity event in Miami, is also a chef and cookbook author . Roach phobia: Quincoces said the house where she was staying turned out to be infested with cockroaches, which prompted her to get in her car and head home . On Monday, the 50-year-old 'Real Housewives' alum explained to Keysnet.com that she was staying at a house in Key Largo, which had been listed by a realtor friend, but discovered that it was crawling with cockroaches. Desperate to get away from the critters, she got in her car and set out for home in Coral Gables. Quincoces claimed she ‘didn’t realize’ her license was suspended, even though deputies warned her she was not allowed to drive just hours earlier. The lawyer-turned-chef chalked up the entire incident to an ‘administrative glitch’ and accused police of being ‘overzealous.’ But according to the celebrity blog Gossip Extra, it all started hours earlier when Ana Quincoces drove down to Key Largo and barged into her ex-boyfriend’s home searching for his new girlfriend. A 911 call placed by the homeowner allegedly picked up a shouting match between Quincoces, her former lover and his new flame. Bad romance: An earlier 911 call placed by her former boyfriend suggests that Quincoces showed up on his doorstep drunk and demanded to meet his new girlfriend . Quincoces was reportedly heard yelling in the background that she came all this way after a night of drinking and had no intention of going anywhere. The man repeatedly tried to convince Quincoces to leave, at one point telling her: 'I don’t want you here, I’m through with you!' The 911 call concluded with the arrival of deputies. Quincoces’ ex declined to press charges against her, but because the jilted woman appeared drunk, the responding officers seized her license and ordered her not to drive.","Ana Quincoces, 50, was pulled over in Key Largo Sunday for driving with suspended license .

"The wife of a passenger on missing the MH370 flight plane has spoken of her heartache, revealing she is still desperate for answers a year after the airliner vanished. It has been 12 months to the day since Perth father Paul Weeks boarded the Beijing-bound flight in Kuala Lumpur and his wife Danica Weeks is still at a loss about what to tell her young boys - and where their beloved father has gone. Ms Weeks said despite being advised by people that she needs to tell Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 2, what happened to him, she refuses to lie to their sons and will wait until the truth is discovered. Scroll down for video . Danica Weeks doesn't know what to say to her sons Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 2 about where their daddy has gone . Paul Weeks boarded the MH370 flight a year ago . 'People say you've got to tell them the truth and I say ""do you?"" because I don't and I'm not going to put them through what I think it is then it turns out to be something completely different – and I will choose to tell them,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald. Ms Weeks described the past year as 'surreal' and a 'blur' without being able to see, or even say farewell, to her 'best friend'. 'I'm just this housewife wanting her amazing husband. He did so much for us as a family and he would do exactly the same if he was in my shoes – he would want to bring us home – and I'll do it for him, he deserves it,' she said. Her mining engineer husband, who was on his way to start a new job in Mongolia when the plane inexplicably vanished, gave her his wedding ring when they said their goodbyes at the airport on Marhc 8, 2014. Ms Weeks said she could not have survived the trauma of the past 12 months if it wasn't for the support of the Western Australian community. She added that it has been impossible to begin the mourning process and even think about moving on. 'Even for the children, we haven't even had a memorial or had a chance to say our goodbyes,' she said. '[Since MH370] There have been two plane crashes and they get the bodies home – we don't even get a piece of the plane.' This comes as China's Foreign minister vowed to never give up looking for the plane while Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the search can't go on forever. Other officials said discussions were already under way between countries involved in the search as to whether to call off the hunt in coming weeks. Mr Weeks gave his wife (right) his wedding ring (left) before boarding the MH370 flight . Officials said discussions were already under way between the countries as to whether to call off the hunt within weeks for the missing plane . As his country said prayers on Sunday for those who were on board the missing flight, Malaysia's Prime Minister said no words could describe their pain. 'The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear,' said Mr Najib Razak. 'No words can describe the pain the families of those on board are going through.' China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, said in Beijing that the search for the Malaysia Airlines flight which vanished one year ago today will not stop. 'The search for MH370 will continue,' said Mr Wang, echoing the previously-spoken commitment of the countries involved in the hunt for the aircraft - Australia, Malaysia and China - in the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak (left) said no words could describe the country's pain, whilst Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) called it 'one of the great mysteries of the 21st century' Ms Weeks says she refuses to lie to their sons and will wait until the truth is discovered . While China and Malaysia vow to search for as long as it takes to find the aircraft . In Kuala Lumpur, Mr Najib spoke of the joint effort, adding in his official statement that 'together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists. 'Malaysia remains committed to the search and hopeful that MH370 will be found.' Although Mr Abbott said he was confident the aircraft would be found as 40 per cent of 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australian had been scrutinised and another 60,000sq km to be covered if necessary, he added that the search had to end at some stage. 'It is one of the great mysteries of the 21st century and I know that there will be a nagging doubt in the minds of billions of people until such time as we can find that plane,' he told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. 'It can't go on forever but, as long as there are reasonable leads, the search will go on.'","It has been 12 months to the day since flight MH370 disappeared while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Bejing and it still remains a mystery .

"Identical twin sisters have been sentenced to 30 years in jail after admitting to the brutal murder of their mother four years ago. Jasmiyah and Tasmiyah Whitehead were 16 when they stabbed their mother, Jarmecca Whitehead, 34, so violently that they severed her spinal cord. She also suffered stab wounds to her lungs, jugular and the back of her neck. The twins turned on their mother after getting into an argument on January 13, 2010, at their home in Conyers, Georgia, after getting up late for school. 11alive said the 21-year-old sisters recounted chilling details of the knife attack in recent taped confessions, revealing that their mother told her daughters she hated them as she bled to death in the bathtub. Tasimyah Whitehead (pictured left) and identical twin sister Jasmiyah were sentenced to 30 years in prison after admitting to the brutal murder of their murder in January 2010 . The twins turned on their mother after getting into an argument on January 13, 2010, at their home in Conyers, Georgia, after getting up late for school . 'My state of mind at the time was defend yourself. It wasn't like a fight on the street, it was more like a fight until somebody dies,' said Jasmiyah during the interview. The twins told prosecutors they had gotten into a verbal argument with their mother that morning who was holding a pot at the time to threaten them. As the twins tried to take the pot away from their mother, the fight became  violent. During her filmed statement, Jasmiyah said: 'We all yelling, we all mad. Somehow, someway I don't know where she got it from, I don't even remember a knife block but she has a knife.' Jasmiyah admitted she broke a vase over her mother's head while Tasmiyah grabbed the pot and hit her with it. In the chaos, the knife ended up being held by Tasmiyah who stabbed her mother as her twin strangled her with a ribbon. Jasmiyah then took the knife and continued to stab her. The twins carried their injured mother to the bathtub which was filled with water. The twins  told police that they discovered the blood-soaked crime scene when they came home from school in January 2010 . Jarmecca Whitehead, 34, (left) had her spinal cord severed in the brutal attack by her two then 16-year-old daughters at their home . As she lay dying, her daughters watched and the mother told them she hated them,11alive reported. The twins watched their mother sink below the surface and knew that she was dead, they said in statements. After the murder, the girls collected their mom's purse and phone along with the pot and knife in a plastic bag, and then went to school. It wasn't until later that day that the girls summoned a Rockdale County Sheriff's deputy who was driving by their home. He found the victim submerged in the bathtub. The officer said at the time that he could 'smell the blood' in the air at the home. The teens lied and said they found their mother dead. Police initially treated them as victims but found that the 16-year-olds had cuts and bite marks, implicating their involvement in a vicious fight. Both girls originally pleaded not guilty when they were arrested and charged four months later. The twins both expressed regret that they had not called the police and helped their injured mother. The twins initially told the police that someone had killed their mother until their bodies were discovered wit cuts and bite marks . The family had a violent history prior before the fight which escalated to murder. Their mother had accused her daughters of smoking pot and being sexually active while they in turn had accused her of using illegal drugs. The twins got in a fight with their mother  in 2008 and were forced by a juvenile court to live with their great-grandmother, Della Frasier. They moved back with their mother a week before the murder. The twins had told a counselor that if forced to go back to their mother's home they would kill her, according to a prosecutor last year. Jarmecca Whitehead's mother , Lydia Whitehead, told the court in 2014 that she was heartbroken over her daughter's death but that she loves and forgave the twins. 'Unfortunately, my grandchildren never learned right from wrong … and that’s why we are here,' she said. 'They should be in college, not sitting somewhere in jail.'

"Thoughts of Australia's 2019 World Cup campaign were in the forefront of Michael Clarke's mind when the captain decided to end his one-day career. Clarke has announced that Sunday's trans-Tasman World Cup decider will be his final One Day International. The 33-year-old reached closure on the decision upon realising there was no chance he'd still be leading the side in four years. Steve Smith is yet to be confirmed as Clarke's successor. Scroll down for video . Captain Michael Clarke announces his retirement from his one-day career after the Cricket World Cup final . However, that is expected to happen soon given Smith became Australia's third youngest Test captain during summer when Clarke was injured. Clarke suggested it wasn't fair to talk about who would takeover, but that it was important they had four years to mould the ODI side. 'I was very fortunate four years ago to get the opportunity to captain this one-day team and that was really good preparation for this World Cup,' Clarke said. 'The next Australian captain deserves the same opportunity. 'It really helped me having that preparation ... to build my own team and set my own style up as a captain.'

Clarke arrives for a press conference before his team's training session for the Cricket World Cup final . Clarke had been thinking about the decision for some time but only made his mind up after returning home from last Thursday's semi-final against India. 'I think I got back to my house at about 12.30, (wife) Kyly was in bed and that's when I spoke to her about it,' he said. 'I told my teammates 10 minutes ago. I told the selectors and (Cricket Australia boss) James Sutherland about an hour ago. 'There's no doubt I could keep playing (ODI cricket) for the next couple of years .. but I know I've made the right decision.'

Clarke signals to his bench during the 2015 Cricket World Cup Semi Final match between Australia and India . Clarke will continue to play Test cricket. 'I'm hopeful it will prolong my Test career and that's a priority for me,' he said. 'I don't feel bad about saying I feel that Test cricket is the toughest part of our game. 'I see it as the pinnacle ... I feel like I've still got a lot to offer the Australian Test team as captain.' Sutherland was full of praise for Clarke, adding that his decision came as 'something of a surprise'. 'Michael leaves one-day cricket on his own terms, aiming to finish on an absolute high, in front of a packed MCG as a possible World Cup-winning captain,' Sutherland said. 'Regardless of the result, he will leave the one-day international game as one our greats.' Sunday's title decider will be Clarke's 245th ODI, ending a stellar career that started in 2003 and has netted 7907 runs at an average of 44.42. Only Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Mark Waugh have scored more ODI runs for Australia.","Aussie skipper Michael Clarke has announced his one-day career .

"This video shows the shocking moment an Uber driver threw a man to the ground 'in self-defence' during a brawl on the streets of central London. The taxi driver, wearing a black coat and white cap, can be seen grappling with a man next to his white car, with the driver door wide open. As the man wearing a beige jacket, who is believed to be a member of the public, throws punches at the cabbie, the driver suddenly picks him up and slams him to the ground. Shocking: An Uber driver (wearing black) was seen grappling with a member of the public in central London . Apparently in 'self-defence', the driver picks up the man and throws him to the ground on Shaftesbury Avenue . As onlookers shout out of shot, the man gets to his feet and dusts himself off before kicking the driver in the shin. At this point people intervene to stop the brawl, which happened on Shaftesbury Avenue in Soho, central London, on Wednesday evening. The driver, who works for Uber, claims he was on his way to a job when the man pulled open the driver-side door as he was waiting to allow pedestrians across the road. A spokesman for Uber, which allows people to book cabs using a mobile app, said the driver did not have a passenger in his car at the time. She said: 'The driver was not on a job - he was heading to go to collect someone. 'He was stopped waiting for pedestrians [to cross in front of him] and while he was stopped someone ripped open the car door - so he was defending himself. 'We’re shocked to hear that an Uber partner driver was attacked in Soho. We are offering our full support to the driver who has gone to the police to report the incident. Thankfully the driver in question, whilst shaken up, is unharmed.' After being thrown to the ground, the man gets to his feet and dusts himself off before kicking the driver . The scuffle happened near Shaftesbury Avenue, known for its theatres, on Monday evening . The video was taken by black cab driver Hassan Mostafa, who was dropping off a passenger nearby at the time. He said: 'I looked and saw the Uber car and a man shouting. I knew something was happening, . 'I started recording and the man came out of the car. Then he and a guy started fighting. 'At that point I had to drive off and later I saw police at the scene.' The Uber driver was called into the firm's London offices on Thursday morning and later went to report the incident to the police. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they were aware of the video and that officers spoke to two men in the Shaftesbury Avenue area on Monday night. No arrests have been made.","Video shows Uber driver and pedestrian grappling in central London street .

"From machine parts and houses to replacement organs, humans look set to be able to create almost anything using 3D printers in years to come. And Will.i.am believes we could even be 3D printing entire people in ‘our lifetime’. The musician and entrepreneur believes the surge in printing technology will shortly make this incredible feat possible and has called for ‘new morals, new laws and new codes’ to govern the technology. Musicians and entrepreneur Will.i.am believes we could even be 3D printing whole people in ‘our lifetime’. He called for ‘new morals, new laws and new codes’ to govern the technology, while unveiling an Ekocycle pop-up shop in Harrods, which uses waste material to 3D print objects (a bust is shown) and create new clothes . He told Dezeen’s Dan Howarth: ‘Eventually 3D printing will print people. I'm not saying I agree with it, I'm just saying what's fact based on plausible growth in technology.’ He believes that humans will be pushed to adhere to new responsibilities so there should be laws to protect people and force us to do the right thing. Researchers are making huge strides in printing organs using living cells and are expected to be able to print  human tissues such as a heart in less than a decade. ‘If you can print a liver or a kidney, god dang it, you're going to be able to print a whole freaking person,’ Will.i.am said. Will.i.am (pictured) described 3D printers as ‘god-like tools’ which could be used to create life and even allow teleportation one day. He believes that humans will be pushed to adhere to new responsibilities so there should be laws to protect people and force us to do the right thing . From a human ear, to perfectly functioning valves, 3D printers are already being used in medicine. Their ultimate goal is to create a new heart for a patient using their own cells that could be transplanted, but experts say it could be years or decades before such operations are regularly performed. The finished product would be called the ‘bioficial heart’ - a blend of the natural and artificial. The heart may be built from cells taken from the patient's fat. But plenty of difficulties remain, including understanding how to keep manufactured tissue alive after it is printed. Patients in the operating theatre would have some fat tissue removed and regenerative cells isolated. The cells would then be mixed with solutions and placed in the bioprinter, which prints the heart. The new organ would then be transplanted in another operation. He described 3D printers as ‘god-like tools’ which could be used to create life and even allow teleportation one day. Will.i.am made the remarks at the launch of a range of sustainable lifestyle products, including clothing, bicycles and luggage, which he created with Ecocycle – a recycling initiative with Coca-Cola. On sale at London department store, Harrods, the products are made using waste materials such as 3D-printer filament produced from recycled plastic bottles. He told The Guardian that 3D printing technology ‘will revolutionise society’ and that in 10 year’s time, everyone will have a 3D printer in their house. ‘Your friend will say: “Let’s hurry up” and you’ll go, “wait, my shoes haven’t finished printing yet.”’ Will.i.am has already unveiled a smartband called Puls, which has its own SIM card inside to replace a smartphone. US citizens can apply to buy the wearable for $399 (£264). While Will.i.am may be worried about the possibility or printing humans, Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk fear we could be wiped out by intelligent robots. A group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including the two revered men, have signed an open letter promising to ensure that AI research benefits humanity. The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind while developing technology such as speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion which could benefit people. Will.i.am launched his smartwatch, that can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone, in October last year. The Puls smartwatch boasts an array of apps, GPS and a voice-controlled personal assistant like Siri. Crucially, it includes a SIM card reader next to the battery, which is fitted into the wide wristband, to make phone calls possible. A curved touchscreen is also built into the cuff design. Will.i.am unveiled his smartwatch, which can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone, in October last year. Called The Puls, it can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone. It has a curved touch screen and a Sim card reader built into its distinctive cuff design . It has 16GB of memory, 1GB of RAM, speakers, 3G and Wi-Fi connectivity as well as GPS for maps and a pedometer and accelerometer for fitness apps. The watch runs on an Android-based operating system using a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, according to Engadget . Like Apple’s Siri, Windows’ Cortana and Google Now, the device includes a voice-controlled assistant. Called AndeedA, it is described as the ‘virtual personality and the soul of Puls’ which can be used with popular apps such as Facebook and Twitter. Will.i.am said: ‘Puls represents my passion for, and my mission to marry design and advanced technology – to create a new breed of wearable device that leapfrogs what is currently on the market. ‘…We designed AneedA from the ground up, taking her from an innovative concept to a reality. You speak, she listens. You ask, she delivers. You need something, AneedA’s ready. ‘With you at all times and incredibly capable – AneedA is the perfect virtual personal assistant.’ While the smartwatch doesn't have a heartbeat sensor like some of its rivals, it apparently detects emotions and can share these ‘vibes’ with others using an app called Vibe. A built-in music app will allow users to store music locally, as well as use a digital music service from a British company called 7digital. Because the Puls is a stand-alone gadget, it requires its own data plan. This will be available from AT&T in the US and from O2 in the UK. The cuff will come in black, white, pink and blue. While there is no news about the device in the UK yet, US citizens can now apply to purchase the Puls for $399 (£264) by joining the 'Make it Great' programme.","Will.i.am says new rules are needed to govern life-giving printers .

"It may sound like the plot of a Disney movie - but Todd the fox really does think he's a dog. The animal was tamed after being rescued as a four-month-old cub and was raised as a domestic pet by owner Emma D'Sylva. Since then the lovable fox has picked up a number of canine characteristics such as tail wagging, playing with toys and even walking on a lead. Scroll down for video . Beloved pet: Emma D'Sylva and Todd the fox, who she rescued as a cub and raised as a domestic pet . The 11-month-old animal accompanies Ms D'Sylva's pet labradors Sky and Oakley on walks, drawing double-takes from other dog-walkers when they see Todd trotting through the local park. He also sleeps in a kennel in his enclosure in the garden, plays energetically with the other dogs and even wags his tail when it's feeding time. Emma, 25, from Stanfield, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., said: 'Todd has been captive-bred so he has never been in the wild. 'I've had him since he was about four months old because his previous owners couldn't look after him any more. Canine customs: Todd enjoys going on walks, playing with dog toys and even wags his tail when he's happy . Sleeps in a kennel: The 11-month-old domesticated animal spends his nights in a plastic kennel with blankets . 'I get people coming over to me asking if he is a fox and if they can stroke him. 'He was a bit crazy when he first came to me last year but now he has a really strong bond with me and he will walk on a lead. 'He is very playful with me. He will run up to me wagging his tail when I go to feed him and he will roll over to have his belly tickled. 'He will come into the house but he has got a purpose built enclosure and he much prefers being outside. 'We got him a little plastic kennel in his enclosure with blankets which is similar to a dog bed. 'He is similar to a dog but he is a bit more hyperactive. He gets on with my two dogs, and wants to play with them all the time. Playful: The fox, pictured in the park with Ms D'Sylva, cannot be let off the lead because he is deaf . School visits: Ms D'Sylva has 40 pets and takes some of them, including Todd, into schools and care homes so that children and the elderly can interact with them . 'He tries to do what the dogs do but I can't let him off the lead because he's deaf so I can't shout him to come back. 'At first he was bonkers but he is getting more used to being in the company of other people now. 'If people or dogs come up to him in the park he will lie down at first and freeze but after a few seconds he will sniff around the dogs or sit patiently.' Todd also lives with Emma's menagerie of other creatures at her three-bedroomed house including a skunk, a raccoon, lizards and snakes. She takes some of her 40 pets into schools and care homes to enable children and the elderly to interact with a range of captive-bred animals. Emma, who lives with her partner Steve Johnson, 34, added: 'Todd went out on his first school visit the other week and the children really enjoyed stroking him while he was in my arms. Walking companions: Todd is pictured in the woods with Ms D'Sylva's two labradors Sky and Oakley . 'He's really getting used to things now and I'm looking forward to letting more and more people meet him.' An RSPCA spokesperson said there were no legal restrictions on people keeping animals and pets in England and Wales as long as they were treated well. He added: 'Foxes have not been domesticated and a fox in captivity would have the same needs as in the wild. 'Anyone who keeps these animals is under a legal obligation to meet their needs under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.'","Todd the fox tamed after being rescued as cub and raised as domestic pet .

"The Labour leadership blocked Karie Murphy (pictured), a Unite candidate, from the Labour shortlist for the marginal seat of Halifax . The tweet about Harriet Harman from a senior unnamed official at Unite, Britain’s most powerful trade union, was short and menacing: ‘She will have to answer for her actions in due course.’ The threat this week was made in response to the Labour leadership blocking Karie Murphy, a Unite candidate, from the Labour shortlist for the marginal seat of Halifax. And the reason for their fury at the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party? The list was agreed by an ad-hoc three-strong committee chaired by Harman. And that committee was given a clear instruction by Ed Miliband: block Karie Murphy at all costs. Relations between Miliband and the union were put under further strain when Linda Riordan, the retiring Halifax Labour MP, accused the party leadership of dirty tricks. She has made a formal protest to Iain McNicol, Labour’s general secretary. But the heavyweight the front bench should be really worried about is Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, who is enraged by the actions of Miliband and Harman. For he is the most powerful Left-wing union boss since miners’ leader Arthur Scargill. The snub to flame-haired Murphy, a comprehensive school-educated NHS nurse, is deeply personal to McCluskey - who was married but is no longer with his wife. McCluskey and Murphy - who is separated from her husband - are very close friends. Indeed, some people in the Labour movement have asked - rightly or wrongly - if they are more than just friends. It’s also personal for McCluskey because Harman is a member of Unite, and she presided over the blocking of their candidate. So why was the usually clueless Miliband so determined to stop Murphy? The answer is to be found far to the north of Halifax, in Falkirk, where Karie Murphy’s candidacy in the Labour selection process in 2013 triggered a vote-rigging scandal so serious the police were called in by Miliband. The result then was virtual open warfare in the party. Now, the animus is erupting again. Murphy was cleared of any wrongdoing in an internal inquiry but withdrew from the selection race. In the end, the police took no action over allegations the union had packed the local party with its own supporters, and even signed people up to vote for her without their knowledge. But the damage was done, and her Parliamentary ambitions were thwarted. After the Falkirk row, Miliband - who pointedly refused to apologise to Murphy — announced reforms to the party’s links with the unions. Furious: Len McCluskey (pictured), the general secretary of Unite, is enraged by the actions of Miliband and Harman . But that attempt at firm leadership came at a price, and the response from Unite was swift and damaging. It withheld £1.5 million from the Labour Party, which has debts of £11 million. Now, Miliband has crossed McCluskey again and — only weeks before the General Election — senior Unite officials are privately plotting how to wreak their revenge for the latest rebuff to Murphy’s parliamentary ambitions. Miliband can ill-afford to make an enemy of McCluskey and Unite, for no other modern Labour leader has had to rely so heavily on one union to ensure the financial survival of the party. Since Miliband became leader, Unite has given Labour an astonishing £14.3 million. The union has pledged a further £1.5 million for the election campaign, but may now withdraw that offer. It could also inflict huge logistical damage on the campaign. In October, the union set up Unite Activists For Labour ‘to support getting Labour back into power to prevent the Tory-led Coalition from wreaking any more damage upon the economy . . . and further attacking trade union and workers’ rights’. They are ready to launch operations in the key marginals of Cambridge, Chelmsford, Luton, Great Yarmouth — where Ukip is battling Labour to try to overturn a 4,000 Tory majority — Ipswich, which the Tories held last time with a 2,000 majority, and Norwich South, where the Lib Dems are defending a wafer-thin 300 majority from Labour. The Unite activists will help with telephone and door-to-door canvassing, fundraising, transporting voters to polling stations and, crucially, ensuring that their fellow union members vote. One senior Labour figure said: ‘It will just take the word from McCluskey for the activists to stay at home, and then our marginal seats operation is in big trouble. Our membership has slumped, which means we don’t have the foot soldiers we had before. ‘We need union members, which is why this argument with McCluskey could not come at a worse time.’ Unite, whose block vote swung the leadership for Ed over his brother David in 2010, has an enormous, and some Labour MPs say ‘unhealthy’, sway over the party. In 403 seats where new candidates have been chosen, 129 will be flying the Unite flag - more than one third of the total. The candidates have either worked for the union or received financial sponsorship. More than 50 are in key target seats where Labour is confident of victory in May. In the current Parliament, 147 of the 257 Labour MPs have received directly, or for their constituency parties, donations ranging from £250 to almost £200,000. Ed Miliband (pictured) can ill-afford to make an enemy of Len McCluskey and Unite, for no other modern Labour leader has had to rely so heavily on one union to ensure the financial survival of the party . Unite has also handed £428,000 directly to Shadow Cabinet members. The biggest beneficiary is Jon Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham, who has received £157,000, which is more than one third of the total. Cruddas, significantly, is in charge of Miliband’s stuttering policy review. He has received a further £55,000 from other trade unions. Miliband’s private office also benefited to the tune of £120,000, and there was a further £148,000 for his leadership campaign. Since he became general secretary of Unite in January 2011, McCluskey, according to the union’s own data, has had 11 official meetings with the Labour leader - though it is not known how often they talk on the telephone or meet in private. The millions of pounds handed over by the union also come with strings. It’s why McCluskey has also had meetings with Cruddas and Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor. Unite’s paw prints can be seen on a number of policies which Miliband has announced. In June 2012, McCluskey, in a tub-thumping speech to his union, demanded a ‘tax on the family home’. Eight months later, Miliband announced a ‘mansion tax’ on properties worth £2 million or more. The policy has been disowned by leading Blairites such as Lord Mandelson, major Labour donors, and just about every Labour MP hoping to secure the party’s nomination to be London Mayoral candidate next year. The following summer, McCluskey called for the abolition of the spare room subsidy, or so-called bedroom tax, which is saving £465 million a year. The matter is personal for McCluskey because Harman (pictured9 is a member of Unite, and she presided over the blocking of their candidate. Two months later, in his party conference speech, Miliband pledged to do just that. The pattern goes on: in July 2011, McCluskey demanded a rise in corporation tax for medium and large-sized businesses. Two years later it duly became official Labour party policy. But despite the agreements on Left-wing policy, the row over Karie Murphy threatens to overshadow Labour’s election campaign. The quarrel is also a personal matter for Harriet Harman. In 1995, her husband Jack Dromey, now a Labour MP, ran for the leadership of the then powerful Transport & General Workers Union. Dromey had the backing of the New Labour machine from Tony Blair down. But he was heavily beaten, and the transport union was eventually absorbed into Unite. One senior source said: ‘Harriet lobbied everyone to try to get Jack that job, and was bitterly disappointed when he failed. She has been nursing a grudge ever since. ‘Harriet insisted on an all-women shortlist for Halifax, but was adamant Karie Murphy wasn’t on it. The sisterhood it seems only extends to the sort of women that Harman approves of, and they are clearly not certain working-class NHS nurses.’ The Halifax Labour Party is due to choose a candidate from a six-strong shortlist on Saturday, at which point the party leadership will be hoping the rancour over the latest campaign selection battle will fade away. But if that ominous tweet is anything to go by, the overweeningly powerful Unite union is already plotting its revenge.","Labour leadership blocked Karie Murphy from shortlist for Halifax seat .

"Cherie Blair has focused on legal and charity work since her husband Tony quit as prime minister . Cherie Blair is set to join Renault next month to improve the diversity on its board, it has been revealed. The French car manufacturer has approached the well-known women’s rights activist as it attempts to improve its female representation. Mother-of-four Mrs Blair, 60, has been concentrating on her legal and charity work since her 61-year-old husband Tony left the office of prime minister in 2007. Renault - the world’s fourth biggest car maker by sales through its alliance with Nissan - said the barrister would also add helpful experience in employment and human rights law. Mrs Blair, who ‘works closely’ with more than 20 charities according to her website, has never previously been appointed to a French corporation, reported The Daily Telegraph. Last year she left human rights practice Matrix Chambers to join the international legal consultancy firm Omnia Stategy, which she co-founded four years ago. Mrs Blair, who was born into a working-class family in Liverpool, also founded the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, which helps female entrepreneurs in the developing world. A quota system exists in France to demand that women make up 20 per cent of board members – a figure that will rise to 40 per cent in 2017. Four of Renault’s current 19-member board are women. Other prominent women in the male-dominated industry include Ursula Piëch of Volkswagen, Mary Barra of General Motors and Patience Wheatcroft of Fiat Chrysler, reported the Financial Times. New arrival? Renault - the world’s fourth biggest car maker by sales through its alliance with Nissan - said the barrister would also add helpful experience in employment and human rights law . Mrs Blair is set to be proposed as a director for four years at Renault's annual shareholders meeting on April 30, according to a list of resolutions published by the firm last Friday. Meanwhile, it was reported earlier this week that her husband is to step back from his role as Middle East peace envoy. The former Labour leader has been the envoy for the Middle East Quartet peace negotiators - the UN, the EU, Russia and the US - since he quit as prime minister. It is understood that the former Prime Minister has met John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, to discuss a possible job change.","She has focused on legal and charity work since Tony left office in 2007 .

"Derrick Blake, pictured with wife Anita, was shocked when he received a cold call from somebody who knew details of his past financial investments . Pensioners and savers whose financial information was sold by B2C have had their lives made a misery by cold calls and con artists. These are some of their stories: . The grandfather preyed on by fraudsters . Derrick Blake was shocked when he received a cold call from somebody who knew details of his past financial investments. The caller used the information to try to scam the grandfather, 75, into handing over his bank details. Mr Blake, who is a carer for his wife Anita, now believes the scammer got his details from B2C. The caller claimed to be from a utility company Mr Blake previously had shares in, but sold seven years ago. They told him he still had 180 shares with them and offered to buy them from him. Luckily, he consulted his son, who immediately realised it was a scam. He said: ‘What is shocking is how they knew all this information about me. How did they know I had those shares? ‘One caller also knew I had arthritis – where did that come from? They know more about my life than I do, it seems.’ Mr Blake, a retired Thames waterman, often receives surveys asking him very specific personal information, such as how much his house is worth, his earnings and investments. He and his wife, who has recently suffered three strokes, have also been offered will-writing and funeral services, which Mr Blake described as ‘insensitive’. He said he ‘couldn’t get over’ the fact that his private financial details were on a database. Ex-florist who was warned to plan for a funeral . Grandfather-of-five Graham Nealer receives around three cold calls a day – usually asking him to answer personal questions ranging from where he does his shopping to how big his pension pot is. Mr Nealer and his wife, Anita, are woken up early in the morning and are bothered late in the evening with such calls. Mr Nealer was shocked to be told his personal information was on a database held by B2C – which includes details on his investments – and were being sold on to nuisance callers. Scroll down for video . Pensioners and savers whose financial information was sold by B2C (company director Nick Sayer pictured) have had their lives made a misery by cold calls and con artists . The same details sold by B2C appear to have ended up in the hands of prize-draw scammers Wye Valley Promotions Ltd, which was fined £120,000 last year for ‘misleading’ customers into believing they had won large cash prizes. Wye Valley called Mr Nealer on his home phone and sent him letters claiming he had won such a prize. Thankfully, he did not respond. ‘I can’t think where they would get these details,’ he said. ‘The only places that know financial information about me are my banks.’ Mr Nealer, who ran a florist with his daughter before he retired, says the nuisance calls increased after he recently turned 65. ‘People want to get their hands on my pension,’ he said. Mr Nealer said the worst nuisance call was last week, at 8pm in the evening, when his wife answered a call from someone trying to persuade her to start planning her and her husband’s own funeral for when they die. ‘It’s totally inappropriate,’ he says. Day the conmen from China struck . Scammers have targeted Michael West on four separate occasions and he gets nuisance calls five times a day. ‘I get a lot of surveys asking me for private information,’ he said. Like several other pensioners on B2C’s database Mr West, 68, has had conmen try to hack into his PC. On these occasions he has been telephoned by people from China or India claiming to be calling on behalf of Microsoft. ‘They start by saying that my computer needs updating or has errors and then ask me to turn it on and log in,’ he said. Thankfully, Mr West – a chartered engineer – consulted a computer expert he knew, who told him immediately it was a scam. On Microsoft’s website it says that such cons are unfortunately common. Thousands of people are thought to have been scammed over the phone, including the elderly (file picture) Couple targeted by computer scammers . Malcolm Williams and his wife, Carol, receive at least two nuisance calls a day – and almost fell victim to the same con artists as Mr West. They suspect they were targeted because they were on the same set of data being sold by B2C. Both couples were told, by a company falsely claiming to be Microsoft, that their computers needed fixing so they could access it remotely and steal their personal details. The couple get cold calls both on their mobiles and landline. The nuisance calls have got worse in the past three weeks. Mr Williams, 66, a retired cabin crew member for British Airways, said he was outraged that his details are being sold. ‘What right has anyone got to be selling these kinds of details? We are always so careful about giving information away and never answer calls when they ask for our details.’ The disabled man plagued by calls . Retired lorry driver John Edghill receives ‘constant’ calls from businesses claiming to be from the Government or trying to get him to answer personal survey questions. The 65-year-old, who lost both his legs in a road accident in 2004, said: ‘I am so careful not to give anything away about myself. I never tick boxes on forms where it says your information can be shared.’ Mr Edghill is also getting a growing number of calls about his finances and pension. He said cold calls made life a misery for disabled people who had to struggle to get to the phone, only to find it was a call about marketing or a scam. Widower who fears answering his phone . Kenneth Longford receives around four nuisance calls a day – which he believes is as a result of once filling in a form with a clothing catalogue. Ever since he did so, he has received a growing number of calls ranging from PPI to prize-draws. Mr Longford, 72, who lost his wife Vicky in 2010 to motor neurone disease, said he was ‘disgusted’ to discover his details had ended up on B2C’s database. The father-of-two and grandfather-of-five, who lives alone in a bungalow, added: ‘I barely ever answer the phone nowadays. ‘It’s worrying for people who are more vulnerable than me, and who knows who has my information now.’","Data firm B2C sold on financial information of pensioners and savers .

"Three men and a woman appeared in court today accused of helping to hide the dismembered body of murdered teenager Becky Watts. Karl Demetrius, 29 and his girlfriend, Jaydene Parsons, 23, were charged with assisting an offender after the 16-year-old's cut up remains were found in their home. The couple allegedly acted to help Becky's stepbrother Nathan Matthews – has been charged with her murder – evade detection. Karl's twin Donovan Demetrius and James Ireland, 23, also stood in the dock charged with the same offence of assisting in the 'disposal and concealment' of Becky's body parts. Suspects: Jaydene Parsons, 23, (right) has a young son with her boyfriend, 29-year-old Karl Demetrius (left). Both have today been charged with assisting an offender in relation to the Becky Watts murder . In custody:  Donovan Demetrius (left) has also been charged as has Jamie Ireland, right, and all four appeared in court today. A fifth suspect was released without charge . The defendants spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth and did not enter pleas during the short hearing. They are jointly charged with assisting an offender without lawful authority or reasonable excuse between February 22 and March 3. The charge alleges that they 'did an act, namely assist in the disposal and concealment of the body parts of Rebecca Watts with intent to impede the apprehension or prosecution of Nathan Matthews, who had committed the offence of murder'. Delivery driver Matthews, 28, is accused of killing his stepsister and his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, is accused of 'consistently lying to police' in an attempt to protect her boyfriend. Matthews, who was unshaven and wearing a grey sweatshirt, appeared via video link from HMP Bristol, and did not enter a plea this morning. Judge Neil Ford QC, Recorder of Bristol, remanded Matthews in custody and set another hearing for March 26 and he expected a trial after September 1. Prosecutor James Ward told the court: 'Nathan Matthews is charged with the murder of Rebecca Watts. 'The allegations of this case have been well-rehearsed in the press recently and I do not propose to go into the finer details. 'There are still people helping the police with their inquiries. Therefore, it would be wrong to place before the media further details about this case.' Becky, 16, was last seen at her home in the St George's area of Bristol on February 19. Body parts thought to belong to the teenager were found on Monday night after police were called to an address in Barton Hill . The four defendants were shuttled to Bristol Magistrates Court today after being charged with the crime. Above, a van drives them in to the court . Nathan Matthews, the stepbrother of Becky Watts, was remanded in custody after he appeared in court charged with the 16-year-old's murder. He is pictured in a court sketch of his first hearing yesterday . Matthews's girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, also pictured in a sketch by a court artist, appeared in a separate hearing in the same packed courtroom yesterday charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice . Nathan Matthews (second from right) and Shauna Hoare (right) are pictured at a fancy dress party with Becky's father Darren (left) and his wife, Matthews's mother Anjie . Police discovered body parts on Monday night after they were called to a property at Barton Court, in the Barton Hill area of Bristol (top right). They also searched a second house, and a blue car parked outside (bottom right). Barton Court is just a street away from a house in Cotton Mill Lane (bottom left) which has been searched extensively, and is opposite Becky's boyfriend Luke's house (bottom centre). Police  also searched Becky's home (top right), and a house in Southmead (top left) where they seized a black Vauxhall Zafira . Mr Ward said police were assessing 'at least' 1,200 exhibits in connection with the case. 'Much forensic work needs to be done,' he said. Paul Cook, representing Matthews, said his client was not making an application for bail. Matthews' girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, who is charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice, will also appear before the court charged with perverting the course of justice on that date. They were detained after detectives attended a house in Barton Court, Barton Hill in Bristol, following information that Becky's body had been 'cut up'. A photograph from Darren and Anjie Galsworthy's 2013 wedding has emerged showing Matthews (far left) next to the couple, with Hoare (next to Mrs Galsworthy) and Becky (right) as bridesmaids . Nathan Matthews (left) was remanded in custody and will appear via video link before Bristol Crown Court tomorrow. Hoare (right) was remanded in custody and will appear at the same court on April 2 . As a white custody van left the court shortly before 11am yesterday, members of the public who had been waiting outside the court banged on the sides of the vehicle and yelled abuse as it drove away . Yesterday, Matthews and Hoare stood emotionless in the dock to face charges after 16-year-old Becky's dismembered body was discovered 80 yards from their home earlier this week. Their separate court appearances were a stark contrast to the wedding photograph which was taken by a family friend in August 2013, after Becky's father Darren Galsworthy, 51, married Matthews' mother Anjie, 49, at a church ceremony in St George, Bristol. Nearly 100 guests attended a reception at the nearby Bendix Club, Kingswood, where Becky and her stepbrother were seen laughing and joking together. Matthews, who held his and Hoare's young daughter in the picture, was dressed in the same grey suit and cream waistcoat as his stepfather. Hoare and Becky wore matching blue bridesmaid dresses. Becky vanished from her home in Bristol on the morning of February 19. Police launched a huge search operation after she was reported missing the following afternoon. But on Monday night detectives discovered her 'cut up' body at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol. A forensic officer makes their way past a sea of flowers left outside Becky's home today as police continue to search the property .

"Demand: An official organ transplant. The first  illegal 'organ harvesting' in UK was reported in 2011 . Two people – one a boy as young as 12 – have been smuggled into Britain to have their organs removed and sold on the black market. The horrific cases, which have been revealed in an official report, show the lengths to which human traffickers will go to make money from their vile trade. The pair were brought into the country last year by gangs seeking to exploit the worldwide demand for transplant organs. One was identified as a boy aged between 12 and 15 and the other as a woman in her 30s. They are thought to have started their journey in Africa or Asia and to have been rescued by British police or immigration officials who suspected they were being trafficked. Such cases are rare, but expose what charities and campaign groups suspect is a little-known aspect of international people-smuggling. The first incident of illegal ‘organ harvesting’ in Britain was reported in 2011. Two years later a girl was brought from Somalia with the intention of removing her organs and selling them on to patients desperate for a transplant. The two latest cases are revealed in a report by the National Crime Agency, which was set up by the Government to combat serious and organised crime. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), as many as 7,000 kidneys are illegally obtained by gangs each year around the world. While there is a black market for hearts, lungs and livers, kidneys are the most sought-after organs because one can be removed from a patient without serious ill-effects. The conspiracy involves a number of people, including a recruiter who identifies the victim, someone else to organise their journey, medical professionals to perform the operation and an accomplice charged with offering the organ for sale. While the vast majority of trafficking cases highlighted in the NCA statistics relate to sexual exploitation and modern-day slavery, ‘organ harvesting’ is specifically identified as a category of cross-border criminal activity. Vigilant: Border police at Heathrow . Immigration officials suspected the pair were being trafficked and they were rescued . The Salvation Army was awarded a government contract in 2011 to give specialist support to victims of all forms of people-smuggling, including providing them with safe houses as well as medical care and legal advice. Anne Read, the Salvation Army’s human trafficking response co-ordinator, said: ‘Front-line staff are becoming more aware of the different types of exploitation that are taking place and the extremes to which gangs will go to make money from their victims. ‘The woman who was found in 2011 and referred to us had not yet had an organ removed but she was completely traumatised and very frightened. ‘She had suffered an awful ordeal and was in such an emotional state that she found it difficult to talk about what she had been through. It is almost impossible to imagine anyone even thinking of carrying out a complicated operation in secret without the necessary medical back-up. The cases highlighted by the NCA are a truly shocking development.’ Chloe Setter, from child protection charity Ecpat UK, said: ‘We know of just a handful of cases but we suspect these are the tip of the iceberg. Organ harvesting is prevalent in many countries. We have felt confident in the UK that we have robust systems and procedures in place in relation to transplants but this could be something that is happening underground and out of view. ‘Traffickers target the most vulnerable – children, those living in poverty, refugees and migrants – because they are often desperate and easy to manipulate.’ The demand for organs outstrips supply in almost every country. In many places the wait for an organ can be measured in years. The WHO says around ten per cent of the 63,000 kidney transplants carried out annually worldwide involve payment of non-related donors of different nationalities. Lutfi Dervishi, clinic director, was jailed for eight years after heading an organ-trafficking ring that performed at least 24 illegal kidney transplants on the outskirts of Pristina, in the former Yugoslav republic of Kosovo . Globally, at least 200,000 people are on waiting lists for kidneys, and many more have no access to transplantation or dialysis services. One of the worst cases uncovered so far was in the former Yugoslav republic of Kosovo, where five men were convicted in 2013 of involvement in an organ-trafficking ring that performed at least 24 illegal kidney transplants at a clinic on the outskirts of the capital, Pristina. The clinic’s director Lutfi Dervishi, who was sentenced to eight years in jail, had promised victims about £12,500 each for kidneys that were then sold on the black market for as much as £84,000 a time, but donors often went unpaid. Prosecutors at the trial said they were ‘cast aside at the airport’. Most of the organs were sold to recipients in Israel, Canada, Poland and Germany. According to the WHO, a heart can fetch up to £1 million on the black market and a pancreas or liver about £500,000. A spokesman for the Human Tissue Authority, which regulates organ transplants in the UK, said: ‘We have been made aware of these two cases. Fortunately, the authorities were able to intervene before the traffickers could carry out their plan.’","A 12-year-old boy and a woman in her 30s started journey in Africa or Asia .

"Two men who claimed to be drunk and high filmed themselves driving and shouting with a wounded owl in their car. Johnny Duverson and his cousin, who has not been named, filmed themselves waving a bottle and driving round the streets of West Palm Beach, Florida, with a Great Horned Owl in the front seat. Duverson's cousin holds the wide-eyed bird, which is protected by federal law, in the crook of his arm while Duverson whoops and cheers. Unexpected passenger: A video emerged showing the owl - which experts think is dazed - being held in the front seat of a car driving down a Florida highway . 'Drunk and high': This bottle - seemingly of alcohol - is waved around during the footage, which was uploaded to Facebook and shared thousands of times . At one point in the video, which was uploaded to Facebook and shared thousands of times, a voice is heard shouting: 'We chillin' with a owl [sic] right now, we vibin'' Alongside the video, Duverson wrote: '3am in the morning, we are drunk, we are high, we bout to take this thing home and eat it up just found it on the road.' Video: Johnny Duverson, pictured above, was in the car and posted the footage on his Facebook page . In a later post he said the bird was 'dancing' and 'acting crazy' during their 10-mile journey down the I-95 highway, which ended at Lake Worth. Wildlife experts were horrified at the video, and pointed out that possessing an owl in any capacity is a breach of federal wildlife laws. David Hitzig of the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary in Jupiter, Florida, said the owl looked as if it was dazed in the video. Speaking to the WPTV local news station, he said: 'To me the concern is: where is the owl now, what's happened to the owl, did anybody cause harm to the owl?' Duverson later said the owl was already hurt when they found it. When confronted by WPTV, he said: 'It didn't fly away so we knew it was hurt. Leave me alone.' He also seemed to row back on claims of the group being drunk and high whilst driving - though he did not offer an alternative explanation. DailyMail.com has attempted to contact Duverson. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation has also launched an investigation. Protected: Great Horned Owls - and any other type of owl - are protected by federal law, and cannot be owned .","Johnny Duverson and his cousin filmed themselves driving with the bird .

"He became known as the Dancing Man after two photos of him were posted online with the caption: 'Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing.' But now, the man - who was pictured happily dancing in one shot, and bowing his head in apparent humiliation and dejection in the other - has been tracked down, thanks to a social media campaign. The music lover, who is named Sean and lives in London, was identified after upset Twitter user, Cassandra Fairbanks, from California, spotted the photos and asked other users to help find him. And not only did The Free Thought Project activist manage to locate him within hours - but she and nearly 2,000 other women have now invited him to a huge VIP dance party in Los Angeles.

The success of Ms Fairbanks's tweet and the subsequent party invite has touched the hearts of people across the world, with many social media users deeming the story 'amazing' and tear-jerking. Sean was first pictured dancing enthusiastically at what appeared to be a concert last month. But after the bullying cameraman and his friend started laughing at him, he bowed his head in shame. The bullies later uploaded the two, contrasting photos of Sean to the anonymous message board, 4chan, alongside the nasty message labeling him a 'specimen' and criticizing his carefree dancing. The post was then screenshot and posted on Imgur, where it attracted the attention of thousands of social media users, including Ms Fairbanks, who said she was 'horrified' by its 'cruel' nature. On Thursday evening, she uploaded the post her Twitter page, writing: 'Anyone know this man or who posted this? There's a huge group of ladies in LA who would like to do something special.' Ms Fairbanks's tweet was quickly circulated on the social network, with thousands of users joining in her efforts to track down the Dancing Man. Before long, the hashtag #finddancingman went viral.

In a post she wrote on The Free Thought Project's site, Ms Fairbanks explained that she and a few other women were 'concerned the photo spreading further could cause embarrassment for Sean'. 'Kind-hearted gesture': Although the group were concerned of embarrassing Sean by tweeting the photos, they decided that the benefits of successfully locating and standing up for the Dancing Man outweighed the risks . Supporting Sean: Emma Roid tweeted to Sean: 'If you see this, we want you to know that we've got your back' More support: Another user, with the handle @tinypants', said she hoped someone on Twitter could identify Sean - before his name was revealed. 'Half the Internet wants to give him a hug,' she wrote, using the hashtag . Fellow dancing enthusiast: Charlie Heapy added: 'We need to #FindDancingMan and have a big dancing party!' But eventually, they decided that the benefits of successfully locating and standing up for Sean - 'bringing some positivity to such an upsetting situation' - outweighed the risks, she wrote. In the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Fairbanks received a photo of a man who looked like the Dancing Man - and was wearing the same wristband - posing next Arsenal football team's emblem. And just hours later, the Dancing Man himself set up a Twitter account to reply to Ms Fairbanks - and posted a photo of himself holding up a sign reading: 'Hi Cass & Twitter (as requested!).' After confirming Sean's identity and discovering he lives in London, Ms Fairbanks posted: 'YAY TWITTER!!! @Dancingmanfound #FindDancingMan. We are going to dance!!!'

"Two single beds side by side, canes hanging from coat hooks and retro British food tins on a gingham-covered countertop - these are the poignant images that capture the lives of two elderly sisters in their family home. Jean and Joy Taylor were born in the house in Ryde, Isle of Wight, in 1916 and 1922, never married and even shared a bedroom in their family home for 27 years until Jean's death in 2008. Now their quiet, old fashioned life together has been documented by a photographer Zoe Barker, with her picture series, The House Of Two Sisters. Scroll down for video . The sisters' guest room is decorated with pink candlewick bedspreads, an electric fire and family pictures on the mantelpiece. Jean's picture is in the centre, to  the right is their brother Jim in his Royal Artillery Uniform . The new owners have kept the enamelled pots and pans and other vintage pieces of kitchenware and continue to use a 'cool cupbord' with perforated metal door and sides for storing cheese, butter and eggs . Jean Taylor (left) was born, lived and died in her home in Ryde, Isle of Wight; after the loss of her sister in 2008,  Joy, now 99, (right) sold the house in 2013 to move into a care home . Barker's pictures are as much a document of the sisters' lives together and of a glimpse of a vanishing Britain. Her images  record an immaculately kept house with vintage features such as antimacassars on the armchairs, tins of treacle in the kitchen, a dressing table and highly-patterned carpets. There are no computers cluttering up surfaces, or plugs, wires and cables wending around furniture  and only a few black and white photographs  decorate on the walls. The women were born into a well-known local family, which originally set up a successful coaching business in the town in the 1840s. They also had two brothers James and John. Barker said: 'Very much a family home in the early days, the sisters shared the house with their mother and their Aunt Edie until both mother and aunt passed away. This was Jean's home all her life.' Aged 23 and 17 respectively when the Second World War broke out, the Taylor sisters came of age in an era of thrift, rationing and self-sacrifice. And their wartime experiences are evident throughout the house. The  dressing table in the twin bedroom that Jean and Joy shared. Their beds are seen reflected in the mirror . The new owners have kept the old Electrolux hoover along with the carpet that remains in this room . Jean and Joy shared a bedroom from the 1950s until Jean's death. The  picture on the wall is of their family friend and Spitfire pilot George Gribble who was never found after bailing out over the sea near Dunkirk . Both of their brothers survived the war and there is a picture of James, who served in North Africa and Italy while John fought in the jungles of Burma, on the guest bedroom mantelpiece. In their neat, almost spartan, room is a black and white photo of their family friend and Spitfire pilot George Gribble who victory-rolled over the house whenever he flew over the island. On 4 June, 1941, he was seen to bail out over the sea near Dunkirk but was never found. The smaller photograph in the corner of the same frame is Bill Tudhope, a bomber pilot who was engaged to one of their cousins. He failed to return from a bombing mission over Germany in 1940. Barker said: 'In 1957 Joy left to live in London, though returned to the house almost every weekend. On retiring in 1981 she returned to live with her sister and they remained there together until Jean's death. 'Neither of them ever married. Despite being a large house the sisters shared a bedroom right up until Jean passed away.' These plastic flowers were given to the sisters by the grandmother of the woman who delivered their lunches in the last two years of Jean's life. Niece Gill remembers how impractical these armchair 'tables' were andmugs of tea would slip off unless held on to tightly . Joy Taylor sold the house in 2013 but her coat still hangs on the coat rack along with the sisters' canes (left); the women hung their Sunday best dresses on the back of the bedroom door (right). Their niece Gill, who says her aunts were always smart dressers, remembers Jean wearing this two-piece on warm summer days . The Isle of Wight-based photographer was asked to take her camera around the house  by the new owners after Joy - the last of the Taylor family in Ryde - sold her house in 2013 to move into a care home. She said: 'The new owners are lovely - a middle-aged couple with a teenage daughter. They are all massive appreciators of old things so it couldn't be in better hands. 'They've kept a lot of the sisters' furniture and objects, selected from the things that the sisters' family didn't want, many of which are currently in storage, but they plan to display them around the house once the decorating is completed. 'They invited me to come and document the house precisely because they appreciated it all so much - they really wanted a record of how it was. I presented them with an album of photographs at the end of the project.' The pictures took first place in the Documentary Series Category at the British Life Photography Awards this month. The new owners of the house have kept this Fowler's Treacle tin and many other old containers including over-the-counter medicines and salves, with a view to displaying them in the house in future . The sisters  had an identical much-loved chair and even Joy isn't sure whether this one was hers or Jean's . Barker documented the interior before it was renovated. She said: 'Little had changed for many years and the house was full of wonderfully dated features. But the house won't be entirely transformed. 'They're keeping the essentials of the house the same - lots of paint required and a few new curtains and carpets, but pretty minimal really as they want the house to retain its wonderful character,' she said. 'For example, keeping the woodchip wallpaper, just giving it a lick of paint, and holding on to some of those amazingly dated carpets. Even the old hoover has been kept as it's working perfectly. 'The biggest change is the kitchen - it was absolutely tiny, a galley kitchen really: the kitchen pans photograph was only just about doable with a wide angle lens and the camera right against the opposite wall. So the old sitting room is now a wonderfully spacious kitchen with window out on to the garden.' The rug was made by Aunt Edie's long-term boyfriend 'Uncle Bert'. The pair stepped out every Wednesday afternoon until he passed away but they never married. The blue china dog also belonged to Aunt Edie .","Photographer shot preserved house of two elderly sisters on Isle of Wight .

The 49-year-old has been suspended while the NHS Trust carries out a high-level investigation. Sharon Bradley is alleged to have sent a vulnerable in-patient at a facility for youngsters with serious mental health issues a picture instructing her on how to take her life . She refused to comment on the case at her home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, according to the Daily Record. She was working at Skye House, a facility for youngsters from the age of 12 to 17 with serious mental health problems. A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde told MailOnline: 'This is a very serious allegation which is being investigated at the highest level within the organisation. 'While this investigation is being carried out a member of staff has been suspended in line with our normal HR procedures.' She has been suspended from her position as a nursing assistant at Skye House (pictured) in the grounds of Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital as the NHS Trust conducts a high-level investigation . The rise of social media has a profound impact on the mental state of young people, according to experts, who attribute sites including Ask.fm as contributing to a rise in cyber-bullying. Abuse on the internet and through mobile phones is one of the key child protection issues facing young people, according to research by the NSPCC and ChildLine. In 2013, 4,500 young people contacted ChildLine about online bullying in 2013. The mental health charity Young Minds said bullying has become such a widespread issue affecting the lives of many children and young people across the UK, that almost half of children between 10 and 15 say they have been bullied at some point in their lives.

"Prosecutors have made Serbia's first arrests of people suspected of carrying out 1995's Srebrenica massacre -  a significant milestone toward healing the wounds of Europe's worst civilian slaughter since World War II. Officers today arrested eight men accused of taking part in the murder of more than 1,000 Muslims at a warehouse near Srebrenica, a team of Serbian and Bosnian prosecutors told the AP. Altogether, more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed in the eastern enclave by the Serbs in 1995 - the only atrocity in Europe to be labeled a genocide by the UN since World War II. Serbian prosecutors said they initially arrested seven suspects in pre-dawn raids at different locations in Serbia this morning, then caught the eighth suspect following a manhunt later in the day. Horror: Pictured is the abandoned warehouse where over  1,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were murdered in July 1995. It remains the only atrocity in Europe to be labeled a genocide by the UN since World War II . Memorial: This photo  shows the gravestone of Muriz Sinanovic - one of the 1,000 victims of the massacre . Chief Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic told the AP that all those arrested 'are former members of a special brigade of the Bosnian Serb police.' Serbia in the past has put on trial men who took a group of prisoners away from Srebrenica to be killed. And in 2011 it arrested Ratko Mladic - the warlord who masterminded the slaughter — and sent him to an international criminal court in The Hague, Netherlands. But today's arrests are Serbia's first attempt to bring to justice men who got their hands bloody in the killing machine known as the Srebrenica massacre 20 years ago this July. 'It is important to stress that this is the first time that our prosecutor's office is dealing with the mass killings of civilians and war prisoners in Srebrenica,' Bruno Vekaric, the lead Serb prosecutor in the case, said. He said Serbia was approaching a key moment in confronting its past. 'We have never dealt with a crime of such proportions,' said Vekaric, Serbia's deputy War Crimes Prosecutor. 'It is very important for Serbia to take a clear position toward Srebrenica through a court process.' Snows covers the area surrounding the now-abandoned warehouse where the massacre took place . Munira Subasic, head the Mothers of Srebrenica group, called the arrests 'good news.' 'It was time for Serbia to do something,' she said. 'This is a message to all criminals who fled and thought they are safe from justice that they can never rest.' The biggest arrest in the sweep was Nedeljko Milidragovic, the commander dubbed 'Nedjo the Butcher,' who went on to become a successful businessman in Serbia, the AP has learned. More than 100,000 people were killed and millions were left homeless in Bosnia's 1992-95 war when Bosnian Serbs, supported by neighboring Serbia, rebelled against Bosnia's declaration of independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia. The collaboration Wednesday by prosecutors from former wartime enemies Serbia and Bosnia — supported by the U.N. war crimes tribunal — is the most important case of judicial teamwork helping to heal the war's festering wounds. The arrests follow a December sweep by the same team of prosecutors of 15 suspects in a separate wartime atrocity: a massacre that followed an abduction from a Bosnian train. Still grieving: Muriz Sinanovic was among those killed in the warehouse. His wife, Suhra (pictured) will never forget his last words before he headed into the forest with thousands of men fleeing Srebrenica . Many Serbs still view as heroes their wartime leaders - including Mladic and former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, who are on trial at the U.N. war crimes tribunal - and believe they were victims of a Western plot. That makes the current campaign to detain the triggermen deeply sensitive. Serbia's conservative government is allowing the prosecutions to move forward in part because it's eager to join the European Union. That July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces opened the Srebrenica offensive with heavy shelling, ignoring Dutch U.N. peacekeeping troops stationed in the town. The Serbs - led by Mladic - marched into the town without meeting any resistance. Women sought shelter at the Dutch base, while Bosnian men and boys fled into the surrounding woods and were hunted down by Mladic's forces. More than 100,000 people were killed and millions left homeless in Bosnia's 1992-95 war when Bosnian Serbs -supported by neighboring Serbia - rebelled against Bosnia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia . The men and boys captured by Milidragovic's men were rounded up and crammed tight into the warehouse with no food or water. There wasn't even enough room for everyone to sit as they waited in fear. The slaughter started in the late afternoon, when the killers hurled bombs through the windows and fired round after round of automatic gunfire. In the morning, witnesses say, Milidragovic ordered the survivors — up to 100 of them — to come out, promising they would be spared. They were not. Even his troops said they were terrified of the commander. 'I was afraid to look him in the eyes,' one of them, a protected witness, said in a deposition. When the Bosnian war ended in a peace deal in 1995, Milidragovic - who is now 58 - moved to the Serbian capital, Belgrade. He had two children and built a trucking business that transports construction material - prosecutors say his startup capital came from tens of thousands of dollars taken from his victims' pockets. Location: This photo taken earlier this month shows the now abandoned warehouse where over  1,000 Muslim Bosniak men and boys had been killed in July 1995 in the village of Kravica on the outskirts of Srebrenica . Muriz Sinanovic was among those killed in the warehouse. His wife, Suhra, will never forget his last words before he headed into the forest with thousands of men fleeing Srebrenica. 'Take good care of my children,' Muriz said as he hugged and kissed Munir, 7, and Emina, 4. In Muriz' trousers, discovered with his remains, investigators found his driver's license and a tobacco box a relative had made for him from U.N. aid cans. Suhra kept the box, a pinch of tobacco and the cigarette paper inside - enough for a cigarette he never got to smoke. The box still sits on a shelf in her living room in Sarajevo. When the children were small, they would not let visiting friends touch it. 'They said it is a sacred object,' Suhra said. Muriz' remains - about half of his body - were found years later in a mass grave. Forensics experts brought the remains to Suhra in a paper bag. They took out a few bones and showed them to her. 'I did not cry,' she said. 'But I almost broke my fingers, twisting them.'","Ex-members of a special brigade of the Bosnian Serb police arrested today .

"A jobless man said to have fathered 15 children with 10 different women has revealed he has another baby on the way. It is estimated Keith MacDonald's growing brood will end up costing taxpayers more than £2million in benefits. The 29-year-old, from Sunderland, is set to appear in a TV documentary tonight in which he says his latest child is due very soon. But despite his most recent partner being heavily pregnant, he tells programme-makers he is still desperate to meet new women - and is even shown trying to chat up love interests at a bus stop. Scroll down for video . Unemployed Keith MacDonald is said to have 15 children with 10 mothers but denies some are his . The documentary, entitled 40 Kids by 40 Women, follows a number of so-called 'mega-dads' to see how they cope, or fail to cope, with having so many children. MacDonald denies all 15 of the children he is said to have fathered are his, but boasts of his skill at meeting women and about his fertility. He tells documentary makers: 'How many of my ex-girlfriends am I still friends with? None of them. Apart from one and that's the one that is pregnant now.' He adds: 'The last time I had sex was nine months ago and the person's pregnant.' MacDonald tells the programme he can't find work, partly because he is 'no good at listening', and spends most of him time playing computer games. He says he finds it hard to meet new women because of his reputation in Sunderland and is shown in the programme going to Birmingham to 'pull girls'. MacDonald has appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show in the past and claims he meets the mothers of his children on public transport. MacDonald in 2008 with then-partner Becky Wright and their baby, one of 15 he is said to have fathered . Charlotte Anderson (left) with her daughter Kady-Marie Anderson and June Garrick with her son Brendan Garrick (right), all in 2005. Both children are said to have been fathered by MacDonald . He previously bragged: 'It's easy - they never seem to say no. Just chat them up on the bus. 'That's what I do and they never seem to say no. If they like you, they like you. Get their number and text them and arrange to meet when you come off the bus. I just pick them up like that.' Keith MacDonald: . - Unemployed . - Reportedly receives incapacity benefit for bad back of up £68.95 a week and £44 income support . - Said to contribute just £5 of his weekly income to his children . - The total benefit bill racked up by him and his offspring has been estimated at £2million from birth to 18 . MacDonald's notoriety grew in 2011 when he tried to fake his own death in a bid to shirk responsibility for his ninth child, according to an ex, who he later beat up. In November 2012, he was found guilty by Sunderland magistrates of common assault and stealing from one of his ex-partners after a row over a cheese toastie. He reportedly refuses to use contraception and already had six children by the time he turned 20 - including two kids he claimed he conceived on double-decker buses. In 2008, he bragged: 'It's not my fault - I thought they were all on the pill. I have fun, come through to Newcastle, or go into Sunderland. 'Lasses keep on coming up to me and I have a laugh with gay men as well.' Macdonald first became a father at 15 as he left school and has rarely worked since saying he finds it boring. He has previously claimed incapacity allowance for a 'bad back'. 40 Kids by 40 Women airs on Channel 5 tonight at 9pm. A new documentary shows him bragging about his luck with women and trying to find a new girlfriend by speaking to girls at a bus stop .

"It's usually parents pushing children to do their homework. But one pet rabbit from New Hampshire appears to be the one cracking the whip in his house. Victor Poulin filmed Fuzzy the bunny keeping his daughter, Chyanne, in check. Each time the schoolgirl puts her pencil down, Fuzzy swiftly picks it up in his teeth and encourages her to pick it up again. 'Tell her to do her homework Fuzzy,' Poulin instructs the critter from behind the camera. 'Yeah, you tell her... it's not time for a break' he continues. Chyanne can't help but giggle as Fuzzy keeps presenting her with a pencil. She then rolls the writing instrument back to him before he passes it back. Dozens of viewers have applauded the rabbit's tutoring antics with some deeming him 'cute'. Tutoring session: Victor Poulin filmed Fuzzy the bunny keeping his daughter, Chyanne, in check .

"It's not every day that you find yourself sitting in the front row while a scantily clad dancer writhes in front of you but that is exactly what happened to the Netherlands' Queen Maxima last night. The 43-year-old royal did, however, manage to keep a straight face during the modern dance performance which took place at Copenhagen's Royal Library. Sat beside Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik, who also managed to look suitably interested, the royal was enjoying the second evening of a three-day state visit to Denmark. Scroll down for video . Interesting evening: Queen Maxima, Prince Henrik and Crown Prince Frederik watch the performance . Sharing a joke: Maxima and Frederik (far right) share a joke during the modern dance performance . As the performance by Dutch dancers from the Het International Choreographic Arts Centre wore on, the two couldn't resist sharing a joke  while Denmark's Prince Consort Henrik looked decidedly nonplussed. They had flown over especially for the performance which was part of a return banquet hosted by Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander for the Danish Royal Family. Designed to highlight Dutch culture, Maxima arrived for the event looking wonderful in a patriotic russet gown studded with rhinestones. Eschewing her usual up-do, the mother-of-three wore her long blonde hair loose and curled for the event, which was designed to give Denmark and its royals a sneak peek at Dutch culture. Sitting on her other side during the performance was Willem-Alexander, who, like 46-year-old Frederik, was dapper in a dinner jacket. Nonplussed: Not everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves with some of the audience looking baffled . Glitzy: All of the royals had dressed up for the occasion, including the sequin-loving Princess Marie (right) Scantily clad: Most of the dancers chose to keep clothes to a minimum for the event . Round of applause: The royals, among them Queen Margrethe, politely clapped when the performance ended . Well done: The dancers enjoy the adulation at the end of their performance . Not to be outdone, 43-year-old Crown Princess Mary opted for a striking strapless black dress with a flattering empire-line cut. In contrast to her Dutch counterpart, the Australian-born royal had pulled her hair into a sleek low chignon and wore eye-catching diamond-shaped gold earrings. Equally glamorous was Denmark's Queen Margrethe who donned a rose-pink gown with a white lace bodice and fur shrug. Also at the event was Margrethe's younger son, Prince Joachim, 45, and his impeccably dressed French wife Marie, 39, who swept Maxima an impressively low curtsey as she arrived. Glamorous: Queen Maxima cut a patriotic figure in her dramatic russet gown . Convivial: King Willem-Alexander cracked a joke as he posed with the Danish royals outside the venue . In charge: Denmark's Queen Margrethe and the Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander on the red carpet . Pucker up: Queen Maxima puckers up as she greets Denmark's Prince Consort Henrik outside the event . The cultural celebration topped off a busy day for Maxima and Willem-Alexander who had earlier experienced the best of Danish weather during a sunny but  blustery ferry crossing to Samsø island. A small speck of land just off Denmark's Jutland Peninsula, the island is entirely carbon-neutral with heat and hot water produced by incinerating hay. Afterwards, the royal party was shown around a special type of Danish boarding school called an efterskole. Most Danish teenagers spend at least a year at the boarding schools, which are usually paid for by parents, albeit helped by a contribution from the state, where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music. The efterskole on Samsø focuses on aquatic sports, diving, aviation and golf, all of which are frequently indulged in by the sports-mad Crown Prince.

Willem-Alexander and Maxima's trip to Samsø was one of the main events of their three-day visit, which began with their arrival at Kastrup Airport's royal terminal on Tuesday. The pair were treated to a banquet at Christiansborg Palace that night, with Maxima wowing in a spectacular royal blue lace dress. Denmark's Queen Margrethe also rose to the occasion in pale blue, while Crown Princess Mary chose simple white.

"Lurking off the coast of Scotland are swarms of stunning jellyfish - from the common moon to the rare purple striped stinger and the tiny Neoturris pileata. And divers Matt Doggett and Richard Shucksmith have captured these floating beauties in exquisite detail. The images include a number of bright and colourful jellyfish that are rarely spotted so close to the UK, as well as so-called sea squirts which have been seen in abundance in recent years. The colourful mauve stingers (pictured) have tentacles that can grow around 13ft-long (four metre) and these eight tentacles are dangerous for unprotected divers.The species is also known as Pelagia noctiluca which means 'open ocean night light' in Latin . The images are from a collection called Earth In Focus and were captured off the coast of Scotland around the outlying islands of North Rona and Sula Sgeir, some 85 miles (136km) west of Stromness, as well as in Loch Duich. The divers said the further they headed offshore, the more bizarre and rare these lifeforms became and Mr Doggett, 36 from Southampton, said a particular highlight was the mauve stinger. Also known as the purple striped stinger, this species is native to warmer waters around the Mediterranean, Bermuda and deeper waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Another shot captures the lion's mane jellyfish (pictured). They can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges, like a lion's mane, which gives the species its name. They are typically found in the waters of the Arctic, Northern Atlantic and Northern Pacific . The images were taken by divers Matt Doggett and Richard Shucksmith  off the coast of Scotland around the outlying islands of North Rona and Sula Sgeir, some 85 miles (136km) west of Stromness, and in Loch Duich. Mr Doggett, 36 from Southampton, said a highlight was the mauve stinger, also known as the purple striped stinger (pictured). It is native to warmer waters around Bermuda and is a rare visitor to the UK . The images are from a collection called Earth In Focus. The divers captured various species of jellyfish including so-called mild stingers that grow around 4 inches (10cm) in diameter. These stingers have multiple radial canals that connect the centre to the edge of the flat bell . Also known as the purple striped stinger, this species is native to warmer waters around the Mediterranean, Bermuda and deeper waters of the Atlantic Ocean. It is a rare visitor to the UK but has been known to travel to the western coast of the British Isles and many experts believe the movement is linked to global warming. The jellies have tentacles that can grow around 13ft-long (four metre) and are dangerous for unprotected divers. The species is also known as Pelagia noctiluca which means 'open ocean night light' in Latin.

The colourful jellies have tentacles that can grow around 13ft-long (four metre) and these eight tentacles are dangerous for unprotected divers. The species is also known as Pelagia noctiluca which means 'open ocean night light' in Latin. Mr Doggett said: 'Despite all the dive gear, you still have to be careful not to get a stinging tentacle in the face so you do approach them with care. 'Some tentacles can be several metres long and could sting you before you see the jellyfish. 'So we always took care to look around carefully and point them out to each other. 'It was interesting to see young fish taking shelter in the tentacles of the lion's mane and mauve stinger jellies which they use to stay safe from predators.' Another shot captures the lion's mane jellyfish in green, shallower water. They can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges, like a lion's mane, which gives the species its name. Like other jellies, the lion's mane jellyfish reproduces asexually until it reaches full maturity at which point it reproduces sexually. The largest of these jellies have been recorded up to 120ft long (36.5 metres) and with more than 800 tentacles divided into eight groups. While the smallest of the species measure just half an inch (1.3 cm) in diameter and are 8 ft long (2.4 metres). While diving in Loch Duich Mr Doggett spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish (shown). Moon jellyfish are also known as Aurelia aurita and grow up to 40cm (15.7 inches) in diameter. They are recognisable by their patterns of spots and streaks and swim horizontally, keeping the bell near the surface at all times. This allows the tentacles to be spread over the largest possible area, in order to better catch food . The left-hand image shows a close-up of a species known as Neoturris pileata. They grow around 1.5 inches long (4cm) and can have up to 90 tentacles. There are more than 350 different types of jellyfish and some 2,000 variations within these species. Despite their reputation, many are harmless. The right-hand image was captured around 85 miles (136km) west of Stromness . This image shows Mr Doggett capturing the previous close-up image of Neoturris pileata. The tiny swimmers typically first appear in the Northern North Sea, off the Norwegian coast and around Kattegat and Skagerrak in May. They can still be spotted as late as September . They are typically found in the waters of the Arctic, Northern Atlantic and Northern Pacific. While diving in Loch Duich, Mr Doggett spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish. Moon jellyfish are also known as Aurelia aurita or saucer jellies and grow up to 40cm (15.7 inches) in diameter. They are recognisable by their patterns of spots and streaks and swim horizontally, keeping the bell near the surface at all times. This allows the tentacles to spread over the largest possible area and increase the chances of catching prey. This image shows a mauve stinger in the foreground as a seal swims in the background. Mr Doggett said that distance of the outlying islands from the mainland 'and their exposure to Atlantic storms and swell makes their wildlife both spectacular but also hard to reach. If the weather gods are on your side and the opportunity exists, these sites will have any diver in awe of the beauty within our seas' Mr Doggett said: 'The million moon jellies in Loch Duich were incredible and we returned the following day to photograph them and swim amongst them. As they do not sting it was a very relaxing, calming and enjoyable dive. 'Jellyfish are beautiful creatures both in colour and form and it was wonderful to have the opportunity to take time to show them looking at their finest.' The photographers also captured images of sea squirts, a type of filter feeder that lives on the ocean floor. There are more than 3,000 known species worldwide but many are found in warmer, tropical waters. They are protected by a thin membrane and are typically cylindrical. In addition to the common bell-shaped jellies, smaller species include what's known as comb jellies  or ctenophores (pictured). They get their name from tiny hairs called cilia that line their bodies and resemble combs. There are eight rows of combs that act like oars to help them swim .

"An Oklahoma City woman was forced to breastfeed her baby in a YMCA family bathroom with no changing table after a staff member told she couldn't feed the eight-week-old in the women's locker room. Tiffany Hoag and another woman were breastfeeding their babies on Wednesday in the women's locker room of the Earlywine Park YMCA when a staff member escorted both of them out. Hoag was taken to a family locker room where she nursed baby Ezra next to a shower and a toilet where it was 'dirty' and there were 'towels on the floor'. Tiffany Hoag was breastfeeding her eight-week-old baby in an Oklahoma City in the women's locker room when a staff member came in and told she couldn't feed baby Ezra there . She was escorted through the gym to a 'family' locker room and was left 'embarrassed and upset' by the whole situation . The first-time mother said that the whole experience was 'disheartening', according to KOCO. 'You don't think it's going to happen to you,' she said. 'I really am humiliated and just embarrassed. I was escorted out of the locker room and through the gym.' Hoag said that to make matters worse, Ezra cried as they walked through the gym, attracting more attention. 'I was really embarrassed and upset because people were looking, and he was crying because he was still hungry,' she told KFOR, adding that she didn't want to return to that YMCA. The fitness and community center has since released a statement, claiming that the whole situation was a misunderstanding. 'The Y is a place for families, and we support breastfeeding moms in our facilities. We believe this was likely an unfortunate mistake with our staff member misinterpreting our locker room policy, which states that children are not allowed in adult locker rooms. This is the family locker room that Hoag was escorted into so she could breast feed baby Ezra. She said the bathroom was 'dirty' and there were 'towels on the floor' and that she fed Ezra between a shower and a toilet . The YMCA has released a statement apologizing, claiming the situation was a big misunderstanding between staff members . 'We are looking into this particular incident further with the staff members involved in an effort to ensure that no other moms have this happen in the future. 'We are very sorry that this new mom had a negative experience and will continue to train our staff to understand that moms can breastfeed anywhere they would like to do so in our facilities.' Hoag said that she, too, hopes this doesn't happen to other mothers. 'If it had to happen to me to make it not happen to ten other mothers, then it's worth it,' she told KOCO. 'And if it ends with me, then I'm happy and I'm good with that.' Hoag said that she is raising awareness of her situation because she hopes no other mothers have to go through what she did .","Tiffany Hoag and another mother were escorted out of the Oklahoma City YMCA's women's locker room .

"A man has incriminated himself in a foolish crime by using his real name and address whilst on a peculiar shopping spree with a stolen credit card. Matthew Clifford, 29, from Geelong West used a stolen credit card 22 times in five hours to buy a range of items. He proved his range of tastes by buying products that ranged from including McDonald’s to expensive whisky, Subway to cognac, as well as fishing lures, a diary, cigarettes and an artist’s sketch pad. Matthew Clifford incriminated himself when he used his real name and address on paperwork for two phones, bought with a stolen credit card . The thief then proved he has mixed tastes by purchasing McDonald's and expensive whisky during his bizarre five hour shopping spree . The scammer only went to shops which used the 'PayWave' system . However, police found it all too easy to identify and locate the scammer due to his incredibly mindless mistake. Whilst using the credit card to buy two mobile phones, Mr Clifford filled out paper work and provided his real full name and Warwick Street address. Mr Clifford only bought items from stores that used the paywave system but managed to spend a whopping $1653.33. His lawyer argued that the accused was facing a difficult time in his life when he committed the crime and is now trying to get his life together. The deviant's purchases revealed his hobbies as he bought fishing lures and a sketch pad . When the stolen card was allegedly offered to him by a friend, Mr Clifford was opportunistic but ‘got caught up in the offending’. He has struggled with drug addiction in recent years but after he was charged with the latest offences has sought treatment. Clifford was convicted on all counts and placed on a further 12-month Community Corrections Order, on top of another similar Order he was placed on in 2014. He must also serve 100 hours’ unpaid community work and undergo a period of judicial monitoring.

"Police in the Philippines are preparing to arrest more suspects involved in an international paedophile ring following the arrest of Australian businessman Peter Gerard Scully. Scully, 51, was arrested in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, leading to renewed calls to reintroduce the death penalty. Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show one of Scully's victims, a 13-year-old girl, being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five. Scroll down for video . Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. The videos shows whipping and torture along with other horrific acts, and was described by police as the most shocking child pornography that has ever been discovered in the Philippines. 'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. The 51-year-old was allegedly paid between $US100 and $US10,000 for the videos. Janet Francisco, head of the anti-human trafficking division of the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation, said that two people had been charged overseas in relation to the investigation. They are believed to be of European nationality, reported The ABC. The Australian Embassy reportedly met to convene on the case, and the UNICEF's chief of child protection in the Philippines, Sarah Norton Staal, said the case needed urgent attention. Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme . Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . 'Well obviously the Australians don't want to see any perpetrators, any Australian nationals who are involved in this,' Ms Staal said. 'And even if there's one, you know, one is too many.' Scully was arrested on February 20 after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon, and he was formally charged on Friday. It is claimed the father of two abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers for his 'pay for view' online child pornography business. He is currently being held in a prison in Cagayan de Oro in the country's south, and will be tried at the same location, facing life in prison if found guilty. Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. He returned to Australia  accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling in 2011, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim. The Age reports Scully was never charged with child sex crimes in Victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history. An unnamed former business associate, who lost more than $200,000 in the fraudulent scheme, told The Age he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against Scully. 'Does it surprise me?' the associate told The Age. Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested . 'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.' It has sparked such an outrage in the Philippines that calls are growing daily to have him executed. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said. An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.

"The world's greatest private collection of coins is expected to sell for $220million (£150million) in a record-breaking series of seven auctions at Sotherby's and Stack's Bowers Galleries. Gathered over more than 30 years by Texas property developer A. Mack Pogue and his son, D. Brent Pogue, the collection contains coins from the early years of the American republic, from 1792 to the 1830s. These are the most sought-after U.S. coins in existence, as the crude production techniques of the period meant that the coins were fragile, making surviving high-quality examples are extremely rare. Scroll down for video . A treasure trove: An extraordinary 1822 five dollar gold coin, worth $8million, is up for auction. Pictured heads (left) and tails (right) Intricate: An 1804 silver dollar piece, pictured heads (left) and tails (right), the most famous American coin in the world, is worth $8 to $10million . Exquisite: A rare 1796 quarter dollar coin, shown heads (left) and tails (right), is expected to fetch up to $1million . Valuable: This 1797 half dollar coin is worth up to $1.75million. Pictured heads (left) and tails (right) Gathered over more than 30 years by Texas property developer A. Mack Pogue and his son, D. Brent, this is considered the most valuable collection of federal American coins dating from the 1790s to the late 1830s in private hands. An 1822 Half Eagle five-dollar gold piece, one of only three known to exist, and an 1804 Silver Dollar dubbed the 'King of American Coins' are expected to be among the top lots when the collection is sold in a series of auctions in New York beginning in May and continuing into 2017. 'These two coins in particular, we think, have a possibility of being up around that $10 million mark,' said Brian Kendrella, the president of Stack's Bowers Galleries. The rare coin and currency auctioneer, which is handling the sales with Sotheby's, believes the coins could shatter the $10 million record set in 2013 for a 1794 Silver Dollar. The Pogue collection includes two examples of the coveted 1804 silver dollar, considered to be the most famous coin in America, which is known as 'the pinnacle of coin collecting'. One of these is valued at $9.8million (£6.7million). Notably, it was presented to the Sultan of Muscat in 1835. D. Brent Pogue, from Dallas, Texas, has now decided to 'cash in his cash' by auctioning off more than 650 individual coins at a number of Sotheby's and Stack's Bowers Galleries sales over the next two years. Experts expect the collection to sell for almost $220million (£150million), more than any other series of rare coins. On Friday, Sotheby's showed off the jaw-dropping collection at its saleroom in New Bond Street, London. David Redden, Sotheby's vice chairman, said: 'To have the world's most valuable private coin collection available for viewing and sale in our galleries is a huge privilege and a great responsibility. 'Sotheby's and Stacks Bowers have worked fruitfully together in the past, notably on the sales of the 1933 Gold Double Eagle for $7.6 million and the Dallas Bank Collection. 'The D. Brent Pogue Collection will be a thrilling addition to that auction history.' A highlight of the collection is a $5 gold piece, known as the 1822 Gold Eagle, which is thought to be one of three in existence, and the only one in private hands. Considered the most desirable US gold coin outside of public collections, it is expected to sell for around $8.8million (£6 million). The 1797 Half Dollar, considered the most beautiful and best-preserved example of a design used for only two years, is the most valuable half dollar in existence. It is anticipated to sell for $1.5million (£1million). And the 1808 Quarter Eagle, which is a $2.50 coin, is also expected to sell for around $1.5million (£1million), which is 500,000 times its face value.The coin was previously owned by the Maryland banker Louis E. Eliasberg, Sr, and the early 20th Century beer magnate Virgil M. Brand, according to Catholic Online. Half Eagle coins have been widely collected over the years by notable figures including the banker J.P. Morgan. Handle with care: A Sotheby's employee holds a selection of American coins including a 1822 Half Eagle, or Five Dollar Gold Piece, and an 1804 silver dollar, both estimated to be worth between $8 and $10 million. The coins are part of the most valuable collection in the world, that is being sold in a series of auctions ending in May 2017 . Precious: This 1804 silver dollar, left and right, is estimated to be worth between $8 and $10million. D. Brent Pogue, who assembled the collection with his father, described selling his collection as 'bittersweet' Most of the coins were made during a time when small mintages and crude production facilities at the Philadelphia Mint made the survival of any high-quality coins unlikely. Each steel die used to strike coins in the early 1800s was painstakingly produced by hand, creating variations that are prized by collectors. The first sale, by Sotheby's and Stack's Bowers Galleries, will be on 19 May and there will be six further auctions with the final sale in May 2017. D. Brent Pogue, who assembled the collection with the help of his property developer father, described the sale as 'bittersweet'. He said: 'I feel now is the time to pass the torch to a new generation of custodians, who can appreciate the legacy of these great American coins. 'These coins conjure up many fond memories, and I hope the new owners will enjoy them as much as I have.' Coin sales are driven by the economy, but Brian Kendrella, the president of Stack's Bowers Galleries, said investors and collectors are also lured by the rarity, uniqueness, condition and historical significance of coins. 'They are artefacts that speak to what was going on in the United States at the time these coins were made,' he said. 'That's one of the main draws.' Perfection: This 1795 Eagle ten dollar gold piece (left and right) is one of the most perfectly preserved 18th Century U.S. gold coins in the world . In awe: A Sotheby's employee holds an American 1804 silver dollar, estimated to be worth between $8 and $10million, which is part of the famous Pogue coin collection, the most valuable private collection of coins in the world, that is currently being auctioned off in sections . With a dozen coins selling for $1 million or more in 2014, and the first gold coin struck for the United States fetching $4.5 million, the nonprofit Professional Numismatists Guild estimates the overall U.S. rare coin market to be worth about $5 billion. Walter Husak, a retired aerospace entrepreneur based in California, knows just how lucrative it can be. A collection of 301 rare penny coins dating from 1793 to 1814, which he gathered over more than 13 years, sold in 2008 for $10.7 million - about double what he invested in it. 'I never thought it would go up that much,' he said. 'There are a lot of people getting involved in coins.' Barry Stuppler, secretary of the Professional Numismatists Guild, has seen plenty of changes in his 52 years in the coin business. He says that the market has been booming in recent years. 'It is a combination of the economy coming back,' he said, 'and the fact that interest rates are very low.' The internet, he said, also has been 'a tremendous, tremendous source of new buyers and sellers of coins that we didn't have 20 years ago.' Demand for rare, investment-quality coins, graded and certified by the guild and the Florida-based Numismatic Guaranty Corporation, is high and supply is low. 'The rarities do the best, particularly gold and silver coins,' said Stuppler. 'The Pogue Collection is extraordinary.' Enticing: Two stars of the collection.

"Friends of the Sierra Leone sprinter who 'absconded' in the UK for nine months after the Commonwealth Games have urged him to return home after he claimed asylum here. MailOnline spoke to Jimmy Thoronka's running mates in Freetown, Sierra Leone who said they wanted him back despite the tragedy that has apparently struck his life. Sandy Musa Aleu, Thoronka's coach at the amateur Freetown Flashpack Runners, said the athlete was the top hope for the sport in his country. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Jimmy Thoronka claims he did not want to return to Sierra Leone after he discovered his adoptive mother, Jelikatu Kargbo, above, had fallen victim to Ebola . Alone: Thoronka was arrested in London last Friday and faces deportation. He has claimed asylum saying there is no one in Sierra Leone to help him - and he wants to become a top athlete here . Taken by Ebola: Jelikatu Kargbo's grave seen from both sides in a cemetery for Ebola victims in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. Thoronka's adoptive mother is thought to have died from the disease  last year . Lost to a deadly disease: The graveyard where Kargbo was laid to rest. She tragically passed Ebola on to her three sisters and another son, Musa, who all perished from the fever which has ravaged parts of Sierra Leone . He said: 'I think he should come home and be a leader for athletics for our country. Maybe if he apologises to the UK for overstaying his visa, the British government can provide money for his sprinting expenses, his training and his accommodation at events.' Thoronka, 20, was arrested last Friday when he was found sleeping rough on the streets of London. He disappeared following last year's Glasgow games and failed to return to the Ebola-hit west African country. He claimed that his flight home was cancelled because of the Ebola crisis and his passport and wallet were stolen - then he was told that his family back home had been wiped out by the deadly virus. But a top Olympic official in Sierra Leone blasted Thoronka's claims yesterday that he was forced to stay after the Commonwealth Games and accused him of lying to claim asylum in Britain. Joseph Nyande, the secretary general of the National Olympic Committee, said: 'I spent a week in London and I still flew in. There was no problem with flights, even British Airways was running at that time. 'He absconded. We tried to get on to him, we tried to call him on the telephone. It was embarrassing for us.' He also cast doubt on Thoronka's claim that his real parents were killed in the 2002 civil war - before he was taken in by an adoptive mother who then died of Ebola. 'I know he has parents here. I don't think there is anything wrong with the parents,' he added. Officials in the country's capital Freetown told MailOnline that Jelikatu Kargbo, 56, the nurse in the police service who adopted Thoronka when he was five, along with four other children, after the civil war that ravaged the country, had indeed died last year. Talent: Jimmy, third from right, with fellow members of the Sierra Leone Police Athletics Club in Freetown . Popular: Jimmy Thoronka (left) with his coach Sandy Musa Aleu (front, centre) and other members of the Freetown Flashpack Runners. They want him to return . Hometown: Thoronka was raised by his adoptive mother Jelikatu Kargbo in Freetown, where she always encouraged his sprinting. This is the view over the Aberdeen Hill district of the capital city . Kargbo worked at the Kingdom Police Hospital in Freetown, where she caught Ebola from a patient, according to a police source. She was admitted to the Rugupta Hospital in the city last summer but not before she passed the virus on to her three sisters and another son, Musa - who all died. Sandy Musa Aleu said that Kargbo had brought him up as if he was her own child and encouraged his track and field work with the police athletics team. He said: 'She was a very kind woman who was always encouraging Jimmy in his sprinting. She came to the track with Musa and Jimmy every week to make sure they did their work.' The family lived in a shanty town area called Congo Cross, a teeming and inaccessible slum dominated by gangs and witchdoctors not far from Freetown's national stadium. Officials said it was not possible to determine if Thoronka's parents had lived or died in the fighting in the Sierra Leone bush during the country's civil war. Many families were torn apart as they fled the maurading militias. Thoronka had not tried to contact his family again. In recent interviews, Thoronka has expressed his gratitude to his adopted mother and said: 'This lady brought me into her home, she took me as a son and I took her as a mother.' Ibrahim Kabia, a fellow runner at Freetown Flashpack runners, said that Thoronka was adored by fans as the country's best 100m and 200m sprinter. He said: 'People would come to the pitch when he ran for the Sierra Leone Police Athletic Club. His fans shouted ""Jimmy!"" all the time when ran. 'He became a big star in our country in 2013 when he beat some Australian and Swedish guys in the championships. We were very proud of him.' Coach Aleu also revealed he last spoke with Thoronka during the competition in Glasgow last year and believes his friend is refusing to return home as he is still devastated because his adoptive mother died. Support: An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted more than 70,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £28,000 to help the young athlete . Friends: Thoronka (far right) posing with other members of the Sierra Leone team before he 'absconded' after the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games . Fame: Thoronka carrying the Commonwealth baton in Sierra Leone. A top Olympic official called him an 'embarrassment' and cast doubt on his hard luck story on Wednesday . Success: Thoronka showed promise as a young athlete and is pictured here receiving the national schools U-17 100 metre gold medal. He said he wants to stay here to achieve his dream, otherwise 'he'd kill himself' He said: 'I tried to keep the news that his mother had died from him while he was in Glasgow but some of his friends had already told him. 'He called me and asked about his relatives. I said they were fine but he did not believe me. 'I wanted him to focus on the competition because he is first class. He had overcome so much and this was devastating for him. Now I am still worried about him.' Thoronka himself admitted he was confused after Mr Nyande publicaly undermined his story as another Olympic offiicial, Abdul Karim Sesay, spoke out in his defence and claimed Mr Nyande's attack was politically motivated. Thoronka told the Guardian: 'Two National Olympics Committee people are telling me two different things. 'If it can be proved that my adopted mother Jelikatu Kargbo is still alive and can continue to support me that will be very good. 'I would be very happy to speak with her again but I have been told that she is dead and I have no family left. 'If I go home, I will have no one to help me. If they can find my adopted mother and bring her to me, I will be very happy but I think some people are trying to destroy me.' Thoronka's friends hit back at Mr Nyande's statement and coach Aleu claimed that the association was trying to hide its own embarrassment at not providing the sprinter with the support he needed. He said: 'I had to nurse Jimmy myself when he had malaria last year. The Olympic association offered him nothing. He went to Glasgow fit and well because of me.' Thoronka was arrested on Friday and quizzed by officers over whether he was carrying or using drugs, which he denied. He has since been released. He is living in Home Office accommodation near Heathrow Airport and has been inundated with offers of help and requests for media interviews. He told the Guardian: 'I want to stay here. Nobody [would] look after me. No one persecuted me, my problem is I don’t have a family there. The person that would help me has passed [due to] Ebola. If I go back, I would not be able to make it, or I would kill myself because I would not proceed with my dream.' Asylum: Thoronka has been released by the Home Office and is living near Heathrow Airport for now . An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted nearly 70,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £28,000 to help the young athlete. Experts have said it would be safe for Thoronka to return to the country. Tom Dannatt, CEO of Street Child UK, the most active charity working with Ebola orphans across the region, said: 'Freetown is a safe area to travel to as long as people are properly educated about the risks and prevention methods to stop them contracting the virus. 'Education is the silver bullet to this crisis, which is why Street Child has trained over 1,200 Ebola educators in Sierra Leone to spread the word about Ebola prevention. 'If Jimmy washes his hands regularly using chlorine, avoids touching sick people and does not attend traditional funerals I have no doubt he will be safe. 'All Street Child staff across the country have been given this exact advice and not one of them has contracted the virus, even though they have been going into high risk areas to provide support for orphans in desperate need.'","Jimmy Thoronka was arrested after nine months of living rough in the UK following the Glasgow Commonwealth Games .

"Sat undressed in bed wearing Minnie Mouse ears and pulling a goofy expression, a 29-year-old Madonna appears to be completely at ease in front of the camera. Maybe that's because she was in the capable hands of Herb Ritts - widely considered one of the top photographers in the world until his death from AIDS in 2002 at the age of 50. The candid black-and-white portrait of Madonna is just one of dozens to be featured in a new hotly-anticipated exhibit of Ritts' work at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston opening tomorrow. Other celebrity subjects include everyone from a sultry Claudia Schiffer to a vest-wearing Richard Gere. Scroll down for video . The artist that Herb Ritts collaborated with most frequently was Madonna, whose whimsical Madonna, Tokyo (1987) was taken in her hotel when the Who’s That Girl World Tour opened in Japan . Hold that pose: Ritts shoots often happened in the afternoon on the roof of his studio on LA's Santa Monica Boulevard, where this was shot of Naomi Campbelll was taken in 1990 . Bevvy of beauties: One of Ritts’ most famous images is Stephanie, Cindy, Christy, Tatjana, Naomi, Hollywood (1989) was taken at the end of a long day photographing a fashion editorial assignment for Rolling Stone . The retrospective revisits the legendary artist, whose groundbreaking 1996 show at the MFA, Herb Ritts: WORK, remains one of the most highly attended events in museum history with more than 253,000 visitors. According to the New York Times, though some have called Ritts 'formulaic, he 'belongs in the tradition of Richard Avedon, Louise Dahl-Wolfe and Irving Penn.' With a career that began in the late 1970's, the California-born Angelino rose to fame with his portraits and editorial shoots of fashion stars and celebrities. Ritts pointed his lens at Madonna, Michael Jackson, Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise to name but a few of the famous faces he snapped, publishing his work in such publications as Vogue, Vanity Fair, Interview and Rolling Stone. One of his sitter, Cindy Crawfiord once said of his work: 'There was something magical about when you stepped in front of his camera and what happened then. This give-and-take, and that’s what makes it fun. Come hither: Claudia Schiffer struck a sultry pose for Ritts in 1992 . Muscle man: Sylvester Stallone demonstrates his strength as he lifts Brigitte Nielsen on the beach in Long Island in 1987 . Globetrotter: Ritts also worked with Turlington on a Gianni Versace advertising campaign, which took them to the dry Mojave Desert lakebed known as El Mirage, where the vast open space gave him a sense of creative freedom . All about timing: He used the gusts of a rising storm to coax a swath of fabric into an arch over the model’s head in Versace Dress, Back View, El Mirage (1990) Fashions of the day: Mick Jagger photographed in 1987 at home in London, left, and a vest-wearing Richard Gear in 1978, right . 'I’ve had the opportunity to work with Helmut Newton to Avedon to Penn but probably the images that are the most timeless of me, most of them, were shot by Herb and are some of my favorite images of myself.' Crawford appears in one of Ritts’ most famous images, Stephanie, Cindy, Christy, Tatjana, Naomi, Hollywood (1989). Taken at the end of a long day photographing a fashion editorial assignment for Rolling Stone, the image also includes Stephanie Seymour, Tatjana Patitz, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington. The bevvy of supermodels appear naked sat huddled in a group together. Ritts applied this signature simplicity of composition and strength of form to advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein, Chanel and Gianni Versace among others, that are still instantly recognizable today.

Michael Jordan took a statuesque stance for Ritts in 1993 . And in the late Eighties, he turned his attention to the moving image directing adverts and music videos to huge critical acclaim. Paul Martineau, who previously curated a Los Angeles exhibit, once described Ritts as an impulsive photographer. 'He wasn’t someone who had everything scripted,' he told the New York Times. 'He approached shoots organically.' Of the works on view in the upcoming exhibit, 15 are from a recent gift from the Herb Ritts Foundation. This, and previous gifts from Ritts and the Foundation dating back to 2000, allow the museum to tell the full story of Ritts’ career, and comprise the largest museum holdings of Ritts photographs in the world - 248 in total. The exhibition explores every aspect of the photographer’s career, and is divided into two sections: one dedicated to the human body and one dedicated to his photographs of celebrity personalities. The exhibition will open on March 14 and run through to November 8 at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

"Lena Dunham's hit HBO series Girls is reimagined in the vein of Transformers director Michael Bay's action-packed blockbusters, which often feature bikini-clad women and massive explosions, in a new spoof video that takes aim the hyper-sexualization of women in Hollywood. The parody trailer for Hot Girls was directed by Alberto Belli and written by actresses Polina Frantsena and Stephanie Lynn, who used quotes and scenes from the feminist series and altered them to spoof the portrayal of women in movies and on television. 'We wanted to satire Hollywood sexism, so we took the most feminist show we could think of and Michael Bay-ified it,' Stephanie told The Hollywood Reporter. Scroll down for video . Feminist satire: Actresses Polina Frantsena (center right) and Stephanie Lynn (far left) wrote and star in 'Hot Girls', a parody video, which reimagines the HBO series as an action-packed Michael Bay film . Making a statement: The spoof features 'hot' versions the characters from Girls, including Hannah, Jessa, Shoshanna and Marnie, and shows them jumping into pools in bikinis and being sexy at all times . The footage begins with Polina, who plays 'Hot Hannah' in the spoof, reassuring herself that because she is from New York, she is 'naturally interesting' - while she leans seductively on a motorcycle wearing tiny denim shorts. The 'ultimate challenge' the show's four characters have to face is running in their high-heels to catch their Uber car that had arrived. Actor Brian Krause, who starred on the show Charmed, plays Hannah's boss in the clip. When Polina's character tells him that she 'can no longer work for free' he responds by noting: 'If you get hungry enough you will figure it out - but not literally. Do not put on any weight. You look great.' Shower scene: In the video, 'Hot Hannah' takes a sultry bath with her friend as she checks her text messages . Special effects: When Shoshanna attacks Marnie, she grows a Transformers-like tail . Hannah's boyfriend also berates her because of what she is wearing to the office. 'You can't wear that to work. You've got to dress sexier,' he yells. Hannah also makes out with her friends in the bathtub in the spoof version of Girls. She and her friends happily dance in skimpy lingerie and climb seductively out of pools in tiny bikinis, while explosives go off in the background. When 'Hot Marnie' explains to 'Hot Shoshanna' that she slept with 'Hot Ray', Shoshanna leaps on top of her and grows a Transformers-like tail. Parody plot: The girls 'ultimate challenge' is to run and meet their Uber driver . Role model: Hannah can be seen cutting a tiny bit of her hair off because she wants to look more like Kate Upton . New version: The clip also shows Hannah seductively riding a motorcycle . One scene in the HBO series, shows Lena's character giving herself an impromptu haircut inspired by actress Carey Mulligan. In the parody version, Hannah barely takes a centimeter off of her luscious blonde locks as she attempts to look more like model Kate Upton. At one point in the clip, Hannah cries that she has been '1.3lbs overweight' her entire life. 'It's been awful for me,' she yells. The trailer ends with a booming voice announcing: 'Four girls are the only hope left for the voice of our generation.' Sexy satire: In this version of girls, Hannah wears lingerie and eats a lollipop when she writes in her bed . Unrealistic: Shoshanna (left) and Marnie (right) dance in lingerie throughout the parody video . Boho babe: Jessa can be seen seductively staring at the camera as she lays on the couch .","Director Alberto Belli wanted to ‘satire Hollywood sexism’ with the parody clip, which is inspired by Michael Bay’s action films ."
"Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has been slammed by social media for his appearance in the new Oral B campaign, labelled the worst marketing campaign ever by unimpressed fans. It could have been the photo of him batting with an electric toothbrush, or holding a winning trophy labelled 'The Gnashes,' or even going undercover as a dentist for Oral B, but whichever it was, keyboard warriors acted immediately. He was mocked by being renamed 'Michael Plaque' and called a 'sellout' and 'money-grubber' as he is rumoured to be making $500,000 for the endorsement deal. Scroll down for video . Clarke has dropped the bat and picked up the toothbrush for his new 'True Blue Challenge' campaign with Oral B . Facebook has slammed Clarke for his endorsement calling him a 'sellout' and 'money-grubber' Clarke had donned these new pair of whites for a campaign called the 'True Blue Challenge,' aimed to boost Australia's oral health and overtake England by 'bowling them over.' 'This is outrageous Australia, the Poms are laughing at us, it's time to take action,' Clarke says in his Oral B adverts . 'I love beating the Poms on the cricket field, it's time to do it again with my oral health.' 'I love beating the Poms on the cricket field... It's time to do it again with my oral health,' Clarke says in his advert . One of Michael Clarke's ads pictures him holding a trophy labelled 'The Gnashes' advertising the 'True Blue Challenge' for Oral B . 'Michael Plaque' has been trending as Clarke's new name since the campaign was initiated . Facebookers have slammed the Australian cricket captain for the endorsement deal . Social media trolls even furthered their displeasure by comparing his campaign with his performance on the cricket field. 'Can't score more than 40 in grade cricket...may as well advertise mouthwash,' one disgruntled viewer said. 'Glad to see he managed to get through the entire commercial without an injury!' said another. Oral B initially began Clarke's involvement as a 'guess who' campaign with many fans recognising his tattoo . Michael Clarke even took to going undercover as a dentist for his Oral B endorsement deal . Clarke was made an ambassador for Spartan in 2012 which made much more sense to many of his fans . Clarke's tattoos have also received ridicule for their appearance in the adverts, especially the Arabic writing scrawled up his left arm, loosely translating to 'the pain of discipline is nothing like the pain of disappointment.' Viewers took to asking him to step down as captain due to the embarrassment of the endorsement deal calling him a 'goose' and a 'commercial whore.' Clarke has previously become an ambassador for Australian sport products company, Spartan, in 2012. He received mostly praise for this deal among fans.","The Aus cricket captain has been ridiculed on Facebook for new campaign .

"Furious residents are calling for the closure of a controversial landfill site, which overflowed leaving the streets infested with rats and trees filled with rubbish. Strong winds caused rubbish from the Blaydon Quarry, in Tyne and Wear, to be strewn across the neighbouring areas. Families living in nearby Ryton, Winlaton and Greenside said their children were not able to play outdoors as the litter from the quarry was being swept up in the gales. Some added they had been forced to take cattle from the fields. Residents have called for Octagon Green Solutions to 'clean up their act' after rubbish from the landfill site was strewn across the streets, leaving trees filled with rubbish and causing an infestation of rats . People living Ryton, Winlaton and Greenside, in Tyne and Wear, picketed the site in Lead Road, Blaydon, calling for better measure to stop waste overflowing . Staging a protest outside the site's main gates, locals demanded operators Octagon Green Solutions 'clean up their act'. They also launched a petition calling for better measures to stop rubbish from overflowing. But Blaydon MP Dave Anderson said the recent issue is just the latest in a 'catalogue of problems' and demanded the site, in Lead Road, be shut down. He said: 'I am not surprised that local people have felt the need to protest about Blaydon Quarry. The operation of this site has caused no end of nuisance and disturbance over recent years. 'My office and local councillors have been in almost constant dialogue with the Environment Agency and the council in an attempt to resolve the mismanagement of the site by the operator. 'The recent outbreak of litter and highways issues are just the latest in a catalogue of problems.' But Blaydon MP Dave Anderson said the recent issue at the site is just the latest in a 'catalogue of problems' Mr Anderson called for the controversial site, which has caused 'no end of nuisance and disturbance' over the years to be shut down . Local families, armed with placards, visited the site to demand its operators to start running the site responsibly. Sharon Westgarth, 43, of Greenside, said: 'It's happened quite a few times now but this was the final straw. 'We can't drive down the street because there are carrier bags flying all over, we have problems with rodents and there are always complaints about the smell.' The mother-of-one added: 'There aren't any nets up so the rubbish gets out. Something needs to be done.' Stephen Coles, 44, said the problems have 'got worse and worse over the years.' 'On Friday the rubbish was blowing all over the place,' he said. 'We have had enough now. These people need to wake up and start running the site responsibly. 'We have been putting up with it for years now and enough is enough. We want them to clean up their act.' Bosses at the quarry were served with a notice by officers from the Environment Agency following an investigation. But Mr Anderson said stronger action was needed, adding he will be meeting officers from the Environment Agency, Gateshead Council and Northumbria Police to review what action has been taken to ensure that Octagon Green Solutions 'take seriously their responsibilities going forward' He said: 'Strong action by the authorities against the operator is now long overdue and so I have written to them requesting that the site is shut down, until effective measures are put in place to protect local communities and the environment. Stephen Coles said: 'We have been putting up with it for years now and enough is enough. We want them to clean up their act.' Octagon Green Solutions declined to comment . 'I also want the authorities to be given greater powers over landfill site operators.' Environment Agency manager Julian Carrington added: 'We have started an immediate investigation into the circumstances which allowed this litter to escape from Blaydon and Pathhead landfill sites and our findings will determine what action we take against the site operators. 'Our officers were out on site over the weekend following a significant number of reports from local residents about wind-blown litter. 'We have served a notice on Octagon Green Solutions, which operates Blaydon Quarry landfill site, requiring it to clear the litter from the areas affected. This clean-up has begun and will continue until the litter is removed. 'We have told both sites to install and better position additional litter fencing and will be monitoring these actions closely.' Octagon Green Solutions declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.","High winds swept rubbish from overflowing Blaydon Quarry across region .

"Up to four serving MPs could be questioned by detectives investigating claims of an Establishment sex ring cover-up. Their names have been handed to officers probing an alleged conspiracy of silence that protected senior figures for decades. The MPs are suspected of holding important details about the handling of previous criminal inquiries. Four MPs could be questioned by detectives investigating claims of an Establishment sex ring cover-up and Steve Rodhouse, Scotland Yard, said they will go ‘where the evidence takes us' Scotland Yard’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse said officers will go ‘where the evidence takes us, without fear or favour’. He was speaking after the Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed it is looking at Met corruption claims from the 1970s to 2005. As questions continued to emerge yesterday about whether other powerful men escaped justice, it was claimed that: . Allegations: It has been claimed that the late Cyril Smith was held and freed seven times over 30 years by police investigating claims he was a paedophile . Last week the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced it is investigating a raft of cover-up allegations against the Met. The 14 separate referrals, which span four decades, indicate the scale of the task police face in getting to the bottom of historic child abuse cases. The allegations include suppressing evidence, hindering or halting investigations and covering up offences because of the involvement of MPs and police officers. Documents seen by the Daily Mail indicate that up to four serving MPs could be questioned as part of their work. None of the public figures has previously been named publicly in connection with the scandal. It is understood that victims believe they could hold highly sensitive information about their abusers which could help further their inquiries. It was also claimed yesterday that a member of the Queen’s family and an MP were identified as part of a major child abuse inquiry. But the Sunday Mirror claimed the operation was shut down by the Crown Prosecution Service for national security reasons. One former Met officer told the newspaper: ‘I was in a car with two other vice squad officers. They were discussing a madam who had provided a girl of about 15 to Oliver Reed. ‘The detective sergeant said he had just had a major child abuse investigation shut down by the CPS regarding a royal and an MP. ‘He did not mention names, but he said the CPS had said it was not in the public’s interest because it ‘could destabilise national security’.’ Separately, further inquiries are being carried out into whether detectives were told to limit a child abuse investigation centred on the former MP Lord Janner. A home belonging to the 86-year-old peer, who was a Labour MP in Leicester for 27 years, was searched in 2013. Last year it was reported that in 1989 a detective sergeant had been told not to arrest Janner or search his home. Earlier this month Home Secretary Theresa May appointed Justice Lowell Goddard to head a public inquiry into historic child sex abuse. The senior New Zealand judge will investigate whether public bodies and other institutions have ‘taken seriously their duty of care to protect children’. The reformed independent inquiry into child abuse will be able to ‘compel witnesses’ in a bid to get to the bottom of many difficult and complex claims. On Saturday, the Daily Mail revealed how Met deputy commissioner Albert Laugharne claimed he was part of one cover-up. He said that, while head of Lancashire police, he was asked to lie about allegations involving Smith, later unmasked as a paedophile. Sarah Green, deputy chairman of the IPCC, said: ‘I would like to reassure people our investigations will be thorough and robust.’","Four MPs could be questioned over 'Establishment sex ring cover-up'

"A Florida woman has been charged with fraud after claiming that she had cancer and collecting thousands of dollars from well-wishers. Kelly Johanneson, 36, of Citrus County, raised at least $4,400 after she disappeared for a month in 2013 and came back to tell her friends and neighbors that she had been diagnosed with stage four breast cancer. Her community rallied around her, holding fundraisers such as a barbeque and airboat event last year where a $2000 assault rifle was raffled off. Scroll down for video . Kelly Johanneson, 36, of Citrus County, Florida raised at least $4,400 after she told her friends and neighbors that she had been diagnosed with stage four breast cancer . She shaved her head and attended fundraisers such as the event held by the Citrus County Airboat Alliance wearing a bandana. A Go Fund Me page was set up for donations as well as a campaign on Our Backyard Foundation. 'Thank you to everyone that has given me their love, prayers and support during this very difficult time of my life. On behalf of my two beautiful children and all of my family you have my deepest appreciation and love,' she said on the site. It is not known how much money was raised through various avenues of giving. Police received a complaint about Johanneson in September and found that the woman in fact did not have cancer, but had been putting on an elaborate hoax that included shaving her head. She gave detectives paperwork that appeared to be from the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, but the treatment and research institute said that she was never a patient there. The community gathered around Johanneson and her supposed illness, holding fundraisers that brought in an unknown amount of money . Johanneson is being charged with a third degree organized fraud, a felony punishable in Florida by up to five years in prison . The center also said that the paperwork provided was falsified.

A day earlier, on March 12, she had been reported missing from Mill View Hospital in Nevill Avenue, Hove, a Sussex Police spokesman said. Police were initially unable to determine the gender of her body but a post-mortem examination later found it was a woman who had died from smoke inhalation. Detective Chief Inspector Karen Mizzi, of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'Specially trained officers are supporting Janet's family at this extremely difficult time. 'Although we have charged a man with murder, I am appealing for information from anyone who may have seen Janet on Thursday night 12th of March.

"Earth may have been witness to a stunning aurora displays, but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on Mars. Because Mars has a very thin atmosphere, the sun's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows. And their behaviour doesn't always follow existing rules. Nasa scientists were recently stunned to discover aurora that reaches deep into the Martian atmosphere. Artist’s conception of Maven's Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS) observing the “Christmas Lights Aurora"" on Mars. Maven observations show that aurora on Mars is similar to Earth’s ""Northern Lights"" but penetrates deep into the atmosphere . Earth has a magnetic shield, known as a magnetosphere, that protects its atmosphere from radiation from the sun. Aurora take place on Earth because some of the sun's energetic particles have managed to break through this shield. Mars, however, only has a very thin atmosphere. Its magnetosphere was lost billions of years ago turning a once watery world into the barren planet we see today. When solar particles hit the red planet, they can hit the atmosphere directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows. Maven's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) also observed what scientists have named 'Christmas lights.' For five days just before Dec. 25, Maven saw a bright ultraviolet auroral glow spanning Mars' northern hemisphere. Aurora, known on Earth as northern or southern lights, are caused by energetic particles like electrons crashing down into the atmosphere and causing the gas to glow. 'What's especially surprising about the aurora we saw is how deep in the atmosphere it occurs - much deeper than at Earth or elsewhere on Mars,' said Arnaud Stiepen, IUVS team member at the University of Colorado. 'The electrons producing it must be really energetic.' The source of the energetic particles appears to be the sun. Maven's Solar Energetic Particle instrument detected a huge surge in energetic electrons at the onset of the aurora. Billions of years ago, Mars lost a global protective magnetic field like Earth has, so solar particles can directly strike the atmosphere. The electrons producing the aurora have about 100 times more energy than you get from a spark of house current, so they can penetrate deeply in the atmosphere. They also made the unexpected discovery of dust about 93 miles (150 km) to 190 miles (300 km) above the red planet's surface. Although the source and composition of the dust are unknown, Nasa said there is no hazard to Maven probe and other spacecraft orbiting Mars. A map of Maven's auroral detections in December 2014 overlaid on Mars’ surface. The map shows that the aurora was widespread in the northern hemisphere, not tied to any geographic location. The aurora was detected in all observations during a 5-day period . 'If the dust originates from the atmosphere, this suggests we are missing some fundamental process in the Martian atmosphere,' said Laila Andersson of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospherics and Space Physics (CU LASP), Boulder, Colorado. It is unknown if the cloud is a temporary phenomenon or something long lasting. The cloud density is greatest at lower altitudes. However, even in the densest areas it is still very thin. So far, no indication of its presence has been seen in observations from any of the other Maven instruments. Possible sources for the observed dust include dust wafted up from the atmosphere; dust coming from Phobos and Deimos, the two moons of Mars; dust moving in the solar wind away from the sun; or debris orbiting the sun from comets. However, no known process on Mars can explain the appearance of dust in the observed locations from any of these sources. The findings are being presented this week at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas. Earth may have been witness to a stunning displays of the aurora (pictured), but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on Mars Because has a thin atmosphere, the sun's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper.  Nasa has only been able to detect the aurora rather capture it in an image .","Maven probe spotted ultraviolet auroral glow in northern hemisphere .

"A former Royal Marine soldier who was fired by Sir Alan Sugar on the Apprentice has pleaded guilty to punching a taxi driver while drunk. Chris Farrell was thrown out of the taxi on November 22 after calling the driver a p****, Wirral Magistrates Court heard today. The 31-year-old who appeared on the sixth series of the TV show in 2010 was on his way home with his partner after drinking a bottle of wine and a few beers. Apprentice: Former Apprentice star Chris Farrell (pictured in 2010) has pleaded guilty to punching a taxi driver while drunk - but claimed the 'unpleasant' man was aggressive towards him and his partner . Altercation: The 31-year-old ex-Royal Marine (circled) - who featured on the sixth series of the hit TV show - was thrown out of the taxi after calling the driver a 'p****' The taxi driver said he had been assaulted by a male and female according to prosecutor Alan Currums. He said: 'As he [taxi driver] approached the female he says he was punched in the face by the defendant. 'He said he was called 'a p****'. The taxi driver stopped the vehicle on the hard shoulder to call police.' 'The defendant had drunk a bottle of wine and a few beers but wouldn't say he was intoxicated. He said he was angry and upset with the driver.' Chair of the bench Eileen Ashton fined him £400 to be paid within 28 days. He was also ordered to pay £150 compensation to the taxi driver and a court fee of £125. The man who served in the Royal Marines for 10 years before becoming a businessman has previous convictions of drink driving, fraud and 'carrying an offensive weapon'. In February 2009, he pleaded guilty to possessing an extendable baton and knuckle-duster which was found in his Merceds car. Police were called to his home following allegations he hit ex-wife Clair and wounded her - drawing blood. TV star: Farrell appeared on the sixth series of the Apprentice and was fired by Sir Alan Sugar (centre) in week eight . And after completing filming for The Apprentice in 2010, he was reportedly hiding in Spain after his former boss revealed she had fired him due to claims of fraud. He was working on commission basis for Mortgages4Plymouth when Tricia Kennedy axed him. During his appearance in The Apprentice, Farrell said he was a sniper and he took 'that killer instinct across into business'. Gerry Pachter who was defending Farrell said: 'Mr Farrell regrets his behaviour that night. He is very remorseful but felt the taxi driver had been particularly unpleasant. 'He had been drinking during the course of the evening. Mr Farrell thought the taxi driver had been aggressive towards him and his partner. 'He recognises that he should've turned a blind eye. The taxi driver pulled up and kicked them out of the taxi - this is what got to them. It was dark and in an unsafe area.' He added: 'The taxi driver wasn't badly injured and there was no hospitalisation.' Mr Pachter said Mr Farrell works in a 'very important high profile unit' as a business manager at Port2Port Maritime Security in Salford. Port2Port provides ships with armed security to fight pirates, using ex-Royal Marines and Army commandos. Mr Pachter requested Mr Farrell be given a fine instead of a community order because it would be 'very difficult' for him due to his work commitments.","Chris Farrell was fired in eighth week of The Apprentice show aired in 2010 .

"Vani Hari has become known as the 'Food Babe' and has built a loyal following of her food blog, where she calls multi-national companies into account . As American fast food chains are forced to tackle the issues of healthy eating and using chemicals in their products, one woman's musings on the food industry are leading to sweeping changes. She is not a scientist, politician, policymaker or a trained nutritionist. Vani Hari is a food blogger. Her writing has earned her the nickname 'Food Babe' and a cult following  which has enabled her to influence large companies such as Kraft and Subway to stop putting chemicals into their food. Hari, of Charlotte in North Carolina, left her job as a managerial consultant to become a blogger in 2011 and began writing down and posting tweets about her concerns that chemicals were being used by some of America's biggest food chains. Four years later she has been named one of the '30 most influential people on the internet' by Time magazine and has influenced changes, such as Subway removing chemicals from its flour, the New York Post reported. However she has been criticised by experts who say her lack of scientific knowledge means she often mixes up the names of chemicals and their impact - and some of her comments can be likened to 'fear mongering.' Hari's most successful campaign was persuading Subway to stop using ingredients containing azodicarbonamide - a chemical used to bleach and condition flour, which is also found in yoga mats. The 34-year-old started a campaign by dubbing the compound the 'yoga mat chemical', which paid off when Subway agreed to change its recipe. 'Subway had to respond to the media blitz. It went worldwide. I was interviewed everywhere,' she told the Post. 'Before my campaign no one in the world knew about azodicarbonamide.' Subway changed its recipe but later claimed it had been planning to do so anyway. Hari was also involved in persuading Kraft not to use yellow dyes in its 'three mac-and-cheeses' and has piled pressure on Starbucks, accusing the company of adding hazardous chemicals to its pumpkin lattes. Among Hari's triumphs in getting companies to change the way they use chemicals are Subway and Kraft . She has recently been campaigning for butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) not to be used in cereals as a preserving agent. Hari said she began to call for change, which is documented in her book The Food Babe Way, released in February, after she noticed the success of others who spoke up about their food concerns - such as 'the pink slime campaign' against lean finely textured beef, after it was featured on a Jamie Oliver show. However her work has been criticised for its lack of scientific accuracy and mistakes. Hari's book The Food Babe way was released in February and has been published on the back of her blog . Yale neurologist Steve Novella has labelled her 'the Jenny McCarthy of food activism.' Dr Marion Nestle, of Yale University said that her mistakes were giving the industry a bad name - citing her confusion over ingredients that are used in beer and antifreeze. Nestle told the New York Post: 'She's making scientific judgments of these chemicals that may or may not be valid or may or may not be meaningful.' Throughout her book Hari stresses that chemicals are frequently added to food to improve profit margins rather than nutrition. She writes about her other successes, which include lobbying Chick-fil-a to remove dyes and artificial corn syrup from its products, Arts Atlanta reported.","Vani Hari is a food blogger and has become known as the 'Food Babe'

"Spanish neuroscientists claim low alcohol red wine produces more brain activity in ‘taste processioning’ areas, then stronger tipples. A stock image is shown . You might imagine that stronger wine would pack more of a punch in the flavour department. But Spanish neuroscientists claim that red wine with a low alcohol content produces more brain activity in ‘taste processioning’ areas, then stronger tipples. While the low alcohol bottles may not contain more flavour per se, people pay more attention to ‘fruity bouquets’ and ‘woody notes’ so the wine appears to be tastier. Neuroscientists led by Ram Frost, of the Basque centre of Cognition, Brain and Language in Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain, wrote in their study, published in the journal Plos One: ‘Over the last few decades, wine makers have been producing wines with a higher alcohol content, assuming that they are more appreciated by consumers. ‘To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic imaging to compare reactions of human subjects to different types of wine, focusing on brain regions critical for flavour processing and food reward.’ They noted that 30 years ago, it was typical for red wines to contain around 12 per cent alcohol, while now quality tipples can be 15 per cent. This is because wine makers ‘seem to… assume that strong wines are, on the average, more appreciated by wine consumers,’ Dr Frost said, adding that they seem more intense, which is considered desirable by some foodies. To reveal that stronger wines aren’t necessarily better, his team measured the brain activity of 21 volunteers in a fMRI scanner. During the scan, the volunteers had the enviable task of sipping samples of different red wines where one was low alcohol and another stronger, but they tasted similar. The researchers measured the brain activity of 21 volunteers in a fMRI scanner while they sipped red wine. They found: Contrary to expectation, significantly greater activation was found for low-alcohol than for high-alcohol content wines in brain regions that are sensitive to taste intensity, including the insula as well as the cerebellum. An image from the study showing brain activity triggered by wine is shown . ‘Contrary to expectation, significantly greater activation was found for low-alcohol than for high-alcohol content wines in brain regions that are sensitive to taste intensity, including the insula as well as the cerebellum', the researchers wrote. In fact, there was no part of the brain that responded more strongly to the more alcoholic wine, meaning that strong wines ‘induce weaker activation relative to the low-alcohol content ones’. This may be because people paid more attention to the flavours of the less potent wine, even though they are not more flavourful themselves, Discover Magazine reported. The experts hypothesised: ‘The low-alcohol content wines induced a greater attentional orienting and exploration of the sensory attributes of wines relatively to high-alcohol content wines.’ Wine critics have previously said that New World, or high alcohol wines, often lack the finesse of less potent options, because the alcohol overpowers some of the more subtle aromas and flavours. ‘The findings raise intriguing possibilities for objectively testing hypotheses regarding methods of producing a highly complex product such as wine,’ the researchers wrote.

Dozens of cheap and popular California wines are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic, claims a new lawsuit filed this week. Sutter Home, Korbel, Franzia and Trader Joe's Charles Shaw White Zifandel, also known as 'Two-Buck Chuck,' were just a few of the 31 wine brands the lawsuit claimed were unsafe. Twenty-eight California wineries were listed in the complaint, which is asking for a halt in production of the wines in question. A new lawsuit claims dozens of cheap and popular California Wine, including Franzia and Trader Joe's Charles Shaw White Zifandel, are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic . The lawsuit was filed by four individual Southern California wine consumers who, according to their attorney Brian Kabateck, had 1,306 wines tested at a Denver-based laboratory and then confirmed results with two additional laboratories. Kabateck said 83 wines, almost all of which sell for below $10 a bottle, contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water. The Environmental Protection Agency standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion - meaning that the tests allegedly found arsenic levels that were double the federal drinking water standard. 'This is a very serious public health concern,' Kabateck said. 'We would hope the wine industry would take these wines off the shelf immediately.' 'If not voluntarily, we would ask the court to do it.'","Spanish neuroscientists gave volunteers samples of red wine to drink while they scanned their brains in an fMRI machine .

"The birth of the forthcoming royal baby, due in April, will be marked with a special £5 coin . A £5 coin will be issued to celebrate the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child. The forthcoming royal baby - due mid to late April - will be fourth in line to the throne and is not expected to ever rule as monarch, but just like older brother Prince George the occasion will be marked with a commemorative coin. The Queen - the baby's great-grandmother - approved the decision at a meeting of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on March 19. Thousands of commemorative coins were struck to celebrate the arrival of George in July 2013 and sold out within days. The Royal Mint produced 10,000 solid silver crown-sized £5 coins, which cost £80 each, and 2,013 22 carat gold sovereigns, which cost £800 each. Both featured the prince's namesake St George. Babies born on the same day as George were also entitled to receive one of 2,013 free 'lucky' silver pennies. When George turned one, the occasion was also marked by a commemorative £5 coin - making him the first member of the royal family to have his first birthday honoured with a new UK coin. His christening was also marked with a coin. The coin to mark the new child's birth will be similar to the silver crown-sized piece that marked Prince George's first birthday on July 22, 2014 .","Birth of fourth-in-line, expected in April, will be marked with silver coins .

"Ahead of Mother's Day this weekend, Katie Price has revealed the highs and lows of caring for her disabled son, Harvey. The 12-year-old, whose father is former Manchester United footballer Dwight Yorke, has 'Prader-Willi syndrome' (PWS), a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems. He is on the autism spectrum, has limited vision and can't walk far unaided. Every day, he has to take six types of life-saving medication. Scroll down for video . Katie Price pictured with her 12-year-old son Harvey on today's This Morning . Mother-of-five Katie, 36, said caring for him can be challenging but she has the full support of her own mother, Amy Price, 62, who appeared on today's This Morning with her and Harvey. 'People say ""how do you cope?"" but I don't know any different,' Katie told presenters Eammon Holmes and Ruth Langsford. 'He is hard work, he does play up for mummy sometimes, don't you Harvey,' she said to him, to which he cheekily replied, 'yeah, babe.' Katie said one of the biggest challenges is controlling Harvey's hunger. A symptom of his condition is a constant desire to eat which can lead to dangerous weight gain. 'He just wants to eat, eat, eat and if we're not looking he will steal food,' Katie said. 'He's a big boy because of his thyroid and with Prader-Willi everything is about food.' When they go on a family holiday, they have to ensure they are near a hospital 'in case something happens' and daily life can be difficult because Harvey's behaviour is so unpredictable. Katie's mother, Amy, left, helps care her grandson who was born with a rare genetic condition . But as he approaches his teenage years, Katie said Harvey is also be a delight as his personality shines through. He loves to play instruments like the piano and drums and to draw. He produced a picture he had made especially for Eammon and Ruth during his appearance on the ITV show. He told them that he loves listening to music and his favourite song is Adele's Skyfall. On his health progress, grandmother Amy said: 'He doesn't have to use a braille machine which is a real bonus because we never thought he would be able to see let alone be able to read.' Katie, who won Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year, said she gets a lot of support from her husband Kieran Hayler, 27. 'He is so good with him,' she said of Kieran's relationship with Harvey. The couple have reconciled after Kieran cheated on Katie last year while she was pregnant with his daughter, Bunny, who was born last August. They also have a son, Jett, 19 months, while Katie has also two children with ex-husband Peter Andre, Princess, nine, and Junior, seven, as well as Harvey. The former glamour model said caring for Harvey is 'hard work' but she 'doesn't know any different' The Price family appeared on today's This Morning to raise awareness of Harvey's conditions . The former glamour model said her home will be a 'mad house' this Sunday as they will celebrate Mother's Day together and she will cook for her mother Amy. Earlier this year, Katie found herself embroiled in a controversy over using taxpayer's money for the care of Harvey. During her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, Katie Hopkins said the multi-millionaire should pay for her son to have a driver to take him to and from school instead of relying on the government. Harvey currently travels 50 miles daily from his home in West Sussex to south London, after his local specialist school was shut down. On the show, Katie claimed it would be 'ridiculous' to pay for it herself, suggesting the car could cost as much as £1,000 a day. She also insisted she pays 'over-the-odd taxes' which should entitle her to the same benefits as other parents. Earlier this year, Katie, pictured today, had to defend her right to use taxpayers' money to help transport Harvey to and from a school that can meet his needs . Ruth Langsford holds up a picture Harvey drew for her and husband and co-presenter Eammon Holmes . In a statement released by her management at the time, she said: 'Where any child that is placed in school out of the immediate home area it is the Local Authorities duty to provide transport that meets the child's needs. 'This is common practice for all disabled children as there are not enough suitable schools available to them. 'The cost of the school placement together with transport is not means tested as it is provided for the child. 'Local Authorities do not have special needs schools locally as these have been closed during the last 15 years as it was deemed a cheaper option to transport children out of borough. Harvey waves at the cameras as he and Katie arrive at the ITV studios for their TV appearance . Katie, pictured with husband Keiran at the Cheltenham Festival earlier this week, said he's great with Harvey . 'If Harvey's school was on his doorstep, as with schools for healthy children, then this would not apply but it was the Government's choice to close the special needs schools.' Meanwhile, on today's This Morning, Katie addressed rumours other whether she will appear on another popular reality TV show - Strictly Come Dancing. 'I'd love to do Strictly but no-one has asked,' she said.","Katie's first born Harvey has a rare genetic condition .

"An assistant nurse at UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, who tortured her adoptive children with a hammer in a spate of sickening attacks, has been sentenced to seven years to life in prison. The court heard that Ingrid Brewer, 53, of Palmdale, California, became increasingly sadistic, binding the children's hands with zip-ties and viciously beating them with electrical cords and a hammer. The seven-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy, who were found in the street in freezing temperatures after running away, testified that they were locked into separate bedrooms when Brewer went to work each day, were deprived of food and forced to use wastebaskets for a lavatory. Twisted: Ingrid Brewer, 53 (left), was found guilty of two counts of torture after she subjected her two small, adopted children to a sequence of horrific attacks with electrical cables, pipes and a hammer. She also deprived them of food and locked them in their room at her Palmdale home (right) while she went to work . Brewer was initially a foster mother to the children, but she then adopted them. Her conviction has raised questions about the standards applied to vetting prospective adoptive parents in the state. The LA Times reported that after Brewer’s arrest, it emerged that she had a history of child abuse investigations going back to 2001, when the county's child abuse hotline received a tip-off that she was abusing her biological children. However, social workers decided to take no further action. At the time of the adoption, Brewer's file contained at least nine investigations of alleged abuse over the previous 12 years, according to the LA Times. Both the boy and the girl were home-schooled by their reclusive adoptive mother in the middle-class suburb of Palmdale. Neighbours reported that Brewer was aloof and unfriendly, and one was not even aware that she had children. It was only due to the bravery of the eight-year-old boy that the torture came to light. ‘The brother was the one that managed to get himself out of his bedroom,’ Sgt. Brian Hudson of Los Angeles County's Special Victims Bureau told MyFoxLA after the children escaped in January 2013. ‘He managed to get his sister out of her bedroom and told her, “It's time to go, we've got to get out of this house.” The children, he said, who were 'tired of being tied up and beaten', escaped without their coats in freezing temperatures, and hid several blocks away. When Brewer became aware of the disappearance she called the police, who launched a search of the area. The children were found hours later, huddled under a blanket in the street in the bitter cold. They told officers about the torture they were suffering, and Brewer - who told detectives that one of the reasons she was locking the children up was because they had been stealing food - was arrested. Investigators said marks and injuries on the victims’ bodies were consistent with the abuse they described. The children were also apparently malnourished. In December, Brewer pleaded no contest to two counts of torture, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office. Brewer has been sentenced to seven years to life. She will be eligible for parole after seven years but may spend the rest of her life in prison.","Californian Ingrid Brewer, 53, found guilty of horrific abuse of a seven-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy .

"The Tsarnaev brothers reportedly learned how to build a pressure-cooker bomb from a jihadi magazine, but apparently that guide didn't include a step instructing them to throw out evidence of their purchases. On Wednesday, the jury deciding accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's fate were shown pictures of  inside his family's Honda Civic as well as his older brother Tamerlan's wallet, which contained receipts for bomb-making ingredients. Tamerlan was killed in a dramatic shootout with police, but his brother escaped for several hours before being caught hiding in a dry-docked boat. Tsarnaev, 21, faces the possibility of the death penalty for his role in the 2013 deadly bombings. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon. On Wednesday, the jury deciding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death penalty trial were shown pictures taken from inside his family's Honda Civic. They were also shown images of older brother Tamerlan's wallet (above) Observing: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (center) is seen in court on Wednesday in this sketch, as a fingerprint expert testifies . A bomb expert also testified in court on Wednesday, about the improvised weapons found at the scene of the Tsarnaevs' shootout with police in Watertown, days after the bombing . Members of the jury look at one of the unexploded bombs in court on Wednesday . Tamerlan's (left) wallet contained receipts from a gun and ammo store and for two backpacks at target. Defense attorneys for Dzhokhar (right) focused on the receipts in order to paint Tamerlan as the mastermind of the plot . Tsarnaev's lawyers showed the jury a photo of receipts Tamerlan had from a gun and ammunition store and for two backpacks and a soldering gun purchased in the days and weeks before the marathon bombings, apparently in an attempt to show that Tamerlan had a larger role in the bombings than Dzhokhar did. Also in the wallet was a MoneyGram receipt reflecting a $900 transfer to Russia by Tamerlan. But the prosecution made a case for Dzhokhar's equal participation on Wednesday, as they tried to connect him to the death of MIT police officer Sean Collier. The two brothers shot dead the campus police officer on April 18, after investigators released pictures of them as the primary suspects in the bombing. Two bloodied gloves were found near the gas pedal of the Honda Civic, and matched the DNA of slain MIT police officer Sean Collier . Fingerprints experts also revealed that Dzhokhar's prints had showed up throughout the Civic. It's still unclear whether he was driving the car that night . Forensics experts testified that Dzhokhar's fingerprints were found throughout the Honda. Jennifer Montgomery, a DNA analyst with the state police crime lab, testified Wednesday that blood was on a pair of gloves found near the gas pedal and driver's seat. The blood on the glove matched MIT police officer Sean Collier, but the defense pointed out on cross-examination that all of the blood tested on Dzhokhars's sweatshirt was his own. An MIT graduate student who was riding his bike by the scene of the shooting identified Dzhokhar as the man he saw leaning into Collier's police cruiser the night he was killed. Collier was shot six times, including three times in the head at close range. While it wasn't determined in court on Wednesday which brother was wearing the glove, the chance that Dzhokhar was the shooter could damage the defense's claim that he was just following his older brother. Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements that he participated in the bombings but said his older brother was the mastermind in hopes of convincing the jury to give him a lower life-in-prison sentence as opposed to the death penalty. On cross-examination, the defense pointed out that none of the blood tested on Dzhokhar's sweatshirt matched Officer Collier . A MIT graduate student has identified Dzhokhar as the man he saw leaning into Collier's car on the night of the shootout . After Collier's killing, the Tsarnaevs had a wild shootout with police in Watertown. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following the gunfight and being run over by his brother as he fled. Dzhokhar was found hours later, wounded and bloodied, hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown. During earlier testimony Wednesday, jurors were shown two pipe bombs hurled at police during the shootout. Neither of those bombs exploded, but a third pipe bomb did. A pressure-cooker bomb similar to the bombs used in the marathon attacks caused a powerful explosion that shook houses on the street and sent debris raining down on police. Trooper Robert McCarthy also showed the jury a Tupperware container filled with explosive powder and fuses found in a car stolen by the Tsarnaevs just before the firefight with police. Testimony is scheduled to resume Thursday . The Tsarnaev family Honda Civic seen on the left. It was apparently first purchased by their father.

"A police force has been accused of putting a  sex offender's 'human rights' before public safety after officers admitted they were trying to trace a missing individual but refused to reveal their name or gender. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed a person convicted of sex offences has disappeared from the Bolton area and could be anywhere in the UK. But despite a Freedom of Information request, the force is refusing to name the missing pervert or even say whether they were a man or a woman, bizarrely claiming the information was 'personal'. Greater Manchester Police have admitted they are attempting to trace a missing sex offender but will not release the name or gender of the individual . Yesterday MPs and locals in Bolton blasted GMP for their rigid stance - claiming it is a hindrance in actually finding the missing offender. Furious Julie Hilling, MP for Bolton West, said the police were offering protection to offenders who have 'broken the rules'. Ms Hilling said: 'These are people who are not fulfilling their legal duty but their human rights mean information cannot be released. 'It is no wonder they have disappeared and cannot be found.' Police say they don't name victims to ensure their safety. If a sex offender was named and attacked by vigilantes they may try to sue  under article 2 of the 1998 Human Rights act which protects 'any person from unlawful violence'. Angry Tony Lloyd, Greater Manchester's police and crime commissioner, said human rights legislation was never intended to protect registered sex offenders. He said he has spoken to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to ensure everything was being done to locate the missing offenders. Anger: Julie Hilling, MP for Bolton West, said police were offering protection to offenders who have 'broken the rules' He said: 'Where necessary and appropriate, police should enlist the help of the public. 'Human rights legislation was never intended to protect registered sex offenders who choose to go off the grid. 'It should never be the determining factor when police consider if they should release an offender's details. 'The police must retain the option to name people who may represent a danger to the public.' GMP initially refused to confirm the exact details of 23 missing sex offenders from their area - citing the risk of identifying individuals. Requests under Freedom of Information laws were refused, but police later disclosed that one offender from Bolton was missing after it was appealed by locals on the grounds of public interest. A police spokesman said routinely naming sex offenders could endanger them or lead to the identification of victims. Instead they said naming them was a weapon they only liked to use as a last resort. He added: 'If individual registered sex offenders are believed to present an imminent risk, then they can be named in the media.' Detective Superintendent Jon Chadwick said there were 2,700 registered sex offenders in Greater Manchester, with more than 600 subject to Sexual Offences Prevention Orders. He said: 'A large proportion of the recorded missing/wanted sex offenders are either known or believed to be living abroad or have returned to their country of origin. 'Of the 23 registered sex offenders registered in GMP whose whereabouts are currently unknown, 11 are strongly believed to be abroad and checks are in place should they return to the UK. 'The remaining 12 are subject to periodic reviews and enquiries in order to trace them and all are circulated as wanted.' Police justified withholding specific information about the missing offenders because it was 'personal' and would increase the risk of identification. Shoppers in Bolton expressed their frustration and anger that more information about who the missing person is has not been forthcoming. Earlier this month, freedom of information requests were sent to every police force in the UK to find out the number of missing registered sex offenders . Local resident Clare Cooke, 32, said: 'How can the public assist detectives if we don't know who he or she is? It's crazy. 'I would be furious if I later found out the person moving in next door to me was a wanted, convicted sex offender.' Cafe worker Karel Popovic, 26, said: 'Police show pictures of other wanted men and women so why is this different?' Earlier this month, freedom of information requests were sent to every police force in the UK to find out the number of missing registered sex offenders. Scotland Yard said the whereabouts of 167 registered sex offenders were unknown and the longest period of time an offender had been missing was 14 years, the force said. Cheshire Police refuse to name a missing registered sex offender - over fears of a vigilante attack saying one registered sex offender was missing but refused to say when their whereabouts became unknown. Merseyside Police said three registered sex offenders were missing, as of March 3, and all three had gone missing this year.","Greater Manchester Police  trying to trace a  sex offender from Bolton area .

"A fishmonger has been sentenced to death by hanging for the murder of two British medical students who were stabbed to death in Malaysia. Aidan Brunger and Neil Dalton, both 22, were attacked in a bar  in Kuching, Borneo, in August while on a work placement at a nearby hospital. Zulkipli Abdullah, 23, had denied murdering the Newcastle University students but admitted being part of a brawl with them and two other people. The death penalty is mandatory for murder in Malaysia. After the sentence was handed down, the parents of the victims paid tribute to their sons and spoke of the devastation their   'unprovoked and senseless' murders had caused. Scroll down for video .

Zulkipli Abdullah walks out of court in Kuching, Malaysia after being sentenced to death for the murders . Prosecutor Muhamad Iskandar Ahmad said the court ruled that Zulkipli's defence was 'merely an afterthought' and failed to raise any reasonable doubt in the case. Mr Brunger, of Hempstead, Kent, and Mr Dalton, of Ambergate, Derbyshire, were discovered lying in the road in the early hours of August 6. The two men had been working at a local hospital in Kuching - an area popular with backpackers. They were stabbed and killed after an incident in a bistro or cafe in the early hours of the morning, an inquest into their deaths heard last year. Five Malaysian men were later arrested but only Zulkipli was charged. His lawyer said he would appeal. Their fathers positively identified their sons' remains when they were flown back to the UK. In a joint statement today  Phil and Jan Dalton and Paul Brunger and Sue Hidson paid tribute to their sons who they described as 'kind, funny and full of life'. Mr Brunger (pictured) and Mr Dalton had been on a work placement at the Sarawak General Hospital . Mr Dalton (above) and Mr Brunger were discovered lying in the road in the early hours of August 6 . They said: 'Since Aidan and Neil were killed on 6 August 2014, our lives have been shattered. 'They were two exceptional young men with such promise - kind, funny and full of life. Their deaths have left their families and many good friends utterly devastated. 'Neil and Aidan were having a wonderful time in Borneo working in Sarawak Hospital and also travelling around seeing as much of the beautiful country as they could. 'Both boys said how very welcoming and friendly the people were. Our sons would soon have qualified as doctors. 'Their unprovoked and senseless murders as they were walking home after a night out with other medical students mean that Aidan and Neil will never have the chance to spend their lives caring for and helping others. 'They would have given so much to the world. We are so very proud of both of them and in what they achieved in their all too short lives. 'Although we are pleased that the man responsible for their murders has been held accountable, the guilty verdict does not bring our sons back.' Zulkipli Abdullah (pictured at an earlier hearing) has been found guilty of murdering the two students . They thanked their families and friends for helping through 'these distressing times' and asked to be allowed to 'grieve in peace'. Their British lawyer, Kieran Mitchell, from Slater and Gordon, said: 'This was a savage and unprovoked attack which lead to the death of two young men who had travelled to Borneo with the sole aim of using their medical skills to help people. 'Since that day the families have put their faith in the Borneo justice system, which is very different to our own, adding further strain and difficulty during this devastating ordeal. 'After a long and complicated trial they are relieved that justice has been done.' Violent crime against tourists and expatriates is generally rare in the Muslim-majority Southeast Asian country. But some recent incidents have sullied that image. Malaysian police in June last year found the body of a 34-year-old British tourist on the resort island of Tioman. The case is still being investigated. A month later, a court sentenced to death a Malaysian shopkeeper for the killing of a French female tourist in 2011, also on Tioman.","Aidan Brunger and Neil Dalton, both 22, were killed in Kuching on Borneo .

"Top French chef Marc Veyrat has vowed 'I'll be back' after a fire tore through his Alpine restaurant. The fire broke out Tuesday at the celebrity chef's La Maison du Bois, a wooden chalet 6,000 feet up in the French Alps near the Swiss border, causing substantial damage. Firefighters had extinguished the blaze inside the restaurant by mid-morning but were still battling to bring it under control as it ravaged the roof of the wooden structure. Inside the remains: Chef Marc Veyrat points to his fire-damaged La Maison du Bois restaurant. Authorities believe the blaze started in the kitchen . Charred remains: The fire ripped through the roof of the Alpine restaurant after starting in the kitchen . Authorities said it appeared to have started in the kitchens and spread rapidly to the dining area, where several pieces of antique furniture were destroyed. Veyrat, considered by some to be the finest chef in the world with six Michelin stars to his name, said a piece of 'cultural history' had been destroyed. 'This is a life and a piece of French cultural history that has just gone up in flames,' he said.

'It's not just a restaurant but also a museum of popular art showing several pieces of furniture from the region. It's sad, but I'm a fighter. I'll be back.' Known as much for roaming the countryside seeking wild herbs for his top-of-the-range dishes as for his trademark black hat, Veyrat has already suffered a forced break in his career. In 2009, he stopped work, saying he could no longer bear the physical strains of the kitchen after a serious ski accident. 6 Michelin stars: A meal prepared by the top chef at one of his other award-winning restaurants .

He handed back the six Michelin stars he had won for two separate three-star restaurants and only  re-entered the kitchen in 2013, opening his Alpine restaurant. Veyrat specialises in traditional dishes, with lots of wild herbs and a little 'molecular gastronomy', chemistry-inspired recipes that produce new textures such as emulsions in cuisine. But such Michelin-starred genius does not come cheap. According to his website, the top 12-course tasting menu at La Maison du Bois would set the diner back £225.

"A five-year-old boy is recovering after a sea lion that washed up on a San Diego beach bit him in the face. The boy was with his family at La Jolla Cove when he tried to pet the sea lion on Sunday. The animal, which was probably starving, 'snapped back its neck and lunged' at the boy. Scroll down for video . A five-year-old California boy suffered a 'minor puncture' when a Sea Lion bit him in the face in San Diego . The boy was with his family at La Jolla Cove (pictured) when he tried to pet the sea lion on Sunday . At least two sea lion attacks have been reported in the last three months, Fox 5 reported. The San Diego Fire and Rescue Department says the boy suffered a 'minor puncture' to his jaw. His family took him to a local hospital for examination. The incident was reported to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the LA Times reported. There have been a record number of sea lions washing up on Southern California beaches in 2015. Nearly 2,000 of the animals have washed up on the state's shores in sick and starving conditions so far this year. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) sounded the alarm over the surge in famished pups, saying there has been 'an unusually large increase' in sea lion strandings. In January and February, strandings were 20 times the average rate for those two months. Experts believe warming sea temperatures might be responsible for the enormous rise in strandings because the availability of fish and other sea lion food sources has been affected. Beachgoers are advised to stay away from mammals, some of which are emaciated and distressed.","Boy was with his family at La Jolla Cove on Sunday when he was bitten .

"The world gets a first proper look at Apple’s latest gadget tonight when the company launches its first smartwatch. With a price tag of about £220, the Apple Watch boasts a range of lifestyle functions – promising to open your car door, buy a coffee and even track your heart rate. The company hopes it will have a winner on its hands, even though sales of rival products by Samsung, LG and Sony have been sluggish and many smartwatches have a notoriously short battery life. Scroll down for video . Apple's latest gadget - the Apple Watch - will be unveiled on Monday night and comes with a price tag of £220 . However, Apple and its British design guru, Sir Jonathan Ive, plan to make the firm’s watch a lifestyle essential. Partnerships have been signed with car companies like BMW, which will allow users to open the vehicle door through the watch. It can also be paired with technology in the home and in hotel chain rooms to automatically let the user in without a key or smart card. There will be partnerships with airlines that will see the watch double as a boarding pass to allow users to sweep through airports more quickly. Importantly, it will be loaded with the new ‘Apple Pay’ technology, that will allow users to pay for a raft of purchases by waving the watch over a till point scanner. The system, which is tied in to user bank accounts, means people will buy lunch or pay for a train or bus ride without the need for cash. The watch, which will be linked to the owner’s iPhone via a Bluetooth link, will also provide a map and directions, vibrating on the wrist to warn of the need to make a turn. The first details of the watch were revealed by Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, in September last year . Importantly, it will also include a raft of health sensors and trackers, which will measure the heart rate and activity level as part of a program to boost fitness. When the first details of the watch were revealed last September, chief executive, Tim Cook, said: ‘We love to make great products that enrich people’s lives. We love to make technology more personal and allow our users to do things they never imagined. ‘We believe this new product will redefine what people expect from this category. This is the next chapter in Apple’s story. ‘It is the most personal watch ever created. It is incredibly customisable to find one that reflects your personal style and taste. It is also a comprehensive health and fitness device. ‘Being more active is being one of the best things you can do to improve your health. Apple Watch gives the ability to motivate people to be more active...or track what you are doing during the day.’ While the watch will have a starting price of around £220 it is suggested there will be a host of other premium versions, including one in gold that will cost as much as £3,325. As such, the company are presenting the device, which was created with input from Paul Deneve, the former chief executive of the fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, as very much a fashion item. The first version, which was unveiled in the autumn, featured a square steel and glass device with a range of case designs, digital watch faces and straps, some leather, some sporty, and one stainless steel to reflect the style of the wearer. It is controlled via a button on the side, which is called a ‘digital crown’ and looks much like the winder on a traditional watch. Sir Jonathan said: ‘Creating beautiful objects that are simple, pure and functional has always been our goal. We have designed a range of products so personal that you wear them on your wrist.’ Ernest Doku, technology expert at uSwitch.com, said: ‘Apple’s long-awaited entry to the wearables space will no doubt supercharge a market that otherwise seemed destined to be the preserve of techies and early adopters.’ The Apple Watch boasts a range of lifestyle functions including the 'Apple Play' software, which will allow users to avoid the need to use cash by simply waving the watch over a till point scanner . The latest speculation suggests that Apple is worried about battery life on the Watch - a common issue among existing smartwatches. Smartphone users already struggle with the relatively short battery life and adding the need to charge a new device will put some people off the whole idea. Mr Doku said: ’The reveal will hopefully give us greater insight into how this device will benefit our lives with a selection of dedicated app demos, a more finalised look at the software and user interface as well as those all-important price points - we entirely expect Apple’s premium positioning to continue in the wearables arena.’","Apple Watch has range of lifestyle functions including opening car door .

"At least half the audience may have been paying very close attention to the hunky leading man. But some viewers of Poldark will have appreciated the delightfully rustic charms of the backdrop to this story of love, jealousy and passion. In the BBC drama, the bustling town of Truro is a lost world of 18th-century wooden shop fronts, muddy thoroughfares and pens of geese and sheep. Which goes to prove how cleverly the producers disguised the fact that it is actually a real-life English market town a long horse ride from the series’ rugged Cornish setting. Scroll down for video . The Red Lion street market that's really a parking bay: The fictional pub The Red Lion, and its large wooden sign, was added to the street. Pens for animals, as well as a vegetable stall and a Punch and Judy show, were added to create a typical scene from the period . Demelza's dirt road that's really got yellow lines: The street where Poldark and his future wife Demelza walked is a real row of terrace houses in Corsham. The producers hid the modern double yellow lines under a fake dirt-covered road that looked as though it was from another era . Saddlery that's really a curry house: With its panelled frontage and rows of saddles, Truscott and Son is entirely convincing as an 18th-century saddlery. But the elaborate facade was required to hide a much more modern stalwart of the High Street - the Indian restaurant. Haque's Indian Cuisine had its signature green shop front hidden behind a carefully crafted set, complete with barrel and harness stands . When Captain Ross Poldark rescued his future wife, Demelza, from a gang of thugs in the first episode of the eight-part series, he was not in Cornwall at all, but more than 150 miles away in Corsham, Wiltshire. Though its stone buildings look believable on screen, these photographs reveal how the town usually looks — complete with Indian restaurant and baby clothes shop. The film crew arrived in town over the May Bank Holiday weekend, and the familiar shop fronts and neat parking spaces began to be replaced by dirt-covered roads, rickety carts and wandering horses. Tell-tale signs of the modern age, such as phone boxes and road signs, were cleverly hidden inside wooden shacks, or temporarily removed. The changes took just one weekend to complete, and took many residents by surprise. One told BBC News at the time: ‘It’s exciting, I didn’t know it was happening. I’ve just come down to the jeweller’s and found it all changed.’ Rope store that's really a flower shop: Theodora's flower show may have been in Corsham for 25 years but there was no space for it in Poldark's Truro. Tor turn it into a store for fishing equipment, the TV crew covered over the modern florist's shop with a weathered wooden casing and accessorised it with benches, baskets, fishing tackle and coils of rope. You can almost smell the sea... Wheelwright's that's really a baby boutique: Vickery the wheelwright's is actually a children's clothes shop, so the colourful shop front had to be boarded over and the nearby modern metal gate hidden behind panelling. The road was covered and the pavement intentionally scuffed to turn back the centuries. A panoply of wheelwright's instruments were placed in front of the 18th-century store . Shed that's a phone box: A phone box was cleverly hidden in a wooden shed and a hay cart added to complete the rustic look . Filming took just a week and people were allowed to use the High Street between scenes, as many businesses stayed open. A council spokesman said any shops which saw trading hit by the temporary intrusion were compensated by the production company. ‘Most people loved it, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Over the course of a week, more and more people came to watch.’ With more than six million viewers tuning in to each of the first three episodes of the series, Poldark’s brooding leading man Aidan Turner has garnered a legion of breathless fans. That success means it may not be long before tourists are beating a path to Corsham, which has already played host to other high-profile productions, including War Horse and The Suspicions Of Mr Whicher. Its latest transformation was so impressive that a special photography exhibition has been arranged by the council showcasing the High Street before and during filming. It’s on display in the town hall and closes on Friday — two days before the next bodice-ripping instalment of Poldark.","How the team behind BBC's Poldark transformed Corsham in Wiltshire into 18th-century Truro in Cornwall .

"Renowned: Rupert Brooke wrote celebrated poems such as The Soldier . The myth paints him as an Edwardian hero and a romantic symbol for a lost generation. But a new book about Rupert Brooke’s affair with suffragette Phyllis Gardner reveals the shocking truth about the poet a century after his death. He was a celebrity of his age, lauded by Winston Churchill as among ‘England’s noblest sons’, and described by WB Yeats as ‘the handsomest young man in England’. But the writer of celebrated poems such as The Soldier is now shown to have been a fierce opponent of women’s rights who privately declared, ‘All women are beasts’. The book, The Second I Saw You: The True Love Story of Rupert Brooke and Phyllis Gardner, draws on forgotten letters between the pair, as well as Gardner’s unpublished memoir. Brooke died from septicaemia in April 1915 as a Royal Navy reserve officer on his way to take part in the Gallipoli landings after a mosquito bite became infected. He was just 27 and the book is being released by The British Library to mark the centenary of his passing. Gardner and Brooke met when he was 25 and she was 22 and they set opposite each other on a train to Cambridge. Gardner wrote in her journal that neither spoke to the other but she spent the time sketching him and added: ‘I drew him steadily all the way to Cambridge and the more I drew him the better I liked him.’ She was the daughter of eminent archaeologist Ernest Arthur Gardner and it was her mother, an amateur poet who longed to be a member of literary circles, who encouraged the affair. The young Gardner soon became infatuated, writing the poet was: ‘The Alpha and Omega of my life’. Brooke was a celebrity of his age, lauded by Winston Churchill as among ‘England’s noblest sons’ Brooke seems to have been awkward and unsure in his feelings but did compose the poem Beauty and Beauty for her. However, after initial trysts, including night time skinny dipping Bryon’s Pool in Grantchester, the affair turned cold. It was under this strain that Brooke’s true feelings began to surface, with him declaring: ‘All women are beasts! And they want a vote - but they’ll never get it,’ an insult to Gardner’s suffragette activities. The poet’s repressed sexuality has been widely discussed by academics and Gardner writes how her lover, who she described as boring in bed, finally managed to express his opinions on sexuality. He said: ‘There are two ways of loving, the normal and the wandering. The normal is to love and marry one person, the wandering is to take what one wants where one finds it, to be friends here, lovers there, married there, to spend a day with one, a week with others’. Gardner’s mother finally decided to end the relationship and Brooke fled abroad. He died two years later. Gardner finished her memoir in 1918 but it was never published. She died from breast cancer in 1939 and, nine years later, the documents were given to the British Museum by his sister, Delphis. She was not revealed to have been his lover until 2000, when the letters and memoir were first unearthed by the British Library.","Celebrated writer produced renowned war poems including The Soldier .

"A café owner was forced to shut up shop for three days after bungling council officials erected a fairground ride just inches from his  window. Paul Meakin, 31, turned up to work on Monday to find the huge structure blocking the entrance to his family-run cafe in Grantham, Lincolnshire. Workers had positioned the carousel-style attraction so close to the front door that it could not even be fully opened. Taken for a ride: A café owner in Grantham, Lincolnshire, was forced to shut up shop for three days after the local council put up a fairground carousel ride just inches from his shop window . Sandwiched in: Workers had positioned the carousel-style attraction so close to the front door of Cafe Leo that it could not even be fully opened . And even though the council apparently agreed the positioning was rather inconvenient, officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up for the event. Mr Meakin now has to wait until tomorrow, the end of the local Mid-Lent Fair, to re-open the cafe. He said: 'What customer wants to sit having a coffee and look out the window at the back end of a giant fairground ride. It was just really inconsiderate to say the least. 'Everybody thought we were closed anyway. You couldn't get anywhere near the shop really. It was unbelievable. 'It was literally 3ft away from the window. Who could ever think that was a good idea?' Mr Meakin, who runs the cafe with wife Jessica, said the 'barmy' decision forced him to close the cafe, a move which he said cost his business at least £1,000. Clear view: Mr Meakin could barely see out of the window after the ride was put up directly outside the cafe . Prettier sight: The area where Mr Meakin usually puts tables and chairs (pictured) for al fresco diners was also completely taken over . He claimed the ride had so badly obstructed the view that the entire premises was plunged into darkness. And the area where Mr Meakin usually puts tables and chairs for al fresco diners was also completely taken over by the attraction. He added: 'I had no choice but to close on health and safety grounds. Takings are down over a £1,000 at least. 'My worry was if we had to evacuate a hoard of people would just have been blocked off by a ride and a lamppost. 'The council just don't seem to consider small local businesses here. It was a barmy decision.' Baffled: Paul Meakin, 31, pictured with his wife and business partner Jessica, said he had to close the business for most of the week, a move which cost him around £1,000 in profit . Mr Meakin was forced to close the café early on Monday afternoon. It remained closed all day Tuesday, Wednesday and today. He is due to reopen tomorrow, once the fair has ended. He said: 'The ride position was just not acceptable so we left it until the council came back and had a proper look. 'When somebody from the council came they agreed and said it's unacceptable so I don't know how someone could have said it was before. 'I used to get nervous about the fair coming but because the past few years it's been the same ride it didn't cause me any concern. Even though South Kesteven District Council agreed the ride (pictured in use at the fair) had been positioned incorrectly, Mr Meakin said officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up . 'In terms of compensation the council said they would just look into it. 'We asked to see copies of the risk assessments so we knew we weren't liable if anything happened but they said they couldn't provide them.' He added: 'We have been here for four years and it's been the same ride every year but it's been in a sensible place. Regular customer Frank Rhimes, 66, said: 'Somebody at the council needs their heads examining. 'I couldn't believe it when I turned up for my daily coffee and saw this massive ride looming over the shop. It just makes you wonder who makes these kind of decisions.' A South Kesteven District Council spokeswoman said: 'We are facilitating a solution between the showman responsible for the ride and the cafe owner.'","Paul Meakin arrived at work on Monday to find huge ride blocking entrance .

"Boxing champion Errol Christie has revealed he is battling lung cancer in what he says is the toughest fight of his life. The 51-year-old former European middleweight champion has started chemotherapy, walking to a hospital near his south London home for each session to keep fit. The determined former boxer, who has never smoked, vowed that he would conquer cancer. Boxing champion Errol Christie (left) has revealed he is battling lung cancer in what he says is the toughest fight of his life . He told the Sunday People: 'I am just starting my treatment. I've had my first round of chemo and it has really been tough but I am going to beat this.' Christie's son Louie, 26, said that his father had been unwell for a while but was only recently diagnosed with lung cancer. Louie, who is also a boxer, said: 'It is a real shock because my dad has always been fit and has never smoked or drunk – it seems so unfair. 'Being who he is, he didn’t want to make a fuss when he felt unwell. He thought it would clear up. 'It was a real shock when he got the results back. We were both stunned. But he is ­remaining positive and has vowed to beat it. He is determined to get well. I’m very proud of how he is coping.' Christie, pictured during his memorable bout with Mark Kaylor (right) in 1985, has started chemotherapy . Explosive: Christie (right) and Kaylor got up close and personal while promoting their clash in 1985 . Christie was training amateur boxers, including X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, at Gym Box in London until last week but has been forced to put that on hold to focus on fighting his illness. Christie's son was due to make his boxing debut as a featherweight next month but this has now been put on hold because of his father's diagnosis. During his boxing career, the former champion fought 41 bouts, taking 32 wins including 26 by knockout. He suffered eight defeats, most memorably to Mark Kaylor in 1985. The infamous match was preceded by an ugly scuffle at the pre-fight conference, and when the boxing finally got underway Christie lost in nine rounds in a match where both men were floored. Although he boxed on into the early 90s, he was never the same fighter again and hung up his gloves in 1993. Christie's greatest success came in 1982 when he defeated Mow Gruciano in what was then East Germany to take the European middleweight belt. The father-of-one was involved in a scuffle with fellow former boxer Lloyd Honeyghan last October during a Boxing Writer's Club dinner at the Savoy Hotel in London. Frank Bruno had to step in to separate the pair after they squared up, but no punches were thrown. Christie said at the time: 'There was a bit of an incident with Lloyd. I don't know what planet he was on but it's different from the rest of us. No punches were thrown. He was just mouthing off, acting the big shot.'","Errol Christie has revealed that he has been diagnosed with lung cancer .

"A former waitress was awarded $1million eight years after her nightclub owner boss was convicted for sexually abusing and forcibly touching her in a storage closet at work. Nicole Slama, 30, was working at the now-shuttered New York club Quo in December 2007 when her employer, Gary Malhotra, told her he wanted to talk to her about a job opportunity at a new venue. That's when Malhotra pushed Slama into the closet, blocking the door with his body, and offered the waitress cocaine before asking if he could snort a line off her body, Salma's lawsuit claimed. Slama said that, after she declined, Malhotra then complimented her backside before telling her 'I want to sniff it off your a**'. Malhotra then grabbed her backside and chest and, according to the suit, told Slama he would sniff cocaine off her breast as she cried out for him to stop. Slama said that, after she continued to resist, her boss said she had to let him snort a line off her shoulder 'because you work for me' and then slipped off one of her tank top's straps. He then shook cocaine on Slama's shoulder and 'snorted the line' off it before he 'began licking her shoulder and neck,' according to court papers. Slama said she tried to push her boss away the entire time but he was 'much larger and overpowered her'. It wasn't until Malhorta left for a cigarette break that Slama said she was able to sneak out and  report the incident to police. Malhorta was convicted of sexual abuse, harassment and forcible touching in 2009. He was sentenced to five days of community service, according to the New York Daily News. In 2010 Slama filed a $3.5million civil suit against her former boss, suing him for sexual harassment and mental anguish.

"Five suspects including a policeman who served in Chechnya have appeared in court over the assassination of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. Their appearances come a week after the 55-year-old was shot four times in the back while walking along a bridge in full view of the Kremlin with his model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, 23. One of the suspects - Zaur Dadayev - has allegedly made a statement confirming his guilt, Judge Nataliya Mushnikova said. She did not specify his actions. All of the men were escorted from a bus to Basmanny district court, in Moscow, with their hands bound in front of them and masked men standing either side. Scroll down for video . Five suspects including a policeman who served in Chechnya have appeared in a Moscow court over the assassination of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. One of the suspects, Tamerlan Eskerkhanov, is pictured above . Another suspect is Zaur Dadayev, who is believed to have served for around ten years in the 'Sever' battalion, part of the interior ministry of Chechnya. Judge Nataliya Mushnikova said he has now made a statement confirming his involvement . Once inside they continued to be flanked by armed guards and were forced to speak from a defendant's cage. The Investigative Committee, the state agency leading the investigation, applied to the court to formally arrest the suspects. All five will now remain in custody. Meanwhile a sixth man thought to be involved in Mr Nemtsov's death blew himself up  after being approached by police at his apartment block, Interfax said. The 30-year-old reportedly threw a grenade at officers in Grozny, Chechnya, on Saturday night before setting one off near himself. The court heard that Dadayev, 33, served for around ten years in the 'Sever' battalion, which is part of the interior ministry of Chechnya. His sister confirmed that he had won medals for bravery and courage. Judge Mushnikova added: 'Dadayev’s involvement in committing this crime is confirmed by, apart from his own confession, the totality of evidence gathered as part of this criminal case.' Anzor Gubashev, who worked for a private security company in Moscow, was named as another suspect. He denied any involvement. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's federal security service, said Dadayev and Gubashev were 'suspected of carrying out the crime'. It was not clear if either of the men were believed to have fired the shots that killed Mr Nemtsov. Nemtsov (left) and his 23-year-old model girlfriend, Anna Duritskaya (right), were walking through Moscow when he was shot four times in the back . The masked men who escorted the suspects up a set of stairs carried large guns and kept completely covered in dark clothing . Russian state investigators said they are seeking the arrest of five suspects, who appeared in court earlier today . Even when they were inside the building the suspects were kept bent over and well within the grasps of the armed guards . Four guards escort Dadayev, one of the main suspects, to and from the courtroom. They carry several guns between them as well as radios . Dadayev, 33, was forced to speak from inside a defendants' cage during the hearing at the district court . Anzor Gubashev is escorted by a policeman and uses a woolly grey hat to cover his face. State news agencies reported that Gubashev worked for a private security company in Moscow . Three unidentified suspects hide their faces using their jackets and jumpers while waiting behind bars in the courtroom . Aaimani Dadayeva, mother of Dadayev, said she was stunned at the arrest of her son. 'I was informed today that my son has been detained on suspicion of involvement in Boris Nemtsov's murder,' she told Interfax late on Saturday. 'I can't believe it. He could not have committed this crime.' Reports suggest the other suspects include Gubashev's younger brother Shagid and two men - Tamerlan Eskerkhanov and Khamzat Bakhayev. Mr Bortnikov added that the developments had been reported to the president, but he stressed they were continuing 'necessary operative and investigative work' on the case. One suspect, whose face could not be seen, was escorted into the court building by two masked guards who held on to his collar . Another suspect pulled the hood of his grey jacket over his face and had his hands bound in front of him . Russian police guard the yard of Basmanny district court, in Moscow, where the suspects in the killing of Mr Nemtsov were delivered . Russian policemen guard the yard of the court after the suspects arrived via bus and were taken inside . At the time of his death Mr Nemtsov had been working on a report about Russian military involvement in the eastern Ukraine conflict. He was also in the midst of organising a march against the war and had written a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and other politicians to alleged corruption. The shooting occurred a few hours after he had made a radio appearance denouncing Putin for 'mad, aggressive' policies in Ukraine. Surveillance footage apparently showed a man climbing into a white getaway car and being driven away. Russian officials have denied any involvement, with President Vladimir Putin dubbing the murder a 'provocation'. In a speech with officials from the interior ministry, Putin said: 'The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends an annual expanded meeting of the Interior Ministry's Board on March 4. He said: 'The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext' The body of Mr Nemtsov lies in a body bag in central Moscow in the hours after he was gunned down. He had been organising a march in opposition to the Ukraine conflict at the time of his death . 'Russia should be devoid at last of the kind of shame and tragedies that we have recently endured and seen. 'I mean the murder, the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov right in the centre of the capital.' He added that he would do all he could to ensure the killers were brought to justice, but has made no comment on the detentions. Russia's top investigative body said it was looking into several possible motives, including that Mr Nemtsov was killed in an attempt to smear Putin's image. It said it was also examining possible connections to Islamic extremism and Mr Nemtsov's personal life. Mourners follow the open-coffin of Mr Nemtsov during a farewell ceremony at the Sakharov centre on Tuesday . Hundreds of floral tributes including bunches of red roses were left on the grave of the murdered Russian opposition leader  after a burial ceremony . A woman weeps as she looks looks towards the coffin of Mr Nemtsov during the farewell ceremony . But Mr Nemtsov's associates said they will only be satisfied if prosecutors track down whoever orchestrated the killing, and not just the people who pulled the trigger. Ilya Yashin, one of Mr Nemtsov's closest allies, said: 'It's extremely important that the matter not be limited to detention of the shooters, whether these are the real killers or not. 'The key task is the identification and detention of who ordered the attack.' Thousands of Russians paid their final respects to Mr Nemtsov when he was laid to rest in the capital earlier this week. The politician's mother Dina, 87, and four children led the mourners with ex-UK prime minister Sir John Major also attending.","Investigative Committee applied to court for formal arrest of five suspects accused of Boris Nemtsov's murder .

"Clairvoyant Timothy Abbott swindled almost £70,000 in disability benefit by claiming he could barely walk . A clairvoyant who swindled almost £70,000 in disability benefit by claiming he could barely was jailed after he was filmed working out in a gym. Spiritualist Timothy Abbott, 53, conned the taxpayer out of thousands of pounds in disability, council tax and housing benefits along with his wife Jeanette, 46. The couple pocketed a total of £170,000 during their 16-year scam, including Mr Abbott taking £35,496 in incapacity benefit and £22,848 in disability living allowance. The medium was filmed lifting heavy dumbbells, using an exercise bike, rowing machine and running on a treadmill and pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to notify the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) of a change in circumstances. Mr Abbott also admitted conning HMRC out of £9,532 by failing to pay income tax or national insurance contributions. Meanwhile his wife falsely claimed £19,477 in disability allowance and £713 in incapacity benefit, along with £1,000 in council tax benefit, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard. Investigators filmed her bending down and carrying a heavy shoulder bag while on a shopping trip in 2012. She also failed to pay £37,000 worth of income support and conned Staffordshire County Council out of £44,000 in housing benefits. On his website, Abbott is described as being one of Britain's most 'evidential platform Mediums'. It goes on to say he was aware of the spirit world from the age of 19 before he 'embarked on his journey of development' by studying for over 30 years. His services are apparently in demand in countries such as Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Canada. He and his wife lived together in a modern £200,000 detached house in Stafford until their scam, which went on for 16 years between 1998 and 2014, was rumbled. Mr Abbott - who advertises himself as an 'international spiritualist clairvoyant medium and tutor' - was yesterday jailed for eight months. Mrs Abbott admitted three counts of failing to notify the DWP of a change in circumstances, one count of making a false statement and one of falsely obtaining benefits by deception. She was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. Abbott's scam was rumbled after investigators filmed him working out in a gym and lifting dumbbells . Abbott (pictured on a rowing machine) also admitted conning HMRC out of £9,532 by failing to pay income tax or national insurance contributions . The medium pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to notify the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) of a change in circumstances after he was filmed in a gym while claiming thousands in disability benefits . His wife Jeanette also falsely claimed a raft of benefits and was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months . After the case, a DWP spokesman said: 'Benefit fraud is a crime and we are dedicated to catching those who commit it. 'Only a small minority of benefit claimants are dishonest, but cases like this cost the taxpayer money that should be used to help those in need. 'We are determined to find those who we suspect are cheating the system by following up on tip-offs, undertaking surveillance and working with local councils.' A proceeds of crime hearing on June 30 will determine how much the couple must pay back. Speaking after the sentencing, Mrs Abbott said: 'It has been two and half years of hell and I don't really want to talk about it as my husband got put away yesterday. It's killing me.' 'In our opinion the truth has not been fully told and we feel very unfairly treated.'","Spiritualist Timothy Abbott, 53, jailed for £170,000 disability benefit scam .

"Our ancestors typically rose with the sun and went to sleep when it set, but modern life and artificial lighting has pushed this routine out of sync. However, researchers have discovered a rural community in Brazil that still follows the natural sleep cycles of the past  - despite having access to the same technology as its urban neighbours. And they now plan to study this group to learn more about how our move away from the natural rhythm could be damaging our health. Researchers have discovered a rural community in Brazil that follows the 'natural sleep cycles' (stock image) of our ancestors who rose with the sun, and typically went to bed when it set. The experts now plan to study this group to learn more about how our move away from the natural rhythm could be damaging our health . The community was discovered in the small town of Baependi in south-eastern Brazil in the state of Minais Gerais. Researchers from the University of Surrey and the University of São Paulo studied the population and asked them questions about their sleep habits and patterns. 'In big cities, the availability of cheap electricity has brought us both artificial lighting and a multitude of other electronic devices that compete with us going to sleep at night,' said lead author Dr Malcolm von Schantz from the University of Surrey. 'As a result, most of us go to bed much later than our ancestors did, and, many of us are sleeping less. 'Even though the people in Baependi have access to electricity and television, their daily rhythms are much closer to those of previous generations. 'Studying this population is like being able to look back at past generations through a pair of binoculars and provide an insight into the benefit this natural pattern may be having on their health.' Historian Roger Ekirch of Virginia Tech recently revealed an 'overwhelming amount of historical evidence' that suggested we used to sleep in stages. He found more than 500 references about ancestors sleeping in two shorter periods throughout the night. The total sleep would occur in a 12-hour period that began with up to four hours sleep, an 'awake period' of four hours and then ended with a second four-hour sleep. These days it is widely accepted human sleep patterns are governed by the 'circadian rhythm'. This is the 24-hour cycle of being awake and then, when it becomes dark, resting. 'However, built into this 24-hour pattern is a series of shorter cycles of about 90 minutes - called the ""ultradian rhythm"",' added Dr Nerina Ramlakhan, author of Tired But Wired: How To Overcome Your Sleep Problems. This explains smaller peaks and troughs of energy throughout the day. Dr Ramlakhan believes this ultradian rhythm is a throwback to our hunter-gatherer years. And while we tend to pay much more attention to the 24-hour cycle than the 90-minute one, Dr Ramlakhan believes the body works best when we move with these natural ultradian rhythms, building in pauses, stopping and resting, so continually renewing our energy. The community was discovered in Baependi (marked) in south-eastern Brazil. Residents were asked when they would prefer to wake up and go to bed, and the average answers from the town dwellers were 07.15am and 22.20pm. Whereas people in the countryside preferred to rise at 06.30am and go to bed at 21.20pm . In particular, the residents were asked when they would prefer to wake up and go to bed if they were completely free to plan their day. The average answers from town residents were 07.15 and 22.20, whereas people in the surrounding countryside preferred to rise at 06.30am and go to bed at 21.20. The researchers believe  the difference is due to town residents following much less of a natural sleep/wake cycle because of the influence of artificial lighting. 'When we asked the same question in London, the average answers were 08.30am and 23.15pm,' continued Dr von Schantz. The paper explained that people in Baependi maintain a stronger link with the so-called solar rhythm because they predominantly work outdoors. They therefore have similar patterns as pre-industrial ancestors.  Town residents follow less of a natural sleep/wake cycle because of the influence of artificial lighting (stock image) The paper explained that the people of Baependi, especially those in the countryside, maintain a much stronger link with the so-called solar rhythm. This is because they predominantly work outdoors and therefore have similar patterns as our pre-industrial ancestors. Solar time uses the mid-points of the light and dark 'periods' - notably midnight and noon - as timing references. In circadian rhythms, sunrise start this clock on its 24-hour run, but this continues regardless of a shift in when the sun sets meaning the mid-points vary. 'Midnight really represents the middle of the dark phase, and yet many of us in the industrialised world are not even in bed by then,' continued Dr von Schantz. 'Our colleagues at the University of São Paulo have studied this population, so there is a lot of data emerging about the health outcomes of the same population. 'We are optimistic that this project will teach us to what extent cardiovascular health, obesity, diabetes, and mental health problems may be associated with our move away from the natural day/night cycle, and the associated sleep loss.'","Study has found a Brazilian community with 'pre-industrial' sleeping habits .

"A baby, a dog and a young couple embracing each other are among the models used in a remarkable new photo series which captures people as they are drenched in honey from head to toe.

"Wife of senator Glenn Lazarus, Tess has revealed she was dropped from the Palmer United Party after standing up to Clive Palmer . The wife of senator Glenn Lazarus has revealed she was dropped from the Palmer United Party after standing up to Clive Palmer. Tess Lazarus, who was sacked as chief of staff for 'failing to comply', said her husband decided to quit because the pair did not tolerate 'bullying behaviour' but the Palmer United Party leader has denied these claims. 'I did make it clear to Clive that I was not happy with being bullied and spoken to using foul language,' she said, according to Sydney Morning Herald. 'I do not think that anyone should have to put up with this behaviour in the workplace. Glenn and I do not agree with bullying behaviour.' But Mr Palmer has hit back, telling Fairfax Media: 'I've never bullied anyone.' The claims follow after Mr Palmer slammed Mr Lazarus for being 'unprofessional' when the senator announced his resignation from the Palmer United Party via a text message. The Queensland senator told Mr Palmer in a text message on Thursday night he was quitting to serve as an independent. But in response to the departure, the PUP leader replied with one word: 'OK'. The senator's decision came just hours after his wife Tess was sacked from her party role. Scroll down for video . Tess Lazarus (centre) said her husband (left) decided to quit because the pair did not tolerate 'bullying' Queensland Senator Glenn Lazarus told Clive Palmer in a text message he was quitting to sit as independent . Senator Lazarus said the sacking was 'one of many things' forcing him to call it quits, but the key reason was Mr Palmer's dictatorial style and announcement of policies without consulting him. 'I have a different view of team work,' he said. It leaves PUP with just one senator - Western Australia's Dio Wang - and means the government now has to negotiate separately with all eight Senate crossbenchers in order to get six of them onside to pass legislation. Meanwhile, the bitter split by senator Lazarus has raised hopes in the Abbott government of getting it's higher education changes through the Senate next week. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the decision did not remove from the government the need to hold 'good faith' talks with crossbenchers. Education Minister Christopher Pyne, who wants his university fee deregulation plan passed by the Senate next week, said Senator Wang had publicly indicated his support for the reform. The senator's decision came just hours after his wife Tess was sacked from her party role on Thursday .

Senator Lazarus (right) quit the party in a statement released on his Facebook page overnight . 'So I at least hope, now that Glenn Lazarus is not the leader of the Palmer United Party in the Senate anymore, that Dio Wang might be free to support this bill next week,' Mr Pyne said. Mr Pyne admitted he had never met Senator Lazarus. Labor leader Bill Shorten said he respected Senator Lazarus and would work with him as an independent to defeat the university changes and other unpopular budget measures. Government Senate leader Eric Abetz was due to contact Senators Wang and Lazarus on Friday to talk about their stances. While not confirming his position, Senator Wang said he and Senator Lazarus had split over policy differences in recent party room meetings. He said he remained loyal to Mr Palmer and believed the party had a strong future. Tasmanian independent Jacqui Lambie, who quit PUP in November, said Senator Lazarus would stand up for uni students. Queensland Senator Lazarus said his wife's sacking was 'one of many things' forcing him to call it quits . The bitter split by senator Lazarus has raised hopes in the Abbott government of getting it's higher education changes through the Senate next week . 'I have a different view of team work. Given this, I felt it best that I resign from the party and pursue my Senate role as an independent Senator,' the statement read . 'Glenn's resignation means that the average workers, the sick, our pensioners, the uni students and disabled will have even more protection in the Senate from this Liberal government, which wants to take away so much,' she said. The higher education bill deregulates university fees and cuts funding for degrees by an average of 20 per cent. It was rejected by the Senate in December, but the government has been working on amendments to get it through. Independent senator Nick Xenophon says the departure of Senator Lazarus will make it more difficult for the government. 'Previously, government ministers could have dinner with Clive at the Wild Duck, or wherever they went, and now it's just that little bit more difficult,' Senator Xenophon said. Mr Palmer accused Senator Lazarus of 'spitting the dummy', arguing that he had stepped in to help the former rugby league player when 'he was sort of washed up'. Liberal Democratic Party senator David Leyonhjelm said there was a suspicion Mr Palmer had been taking an interest in Senator Lazarus' seat because he felt powerless in the lower house. 'That's probably not likely to happen now,' Senator Leyonhjelm said. Senator Lazarus quit the party in a statement released on his Facebook page overnight. Mr Lazarus (pictured: right) released a statement overnight to announce his resignation . His social media profiles were also updated to reflect his new status and removed any mention of the Palmer United Party . 'I have today resigned from the Palmer United Party,' he said. 'This was a difficult decision. 'I have a different view of team work. Given this, I felt it best that I resign from the party and pursue my Senate role as an independent Senator.' His social media profiles were also updated to remove any mention of the Palmer United Party. Mr Lazarus also said he is 'determined to do my best in representing, and being a voice for, the people of Queensland' during his time in the senate. 'I am deeply grateful to Clive Palmer for the opportunity to be involved in the party,' the statement read. 'I sincerely wish Clive and his family all the very best for the future.

However, the reality TV star, who we are more accustomed to seeing falling out of clubs in tiny bodycon dresses, is debuting a sophisticated new style. Vicky, 27, has given FEMAIL a first look at her new fashion range for Honeyz - and promises that it will make every girl feel 'amazing'. Scroll down for video . Vicky Pattison, who found fame on Geordie Shore, has unveiled her new range for Honeyz - and shows off her sophisticated style and recent weightloss in the campaign images . Speaking about creating the range, the Geordie Shore star revealed the great lengths she went to to ensure it was prefect. She said: 'The range is a real labour of love. We've been developing it tirelessly and we're finally at a place where we are designing almost all of the items ourselves, sourcing the material and making really affordable and fashionable items for women that I'm so proud of.' The 27-year-old has been working 'tirelessly' on her new range and says there's something for every body shape and the entire range will make every woman feel 'amazing' Vicky cites Victoria Beckham as her icon and says she would love to see 'gorgeous girls' Michelle Keegan and Sam Faeirs wearing her collection . Vicky, who says she's always been interested in fashion and looking good, wanted to design this range for normal women of all shapes, sizes and ages. Dresses are priced at around £30 and and jumpsuits at around £40. The clothes, she says, are for real women: some with curves, some slim - and she models each look to perfection. The fashion fanatic says she is constantly inspired by the women around her; including one woman in particular. 'I'm inspired by women like Victoria Beckham whose style is so classic, timeless and feminine it transcends time,' she said. 'Her new collection is beautiful. I also love Balmain and Michael Costello.' The successful star will host of her very own show, Judge Geordie, which is slated to air later this summer . Vicky, who says she would love to see 'gorgeous girls' Sam Faiers and Michelle Keegan wearing her clothes, is the first to admit that her style has had a complete overhaul since finding fame. 'I've been through quite a big style evolution over the last couple years,' she said. 'But more than that being down to me losing weight, I feel as though it's my age. As I'm getting older, I'm becoming more sophisticated and classic. 'However, since losing my weight I have enjoyed being more adventurous.' While she rocks sophisticated camel coats and chic vibrant blazers from her new range, the Newcastle local assures us that she'll never forget her roots. 'Am I over bodycon dresses? Gosh no!,' she laughed. 'I still love letting my hair down and wearing party dresses and jumpsuits. I will never forget my roots and I'm still a party girl at heart; my range still reflects that. 'No Geordie girl's collection would be complete without a couple party dresses.' Vicky recently dropped a staggering five dress sizes after overhauling her lifestyle and she's keen to show off the results of her hard work whilst modelling her new range . As well as making a foray into fashion (and a soon-to-launch jewellery range), Vicky is set to re-launch her TV career with a brand new role that will see her become Britain's answer to Judge Judy. It has been confirmed by MTV and Lime Pictures that the 27-year-old will host of her very own show, Judge Geordie, which is slated to air later this summer. The on-screen star certainly has ambition. She added: 'I'd love to be a TV presenter doing the X Factor or something. 'But in terms of my collection, I would love to see it grow and expand. No one would have thought Victoria Beckham would end up rubbing shoulders with Anna Wintour and sitting on the front row of fashions shows, but she is.

"A grenade exploded after being thrown into the home of a drug dealer - prompting fears of an underworld turf war. The explosive was hurled at the semi-detached home in Salford causing  damage to the front in a 'targeted attack'. No one was injured in the attack which occurred shortly after midnight at the home of Ryan Coward, 23, who lived there with his parents and brother. The explosive was hurled at the semi-detached home in Salford shattering the window (pictured) and causing damage to the front in a 'targeted attack' Earlier this month, he was jailed for 32 months at Edinburgh Sheriff Court for being concerned in the supply of cannabis. He and an accomplice were arrested last year and officers recovered two kilos of Cannabis with a street value of up to £20,000 along with £2000 cash. The householders were said to be 'extremely distressed' by the attack on the Duchy Estate, Greater Manchester, according to police. Neighbours living near the explosion described the booming blast as the 'loudest thing they have ever heard' with one adding he felt furniture in his house shake. Ryan Coward, 23, lived at the home in Salford with his parents and brother before he was jailed for 32 months for being 'concerned in the supply of cannabis' Neighbours living near the explosion described the booming blast as the 'loudest thing they have ever heard' with one adding he felt furniture in his house shake . Another said: 'I heard a huge explosion, and I thought a bomb had gone off in the street. It was just so so loud.' Detective Chief Inspector Clare Devlin from Greater Manchester Police said: 'While we are only in the early stages of our investigation, we believe this was a targeted attack and can confirm that a hand grenade was used. Hand grenades were used by Dale Cregan in the murders of PCs Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, and David Short in 2012 . 'Clearly this is something we are taking extremely seriously and I am sure people in the area will be hugely shocked by this news. 'There are a large number of officers dedicated to investigating exactly what has taken place here and they will also be speaking to residents in the local area today and over the coming days. 'Thankfully no one was injured during this attack, although the occupants of the address are understandably extremely distressed. 'Make no mistake that we are going to find out exactly what has gone on here and why, and catch those responsible. This kind of violent behaviour on the streets of Salford will simply not be tolerated.' It comes after a wave of stabbings in the surrounding area which saw one 29-year-old man slashed multiple times with a machete. Hand grenades were used by Dale Cregan in the murders of PCs Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, and David Short in 2012. Cregan gunned down Mr Short outside his home in Clayton, Greater Manchester, in August that year before he threw a grenade at him - the first time a military grenade had been deployed in the country in that way. While on the run for the murders of Mr Short and his son, Mark, whom he gunned down in a pub in May, Cregan lured the two policewomen to an address in Hattersley with a bogus 999 call in September. After shooting the pair, he left his 'calling card' of an M75 grenade, which he threw on to the path where the two officers lay. A bag containing 10 M75 grenades from the former Yuglosavia was found in a storm drain in Glodwick, Oldham, in 2013. Following the discovery, Greater Manchester Police said they believed they had recovered all the grenades from Cregan's batch. M75 grenades were also reported to have been used in several attacks by an underworld crime gang in Merseyside. Greater Manchester Police discovered this stash of grenades inside a storm drain during Dale Cregan's 17-week trial .","Grenade exploded after being thrown into the home of a drug dealer .

"The Canadian government has come under fire for allowing the slaughter of nearly 470,000 seals as part of the biggest marine animal hunt on the planet. Canada's annual 'commercial seal hunt', which mainly takes place during March and April, sees thousands of young seals clubbed to death for their furs. The annual quota for the seal hunt has gone up in recent years, despite the market for seal pelts collapsing following an near world-wide ban on the furs. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: A number of harp seals lay on the ice next to the skinned carcasses of other animals surrounded by pools of blood in the wake of a day during the annual Canadian seal hunt . A seal hunter gets ready to kill a harp seal with a blow to the head with the 'hammer' end of a hakapik . Killing fields: An aerial view of a seal hunting camp shows over a thousand harp seal pelts covering the ground at the end of a day of hunting . Last month, Canada's Fisheries Minister Gail Shea set the seal hunt quota to 400,000 harp seals, 60,000 grey seals and 8,200 hooded seals  - a total of more than 468,000 animals. The seals are mainly killed for their pelts, but hunters also sell their blubber, which is used to make ‘seal oil’ and sold as a health supplement, and the penises, which are a popular ingredient in aphrodisiacs in some Asian markets. In order to avoid damage to the pelts, a majority of the seals are killed with clubs or a ‘hakapik’ – a seal hunting tool which has a hammer head used to crush a seal's skull, and a hook used to drag away the carcass. Although hunters and the Canadian government claims these methods are humane,  animal rights advocates say an alarming number of the seals are skinned while alive and responsive to pain. The Humane Society of the United States claims that independent, international team of veterinarians observed the hunt and examined the corpses of skinned seals. They found evidence that up to 40 per cent of the dead seals had skull injuries that were not sufficient to have caused death.

Death in numbers: The 2015 seal hunt quota to 400,000 harp seals, 60,000 grey seals and 8,200 hooded seals - a total of more than 468,000 animals . 'Humane': A majority of seals are killed with clubs or a ‘hakapik’ to the head in order to avoid damaging the pelt . Killing: The annual quota of seals has gone up since the Nougties, despite the actual number of seals killed going down in the wake of several countries  banning import of products from commercial seal hunting . Threats: Animal rights activists are also criticising the high quotas on the base that global warming is threatening all seal species in Canada as the ice, where the seals breed, is melting . Seal hunters are not allowed to kill seal pups which have yet to molt their downy white coat, however, this usually happens when the pup is between just ten to 21 days. Adult seals are harder to hunt, and mainly has to be shot rather than clubbed – a tough task when the animal is in the water which also risks destroying the pelt. As a result, an estimated 95-98 per cent of the seals killed during the commercial hunt are three weeks to three months old. The seal hunt quota set by the Canadian government has rolled over from last season and the 400,000 harp seal allowance has remained steady since 2011, up from in 2010 and 280,000 in 2009. However, despite the large hunting quotas, approximately 94,000 harp seals were killed during the commercial hunt in 2013. This  was an increase from 71,000 in 2012 and just 38,000 in 2011. The recent number of seals killed is a significant drop in numbers from the mid-to-late noughties with 218,000 harp seals killed in 2008, 355,000 in 2006 and a jaw-dropping 366,000 in 2004. The reason for the drop in number of animals killed is a near world-wide ban of sales of the seals' fur, which has seen the global market collapse. The United States, the EU, Taiwan, Switzerland, Mexico and the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Armenia have all stopped their trade in some or all products of commercial seal hunts. ‘The quotas are going up every year, despite opposition and the market for seal pelts disappearing,’ says Andy Ottaway of the Seal Protection Action Group. ‘The recent EU ban on import of seal products has led to a dramatic collapse in the market. ‘The government is keeping the quotas they have already set, but the actual hunters themselves cannot be bothered to go out because they cannot sell the pelts. The incentive is gone. ‘If the EU ban had happened a decade ago perhaps the hunt would've grinded to a halt by now.’ Clubbing babies: An estimated 95-98 per cent of the seals killed during the commercial hunt are three weeks to three months old .

No change: Despite the hunting quotas for harp seals staying at 400,000, just 94,000 harp seals were killed during the commercial hunt in 2013 . Blood on their hands: Bertrand Oucoin  pulls a harp seal onto his barge at the beginning of the annual seal hunting season . The recent number of seals killed during the Canadian cull is a significant drop in numbers from the mid- to late noughties with 218,000 harp seals killed in 2008, 355,000 in 2006 and 366,000 in 2004 . There are also further threats to the Canadian seals, as climate change is causing their ice habitat to deteriorate at an alarming rate. In recent years, the Canadian government has estimated a near 100 per cent mortality for pups born in key whelping areas when the sea ice melted too soon in the season, and the pups drowned. ‘And as global warming is thinning the ice, which is the seal’s breeding area, the species is already under threat,' Mr Ottaway adds. 'It’s outrageous that the Canadian government is putting quotas up on an endangered species.' However, seal hunters and Canada's Fisheries Department (DFO) says the hunt is sustainable and humane, and earns money for isolated fishing communities in Atlantic Canada. Seal hunting methods have been studied and approved by the Royal Commission on Seals and Sealing who concluded 'the methods of hunting seals compare favorably to those used to hunt any other wild or domestic animal'. Why: The seals are mainly killed for their pelts, but hunters also sell their blubber and the penises, which are a popular ingredient in aphrodisiacs in Asia . Blow: Despite hunters claiming it is a humane killing method, animal rights activists claim many seals are skinned while alive and responsive to pain . Red seas: Pelts from harp seals lie in pools of blood after a long day of seal hunting in Canada . In a statement to MailOnline, a DFO spokesperson defended the high quotas saying 'decisions are informed by science.' 'The overall Atlantic seal population, including harp seals, grey seals and hooded seals is healthy and abundant. Harp seals are currently estimated at approximately 7.4 million animals which is more than three times what it was in the 1970s. 'It is truly unfortunate that decades of misinformation campaigns by animal rights groups have had such a negative effect on the economic well-being of rural and Aboriginal Canadians. 'The effects of these campaigns are not just being felt economically, but ecologically as well. For example, the Atlantic grey seal population eats more than 1 million tonnes of fish each year. This is having a drastic effect on many fish species, most notably cod. 'The Government of Canada has been rock solid in its support for Canadian sealers. We will continue to stand up for trade fairness for this important, traditional way of life.' Rebecca Aldworth, executive director of Humane Society International Canada, condemns the quota as irresponsible. 'Canada's Fisheries Minister has yet again ignored sound science in favour of her political agenda,' Ms Aldworth said in a statement. 'The Canadian government acknowledges that climate change is causing mass mortalities for these ice-dependent seals, yet is still endorsing the largest mass slaughter of marine mammals on the planet. 'Instead of setting irresponsible and unsustainable seal quotas, our government should take immediate steps to end the commercial seal slaughter through a federal sealing industry buyout.'","Canadian seal hunt is the largest marine mammal cull on the planet .

"Child rapist Andrew Horrocks, 35, delivered post to schools for more than a year because of an admin blunder . A child rapist delivered post to schools for more than a year after a criminal records blunder led to his conviction being missed. Andrew Horrocks, 35, was jailed for 12 years in 2007 for raping and sexually assaulting a five-year-old girl. But in December 2013 he was given a job at Whistl delivering post to businesses and schools. The convicted sex offender had two schools in the Prestwich and Whitefield areas of north Manchester in his rounds. Horrocks, who was based at the company's sorting depot in Prestwich, was sacked this week after the company was alerted to his conviction by one of his colleagues. The child rapist, from Wigan, told the company that he had an unspent conviction for a 'sexual offence' when he applied for the job. The firm, which employs 4,500 people across the UK, says it then did a Criminal Records Bureau check on Horrocks, which confirmed he had a conviction but the information was not passed on during the recruiting process. Whistl claim Horrocks did not give full details of the offence and the company made no attempt to investigate what he was jailed for. One member of staff at the Prestwich depot, who did not wish to be named, said: 'This has caused panic among the management at work. 'Horrocks has been going to schools and businesses as well as private homes - that is what we do. We deliver post to those kind of premises. I think it is shocking that this can happen.' A spokesman for Whistl said: 'Andrew Horrocks was employed as a delivery operative by the company in autumn 2013. He was subject to a CRB check and the ongoing associated Mail Integrity Code of Practice for the delivery of mail. Horrocks, who was based at this industrial estate in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, was sacked this week after one of his colleagues told bosses about his conviction . 'He had declared an unspent conviction and due to an unacceptable administrative error, the conviction was not highlighted. As soon as we became aware of the conviction, we met with Mr Horrocks and agreed to terminate his employment. 'We are currently undergoing a thorough review of the existing paperwork for delivery personnel and recruitment processes to ensure that this is an isolated incident. We are distressed that this situation has arisen as we aim to work to the very highest standards. 'He was a delivery person who would deliver mail to letter boxes in Prestwich and Whitefield. He would have no reason to be in contact with children whilst on his rounds.'","Andrew Horrocks was jailed for sexual assault and raping a girl, five .

"Al Qaeda received about $1million from the Central Intelligence Agency when the Afghan government used money from a secret fund to pay a ransom for a kidnapped diplomat in 2010. Abdul Khaliq Farahi was the Afghan consul general in Peshawar, Pakistan, when he was kidnapped in 2008 and handed over to Al Qaeda. He was released two years later after Afghanistan paid the terrorist group a $5million ransom, a fifth of which was from the CIA, the New York Times reported. Scroll down for video . The CIA money Al Qaeda got was part of a $5million ransom to free consul general Abdul Khaliq Farahi (above) Letters about the CIA payments were found during the 2011 Navy SEALS raid that killed Osama Bin Laden . The bulk of the CIA payments were made while former President Hamid Karzai (left) was in power but they have slowed down since Afghan President Ashraf Ghani (right) took over in September . The money came from an Afghan government fund that received secret monthly cash deliveries from the CIA, the Times reported. The deliveries were made to the presidential palace in Kabul. Letters about the ransom payment were found during the 2011 raid by US Navy SEALS that killed Osama Bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The letters were submitted as evidence during the trial of convicted terrorist Abid Naseer (pictured) In a June 2010 letter to Bin Laden, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, Al Qaeda's general manager, wrote: 'God blessed us with a good amount of money this month'. He wrote the money would be used for weapons, operational needs and payments to families of Al Qaeda fighters held in Afghanistan. The communications were submitted as evidence in the trial of Abid Naseer, who was convicted this month in New York of supporting terrorism and plotting to bomb a shopping center in Manchester, England. Bin Laden had at first been concerned about the ransom payment, fearing the CIA knew how the money would be used and had tainted it with poison, radiation or a tracking device. He suggested the money be converted to another currency to 'be on the safe side'. The money the CIA delivered while President Hamid Karzai was in charge was used to buy the support of warlords, legislators and others, as well as expenses for clandestine diplomatic trips and housing for senior officials. Afghan officials reportedly said the payments have slowed since Ashraf Ghani became president in September. The CIA declined to comment on the report. In addition to the Al Qaeda correspondence, the story was based on conversations with Afghan and Western officials.","Money was part of $5M ransom to free consul general Abdul Khaliq Farahi .

"Germany should pay reparations to Greece for ‘serious wrongs’ by the Nazis, members of Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition said last night. The German Chancellor has angrily rejected demands from Greek ministers for Berlin to pay £240billion in compensation for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War. But, in an astonishing twist, senior members of the SPD, which shares power with Mrs Merkel, yesterday disagreed. Senior figures in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition partner in government  have united with the Green Party to declare Germany should compensate Greece to the tune of billions of pounds for wartime Nazi atrocities . Gesine Schwan said: ‘I think it would be good for us Germans to sweep up after ourselves in terms of our history. It is about recognising that we have committed serious wrongs in Greece. ‘The government’s legal case isn’t convincing. It leaves a bad impression that Germany doesn’t want to face up to its responsibilities.’ Ralf Stegner, SPD deputy leader, said: ‘We should not link the question of compensation with the current debate on the euro crisis. But I am of the opinion that we need to discuss compensation regardless.’ Green party parliamentary group leader Anton Hofreiter said: ‘Neither morally nor legally is this chapter complete.’ About 250,000 Greeks died during the brutal Nazi occupation. Greece’s new hard-Left rulers are demanding billions in return. Justice minister Nikos Paraskevopoulos said this month that German assets in Greece could be seized. Athens is demanding general compensation as well as specific claims for massacres and forced loans. Some senior German politicians view the Greek demand for up to £250billion  in reparations for the Nazi occupation as a ploy to gain more time and money to settle its chronic debt crisis. Pictured is an anti-austerity and pro-government demonstration in Athens that took place in February . German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble has said: ‘They won’t get their debts paid by conjuring German obligations from World War Two.’ Mrs Merkel’s spokesman said the question was ‘legally and politically closed’. But Eberhard Rondholz, a historian who has studied the issue, told the Financial Times: ‘The government view is false. This issue is not closed – it is very much open.’ Spiegel news magazine yesterday said lawyers have told Mrs Merkel the Greeks may have a case. It says that a £2billion loan the Third Reich secured from Greece in 1942 was never repaid – £10billion today. Germany paid Greece £50million in 1960, but Athens says it was not enough.","Germany did pay some £50million in compensation to Greece after WW2 .

"A church has come under fire over plans to dig up thousands of bodies - including the founder of Western Australia - to make way for a car park. St John's Stoke church, in Guildford, Surrey, wants to build a community centre in its grave yard and replace the current centre with a car park. But the scheme, which would see remains dug up, cremated and reburied in a mass grave, has already sparked outrage with opponents producing a 1,400-signature petition in a bid to save the graveyard. St John's Stoke church (pictured), in Guildford, Surrey, wants to build a community centre in its grave yard and replace the current centre with a car park . The body of Sir James Stirling, a navy admiral and the first governor of Western Australia, is buried in the graveyard . An international dispute threatens to break out as the body of Sir James Stirling, a navy admiral and the first governor of Western Australia, is buried in the graveyard - but the church is not sure where. Reverend Mark Woodward, the church's rector, said: 'We have heard a large number of views ranging from strong opposition to our plans, to very strong support in favour. 'We hope and pray that something very positive will come from the proposal to see land used to help fund an excellent new community project. Sir James Stirling become the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Western Australia . It was Sir James Stirling’s persistence that finally persuaded the British government to establish the Swan River Colony in Western Australia. The British naval officer, who was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1791, had explored the area before lobbying officials to allow him to establish a settlement. And it was a move that would eventually see him become the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Western Australia. Stirling entered the navy at the age of 12 and went on to serve in the Napoleonic wars and the war between Britain and the US in 1812. He married Ellen Mangles at Stoke Church, Guildford, on September 3 1823. They went on to have five sons and six daughters. Stirling travelled to Australia a few years later as part of a navy assignment and joined an inland expedition – eventually taking him to the west. He would go on to oversee the development of the surrounding area and remained in his post until 1838 when he resumed his naval career. Stirling became an admiral in the 1860s and died in retirement at Guildford on April 22 1865. 'We are in contact with the descendants of some families who believe they have ancestors interred in the graveyard and we are listening very carefully. We are committed to working very closely with all interested parties. 'It is inspiring to see our church facilities put to such great and varied use by so many people every week, but we are simply running out of space.' Sir Stirling was buried at the site following his death in 1865 but when a new rectory was built on the western graveyard in 1977 his stone was accidentally smashed and moved to the entrance of the church. If all goes to plan for the church, remains will be placed in a memorial garden behind the new community centre, with the remaining headstones placed around the perimeter of the church . The reverend believes the admiral's body was moved with the stone, a claim that is hotly disputed, and argues the car park is needed because church turnout has risen sharply. The last burial at the church is thought to have taken place in the 1870s. Eventually, if all goes to plan for the church, remains will be placed in a memorial garden behind the new community centre, with the remaining headstones placed around the perimeter of the church. Church leaders will take their plans to church commissioners, in Westminster, London, on April 22.","St John's Stoke church plans to build new community centre and car park .

"We feed them, groom them, clothe them and otherwise shell out the big bucks to protect and pamper our pets. The American Pet Products Association's annual report on pet industry spending says Americans spent $58 billion in 2014 on their 397 million pets, which range from freshwater fish and reptiles to cats and dogs. The industry trade group released the survey Thursday at the Global Pet Expo, an annual trade show in Orlando, Florida. The data came from a variety of groups, market research studies and media reports. The American Pet Products Association's annual report on pet industry spending says Americans spent $58 billion in 2014 on their 397 million pets, which range from freshwater fish and reptiles to cats and dogs . Here's a snapshot of how we spend money on pets: . WHERE THE MONEY GOES . The association measures five areas of spending. Last year, people spent $22 billion on food; $15 billion on veterinary care; $14 billion on supplies such as beds, bowls and collars and over-the-counter medicine to fight ailments such as fleas, ticks and colds; $4.8 billion on other services; and $2 billion on animals themselves. The 'other services' category grew the fastest in 2014 and includes payments on grooming, boarding, walking, training, day care and even trips to the spa — where pets can get facials and massages, said Bob Vetere, president and CEO of the pet products association, based in Greenwich, Connecticut. Food:  $22.62 billion . Supplies/OTC Medicine: $13.72 billion . Vet Care:  $15.25 billion . Live animal purchases:  $2.19 billion . Grooming & boarding: $4.73 billion . The breakdown of pet expenses above is an estimation by the American Pet Products Association based on its annual report on pet industry . VET VISITS FLAT . The report says trips to the veterinarian were unchanged or slightly down last year, although expenditures per visit have increased as owners green-light more expensive procedures, Vetere said. Those treatments ranged from the lifesaving to the exotic, like plastic surgery. A robust human-animal bond still exists, especially with dogs and cats, and people are doing more to prolong their pets' lives, from surgery to food, Vetere said. WHAT'S FOR DINNER . If food for pets sometimes sounds good enough to eat, it's because it is. San Diego-based Honest Kitchen and Vero Beach, Florida-based Caru Natural Dog Stews are two pet food brands considered human-grade by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because their grub is made with ingredients palatable by people and produced in facilities meeting higher safety requirements. Americans spent the most on food for their pets last year, and much of it mirrored human trends, such as gluten-free, wheat-free, little sugar or reduced-calorie. The feast might come dry, wet, raw, baked, flaked, shredded, diced, sliced, frozen or freeze-dried. PET SALES DOWN . Sales of the animals themselves dropped from $2.23 billion in 2013 to $2.15 billion in 2014, which was expected because spending in the category has fallen slightly each of the past several years, Vetere said. There is likely no one reason, he said. But adoptions at shelters and rescues are strong, many cities banned the sale of dogs from puppy mills and the lifespans of dogs and cats have lengthened. INDUSTRY GROWTH . As pets have become more important parts of U.S. families, spending on them has exploded. There has been more than a threefold increase since the group's first survey was released in 1994, when people paid out $17 billion. Spending grew 4.2 percent, from $55.72 billion in 2013 to $58.04 billion last year, Vetere said. COMPARING SPENDING . People spent about five times more on their pets than they did on movies last year. The box office firm Rentrak estimated that ticket sales from 2014 totaled $10.4 billion, a 5.2 percent drop from 2013. But people spent far more on their homes than they did their pets, with expenditures from home improvements and repairs reaching $298 billion in 2013, the most recent data available.

Police say no one was inside the property on Harborne Street in Wembley, western Perth, during the fire yesterday however a male resident arrived at the scene a short time later. Kerr, 31, has reportedly been residing at the home after being granted bail on previous charges, according to the ABC. Department of Fire and Emergency Services' fire investigation officer told Daily Mail Australia it took firefighters 10 minutes to extinguish the 'suspicious' fire and most of the damage was caused by smoke. Police say arson squad officers attended the scene and will continue their investigations into the incident. Kerr, 31, has reportedly been residing at the burnt down home after being granted bail on previous charges . Earlier this year, Kerr pleaded not guilty to his charges over allegations of splashing petrol around the property and throwing petrol at a man and a woman inside - before trying to set the property alight. He recently had his bail conditions altered by the Perth Magistrates Court which gave him permission to move to Western Australia's south - Denmark - to play football for a local team, the ABC reports. This comes as footage emerged of the moment fallen AFL star Ben Cousins was spotted driving erratically and running through the streets away from police, before he was taken into custody for the third time in two weeks. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media.","Firefighters were called to the home of Daniel Kerr's estranged wife Natasha Pozo on Monday afternoon .

"A former Australian Survivor contestant who tried to murder his ex-girlfriend so the couple could 'be together for eternity' has lost an appeal in the NSW supreme court. Joel Betts will spend at least 11 years behind bars and could be in jail for up to 16 years after his 2012 sentence for stabbing Samantha Holland was upheld on Tuesday morning. During sentencing for the 2010 attack, which happened at the couple's Chippendale apartment in Sydney's inner-city, Judge Robert Toner said Betts intended to kill the 24-year-old because he couldn't persuade her to reunite with him. Joel Betts (rigjt) will spend at least 11 years behind bars and could be in jail for up to 16 years after his 2012 sentence for stabbing Samantha Holland (left) was upheld on Tuesday morning . Judge Robert Toner said Betts (right) intended to kill the 24-year-old (left) because he couldn't persuade her to reunite with him . While stabbing Ms Holland 26 times, Betts told her: 'I want us to die together so we can be together for eternity.' Betts pleaded guilty to the attempted murder in February 2012. Judge Toner found that 'profound jealousy' had motivated Betts to try and kill Ms Holland as she went to leave their home unit. She had gone there to collect her belongings after ending the relationship. He had promised he would not be home but he was and tried to persuade Ms Holland to resume the relationship. She refused, telling him 'I'm done', and tried to leave. As she turned towards the door, Betts stabbed her in the back and also stabbed himself in an attempted suicide. Betts pleaded guilty to the attempted murder in February 2012 . Ms Holland tried several times to escape. In one attempt she told Betts to hand her the knife if he wanted them to die together in 'the Romeo and Juliet love scenario he had in mind'. After a 45-minute ordeal, she stabbed Betts in the stomach and jumped onto a neighbour's balcony in blood-soaked underwear. Ms Holland testified during the trial she still struggled to understand 'how someone who professed to love me was the one who wanted to cause the most harm'. 'I was stabbed, detained and forced to jump from a third-floor balcony to save my life... I had no intention of dying,' she said.","Joel Betts was sentenced to at least 11 years behind bars and could be in jail for up to 16 years .

"Six schoolgirls subjected to 'horrific' sexual abuse and gang rape were accused by a defence lawyer of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by a gang of five men at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, who has been found guilty of 12 counts of sexual abuse. Michael Magarian, QC, for the defence, suggested the girls  abused in Banbury, Oxfordshire, only reported the crimes so they would not have to take responsibility for having underage sex. He said: 'It's better to be a victim than a slag. Once you are a victim who has been groomed you no longer have to take any responsibility for anything that you did.' Six schoolgirls were subjected to 'horrific' sexual attacks by a gang led by Ahmed Hassan-Sule (left), 20, who has been found guilty of 13 counts of abuse. Mohamed Saleh, 21, (right) was found guilty of sexual abuse . The Cambridge-educated QC, who specialises in gang related cases, said the schoolgirls could have been 'brainwashed by social workers', according to The Times. Mr Magarian also claimed during the trial at Oxford crown court that the prosecution was 'a police-manufactured case' Five men from Banbury were found guilty on Thursday of a string of sexual offences against the girls which took place over five years. The alleged leader of the group Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 20, known as 'Fiddy' was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual activity with a child one count of assault by penetration. Prosecution barrister Stuart Trimmer QC said the defendants identified their targets by organising parties – called 'Fiddy Events' – for under 18s. Takudzwa Hova (left), 21, was found guilty of one count of rape and Said Saleh (right)  was convicted of one count of sexual activity with a child but was found not guilty of another count . The Cambridge-educated QC, who specialises in gang related cases, told Oxford Crown court (pictured) the schoolgirls could have been 'brainwashed by social workers' One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. Clare Dowse, also for the defence, suggested that the children, from troubled backgrounds in Banbury, Oxfordshire, 'might be enjoying all the attention from police and social services'. The victims, described as 'emotionally immature' by prosecution lawyer Stuart Trimmer, were abused from 2009 to 2014. He said: 'Sadly for them they were identified by these defendants and used by them. Once they were into the cycle of abuse they had no realistic means of extricating themselves.' One girl said: 'They brainwashed me to think it was normal, what was happening.' Mohamed Saleh, 21, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child. He was found not guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child and one count of rape . Kagiso Manase, 20, was found guilty of one count of sexual assault . Kagiso Manase, 20, was convicted of three counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of sexual assault. Takudzwa Hova, 21, was found guilty of one count of rape, one count of sexual activity with a child and two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He was found not guilty of one count of rape . Alexandru Nae, 19, was acquitted of one count of sexual activity with a child and one count of rape . The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of rape. Said Saleh, 20, was convicted of one count of sexual activity with a child but was found not guilty of another count. Mr Magarian's comments have been condemned as 'completely inappropriate' by the NSPCC. Jon Brown from the children's charity told The Times: 'They show a total lack of understanding of how children are groomed. Any suggestion that they may be to blame for the horrendous things that happened are totally wrong.' Jim Leivers, Oxfordshire County Council's Director for Children, Education and Families, said: 'This case embodies all of the lessons learned from Operation Bullfinch and is a very different case as a result. 'The social workers and police officers have worked in close co-operation on a day to day basis devoting a large amount of time to building high levels of trust between themselves and the victims over a long period.' 'These victims have shown real bravery. They have been rewarded for that bravery with the verdicts that have been returned - as have the professionals who have put huge amounts of time and effort in to working towards this outcome. 'Those same professionals have now already started working with the victims in this case to help their transition in to what we all hope will be a normal and healthy adulthood.' Senior investigating officer, Det Insp Steve Raffield, from Banbury Force CID, said: 'These offenders abused the trust of the vulnerable young victims for the purpose of their own sexual gratification. 'The girls were subject to horrific sexual offences including, in some cases, rape at the hands of these defendants. 'These horrific crimes will have a lasting impact upon the victims' lives. 'The fact that the offenders maintained they were not guilty of the offences resulted in the victims having to relive their experiences by giving evidence in court.' The men will be sentenced on 17 April.","Six schoolgirls were subjected to 'horrific' sexual abuse and gang rape .

"A town councillor from Hertfordshire says a British Airways flight to Dubai was forced to return to London due to a foul odour emanating from an overflowing toilet. Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev, who represents Potters Bar Parkfield, said the seven-hour flight was aborted ‘because of a smelly poo in the toilet’. Cabin crew were unable to fix the problem and the smell became unbearable for passengers seated nearby, forcing the plane to turn around near Brussels and land at Heathrow Airport. A British Airways captain told passengers the smell was from 'liquid faecal excrement' in a toilet . Mr Sachdev, a Tory councillor, said the flight departed on time Thursday night and everything seemed fine until the captain made an announcement about 30 minutes after take-off. He told MailOnline Travel: ‘The pilot made an announcement requesting senior cabin crew, and we knew something was a bit odd. ‘About 10 minutes later he said you may have noticed there’s a quite pungent smell coming from one of the toilets. ‘He said it was liquid faecal excrement, those are the words he used. He said it’s not a technical fault with the plane, and he was very adamant about that.’ Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev said passengers were told that crew could not fix the problem . The captain informed passengers that the plane’s crew had examined the problem, but were unable to fix it. He told them that the plane would be forced to return to London for health and safety reasons. Passengers were initially told that they would board another flight in three hours, but it turned into a 15-hour delay, said Mr Sachdev, who was travelling with his pregnant wife, Rupa, and their two-year-old daughter, Shravani. He said the airline offered an apology and provided hotel accommodation and food vouchers, but claimed BA ground staff were unprepared and told the travellers to contact the Civil Aviation Authority for compensation. Tory councillor Abhishek Sachdev was travelling with his pregnant wife and their two-year-old daughter . Mr Sachdev, who wasn’t seated near the toilet in question, said passengers departed for Dubai yesterday at 1pm. He said: ‘It’s obviously disappointing to lose a whole day of your trip. You might expect it on some random airline, but you wouldn’t expect it from British Airways.’ After the plane landed at Heathrow, the councillor tweeted: ‘Insane! Our BA flight to Dubai returned back to Heathrow because of a smelly poo in the toilet! 15hrs until next flight/’ A British Airways spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'We're very sorry for the discomfort to our customers. ​ .

"Authorities have today arrested 23 suspected members of a terror cell in connection with a jihadist massacre at Tunisia's national museum which left 21 people dead. The attack last week targeted the Bardo Museum in the capital Tunis with 20 foreign tourists, including 17 people from a cruise ship gunned down. Tunisia's interior ministry confirmed the arrests saying that 80 per cent of the terror cell responsible for the attack had been broken up and that the suspects are due to appear in court. A man lays flowers on the bloodstained entrance to the Bardo Museum in Tunisia. Today 23 suspects have been arrested in connection with the jihadist attack . However, they added that three suspects involved in the attack, who are thought to be Moroccan and Algerian nationals, are still on the run. Interior minister Najem Gharsalli said: 'Twenty-three suspects including a woman have been arrested as part of a terrorist cell involved in the attack.' Among those arrested was head of the terror cell, who was identified as Mohammed Emine Guebli. Mr Gharsalli added how the gunmen attacked the museum wearing belts filled with powerful explosive semtex, which would have been 'catastrophic' if used. He also detailed that two members of the group arrested had also fought with extremists in Syria, with the three others, including the attackers, training in Libya. CCTV released earlier this week showed the two gunmen and a third unidentified man roaming around inside the museum before the attack . Today it was revealed how the gunmen attacked the museum wearing belts filled with powerful explosive semtex . Tunisian national Maher Ben Mouldi Kaidi had been previously identified as a suspect and is alleged to have provided the automatic weapons to the gunmen. The minister also said the operation was organised by an Algerian jihadist named Lokmane Abou Sakhr, one of the leaders of the Al-Qaeda-linked Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, the main Tunisian armed group active along the border with Algeria. Earlier this week a video emerged of the moment two gunman began roaming the Bardo Museum looking for victims. The one-minute video posted on the government's Interior Ministry Facebook page shows the two men scurrying through the Tunis museum, carrying assault rifles and bags. One of the attackers is wearing a baseball cap and a heavy jacket, while the other wears a red hooded jumper and tracksuit pants. Tourists and visitors flee from the Bardo Museum following the attack. Twenty foreign tourists, including 17 from a cruise ship were gunned down and killed . At one point, they encounter another man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs. They briefly acknowledge each other and let the unidentified man walk free before unleashing the deadly attack in the country's largest museum. Eight of the foreign tourists were killed as they got off a bus in front of the musuem building while another 12 were killed inside along with a Tunisian policeman. The attack was the worst on foreigners in Tunisia since an Al-Qaeda suicide bombing of a synagogue killed 21 people on the island of Djerba in 2002. Authorities are now organising an international march 'against terrorism' in Tunis on Sunday, similar to the one in Paris that followed the attacks earlier this year on the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly and a kosher supermarket. French President Francois Hollande is among those who have announced they will attend. A Tunisian policeman stands guard outside the museum. Authorities are now organising an international march 'against terrorism' in Tunis on Sunday . In a televised statement on Wednesday, President Beji Caid Essebsi urged a huge turnout. He said: 'I am calling on all Tunisians young and old... to take part in this march to show Tunisia's strength and its willingness to fight terrorism. ' The attack dealt a heavy blow to Tunisia's vital tourism industry as the country looks to rebuild its economy. The birthplace of the Arab Spring revolutionary movement, Tunisia has seen an upsurge in Islamic extremism since overthrowing longtime strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. But Tunisia has taken pride in forming a democratic government since the Arab Spring -- in marked contrast to countries such as Egypt and Libya.","Tunisian interior ministry said they had broken 80 per cent of the terror cell .

"An extremely rare teddy-bear lookalike mammal has been spotted in China for the first time in 20 years. The tiny Ili Pika, an eight-inch long rabbit-relative, is one of the world's most endangered animals with less than 1,000 animals believed to be left in its natural habitat. The Ili Pika population is believed to have declined by almost 70 per cent since its discovery in 1983, scientists say. Adorable: The Ili Pika is one of the world's rarest mammals, and has been spotted for the first time in 20 years in its natural territory in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China . The Ili Pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, was discovered by conservationist Li Weidong in 1983, who named it after his hometown. The animals can only be found in the Tianshan mountain range in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, and its territory is under threat, with the population rapidly declining. When the Ili Pika was first discovered, Mr Li and his team estimated that there were around 2,900 animals living in the Tianshan mountain range. Nearly 20 years later, in 2002, Mr Li conducted a new demographic, which found that the population had dropped to 2,000. Last year's fresh census, which is when the Ili Pika was spotted for the first time in 20 years, concluded that the population is down to less than 1,000 pikas. Rare animal: Chinese scientists believe that there are less than 1,000 Ili Pikas left in the world . Disappearing: Ili Pika population is believed to have declined by 70 per cent since its discovery in 1983 . 'I discovered the species, and I watched as it became endangered,' Mr Li told CNN. 'If it becomes extinct in front of me, I'll feel so guilty.' Very little is known about this rare species, as no successful observations about its ecology, behaviour or reproduction has been carried out. Mr Li believes global warming is the cause of the decline in Ili Pikas as the altitude of permanent snow in the Tianshan mountain range has risen. 'This tiny species could be extinct any time,' Mr Li added. 'They don't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore.' The Ili Pika was discovered by conservationist Li Weidong in 1983, and it was he who photographed the adorable animal for the first time in 20 years last summer .","The tiny Ili Pika lives in a mountain range in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China .

"A popular health blogger who reportedly failed to donate $300,000 in profits to charity has now admitted she was 'wrong' about the extent of her terminal cancer. The Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson, whose app has about 200,000 followers, claims she was 'misdiagnosed' by a doctor after announcing last year that life-threatening cancer had spread to her live, uterus, spleen and blood, The Australian reports. The 26-year-old, who became a social media sensation when she launched her hit lifestyle and recipe app after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, says she feels 'humiliated' after a German medical team's examination led her to announce she was battling a third and fourth cancer. The latest revelations come just a day after it emerged that Ms Gibson may have misled her followers by failing to donate 25 per cent of the profits from The Whole Pantry - totaling $300,000 - to charity, despite promising she would. Scroll down for video . Belle Gibson, 26, the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry recipe and health app, publicly said $300,000 in profits would go to charity, but they never did . There have also been revelations that Ms Gibson was dishonest about her recent medical history and told people she was again riddled with cancer, later claiming she had been 'misdiagnosed' Ms Gibson, who shunned traditional treatments to combat her cancer and instead opted for a wholefood and holistic approach to battling the disease, said she was confused by her misdiagnosis. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong... (I felt) confused, bordering on humiliated', Ms Gibson told The Australian. She revealed a medical team from Germany had examined her using 'magnetic' therapy and believes this investigation led to her misdiagnosis, although she declined to name the medical team. In July 2014 she broke the news of her illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal Instagram page. It read in part: 'With frustration and ache in my heart // my beautiful, gamechanging community, it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that I've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer. 'One is secondary and the other is primary. I have cancer in my blood, spleen, brain, uterus, and liver. I am hurting,' Ms Gibson wrote. Around 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up her initial post, revealing she was undergoing 'German integrative oncology protocol'. 'I'm following the same, yet amplified holistic medicine treatment plan, taking what I need from each respected modality; herbalism, acupuncture, nutrition etc and a new addition to it all with a German integrative oncology protocol. It took me a while, but I'm back in (adjusted) full force and taking each day as it comes.' On Monday Fairfax Media revealed Ms Gibson had not delivered on her promise to donate 25 per cent of The Whole Pantry's profits to charity, and reported she had lied about donating $300,000 in funds to a number of organisations. The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges $3.79 for the app . Ms Gibson has almost 200,000 followers on her personal Instagram account, who she has kept updated on her health and progress over the past few years. However there appear to be a number of inconsistencies in her medical history, age, and some recent ailments. The Australian reported that in 2009 she claimed to have undergone multiple heart surgeries where she died on the operating table, and months later was told by a doctor she had terminal brain cancer which left her only four months to live. She has said publicly that she was 20 at the time, but other documentation has indicated that she was born in 1991, meaning she was 17 in 2009. Many of Ms Gibson's social media postings from recent years have been removed, and her Instagram account is now private. Furthermore, when The Whole Pantry took to Facebook on Monday to defend the company, they appeared to be deleting comments questioning the validity of Ms Gibson's illness and business plan. The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges $3.79 for the app. At least five charities who purportedly had money raised for them through a number of campaigns run by Ms Gibson never saw any funds. The app, which has been downloaded over 300,000 times, proved so popular she was flown out to Silicon Valley last year where she was told her app was to be included on the Apple Watch. The 26-year-old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business' profits were being donated to charity, last year claiming that $300,000 had been donated. However Ms Gibson told Fairfax Media this week that those donations had never been made, citing disappointing app sales and miscalculated profit margins. Neither Melbourne's Asylum Seeker Resource Centre or One Girl - who were donated $1000 after questions were raised - received any money from Ms Gibson initially and the former claimed that it wasn't aware money was being raised in its name. 'In late 2013 The Whole Pantry advised One Girl that they would be fundraising on our behalf in an online fundraising event,' Chantelle Baxter, CEO, One Girl told Daily Mail Australia in a statement. 'In early 2015 One Girl approached Belle Gibson from The Whole Pantry to enquire about when a donation would be made to One Girl and how much was raised from the fundraising event.' She has also released a cookbook version of the creations following the success of the app . Ms Baxter said One Girl received a response from The Whole Pantry last week, which coincided with initial media inquiries into the business and they 'have since made a donation of $1,000 to One Girl.' 'Since this donation One Girl has asked The Whole Pantry for confirmation of the total amount raised through the online event and are awaiting their response,' Ms Baxter added. Apparently only $7000 in total has reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated. Penguin, the publisher of Ms Gibson's book which was launched off the back of her app's success said they did not see it necessary to seek confirmation on the entrepreneur's medical history or age during their dealings with her. 'Penguin did not seek or receive documentary evidence of Belle's medical condition or birth date prior to publication,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'We did not feel this was necessary as The Whole Pantry is a collection of food recipes, which Penguin has published in good faith. 'We are concerned about the questions raised in recent days - we'll discuss them with Belle as ultimately only she can answer the questions,' the spokesperson added. There were also revelations that neither the business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises, a situation that could lead to huge fines and potential jail time. Daily Mail Australia has contacted The Whole Pantry for comment and while they could not be reached at the time of publishing, they had earlier posted a lengthy response on social media addressing some of claims made in the original article. There have been revelations that The Whole Pantry business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises . Ms Gibson has appeared across a number of networks (pictured on Sunrise) speaking about her approach to healing . In the post to their Facebook page the company clarified they were a 'for-profit' company and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry. 'We have, like all start ups, struggled with managing all facets of a new business, biting off more than we could chew, juggling internal and external priorities with little staff. 'We have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external Business Manager and Accounts team, an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses. 'They have been working over our finances for the last five months, and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight. We were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward,' the post read in part. 'Our books are taking longer to bring up to date than anticipated. TWP forecasted income in October 2014 which was not fulfilled, creating cash-flow issues and unforeseen delays on finalising three discussed charitable donations,' another section of the post read. By citing 'cash flow issues' as Ms Gibson did when explaining the business model and why charities had received no donations, the lengthy response garnered harsh criticism from commentators. Last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new Apple Watch . Apparently only $7000 of a projected $300,000 has reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated . 'Appalling - your organisation not the media. Money for charity doesn't go into 'cash flow' - that is beyond unethical, surely it's illegal?', one angry subscriber posted. 'You have skipped the entire point in your very long and wordy response. YOU took money from people who GAVE you the money believing it would go to said charities, you FAILED to forward on the money,' another poster wrote. '... That my friends is dishonesty / theft in the highest degree and takes advantage of peoples good natures. SHAME on you,' the comment continued. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Belle Gibson, The Whole Pantry, and a number of the charities who were to receive donations, for comment.","The Whole Pantry is a health and recipe app created by Belle Gibson .

"An amazing image showing a collection of stars and nebulae has been released by the European Southern Observatory. In the colourful picture star clusters, emission nebulae and active star-forming regions are seen at a distance of about 4,000 light-years. The image is the most detailed view of this part of the sky, the southern constellation of Ara (The Altar), ever taken. Scroll down for a video zooming in to the region . This image, taken by OmegaCAM on the VLT Survey Telescope at Paranal Observatory, shows a section of the Ara OB1 stellar association. In the centre of the image is the young open cluster NGC 6193, and to the right is the emission nebula NGC 6188, illuminated by the ionising radiation emitted by the brightest nearby stars . The image was created using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO’s) Paranal Observatory in Chile. At the centre of the image is an open star cluster called NGC 6193, which contains about 30 bright stars. A nebula, which comes from the Latin word for ‘cloud’, is a region of gas and dust in space. Some are the remains of dead stars that have expelled their gas, whereas others are regions where new stars are being formed. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. There are four main types: planetary nebulae, reflection nebulae, absorption nebulae and emission nebulae. The two brightest are extremely hot and giant stars, which provide illumination for a nearby emission nebula called the Rim Nebula, or NGC 6188. This includes the extremely bright star HD 150136, at the centre, which is likely to actually be a pair of stars that are extremely close to each other. The reddish glow comes from giant clouds of hydrogen, which are lit up by the intense ultraviolet light from the cluster of hot young stars in the middle of the picture. They are spread over a region known as the Ara OB1 association, which continues outside the limits of this picture - and is a region of similar hot and bright stars that formed at the same time. The blue colouration is scattered light from these stars, while the brown darker features are huge clouds of cosmic dust, which absorb the light. The Rim Nebula is towards the right-centre of the image, and is the prominent wall of dark and bright clouds that provides a border to an active star-forming region called RCW 108. The nebula is about 300 light-years long and contains young stars that formed as recently as a few million years ago - a blink of an eye in cosmic terms. At the centre of the image is an open star cluster called NGC 6193, while on the right is the Rim Nebula. Move the slider to see labels for the image .

The entire image was created by combining more than 500 individual pictures taken through four colour filters with the VLT Survey Telescope. The total exposure time was more than 56 hours. ‘A great deal of computer work was needed to combine the many individual pictures and make this detailed colour view from them,’ a spokesperson for the ESO told MailOnline. ‘This is a great image for studying what goes on in star formation regions, and how the young stars interact with their surroundings - and also trigger the next generation of star birth.’","A telescope array in Chile has captured the most detailed image ever made of a portion of the southern sky .

"It was a coal freighter that overturned in a horrific storm in 1940, sinking, along with the 32 crew aboard, 210 feet below the surface of Lake Michigan, just off the coast of Pentwater. While the shipwreck of the SS William B. Davock was finally found, upside down, by  divers in 1972, an investigation into why it sank was deemed all but impossible, due to the murkiness of the water.

The reason for its sinking was unknown . Wreck: The ship sits upside down on the shore of Lake Michigan, 210 feet below the surface and just off the coast of Pentwater. Because of the way it sits and the murkiness of the water, investigations weren't possible .

The dive allowed for the first-known footage of the ship to be taken. The footage, taken by MSRA diver Jeff Vos, of Holland, showed a broken rudder and snapped propeller blade. 'The waves were so strong, they must have snapped the rudder's connection, at which point it swung so far over that it struck the propeller,' Vos told Michigan Live. 'With no power or steering, the Davock would have been at the mercy of the storm.' The Davock had little warning the storm was to hit on November 11, 1940. With 75 mph winds, 30-foot waves and rain turning to snow, it is still referred to as 'the most disastrous day in the history of Lake Michigan shipping'. Discovery: During a dive last fall, the Michigan Shipwreck Research Association (MSRA), a nonprofit underwater archaeological organization were able to capture the first-ever footage of the wreck, determining a rudder the broke in the storm struck the propeller (pictured) Taking coal to Chicago, the Davock went down five miles out from Little Sable Point between Ludington, Michigan and Pentwater, Michigan. Another ship, cargo carrier the SS Anna C. Minch, also went down, along with all 24 aboard, while several other ships were damaged and ran aground. MSRA board member, Craig Rich, further explained what caused the Davock to sink. 'It would have sent the ship into what we call a shivering mode,' he told MLive. 'Without the rudder, it wouldn't have been able to steer and without the propeller working properly you can't drive it forward. 'The ship would have gone into the trough of the wave sideways which would have swamped the ship.' 'X' marks the spot: The shipwreck of the Davock five miles out from Little Sable Point between Ludington, Michigan and Pentwater, Michigan. The freighter was en route to Chicago when it sank . The MSRA was motivated to delve deeper into investigating the Davock after the waters of Lake Michigan started to clear in recent years. 'We decided to give it a shot,' Rich said. ""The divers didn't even use a light for the discovery. 'It's not as warm as it is in the Caribbean, but it's certainly starting to rival it in clarity. 'It was a warm, sunny day. 'The ambient light was amazing.' The SS William B. Davock was a lake freighter that was constructed in 1907 by Great Lakes Engineering Works in St. Clair, Minnesota .","The SS William B.

"My hair is thin and flat, and it never seems to grow longer than just past my shoulders. Do you have any tips for adding much-needed volume? Karen, 53, Cheshire. Mother-of-four Karen was fed up of trying to make her limp hair look and feel thicker. Like many busy women, she had found her hair had thinned, thanks to hormonal changes, but this can also be caused by stress, a poor diet or illness. BEFORE: Mother-of-four Karen (pictured) is fed-up with trying to make her long, limp hair look thicker . While Karen had used clip-in hair extensions in the past, and found that they worked well, she wanted a longer-lasting solution. The most important thing with hair extensions is that they look natural. It’s equally important that they don’t damage your real hair or prevent it from growing. So, we visited the Real Hair salon in Chelsea, South-West London, where stylist Chanelle applied Beauty Works semi-permanent hair extensions. With 46 shades to choose from, it was easy to match them to Karen’s hair colour. The strips of hair have a bonded keratin tip, which is attached to your hair. The keratin is transparent, which means that the joins are barely visible. Chanelle blended four different shades into Karen’s hair to create a natural look. Then, she cut them, so that they blended in with Karen’s natural hair. AFTER: Karen (pictured) had semi-permanent hair extensions put in at the Real Hair salon in Chelsea, South-West London, they should last six months . The finished result promises to last six months. The keratin bond can withstand washing, drying and brushing — however, good aftercare is essential. To keep her extensions in top condition, Karen was advised to use a nourishing shampoo and conditioner, along with a serum, heat protection product and weekly deep conditioning mask. OR TRY THE NEW VOLUMISERS … . Not everyone is suitable for hair extensions. But if they’re not for you, there are some excellent products to use as an alternative. The new John Frieda Luxurious Volume 7 Day Volume In-Shower Treatment (£9.99, boots.com) is designed for hair that lacks body. A semi-permanent treatment, it creates volume by building a polymer network onto hair fibres, enhancing the texture and fullness of individual strands. Shampoo and conditioner can also make a real difference. The Ogario London Revive and Shine Conditioner (£18.50, ogariolondon.com) blends pro-vitamin B5, which boosts the water content of your hair. It is also rich in minerals and ideal for helping to promote healthy hair growth. Kerastase has invented its first youth activator serum, Densifique Serum Jeunesse (£49, kerastase.co.uk). Apply to the scalp on towel-dried hair. The Trevor Sorbie Rejuvenate range has a collagen and peptide complex to repair and strengthen. Try Rejuvenate Strengthening Treatment (£9.99, Boots) after shampooing, then rinse. Mousse is an old favourite for volume boosting, as the polymers and binding agents make it easier to style. Try the Andrew Barton Supreme Volume Big Body Beautiful Mousse (£2.50, Asda). Finally, the Colab Extreme Volume Dry Shampoo (£2.50, Superdrug) in a handy 50 ml size is perfect for volume on the go. Karen’s extensions were applied at Real Hair, Cale Street, Chelsea. Prices from £350. Beauty Works has more than 1,000 stockists across the UK and Ireland (beautyworksonline.com). UNSUNG HERO .

Amazingly, it’s been around for more than 100 years and can be used to soothe insect bites, blisters, burns and even skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema. The rich, hydrating formula has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. The cream is thick, so it needs to be worked into the skin until absorbed. BARGAIN BUY . Essence long-lasting lipsticks (£2.30, wilko.com ) Nude shades are big news for spring — especially for lips. The secret is to find a shade that complements your complexion. The new collection of Essence long-lasting lipsticks (£2.30, wilko.com) has a shade to suit all skin tones. ELSA'S PICK . Bobbi Brown has launched a limited edition shade of its iconic Pot Rouge — Pretty Powerful 11 (£19, Bobbi Brown). Just a tiny touch will give lips or cheeks a boost of fresh colour. For each compact sold, the full price (less VAT) will be donated to Smart Works, a charity that gives styling advice to out-of-work women. Rimmel Sun Shimmer Self-Tan Mousse (£7.99, Boots) is a fast-drying tan that develops in one hour. Massage the mousse in with a tanning mitt to ensure an even coverage. It comes in three shades — light, medium and dark — and all are matte, so there’s no unwanted sparkle. For your first self-tan of the year, it’s always best to build up the colour slowly — so if you’re fair-skinned, start with the lightest shade and use it over three days to get a natural glow. It’s always a good idea to pick a face mask based on your skin’s individual needs. The new NSpa masks cost just £1.59, or two for £3 at Asda, so you can choose one or two to address your skin’s particular issues. Choose from Radiance Boosting, which infuses skin with vitamins and brightens the complexion, Warming Detox, which draws out impurities, Deep Cleansing Mud, which gives skin a real glow, or Professional Peeling, which will calm down your blemishes.","Mother-of-four Karen is fed up trying to make her limp hair look thicker .

"The White House blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday for holding up the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general, saying the 'unconscionable delay' calls into question the Kentucky lawmaker's leadership abilities. The verbal strike on McConnell came after the Republican legislator said over the weekend that he wouldn't allow a vote on New York prosecutor Loretta Lynch's confirmation until the Senate passes a once bipartisan sex trafficking bill that Democrats are now refusing to support over a provision limiting funding for abortions. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the delay on the attorney general post reflected 'inept leadership,' not a flaw in the trafficking bill, and that the move suggested the White House could no longer trust congressional Republicans to act in good faith. The spat is the latest indication that the respective goodwill professed by the White House and GOP leaders after November's elections, when Republicans were swept into control of Congress, has since soured and is now curdling. Scroll down for video . UNCONSCIONABLE: White House spokesman Josh Earnest blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday for holding up the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general, saying the delay calls into question the Kentucky lawmaker's leadership abilities . The verbal strike on McConnell came after the Republican legislator said over the weekend that he wouldn't allow a vote on New York prosecutor Loretta Lynch's confirmation until the Senate finishes a once bipartisan human trafficking bill that Democrats are now refusing to support over a provision limiting funding for abortions . Battling for control of the federal government with the executive branch, the first few months of the GOP's reign over the legislative branch has been marked by constant bickering with the White House and numerous veto threats. In an attempt to balance what they saw as executive overreach on the part of the president, who in November took unilateral action to save millions of illegal immigrants from deportation against the wishes of Republicans in Congress, the GOP last month attempted to hold captive funding for the Homeland Security department. The majority party ended up with egg on its face, though, when it opted to back down from the fight and appropriate money to the department rather than watching it to go into shut down mode until Democrats backed a measure to defund Obama's immigration directives - a scenario that may have never come about. House Republicans in January also stuck their finger in the eye of the Obama administration when Boehner secretly invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress. Usually, the executive branch coordinates visits with foreign heads of state. More recently, Senate Republicans wrote a letter to Iranian leaders cautioning them that a nuclear pact with the current administration may not last. The missive could undermine the tenuous negotiations the U.S. and its allies are in with the Middle Eastern country. McConnell is now using the Lynch confirmation vote as a bargaining chip in his fight to keep a provision that would place heavy restrictions on use of money for abortion in a victims fund named in the child sex trafficking bill. Democrats had already signed off on the legislation in committee before they realized that the measure was included. They have since backed away from the bill as is and accused Republicans of trying to hoodwink them, despite having had weeks to read the legislation in full before a final vote. 'If they want to have time to turn to the attorney general bill next week, we need to finish up this human trafficking bill,' McConnell said Sunday on CNN. Earnest at one point suggested that McConnell, pictured here last week at a press conferene on Captiol Hill with other Senate Republicans, is 'inept' as a leader . Obama's spokesman lit into McConnell on Monday over the play. 'You've got to hand it to Republicans, that they've taken even a measure as common sense as that and turned it into a partisan controversy,' Obama's spokesman said today. 'The fact that leader McConnell can't build bipartisan support for a child sex-trafficking bill, I think, is an indication that his leadership here in the majority is not off to a very strong start. Earnest at another point suggested that McConnell is 'inept,' The GOP leader, he said, should just take out the offending abortion measure in order to get Democrats back on board. 'I don't really understand,' he said, why the majority leader doesn't look at this situation and say, 'Let's remove the objection so we can get it passed, and get it signed into law.' Although the White House frequently threatens to veto pending bills unpalatable to Obama, Earnest wouldn't say whether Obama would sign the bill with the abortion language included. He suggested the issue is moot because Republicans don't have enough support to pass it anyway. In a sharp rebuke, the White House appeared to question whether Obama can trust McConnell and his fellow GOP leaders and 'whether their word is good with the president.' Earnest pointed out that McConnell had argued last year that Lynch's confirmation should wait until the new GOP-run Senate was seated in January, but was now claiming publicly that it was Democrats who prolonged the confirmation by waiting until 2015. The White House spokesman said he is often asked if McConnell 'is a man of his word.' This incident is not 'a very good sign of faith,' Earnest proclaimed. Ironically, Republicans' strategy to force a vote in support of the sex trafficking legislation before taking a vote on Lynch's nomination prolongs the departure of one of their least favorite Obama administration officials from the president's service: Eric Holder, pictured here to the left of the president. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid chimed in on Monday and said that McConnell 'gave his word' that Lynch would receive fair consideration. 'Now he's hedging on that,' Reid said during a speech on the Senate floor. 'Republicans simply can't govern,' Reid, the Senate's majority leader until Republican took over in January, argued. McConnell's spokesman Don Stewart blamed the trafficking bill kerfuffle on Democrats in a statement provided to the Associated Press. And given White House's hesitancy to issue a veto, he said, the president, not McConnell, should ask his party members to swallow a version of the bill it doesn't entirely agree with. 'They need to choose between a partisan filibuster and the pleas of thousands of abused children across the country,' Stewart said. 'And they need to do it soon.' Ironically, Republicans' strategy to force a vote in support of the sex trafficking legislation before taking a vote on Lynch's nomination prolongs the departure of one of their least favorite Obama administration officials from the president's service: Eric Holder. Earnest confirmed today that Holder will remain on the job,‘gettin' up early and workin' late,' as long as is 'necessary.'","The Senate majority leader won't allow a vote on Loretta Lynch's confirmation until the Senate passes a sex trafficking bill .

"Eighty drivers a day are being snapped by a new speed camera on the M4 motorway, generating £450,000 worth of fines, it has emerged. The traffic camera is on a notoriously busy stretch of road and has already snapped 4,500 motorists in a two month period. Drivers had been used to slowing down for a fixed camera in the 50mph zone at Port Talbot, South Wales. The traffic camera is on a notoriously busy stretch of the M4 (pictured) near Port Talbot, South Wales . But since November last year, it has been replaced with an 'average speed' check - meaning motorists have to drive more cautiously. Chris Hume, from GoSafe, the Wales Road Casualty Reduction Partnership, said he was 'disappointed' by drivers speeding between junctions 40 and 41 of the motorway. He said: 'Excessive and inappropriate speed remains a factor in collisions, associated fatalities, serious injuries and, in this case, also contributes to the traffic congestion. 'On average day there are still 80 motorists showing a complete disregard for the speed limit and putting lives at risk.' Drivers who are caught will either get three points on their licence with a £100 fine or the option of a speed awareness course for £85. The new cameras measure the speed at which a vehicle is travelling by tracking it over a set distance. Using data from several locations, it can tell how fast a motorist is driving based on its average, rather than at a set moment.","New speed cameras on M4 near Port Talbot are catching 80 motorists a day .

"He joined The Daily Show as a correspondent only three months ago. But now, Trevor Noah has reportedly emerged as the frontrunner to replace host Jon Stewart. The 31-year-old South African comedian has apparently been named on a short list of potential successors to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the Comedy Central show this year. He is being considered for an integral position on the program, a source close to the matter told Variety magazine. However, no final decision has yet been reached by network executives. Scroll down for video . Replacement? Trevor Noah (left) joined The Daily Show as a correspondent three months ago. But now, he has reportedly emerged as the frontrunner to replace the Comedy Central program's host Jon Stewart (right) 'Shortlisted': The 31-year-old South African comedian (pictured in 2012) has apparently been named on a short list of potential successors to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the show this year . According to the source, Comedy Central's efforts to select a replacement for Stewart - who has hosted the satirical news show for a staggering 16 years - have gained speed in recent days. Last month, shortly after Stewart revealed his plans to step down from his role, company executive Doug Herzog confirmed that a 'short list' of possible replacements had already been put together. He added that the channel and Stewart were consulting on when he will depart his job, as well as discussing whether he will have continue to have a role with the show he has hosted since 1999. When asked about a possible future role, Herzog, 55, the president of Viacom Entertainment Group, replied 'TBD', meaning 'to be determined'. He then added: 'It's not out of the question.' If Noah - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on-air - replaces Stewart on The Daily Show this year, he will be joining a primarily white, male and straight late night show landscape. At present, Comedy Central is the only network to have an African-American host: Larry Wilmore, A network spokesman declined to tell Variety whether Noah was being considered for Stewart's job. No stranger to controversy: During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, Noah (pictured during the broadcast) used his mixed-race heritage and politics to amuse viewers. Referring to protests in the US over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart that his arms were 'tired' from constantly 'holding them up' Thorny issues: 'I never thought I'd be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa,' he said, adding: 'It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days back home.' He also riffed on Ebola with Stewart . Noah, who grew up in Gauteng, started his entertainment career at 18 on the South African soap opera, Isidingo. He shortly began hosting his own radio show on the region's main youth station. Now, he is a well-known TV personality in the country, with his stand-up shows often selling out. In 2012, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to feature on NBC's The Tonight Show. The following year, he became the first to appear on CBS's Late Show With David Letterman. During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, the comedian, whose mother is a black South African and father is a white Swiss, discussed race and politics to amuse viewers. Referring to protests across the United States over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart his arms were 'tired' because he had been constantly 'holding them up' since he had arrived in America. Positive: Over the past 24 hours, people across the country have been taking to social media to express their views on Noah as the potential new host of The Daily Show, with many deeming it 'great' news (pictured) 'A great addition': Briton Tim Browning tweeted Noah, asking: 'Any truth to rumour about the daily show?' Hopeful: A Twitter user called Sarah said she hoped 'so badly' the comedian would be named the new host . 'I never thought I'd be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa,' he said, adding: 'It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days back home.' He also riffed on Ebola with Stewart. And he challenged the host to game of 'Spot The Africa', featuring snapshots of America and Africa. Following the article in Variety, people across the country have taken to social media to express their views on Noah as the potential new host of The Daily Show, with many deeming it 'great' news. Twitter user Andrej Novak‏ wrote: '@Trevornoah didn't appear much on @TheDailyShow, but from what we could see, he looks like a great replacement. Show must go on.' Meanwhile, a British man named Tim Browning tweeted Noah, asking him: 'Any truth to rumour about the daily show?' He added: 'Good luck. I think you would be a great addition!' Appearance: In 2012, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to feature on NBC's The Tonight Show (pictured). In 2013, he became the first to appear on CBS's Late Show With David Letterman . Departure: Stewart's (pictured) departure was announced by Comedy Central President Michele Ganeless after the host broke the news to the studio audience at a taping in New York at the beginning of February . And a user called Sarah said she hoped 'so badly' that the comedian would be named the new host. In addition to being the show's host, Stewart is currently also an executive producer. His firm, Busboy Productions, produces The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, which replaced The Colbert Report. It is unclear whether the short list includes former The Daily Show correspondent John Oliver, who moved over to HBO after successfully filling in for Stewart when he took a movie-making break. Asked about whether Oliver is a candidate last month, Herzog's reply was succinct. 'John Oliver's got a job,' he said, later adding: 'I think he's spoken for.' Another obvious candidate for the role - the veteran The Daily Show contributor Samantha Bee - has apparently been ruled out after accepting a deal to start a program at Time Warner's TBS. Her husband, Jason Jones, is heading to TBS with her. And correspondent Jessica Williams has deemed herself 'extremely under-qualified' for Stewart's position, Entertainment Weekly reported. Whoever is chosen as replacement on the program has heavy lifting to do. Stewart, who grew up in New York City, is expected to leave his role at some point between July and the end of the year. 'It's not easy. The shadow of Jon Stewart is going to loom large. What you have to get comfortable with is, it's just not going to be Jon Stewart. And it's going to be different,' Herzog told AP. Still to be decided: The Daily Show contributors Samantha Bee and Jason Jones (left) have apparently been ruled out as possible replacements after accepting a deal to start a program at Time Warner's TBS. Right, TV executive Doug Herzog, 55, said whether Stewart will have a future role on the show is 'to be determined' He added that, whatever happens, 'The Daily Show' is 'a format that's built to last, and last it will.' Stewart's departure was announced by Comedy Central President Michele Ganeless after the host broke the news to the studio audience at a taping in New York at the beginning of February. 'This show doesn't deserve an even slightly restless host, and neither do you,' Stewart told the audience, blinking back tears. 'I'm gonna have dinner, on a school night, with my family,' he added. Ganeless called Stewart a 'comic genius.' But she did not say what led to his decision to leave. The revelation sparked a huge reaction online, prompting Stewart, who has amassed 19 Emmys, to joke: 'Last night I was perusing the internet, and I guess my question to you is, ""Did I die?""'","Trevor Noah, 31, joined The Daily Show as correspondent last December .

"Police in Florida have dramatic released bodycam footage of a deadly raid where an unarmed fugitive was shot and killed at his home. U.S. Marshalls and sheriff's deputies are seen surrounding the home of Corey Tanner in Flager County in August 2014 while four children are inside. The 24-year-old serial criminal, whose family say had mental health problems and was on medication, was wanted for attempted murder. Scroll down for video . Raid: U.S. Marshalls and sheriff's deputies are seen surrounding the home of Corey Tanner in Flager County, Florida, serving a warrant for attempted murder . Ready: Officers are heard shouting at the 24-year-old serial criminal to surrender and walk out . Officers are then heard repeatedly telling Tanner to leave the home with his hands up while getting into position, but the demands are ignored. The four youngsters said to be in the house at the time are then allowed out, leaving Tanner in the bedroom. The sheriff's department then drives a patrol round with his brother, John, in the back seat in a bid to talk Tanner out of the house without harm. He says his brother is not armed and pleads for them to bring his mother in to persuade him to give up. Minutes into the stand-off, the video, obtained by Local 6, skips when the fatal shots are fired and officers are seen going around to the side of the house. Another man who was believed to be in the house at the time is seen being frisked on the lawn by the side of the property before he is released.

'They didn't give him a chance,' said Tanner's mother, Brenda Williams. 'He had problems because he was bi-polar and had other mental problems, but almost everybody knew that.'

"The City of Light is often captured in all its beauty with a series of images that show off its romantic side. But an American filmmaker has created a three-minute video that presents Paris in an entirely unique way. Sean Collins, a 31-year-old from Los Angeles, used special effects to make the French capital's famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tour and Arc de Triomphe, and pedestrians look like miniature toys. The video is the work of photographer Sean Collins, who studied at the American School of Paris . The American video maker captures a shot of the Eiffel Tower in the distance of his unique film . Sean filmed the scenes over the course of eight days while visiting his girlfriend, a Boston University student who is studying in Paris. He said: ‘When I went to visit her we decided to make this video. On her days off she accompanied me to the sites to film. ‘We couldn't film on rainy, cloudy or days with poor air quality and we had to go to each location multiple times.’ Sean, who was educated at The American School of Paris, but later studied at a film school in California, explained that his intention was to present the French capital in a way it has never been seen before. Sean Collins experimented with effects that make Paris famous landmarks look like small toy sets . The people captured underneath the Eiffel Tower in a timelapse shot appear to look like figurines . He said: ‘My goal was to show Paris to the world in a new light for those who have never had the experience or never managed to make it those sites.’ The video opens on a landscape shot of the city, with the Eiffel Tower and Army Museum appearing to be positioned almost too close together. The Champ de Mars is presented in beautiful saturated green colours with people walking around it, appearing to look like figurines. Sean spent two weeks testing different ways to change the texture of the different images . A train is captured in the film and appears to look like a toy being controlled by a child . Shots of boats travelling under bridges tie Paris' natural beauty with its urban iconography . A couple of timelapse shots of the Eiffel Tower continue this theme before a train, which looks like it could be being controlled by a child, travels across a bridge. More landscape shots show a breakdancer looking like a puppet on a string and a group playing football. As darkness descends on the Parisian streets the landscapes become more beautiful, before daylight is reinstated and the traffic begins to swell. Sean recorded the video over eight days with the help of his girlfriend who he was visiting in Paris . The Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups shots of people looking like toys . A distant shot of the Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups of people negotiating busy streets. Eventually the video concludes with footage of pigeons, a boat travelling under a bridge – which ties Paris’ beauty as a natural landscape and an urban city together – and a casual shot of the Eiffel Tower. Discussing the difficulties faced while filming, Sean explained that the final result is the product of much experimentation. Sean's goal was to show Paris in a new light for those who have never had the chance to experience it . Sean had to prepare for each shot and was unable to film on rainy or cloudy days or days with poor air quality . ‘It's not as simple as just adding blur to the top and bottom to achieve the effect. I spent two weeks testing different ways to change the ""texture"" of the image,’ he said. ‘I experimented with some really distorted toy-like effects but eventually settled on this more subtle effect. This was a combination of noise reduction and sharpening.’ Sean’s work is available on his Facebook page and the original video can be viewed here.","Sean Collins, from LA, created the three-minute footage over eight days .

"From the modesty of bloomers to the seductiveness of lacy corsets, a new exhibition gives us a rare glimpse into the most intimate and private parts of history. The Powerhouse Museum in Sydney have unveiled their 'Undressed: 350 Years of Underwear in Fashion' collection, which features undergarments from the 17th-century to  more modern garments worn by celebrities such as Emma Watson, Cindy Crawford and even Queen Victoria. The exhibition features 81 pieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and includes a  section devoted to the fetish corsets and fur-trimmed designs of racy Australian dominatrix Madame Lash. Scroll down for video . A highlight of the exhibition is this hot pink corset from the 18th century . Apart from a brief stint in Bendigo and Perth, the collection has never been seen by any members of the public before and lead curator Edwina Ehrman believes people will be both shocked and intrigued by what's on display. 'The exhibition focuses on how important underwear has been since the 17th century right through to the present day,' Ms Ehrman told Daily Mail Australia. 'It looks at the way women have used underwear and garments to constrict their body. 'For instance when it was desirable to have a slim waist or broaden their hips.' The collection also takes a look at the more practical aspects of underwear, such as hygiene and keeping women warm in the Winter or cool in the Summer. In the 18th century, proprietary was measured by the type of clothes you wore and while this is very much a fashion exhibition, it also delves into the social aspects of underwear and its status in society. A special section of the exhibition has been dedicated to famous dominatrix Madame Lash . 77 mannequins will showcase over 81 garments at the exhibition. The V&A house over 100,000 items and the collection is particularly strong from the 18th century onwards. The vast majority of the garments come from the museum's own archives however some garments were borrowed from designers to showcase their work. The exhibition is ordered chronologically. The first section covers the practical side of underwear while the second section looks at how underwear was used to fit the body and seduce men. It looks at corsets, targeting in the 18th century and how women's shapes have changed. The bra is then introduced with the girdle and the collection shows how important technology has been in the advancement of undergarments. There is a section which looks at the Victorian period and very closely at the fashions from the 20th century and particularly the 1990s. 'Some of the garments on display have been worn in adverts or fashion magazines to promote underwear and the fashionable body image,' Ms Ehrman said. The key image from the exhibition is that of a hot pink corset with delicate black lace detailing. 77 mannequins will showcase 81 designs from the 17th century onwards, including racy, seductive and functional underwear . It was considered quite racy in the 1890s and was an extremely unexpected colour from that era. 'It was a very high end corset,' Ms Ehrman said. 'It’s covered with silk satin - not cotton or linen - and the brighter the colour in general the more expensive the corset was. It’s quite racy and it’s very much a piece that would have been revealed as a woman undresses. It’s a star item.' A garment that is sure to shock people is the maternity corset from the 18th century. 'People grew up wearing corsets and there were no bras at this time so people would have felt undressed and they would lose their self esteem if they didn't wear a corset,' Ms Ehrman said. 'But it’s very cleverly designed. I love the technology and invention that’s gone into creating the undergarments.' The exhibition has dedicated a whole section to Australian artist and famous dominatrix Madame Lash (Gretel Pinniger). The 70-year-old became famous in the 70's when she opened Sydney's first retail S&M emporium on Oxford Steet called Game Birds. She was a pioneer of her generation and spent years designing and creating intricate corsets and controversial S&M gear. Even now, Ms Pinniger lives and breaths the underworld life and at the opening of the exhibition even decided to wear a white corset adorned with a crown of flowers and a sacred heart which lit up. Some of the garments are sure to shock people but most open up a conversation about the role undergarments play in society . The corset had actually been designed for Pinniger for the Sydney Mardi Gras parade, where she was a celebrant and married three same-sex couples. However she told Daily Mail Australia that she is extremely honoured to be included in the collection and is proud of her work, which she conducted 34-years-ago. 'They have included an exhibition of my work they've had for so long which is a great honour for me,' Ms Pinniger said. 'They were things I made 34 years ago and they've included the painted ones. I did the painting on those garments in the first two weeks of my son’s life.' Ms Pinniger was inspired to venture down the seductive S&M road over 35-years-ago. 'For my own interests - and for others who I hoped would be interested - I was making corsets and corset dresses. Ms Pinniger said she became 'fascinated' with corsetry while on a trip to London with her fiancée at the time. This blue silk corset is a typical style that would have been worn by Queen Victoria  in the 1860s . He took her to a place called Madame Medeq, a famous corset-maker's shop in London. 'It was a very discreet establishment that made purportedly medical corsets but but she ordered out for her clientèle,' Ms Pinniger said. 'I got measured up for two very tight and restrictive corsets and when she finished with me she turned to my fiancée and said ‘and for you sir?’ Ms Pinniger said she was 'completely thrilled' with the whole thing and took her interest back to Sydney where she opened up her own business. 'I took great pain over each garment,' she said. 'I made my clothes in fantasy fabrics and I measured everybody for those garments. I had ideas on the rack but really the business depended on me because they would order from me and I’d design for them.' 'So I made garments for brides,men, Madame Lash and anyone who wanted to live the fantasy life. 'I've always liked people who were different and who wanted to be taken out of their usual selves when they were in my clothing and I succeeded there. A range of garments from such designers as Calvin Klein, Vivienne Westwood and Jean Paul Gaultier will be on display . When she eventually sold her business in 1986 to become a full-time artist, she had a garage sale and each item was snapped up. Now Ms Pinniger says she is extremely grateful that her designs are being honoured at the exhibition. Included in the Madame Lash's collection is a brasserie and g-string and a ruffled white and pink corset designed in 1981. A white leather corset with scalped detail and metal reinforcements is also on display along with women's bloomers and leather cuffs. 'Back then Sydney was not mono-cultural but it certainly wasn't multicultural,' Ms Pinniger said. 'Now in Sydney I see dresses that I would kill to be able to go into a shop to buy. Back then I had to pour ink into nail polish just to get a colour.' 'Everything's very accessible now but the workmanship that goes into real corsets and what I used to put into corsets is what I’d like to see again.' Undressed's core themes include modesty and practicality, decoration and seduction and control and corsetry . Ms Pinniger said people are more adventurous with their undergarments now and believes that her shop would have thrived in the modern world. 'My collection was done 35 years ago and some people have said that they can remember my shop but they were too scared to go in. Now there’s quite a taste for it,' she said. 'I think the things I did back then would definitely work to a much bigger clientèle than I attracted. 'I was there for the love of it, you couldn't say it was majorly profitable. Very often I had to pawn my rings to pay my workers. It was always a bit touch and go.'

"An Iranian man who permanently disfigured another in an acid attack has had his eye gouged as punishment. The man, only identified as Hamid S., poured acid over victim Davoud Roshanaei in 2005, causing him to lose an eye and an ear. An Iranian court sentenced him to qesas, 'retribution in kind' and he has now had his eye and ear surgically removed at a prison in Karaj, . Eye for an eye: Victim Davoud Roshanaei, pictured before and after the attack, had acid poured over his face and body, causing him to lose an eye and an ear . Hamid S was reported to have been sedated in Rajai Shahr prison in Karaj, 33 miles west of the Iranian capital Tehran, on Thursday. A team of doctors then removed his left eye, but postponed the removal of his right, state-owned Hamshahri newspaper reported according to the New York Daily News. In addition to his qesas, Hamid S must pay a fine to Mr Roshanaei and serve a ten-year jail sentence. The surgery was meant to have been carried out in January, but was postponed after medical staff at Rajai Shahr prison refused to carry out the qesas. 'The delay is from the medical side and is not our fault,' a judge later told the state-run Iranian Fars news agency. Justice: Mr Roshanaei's attacker was sentenced to qesas, 'retribution in kind', and has now had his eye and ear surgically removed at a prison in Karaj . Critique: An Iranian human rights organisation has attacked the 'eye for an eye' punishment, calling the practice 'barbaric' 'We had a meeting with the forensic medicine and they will let us know once there is a doctor who is willing to carry out the sentence'. An international Iranian human rights organisation based in Norway has condemned the punishment, calling it 'barbaric'. 'Removal of inhumane punishment in law and practice must be a prerequisite for any improvement of relations between Iranian authorities and the international community,' Iran Human Rights's spokesperson Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddan said. 'Participation in such punishments are serious violations of the Hippocratic oath and anyone who takes part in carrying out such sentences can not be called a doctor.'","Davoud Roshanaei was attacked with acid and lost an eye and an ear .

"The original maybe more than 50 years old, but you can once again take to the road in a brand new Ford Mustang. A Florida startup company called Revology is selling a clone of the first-generation car, souped up for the 21st century. You won't be able to tell from looking at vehicle, but it comes complete with LED headlights and even remote central locking. The seats and windows are electric - and all disguised in the classic 1960s interior decor. Scroll down for video... Can it be true? Florida startup Revology is selling a picture perfect clone of the first-generation Mustang . Classic: Revology starts with licensed replica bodies built by Dynacorn, filling them with a collection of curated parts intended to improve on the ride and performance of the classic while maintaining its old-school style . Welcome back: Revology Cars unveiled the new version of an old Ford Mustang on Saturday . Way back when: The cars are licensed Ford Mustangs from the original production line that ran between late 1964 and 1966, using authorized reproduction bodies and equipment . Revology founder Tom Scarpello introduced the vehicles this past weekend. They are modeled on the original muscle-cars sold between 1964 to 1966. Numerous details ensure the new car maintains the look of the original, including power windows that are activated by pushing or pulling on the original window crank handle. Although the bodies of the vehicles are new, some of the insides are made up of curated parts intended to improve on the ride and performance of the classic while maintaining its old-school style. The engine is a re-manufactured 1990's-era 302 V8 supplied by Ford, which was chosen because it's the same size as the original 289 V8 and fits perfectly in the chassis without any modifications. The engine is a fuel-injected 5.0-liter V8 producing about 265 HP. Of course with modem technology the ride is even smoother than the original with new suspension and power steering too. Legend: The cars power came in from a 302-cubic inch V8 Windsor engine, a motor engine first introduced in 1962 . Old favorite: The body design has been licensed by Ford , which is making this car the closest thing to buying a restored classic Mustang . Back on the market: The original Ford Mustang is a half-century old, but now you can buy a brand new one . Used car or new car? The Revology Mustang replica was unveiled to the public for the first time last weekend at the Amelia Island Concours . Fastback flashback: A fastback starts at $ 119,500.00, while a convertible with power top is listed at $122,000, with deliveries on new orders starting next year . Groovy: The car can be equipped with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic gearbox . Spot the difference: Look closely, and you’ll notice the LED head and taillights . Style: The car has power seats and windows that are operated by switches disguised as wind-up cranks . Opening up the ashtray will lead you to something of a surprise with a USB and Aux ports for the Bluetooth-equipped two-speaker AM/FM radio. There's also remote keyless entry and even air conditioning. However, even with all of the upgrades, Revology's Mustang replica looks so authentic, it can easily be mistaken for a perfectly restored original . Revology hopes that several of the cars can be built although it will cost considerably more than the original $2368 base price. Ford sold 1.3 million of the original Mustang model first time around. The 1964 1/2 Mustang' fastback starts at $119,500 while a convertible with power drop-top roof will go for $122,000. 'Our car is not just a copy,' Scarpello says in a promotional video the company produced. 'Our car is really a postmodern interpretation of that original Mustang. In other words, it is upgraded with modern technology and materials that weren't available 50 years ago.' The company reported that the response at Saturday's car show in Florida was 'overwhelmingly positive.' 'We have about 50 people who are seriously interested in buying one of our Mustangs,' Scarpello said. 'The next step is to find a new facility and start building.' However some car enthusiasts say that it should be possible to recreate a Mustang by simply replacing the older parts of an original mode for closer to $38,000... but then who has the time for that?! The replicas should be in driveways by next spring. Old friend:  It's still undeniably a Mustang in shape, naturally. The brand new steel body is produced by a company called Dynacorn, but licensed by Ford, with only a few changes to integrate the modern underpinnings . Stunning: The engine is a remanufactured 1990’s-era 302 V8 supplied by Ford, which was chosen because it’s the same size as the original 289 V8 and fits perfectly in the chassis without requiring modifications . Remember your first time? The car is equipped with electronic fuel injection and the eight-cylinder engine can produce 265 horsepower and 300 foot-to-pounds torque output . Driving off the lot: Selling over a million cars in under three years, the Mustang became one of the most beloved cars made anywhere in the world, with an original base price of $2,368.","Revology Cars unveils classic Ford Mustang replica with modern technology .

"In his autobiography published late last year, Andrew Cuomo described himself as the victim in his bitter divorce from Kerry Kennedy - saying he learned about the break-up from a reporter who called him for comment. But a new biography of the New York governor says he had a larger part in the unraveling of the marriage, which briefly united two political dynasties. Vanity Fair's Michael Shnayerson alleges in 'The Contender' that the couple started talking 'not if but when' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter Michaela in 1997. However, Cuomo dragged out the break-up for years - possibly to use his wife's political clout to fuel his failed 2002 gubernatorial run, the book alleges. Doomed: A new biography of  Andrew Cuomo details the bitter divorce between the current New York Governor and Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F Kennedy. The former couple pictured above on their wedding day in 1990 . The New York Daily News, which previewed the book, cited Shnayerson's sources who said the couple learned they were incompatible fairly early on in their relationship. Shnayerson did not interview Cuomo himself. Shnayerson quotes a Douglas Kennedy - Kerry's 46-year-old younger brother -  who says that while Cuomo treasured the connection to the Kennedy family, he loathed participating in reunions at the family's estate in Hyannis, Massachusetts and eventually stopped going altogether. Douglas Kennedy said on one occasion, when the Kennedys spent a night partying and singing, Cuomo stood by 'looking disgusted'. Douglas also described Cuomo as a 'bully' who thought many member's of his wife's family as weak or 'political'. Not if, but when: Author Michael Shnayerson says in 'The Contender' that Cuomo and Kennedy started talking not if 'but when' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter Michaela in 1997. The couple pictured above with twins Cara Ethel and Mariah Matila, with father Andrew holding baby Michaela . Staying together for the campaign: Kennedy allegedly decided to stay with her husband during his ultimately failed 2002 run for governor. According to the book, the couple agreed to break-up after the campaign, but Cuomo kept putting it off . The Contender, written by Vanity Fair writer Michael Shnayerson, is due out March 31 . Perhaps one of the most painful digs at the Kennedy family was the Manhattan party that acted as the informal launch for Cuomo's 2002 campaign for governor. At the party, the Rolling Stones song 'Sympathy for the Devil' was played at high-volume - a song which deals with the assassinations of both President John F Kennedy and Kerry father's Robert F Kennedy. The Kennedy's who were in the room for the party were aghast, but it's unclear if Cuomo was behind the decision to play the song. Disdain for the in-laws wasn't the only issue between the political couple. Kerry Kennedy and Cuomo harbored ill-feelings about the little things too, the book claims. When she first started dating Cuomo, Kennedy allegedly 'rolled her eyes a bit' when she saw the plastic covers he kept on his furniture. And a friend close to one side of the former couple told Shnayerson that Cuomo wasn't dazzled by his wife's cooking, cleaning or even the 'dowdy' way she dressed. By the time Cuomo started planning his 2002 run for governor, his wife agreed to stay with him through the campaign. But when the campaign failed, Cuomo allegedly asked her to stay together for just a little longer. The breaking point for Kennedy, according to Shnayerson, came when Cuomo confronted her for having an extra-marital affair with polo player Bruce Colley. A 'closer observer' told Shnayerson that Kennedy told Cuomo to mind his own business, break the news to the kids and move out of their home. 'After 13 years of marriage, and truly stressful times, I knew the ties that bound us together had frayed,' Cuomo wrote in his autobiography All Things Possible, published late last year. 'But I had hoped we could work through what I saw was a difficult time, not an end. Obviously, I was in denial.' 'Even though Kerry had told me she wanted a divorce I thought I could fix it, I couldn’t accept it — it only became real when a reporter called and said she filed the papers.' Breaking point: The couple officially divorced in 2005. Cuomo eventually won the New York governorship in 2011 - the same year he started dating celebrity cook Sandra Lee. Above, Cuomo and family after his re-election last November. From left to right: Cara, Michaela, Cuomo, Sandra Lee, and Mariah . Single life: Kerry Kennedy pictured above on March 10 with human rights lawyer Elisa Massimino at an event in New York City . The couple originally said their break-up was amicable, but that didn't last long, according to the book. Soon an attorney for the Cuomos started spreading stories about Kennedy's betrayal. Cuomo did eventually win the New York governorship in 2011 - the same year he started dating celebrity cook Sandra Lee. Kerry Kennedy still lives near her ex-husband in Westchester, New York. Last week on Wednesday, their youngest daughter Michaela was rushed to the hospital when she was found unconscious at her mother's home. The 17-year-old was treated and released from Westchester Medical Center. It's still unclear what caused the medical emergency. Michael Shnayerson's 'The Contender' is due out on March 31. Health scare: The couple's daughter Michaela was hospitalized last week after she was found unconscious at her mother's home. Michaela was treated at the hospital and released. It's still unclear what caused the hospitalization.

"Retired Republican politician Mitt Romney says he passed on a third presidential campaign because 'it just didn't feel right' and will instead allocate his time to business and philanthropic causes, as well as his wife Ann and their 23 grandchildren. 'Somehow, it just didn’t feel like this was the right time for us to step forward,' Romney told Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric during an interview that was released on Thursday. 'I would love to be president. I just concluded I was not the best person to carry forward the Republican torch.' Romney wouldn't endorse one of the many possible GOP presidential candidates in his first interview since he took his name off the 2016 roster but spoke sharply of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Katie Couric Interviews Mitt Romney in San Diego, California, at his son's home. 'I would love to be president. I just concluded I was not the best person to carry forward the Republican torch,' Romney told her . Romney wouldn't endorse one of the many possible GOP presidential candidates in his first interview since he took his name off the 2016 roster but spoke sharply of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton . Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul would all make tremendous presidents, he indicated. Bush, who was widely considered Romney's biggest hurdle toward securing the Republican presidential nomination for a second consecutive time due to their similarity in background and policy positions, Romney described as a 'sound, effective governor.' He will make for 'a very formidable and capable candidate,' said Romney, who met privately with the fellow former governor just before he definitively ended rumors that he was contemplating a 2016 bid. Walker he characterized as 'a man of integrity and character' and said 'he makes a very compelling case to become a nominee.' 'He was one that faced a recall, fought for his agenda; it was supported by the people of Wisconsin,' Romney told Couric. 'I think a guy like that really has stood the test of a very close inspection.' Romney also voiced approval of a possible Rubio candidacy,saying the freshman senator 'has really distinguished himself' on foreign policy. And while he and Paul, whose father Ron competed against the Massachusetts governor for the party's blessing in both 2008 and 2012, don't often see eye to eye, particularly on foreign policy issues, Romney said he understands the draw to the non-traditional Republican lawmaker. 'A lotta young people are very excited about Rand Paul. And of course, there’s a libertarian strain in my party, and he’s connected with a lotta folks who wanna see us take a different course as a party,' Romney said. 'I mean, more power to him as he expresses his views.' Clinton, on the other hand, is in quite 'a mess' over her secret server and will have to defend what he called 'the Hillary Clinton/Barack Obama foreign policy.' 'I mean, it’s always something with the Clintons,' he said, responding to a question about the former secretary of state's email debacle. 'They have rules which they describe before they get into something, and then they decide they don’t have to follow their own rules. And that, I think, is gonna be a real problem for her,' he said. He added, 'She didn’t follow the rules and regulations of the federal government.' The former Massachusetts governor said he passed on a third presidential campaign because 'it just didn't feel right' and would instead allocate his time to business and philanthropic causes, as well as his wife Ann, pictured here during the interview, and their 23 grandchildren . 'Somehow, it just didn’t feel like this was the right time for us to step forward,' Romney told Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric during their interview on Wednesday, which was released Thursday . Romney became the laughing stock of much of the political class in the lead up to the 2012 election when he named Russia as the United States' greatest geopolitical foe but has since been heralded by Republicans as as visionary. In the interview he again scrutinized Clinton for her infamous 'reset' with Russia and the mock button she gave the country's top diplomat Sergei Lavrov in 2009. He also warned that Islamic extremists abroad are unlikely to suffer defeat if the Obama administration continues to refuse to put American troops on the ground. 'I’m afraid you’re gonna have to see more American military involvement in order to keep ISIS from spreading even further,' he said. It would be ideal for most of the ground troops to be provided by regional partners such as 'Turkey or Saudi Arabia or others,' Romney said. 'But I think, as the President of the United States, you have to say that we will defeat ISIS, period. Full stop. And we will do what’s necessary for that to happen.' Reacting to former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod's claims in his memoir that Romney suggested in his election night, congratulatory call to the president that he won reelection because blacks in urban cities voted for him, Romney said a 'misunderstanding' must have occurred. Axelrod claims that Romney told Obama, 'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.' 'I certainly did not,' Romney told Couric. 'I remember going into the room with a few of my staff people, picking up the phone and being as gracious as I could possibly be at a very difficult time, and congratulating the president on winning and congratulating him on having a good campaign and running a good campaign. The former Republican politician acknowledged that he 'may well have said what a good job they did turning people out, because they did.' But 'I don’t even know what happened in Milwaukee, so some of those quotes are obviously a misunderstanding.' 'I had nothing but congratulations for the president and positive feelings that I expressed to him,' he posited.","'I would love to be president. I just concluded I was not the best person to carry forward the Republican torch,' Romney said .
It was his first interview since he took his name off the 2016 roster .
Romney wouldn't endorse one of the many possible GOP presidential candidates but spoke highly of Scott Walker, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio .
Hillary, on the other hand, is in 'a mess' over her secret server and will have to defend 'the Hillary Clinton/Barack Obama foreign policy'
'I mean, it’s always something with the Clintons. They have rules which they describe...then they decide they don’t have to follow their own rules'
Romney said it's 'certainly' not true that in his election night, congratulatory call to POTUS he suggested he won because of blacks ."
"One woman whose family was scammed out of $25,000 by a dodgy 'doctor' promising to help stall the onset of her motor neuron disease may finally get her shot at battling the debilitating condition. Jaime Wild, from Queensland's Gold Coast was diagnosed with the devastating illness on October 1 last year, and straight away her family kicked into action, looking for ways to fight the cruel disease. After her mother Kate was scammed out of almost $25,000 paid to a dodgy Canadian doctor to visit his clinic in India, Jaime's family needed money to send her to Israel for a procedure which isn't available in Australia. Jamie Wild (centre with her parents, including mother Kate on the left) from Queensland's Gold Coast, was diagnosed with motor neuron disease last year . Her mother Kate was scammed out of almost $25,000 after a dodgy Canadian doctor asked them to visit his clinic in India . The mother-of-three, 36, said the MND was initially misdiagnosed as other ailments, but thing started to take a more serious turn when her speech began to slur. 'First I thought I had depression because I was a bit moody and I got upset quite easily,' Jaime told Daily Mail Australia. 'I went on anti-depressants and then my breathing started to play up and we thought it was anxiety, so we just upped the medication a little bit more. 'That’s when the slurring started and they said something’s not right,' she added. Jaime's family needed money to send her to Israel for a procedure which is not available in Australia. She is pictured here with husband Chris (second right) and their children Brendan (far right), Dylan (far left) and Abby (second left) The mother-of-three (pictured here with mother Kate), 36, said the MND was initially misdiagnosed as other ailments, but thing started to take a more serious turn when her speech began to slur . To raise funds for this treatment and Ms Wild's (pictured left and right with her husband Chris), ongoing medical costs, her friends and family threw her a 'Cinderella Ball To Remember' at the weekend . The ball was a great success and between that and boxing fight organised by a kind stranger called Chris more than $26,000 has been raised . When doctors told her she had MND, Jaime said she had not prepared herself for the fact that there was nothing she could do to treat the crippling disease. 'At first I thought okay, all right, so what do we need to do... (The doctor) said there is no treatment and there is no cure. 'That was like your whole world crumbling,' Jaime revealed. The Gold Coast mother described her debilitating symptoms in great detail, and revealed her dexterity has declined in recent months despite her still being quite mobile. 'My eating is quite hard, it takes a lot of energy for me to chew, I try and go for the softer foods,' Jaime said. Jamie revealed her dexterity has declined in recent months despite her still being quite mobile and her brother has become her carer . 'My breathing is quite severe, I don’t do big long breaths, just short ones. 'My tongue is quiet weak so for me to form words especially when I get tired they don’t come out too well,' she continued. Motor neuron disease (MND) is the name given to a group of diseases in which the nerve cells (neurons) controlling the muscles that enable us to move, speak, breathe and swallow undergo degeneration and die. Motor function is controlled by the upper motor neurons in the brain that descend to the spinal cord; these neurons activate lower motor neurons. The lower motor neurons exit the spinal cord and directly activate muscles. With no nerves to activate them, muscles gradually weaken and waste. MND can affect a person’s ability to walk, speak, swallow and breathe. 'My right hand is really bad so I can’t undo buttons or press buttons. '(And) both my legs are pretty bad,' Jaime revealed. Desperate to help her daughter, mum Kate Millar sprung into action, spending all hours of the day researching potential treatments and clinics. Stem cell treatment is one of the most common ways to treat motor neuron diseases among sufferers, however is not available in Australia due to inconclusive medical studies. Kate came across a doctor called Doug Broeska, owner of Regenetek Research, offering clinical trials in stem cell treatment out of a clinic in India. However since then Mr Broeska's medical qualifications have come under scrutiny by CBC and other news organisations, with some reporting that his medical degree is fake. 'When Jamie was first diagnosed of course I went Googling and searching for anything that I could come up with,' Kate told Daily Mail Australia. Here Jamie (third from left in front row) is pictured with her extended family . Jaime (second left) now has a trip to Israel lined up which she leaves for in under two weeks, where she will undergo the first part of stem cell treatment to try and stall the onset of the MND . She said the doctor came highly recommended from another patient who had suffered from MS, and Kate and her family were in frequent contact with Mr Broeska before he went underground with their money. 'We transferred the first lot which was $24,000 Australian dollars, two days later that’s when it all came out in the media questioning,' Kate said. She also revealed that since further revelations against the 'doctor', were aired, the Canadian Police have been involved to try and recover her money. After the first treatment option fell through, Jaime's family wanted to get moving to get her some more help as soon as they can. Jaime now has a trip to Israel lined up which she leaves for in under two weeks, where she will undergo the first part of stem cell treatment to try and stall the onset of the MND. To raise funds for this treatment and her ongoing medical costs, her friends and family threw her a 'Cinderella Ball To Remember' at the weekend. Jamie and her husband, Chris, on their wedding day. The couple have three children together . Organised primarily by her brother Geoffrey, 30, who is also her full-time carer Jaime was almost lost for words as she described the evening. 'It was amazing, all of it was just so surreal, I just sat there at the front just taking in every moment of the night,' she said. Decked out in a stunning white dress and arriving at the venue in a carriage, Jaime described the moment she arrived at the ball to a red carpet awaiting her as 'incredible'. 'When Jamie was first diagnosed, Jamie was in the closet one day crying and I was sitting on her bed and I thought what does every girl want to be, and I thought to be a princess,' Geoffrey revealed. 'So we came up with the idea of the ball.' The ball was a great success and between that and boxing fight organised by a kind stranger called Chris more than $26,000 has been raised, but to sustain the high level of treatment Jaime needs the family needs more. 'Jamie can’t get any support from the government because her husband and her do own a small business,' Geoffrey said. 'They’ve gone from having three kids and two incomes to one income and still three kids plus Jamie’s medical expenses.' 'We literally take it five minutes at a time, I could come around here in the morning and Jamie;’s having a bad day,' Geoffrey continued. 'Her life is just beginning, her and her husband have always been hard workers . 'She’s done everything right she doesn’t smoke, she doesn’t drink . 'It is unfair but me as Jamie’s brother I believe that if Jamie was supposed to be taken away from us she would have been.' he added.
