And 25-year-old Whitney Quinton's family were in an equal state of shock, as a heartwarming new video shows. The mother-to-be from Alberta, Calgary, filmed the moment she and her husband Brett told their relatives the happy news over Christmas.

Tears of joy: In the video's opening scene, a man is seen opening a small envelope and pulling out a message reading: 'Baby Quinton coming August 2015' Parents to be: The Quintons battled infertility for four years but finally, last November, a pregnancy test came back positive . As the words sink in, he suddenly tears up before going over to hug Mrs Quinton. Other people in the room mimic his actions, with one woman excitedly exclaiming: 'Are you serious?' In the following scene, 29-year-old Mr Quinton tells his brother via Skype that he's going to be an uncle. His mother is also in the room while the interaction takes place and she can barely contain her excitement over the fact she's going to be a grandmother for the first time. She puts her hand over her mouth before breaking down in tears. Mrs Quinton reveals via her blog, brettandwhitneyquinton.blogspot.ca, that her fertility problems were linked to childhood illness.

While she was worried the invasive operation would impact on her life, Mrs Quinton went on to forge a successful career as a dental assistant and marry the 'man of her dreams'. It was only when she started trying to conceive she discovered there was a problem.

Demetria Harris is calling for immediate action after a photo showing her badly beaten son with a leash around his neck taken at a Georgia correctional facility appeared on Facebook . 'I was like oh my God! What happened? How'd it happen? It's a terrifying picture to see,' Berry's mother, Demetria Harris, told WRDW. Berry was visited by his aunt on Saturday and he told her that he had been jumped by ten people who beat him and 'choked him to sleep.' 'Pretty much they left him there for dead,' said Shavondria Wright. The incident happened at 3:15 p.m. but he was left unchecked by the guards until 9:45 p.m. that night, she said. 'No one deserves this,' said Harris. 'They're not being protected. I don't care what they're there for, they still need to be protected.' The attack also appears to be gang related. The caption of the photo posted on Facebook reads: 'When you disrespect the Nation, it brings nothing but pain and suffering.' That is understood to be a reference to the gang, G.D. Nation, short for 'gangsta disciples.' Video courtesy of CBS46.com . Berry told visiters on Saturday that he had been jumped by ten people who beat him and 'choked him to sleep' The Department of Corrections is carrying out an investigation into the incident and has the area of the center where the photo was taken under lockdown. Inmates are not supposed to have access to cellphones. Berry is serving an 8 1/2-year sentence for aggravated battery, robbery and theft of a motorvehicle. He was transfered to the medium security detention center last year after violating his probation. His family say they want an assurance from the department that he will be able to pay his debt to society, without being killed. 'We could've lost him. He could've been dead. Especially when they hung the belt around his neck. He could've just been gone,' said Wright.

"Two senior Secret Service agents who crashed their government car outside the White House actually disrupted an active bomb investigation, according to a shocking new report. The agents, who are suspected of being drunk at the time, may have even driven over the suspicious package as they careened through police crime scene tape and smashed into a temporary barrier outside the President's home, the Washington Post reports. About 10.30pm on March 4, a woman got out of her car at the south entrance of the White House and threw a package on the ground. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama Obama is pictured with Mark Connolly in 2011, the second-in-command of his security detail. Connolly is accused of being one of the agents who crashed into a bomb investigation outside the White House on March 4 . Connolly, pictured with the president during a trip to Dublin, Ireland, has been placed on leave, pending the investigation . She told guards 'It's a bomb!' before speeding away in her car. The uniformed Secret Service officers cordoned off the area in crime scene tape and called the bomb squad. About 30 minutes later, Mark Connolly, the second-in-command for President Barack Obama’s security detail, and George Ogilvie, a senior supervisor at the agency's field office in Washington, smashed through the crime scene. It's not clear which agent was driving. Their government car broke the crime scene tape and crashed into barrels that made a temporary barrier, according to a Secret Service police report. According to the Post, the two men were returning from a Secret Service party in the nearby Chinatown neighborhood. Investigators told the newspaper that the two men either drive very close to or smashed over top of the suspicious package. Police reports reveal that officers suspected the two men were drunk and wanted to arrest them and give them breath tests. The crash happened at the south entrance to the White House on 15th Street, where uniformed Secret Service officers were investigating a suspicious package (stock image) The Secret Service, which has been plagued by scandals in recent years, is working to clean up its image - through the latest incident surely won't help . However, a supervisor told them to let the men go on their way and return home. About 45 minutes later, explosives experts arrived and determined that the package did not pose a threat. Officers recorded the license plate number of the woman who dropped the package and later questioned her about the threat. The incident is just the latest embarrassment for the Secret Service, which has been plagued by a slew of security lapses and misconduct by agents in recent years. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in October following the revelation that a man with a knife had made it all the way into the White House after jumping the fence - along with several other incidents that came to light. Pierson herself was brought in to clean up the agency after the resignation of her predecessor Mark Sullivan, who was forced out when it was revealed that 11 agents had hired prostitutes and threw wild parties in Cartagena, Colombia, in April 2012 ahead of Obama's visit there. Obama learned about the incident earlier in the week, before word broke publicly through the news media.On Thursday, the White House said the President still has full confidence in his newest Secret Service Director, Joseph Clancy - despite the newest debacle. White House spokesman Eric Schultz says Obama was disappointed to learn about the incident. But he says nobody has higher standards for the Secret Service than Clancy. Schultz says Clancy will continue making reforms to address the problems in the agency.","A woman had just dropped a package and shouted 'It's a bomb!' outside White House when two agents crashed through the crime scene .

"A prominent Muslim leader has lashed out at the Jewish community, calling them 'the most evil creatures of Allah'. The spokesman for Islamic extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, Ismail al-Wahwah, delivered the rant in an online video posted on March 3. He went on further to say recognising the Jewish people and giving them 'even a single inch of Palestine' would be the 'epitome of evil' as it would 'strengthen that cancerous entity'. The spokesman for Islamic extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, Ismail al-Wahwah, delivered the rant in an online video posted on March 3 . 'The Jews are the most evil creatures of Allah. Moral corruption is linked to the Jews,' Mr al-Wahwah said. 'They will pay with blood for blood, with tears for tears, and with destruction for destruction.' The surfacing of this video follows the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies (JBOD) filing a complaint with the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board against the extremist group. It was in relation to comments made last year at a rally in Lakemba, where Mr al-Wahwah said Jewish people all around the world were corrupt and they were a 'hidden evil', The Australian Jewish News reported. JBOD president Jeremy Spinak called on the Anti-Discrimination Board to write a brief up for the public prosecutions department so it could bring charges against Mr al-Wahwah and his fellow spokesman Wassim Doureihi. 'The speech incited hatred towards, serious contempt for, and severe ridicule of, Jews on the ground of them being Jewish,' Mr Spinak wrote. NSW JBOD chief executive Vic Alhadeff said he also feared speeches like al-Wahwah would lead to more local terror attacks . 'The speech incited hatred towards, serious contempt for, and severe ridicule of, Jews on the ground of them being Jewish.' NSW Communities Minister Victor Dominello has also written to the Anti-Discrimination Board to alert them to al-Wahwah's latest video, The Australian reported. Mr Dominello said despite the fact Australians enjoy freedom of speech, it should not be abused in this way. He labelled the video as 'deeply disturbing' as well as 'hateful and derisive'. '[It] has no place in our harmonious multicultural society,' Mr Dominello told News Corp. NSW JBOD chief executive Vic Alhadeff said he also feared speeches like al-Wahwah would lead to more local terror attacks. The surfacing of this video follows the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies (JBOD) filing a complaint with the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board against the extremist group . A Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman said comments made on behalf of the group had to be assessed on the 'the context of an ongoing and bloody occupation of Palestine', referring to the Gaza conflict (above) 'This has nothing to do with Israel and is in the same vein of Islamic extremism and incitement that IS [Islamic State] peddles,' Mr Alhadeff said. 'It's another wake-up call for the authorities to act before these hate preachers inspire the next [Sydney Siege gunman] Man Monis.' Hizb ut-Tahrir jumped to the defence of Mr al-Wahwah, saying his comments made last year were made during the 'most recent offensive against the people of Gaza', which 'indiscriminately razed homes, schools, hospitals and mosques'. The group's Tuesday statement also said the JBOD was 'falsely exploiting the words of Hizb ut-Tahrir'. Hamzah Qureshi, a Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman, told News Corp on Wednesday comments made on behalf of the group had to be assessed on the 'the context of an ongoing and bloody occupation of Palestine by the illegitimate Israeli army'.","Ismail al-Wahwah delivered the rant in an online video posted on March 3 .

"Whether taking in a spectacular panorama, visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert; the chances are your view has been ruined by  a selfie stick on at least one occasion. Now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse, because there’s a next-generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone. The contraption lets selfie addicts take photos  of themselves using their iPad, ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots. The selfie stick for tablets (pictured) allows people to take photos and films of themselves using their iPad – if their smartphone screen isn’t large enough . The supersized stick is available on the website Accessory Geeks for just $23 (£16), suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon. The set comes with an attachment head for the tablet, a reinforced selfie stick and a remote control. Users can deploy it to see themselves in more detail as they are taking a snap, or to make it easier to include themselves in large groups pictures. The head comprises an adjustable rubber clamp that the company  claims can hold all sizes of tablets and smartphones securely. ‘The durable selfie stick is built strong, so your tablet or phone will be safe and secured in the air when you are taking a selfie,’ the website says. The head comprises an adjustable rubber clamp that the company selling it claims can hold all sizes of tablets and smartphones securely (pictured) For $23 (£16), budding photographers get an attachment head for their tablet, a selfie stick and a remote control. As well as taking close-ups, users could make use of the stick to include impressive views or large groups of people in their shots (some examples are shown above) On the end of a strap is a standard quarter-inch (0.5cm) mount into which the stick itself can be attached. It extends up to 3ft (1m) to 'give your device the best photo taking coverage.' However, the tablet may appear heavier when it's held away from the body and could be difficult to keep still, so not to take blurry photos. The company says of its bundle: 'No matter where you may be, you are sure to get everyone and neighbouring surroundings in the picture'. In order to help users hold the stick still, there's a Bluetooth remote control that comes with the bundle to make taking pictures slightly easier, without the need of setting timers. It’s compatible with iPhone and Android handsets. Customers can also buy the strap on its own for $10 (£7), but run the risk of using it with an insufficiently strengthened stick, which could end in an expensive accident. Selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them. This week organisers of two major US festivals have made clear what they think of selfie sticks. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds. While the latter has named 'GoPro attachments like sticks, selfie sticks & monopods' on its list of prohibited items, Coachella has banned festivalgoers from bringing 'Selfie sticks/Narsisstics (sic)'. Banned: The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza, in Illinois and California, are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban selfie sticks on their grounds (file picture) However, it remains unclear how organizers intend to identify and weed out 'narsisstics' at the gates of the festival, which begins in Indio, California on April 10 - more than three months before Lollapalooza. And selfie sticks are not the only unusual items to be banned at the two festivals. Coachella also prohibits blankets, chairs, flags, hula hoops, marker pens, stuffed animals and umbrellas on its list . The ban, first reported by Brooklyn Vegan , will prevent selfie sticks from obstructing festivalgoers' views of the stage - and could limit the illegal recording of performances, according to Rolling Stone . Bizarre: And the gadgets are not the only unusual items to be banned at the two festivals. Coachella also prohibits blankets, chairs, flags, hula hoops, markers, stuffed animals and umbrellas on its list (left and right) It will likely mean attendees will have to resort to the old-fashioned method of using their arms to take selfies. Selfie sticks, which allow users to position their smartphone or camera beyond the normal range of their arm, have already been banned from an array of venues and historical sites across the world. According to NME , London's O2 Arena and Wembley Arena have prohibited them, while CBC reports that France's Palace of Versailles and Rome's Colosseum also do not permit the use of the gadgets.","Selfie-stick for tablets has a strong rubber band to hold a tablet in place .

"These are the adorable images of a set of polar bear cubs seeing the world for the first time. Despite temperatures reaching -50C, the excitable cubs played in the snow - even during a blizzard - rolling around and climbing on top of their mother. Photographer Andy Skillen tracked down the family at Wapusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada, and followed the family for two days. Welcome to the world: A mother Polar bear introduces her two newborn cubs to the joys of playing in the snow . Tumble: It takes time to learn to keep your balance! Wildlife photographer Andy Skillen spent two days following the bears at Wapusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada . Drowsy: According to Mr Skillen, the polar bears had recently resurfaced after spending the winter in hibernation . The area is famous for its polar bear dens, and Mr Slkillen managed to capture a set of heart-warming scenes. In the region, most polar bears build their dens around November and come out of hibernation in February. The photographer said that most bears in the park, hungry after months of being in their dens, are anxious to get hunting seals before the spring thaw. Having excitable young bears in tow, though, makes things a little trickier. He said: 'It's a fascinating scene to watch unfold. 'Polar bears live in a world of extremes, and yet despite their fearsome reputation show a remarkably touching side. 'They are programmed to survive like no other animal on earth, and the sheer enormity of the tasks these mothers have to take on every couple of years is beyond belief. 'I have the utmost respect for all animals that can make a living in the Arctic, and bears top the lot.' Content: The family of bears was spotted in the Waspusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada . Bliss: The two young cubs, pictured, frolicked in the snow for several hours in temperatures of -50c .

Protective: As soon as the young cubs take a few steps away their mother, she looks on intently . Cosy: The two young cubs use their mother as a form of protection from the worst of the elements . Safe: The cubs enjoyed their first taste of freedom but they never went too far from their protective mother .

One of Dane's best friends, who has been friends with him since the age of 12, is so desperate to find him that he has offered a $25,000 reward from his own pocket for any information. Dane hasn't touched his phone, bank account or social media accounts since he went missing . For three months his friends have campaigned tirelessly, imploring everybody to spread the message about Dane's strange and distressing disappearance . Brittany Taylor, the partner of Dane's best friend Anthony Hudson, told Daily Mail Australia that the missing man's family and friends were beside themselves with worry. 'No one has heard a word. There's been nothing since then (December 12); his phone hasn't been touched, his bank account hasn't been touched, social media – nothing,' Ms Taylor said. 'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's birthday, some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character. It's not unusual for him to travel, but it is unusual for him not to check in.

"More than 1,000 years ago this pre-Inca baby was laid to rest  on a barren Peruvian hillside. It was among dozens of well-preserved mummified skeletons found by archaeologists on the outskirts of the capital city of Lima. The discovery was made by experts who were hired by the Government to search the hillside for any remains prior to the building of a new road. This pre-Inca baby was found on a barren Peruvian hillside by archaeologist combing the site before a new road is constructed . The newfound site is on the northwestern edge the largest Inca cemetery ever excavated, Puruchuco-Huaquerones. In the last 60 years researchers have examined just 10 per cent of the historic site. So far they have uncovered 2,000 mummies, ceramics and hundreds of pieces of textile, silver, copper and gold. Three days into the project the archaeologist came across the cemetery, according to National Geographic News. 'By now we have over 40 [mummy bundles] and the number increases every day.' Guillermo Cock, a Lima-based archaeologist, reportedly told the website. 'Given the proximity to the city and the tradition of looting in the area, we are really surprised that this is mostly undisturbed, mostly intact, mostly unlooted. 'Only a few bundles have suffered damage by human action.' In total the team located around 26 tombs, containing both children and adults. The latest discovery was made close to Puruchuco-Huaquerones - the largest Inca cemetery ever excavated. In the last 60 years researchers have examined just 10 per cent of the historic site. So far they have uncovered 2,000 mummies, ceramics and hundreds of pieces of textile, silver, copper and gold. The mummified skeleton has been preserved for more than 1,000 years outside Peru's capital of Lima .

"A random attack by a drunk stranger has completely changed the life of 53-year-old Jose Gonzalez, leaving him in constant pain and with little prospect of ever working again. The paving worker from Homestead, Florida was napping in his work car nearly two years ago, waiting for two co-workers to finish drinking at a bar in Marathon when a drunk patron came outside and set the propane tanks in the back of the truck on fire. Surveillance footage shows the moment then 26-year-old Stuart Collins pulled out a Bic lighter and sparked the flame that then engulfed the truck in flames. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: Scroll down for video . Life changed completely: Jose Gonzalez of Homestead, Florida received third-degree burns to 68 per cent of his body in a July 2013 attack by a stranger . Spark: The 53-year-old was sleeping in his work truck, waiting for two coworkers to finish up drinking at a Marathon, Florida bar when a drunk man came out and set propane tanks in the back of the vehicle on fire . Engulfed in flames: The married father-of-one woke up to flames eating away at his clothes, and was on fire for an excruciating 11 minutes . Suspect: Stuart Collins, now 29, was arrested for setting the car on fire. He is being held on $1.05 million bond for charges of attempted second-degree murder, second-degree arson and criminal mischief . Gonzalez says he woke up to his clothes on fire, but was lucky enough to escape the truck by himself before help arrived. However, the flames had spread too fast and he suffered covered in fire for 11 minutes - leaving him with third-degree burns on 68 per cent of his body. Gonzalez spent the following six months after the July 12, 2013 attack in the hospital, going in and out of a coma while he underwent some 15 surgeries. 'It changed everything. I am a useless man on a bed,' Gonzalez said in Spanish to CBS Miami. 'Why did he do this? We don't know each other. He did this for no reason,' Gonzalez said of Collins. 'It seems like he just became enraged and lit the truck on fire and unfortunately I was inside sleeping and he set me on fire. It changed my life forever.' Now he's speaking out as he plans to file a lawsuit against the owners of J.J.'s Doghouse, the bar that continued to serve Collins. 'If there would have been security, this could have been avoided and I wouldn't be burnt,' Gonzalez told Local 10. The Gonzalez family's lawyer Jason Brenner cited surveillance footage which shows Collins entering the bar that night, claiming the video proves the young man was clearly intoxicated. Lawsuit: The Gonzalez family plans to sue the bar that continued to serve Collins. Collins seen above in a white shirt, stumbling around, in surveillance footage from just before the explosion . Fault: Gonzalez says if J.J.'s Doghouse had security protocols in place, they might have prevented Collins from causing harm . Charred: Above, a photo released by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office shows the charred remains of Gonzalez's work truck . 'This was a very small bar in terms of space, and where this incident took place, it was but three feet from the back door, and this was an area where people always hung out,' Brenner told WSVN. 'When you see in the video, when this man got out of the cab, he was extremely intoxicated and identified by the bartender. He had erratic and aggressive behavior throughout the evening.' Collins told police he only had two rum and Cokes and three beers in a six-hour span that night. The now 29-year-old was arrested after the incident and is being held on $1.05 million bond at the Monroe County Jail on charges of attempted second-degree murder, second-degree arson and criminal mischief. He has plead not guilty to the charges ahead of his trial, which is expected to start in June. Painful: Following the attack, Gonzalez spend six months in the hospital and underwent 15 surgeries . Never the same: His mobility is now limited and it's unlikely that he will ever work again. That causes a serious hardship on his family since his wife also lost her job as a vice principal . Forever dependent: Gonzalez is now relies on his wife and teenage son to take care of him . Happier times: Above, Gonzalez pictured before the attacks. Alone on the left, and with his wife of 21 years on the right . Meanwhile, Gonzalez is in his own form of prison due to to the injuries which have left him completely dependent on his wife and teenage son, and will likely never work again. That has put a serious strain on the family, since his wife also lost her job as a vice principal. 'It's gone from me being able to do pretty much whatever I want with my dad to not being able to do very much at all,' his son Jose Gonzalez Jr said. 'In fact, I have to do most things for him along with my mother.' In addition to the planned lawsuit against J.J.'s Doghouse, the Gonzalez family settled another lawsuit against the property's owner but the terms were kept confidential.","Jose Gonzalez, 53, was sleeping in his work truck, waiting for two colleagues to finish drinking when the attack happened .

However, Google boss Eric Schmidt has confirmed that in fact the project is still going strong - and remains  'a big and very fundamental platform for Google'. Schmidt told The Wall Street Journal that it has been put under the control of Tony Fadell 'to make it ready for users.' Scroll down for video . Google boss Eric Schmidt has confirmed that in fact the project is still going strong - and remains 'a big and very fundamental platform for Google'. Google dubbed the first set of several thousand Glass users . as 'Explorers.' But, as the Explorers hit the streets, they drew . stares and jokes. Some people viewed the device, capable of . surreptitious video recording, as an obnoxious privacy . intrusion, deriding the once-proud Explorers as 'Glassholes.' 'It looks super nerdy,' said Shevetank Shah, a Washington, . DC-based consultant, whose Google Glass now gathers dust in a . drawer. 'I'm a card carrying nerd, but this was one card too . many.' Google stopped selling the first version of Glass and shut its Explorer program in January, moving the project out of its Google X research lab into a standalone unit. Ivy Ross remained head of the Glass team but Tony Fadell, head of Google's Nest connected home division, now oversees strategy for the project. Cources claim Fadell wants to redesign the headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until 'it's perfect'. 'It is a big and very fundamental platform for Google,' Schmidt told the WSJ. 'We ended the Explorer program and the press conflated this into us canceling the whole project, which isn't true. 'Google is about taking risks and there's nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we're ending it.' He said Glass, like Google's self-driving car, is a long-term project. 'That's like saying the self-driving car is a disappointment because it's not driving me around now,' he said. 'These things take time.' Sources claim Glass' new boss Tony Fadell (pictured) wants to redesign the Google headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until it's complete. One unnamed source told the New York Times that Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect' The firm brought in Tony Fadell from Nest - a home automation company Google bought in 2014 - to lead the team, replacing previous boss Ivy Ross. Ms Ross still works on the project and runs 'day-to-day' operations. In a statement in January, Mr Fadell said: 'Early Glass efforts have broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike. 'I'm excited to be working with Ivy to provide direction and support as she leads the team and we work together to integrate those learnings into future products.' An unnamed source added Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect.' The previous Google Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme. This programme gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (£990), and was launched in the US in 2013, and the UK last summer. Google announced it was killing off the current version of its Glass headset (pictured) last month. It didn't abandon the project entirely, though, and promised to develop smart glasses under a different guise . Google Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme. This programme gave developers the chance to buy Glass (pictured) for $1,500 (£990), and launched in the US in 2013 . The firm had already been thought to be developing a new version, with chips made by Intel, to go on sale later this year. Aside from saying it was committed to working on the future of the product, Google gave no timescale for the launch of an improved product. 'It's hard to believe Glass started as little more than a scuba mask attached to a laptop,' the Glass team said in a post on Google+ last month. 'We kept on it, and when it started to come together, we began the Glass Explorer Program as a kind of 'open beta' to hear what people had to say.' 'Glass was in its infancy, and you took those very first steps and taught us how to walk. 'Well, we still have some work to do, but now we're ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run.' Google boss Sergey Brin (pictured) was spotted without the high-tech specs at a Silicon Valley red-carpet event last year. Since the headset was unveiled in 2013, the 41-year-old was rarely seen without them.

"Tributes are pouring in for former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser, the giant of Australian politics who died aged 84 on Friday morning. His office issued a statement confirming the news 'with deep sadness', saying he had suffered only a 'brief illness'. 'We appreciate that this will be a shock to all who knew and loved him, but ask that the family be left in peace at this difficult time,' it said. Mr Fraser was prime minister from November 1975 until March 1983. He controversially came to power as caretaker prime minister following the dismissal of Labor leader Gough Whitlam by Governor-General Sir John Kerr. Mr Fraser's party had blocked the supply of money for the government in the Senate, forcing the constitutional crisis. Gough Whitlam would dub Fraser 'Kerr's cur', although, perhaps in a sign of Mr Fraser's compassion, the two would have a rapprochement later in life. Under his leadership, the Coalition then won the largest landslide of any political party at the 1975 federal election. Prime Minister Tony Abbott today hailed Mr Fraser's service, acknowledging him and Mr Whitlam as 'fierce Australian patriots'. 'Malcolm Fraser held true to the belief that his actions were in the best interests of Australia... He was rightly proud of his government.' Scroll down for video . Malcolm Fraser was prime minister from November 1975 until March 1983. He was elected to federal Parliament when he was just 25 . In a statement, Malcolm Fraser's office said:' It is with deep sadness that we inform you that after a brief illness John Malcolm Fraser died peacefully in the early hours of the morning of 20 March 2015' You can call me (caretaker) Prime Minister: Malcolm Fraser strides down the steps of Old Parliament House, on the day Gough Whitlam was dismissed . Divisive: The method in which Malcolm Fraser rose to power did not endear him to much of the population during the politically turbulent period of the 1970s . Fraser's government won the largest majority of any party at any federal election in 1975 . In office, Mr Fraser championed a multicultural Australia, delivered self-government to the Northern Territory and established SBS and the Australian Federal Police. He was determined in confronting the 'evil' of apartheid in South Africa and began to develop economic reforms that would change the country. Following his defeat by Labor's Bob Hawke in 1983, Mr Fraser became known as an outspoken advocate of asylum seekers. He became critical of the Liberal Party - later resigning his membership - and his opinions, often broadcast on Twitter in his later years, tended to run against the grain of the modern party. Treasurer Joe Hockey told reporters: 'He supplied stability and re-assurance at a time where Australia had experienced much upheaval. 'I think history will be kinder to Malcolm Fraser than many of his critics have over the years. 'It is with deep sadness that we inform you that after a brief illness John Malcolm Fraser died peacefully in the early hours of the morning of 20 March 2015. 'We appreciate that this will be a shock to all who knew and loved him, but ask that the family be left in peace at this difficult time'. Mr Fraser's party had blocked the supply of money for the government in the Senate, forcing the 1975 constitutional crisis . 'The night Malcolm Fraser lost his trousers': The former prime minister's most embarrassing moment came about in 1986, when he was found confused and dressed only in a towel at Memphis hotel frequented by prostitutes and drug dealers . Malcolm Fraser's former treasurer and eventual successor, John Howard, praised his 'dominance' of the Liberal Party . Former leaders: Australia's seven surviving prime ministers past and present posed for a photograph at Gough Whitlam's memorial service last year. Now Malcolm Fraser is no longer among their number. From left to right: Mr Fraser, Julia Gillard, Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott, John Howard, Kevin Rudd and Paul Keating . Beloved: Malcolm Fraser is pictured here earlier this year with his wife Tamie Fraser. The pair had four children . Following his defeat by Labor's Bob Hawke in 1983, Mr Fraser continued to be an outspoken advocate of asylum seekers . Former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd honoured Mr Fraser as a Liberal leader in the tradition of Alfred Deakin, the country's second leader. 'All Australians will recall Mr Fraser’s role in the controversy surrounding the dismissal in 1975,' he added. 'This cannot be erased from history. 'Prime Minister Fraser will be remembered as a compassionate Australian, who cared for people at home or abroad, who had little or nothing to protect them. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: 'Mr Fraser a politician of principle and leader of compassion. A true gentleman with a heart full of empathy. I am devastated.' The Australian flag is flying at half-mast at Parliament House. He is survived by his wife, Tamie, and their four children. Malcolm Fraser was first elected to federal Parliament for his seat of Wannon when he was just 25 . Our country has lost its 22nd Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser. As our nation’s leader between 1975 and 1983, he restored economically responsible government while recognising social change. In a long and active retirement, he maintained a keen interest in our country’s direction. The constitutional crisis of 1975 was one of the defining political events of our nation. Malcolm Fraser held true to the belief that his actions were in the best interests of Australia. He was determined to ‘turn on the lights’ and restore Australia’s economic fortunes. The greatest win in Australian political history confirms that he had correctly read the mood of the public. The friendship he built in later life with Gough Whitlam spoke volumes about the character of both men at the centre of the crisis: in their own different ways, they were both fierce Australian patriots. Under Malcolm Fraser’s leadership, self-government was conferred on the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth Ombudsman was established and our first Freedom of Information laws were enacted. Following the Hilton bombing, he established the Australian Federal Police. Later, he introduced legislation to establish a crimes commission following the Costigan Royal Commission. He commissioned the Campbell Report of 1981 which laid the foundations for eventual deregulation of the financial system. Under Malcolm Fraser’s leadership, Australia was an unwavering opponent of apartheid and after he left office, Malcolm Fraser continued to work for the end of apartheid. His subsequent appointment to roles with the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations reflected his high international standing. He had a deep interest in the advancement of indigenous people. He banned sand mining on Fraser Island. As well, the first Australian sites were placed on the World Heritage List and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was declared. He welcomed the re-settlement of tens of thousands of Vietnamese people in Australia who have subsequently added a rich, new dimension to our national life. He was rightly proud of his government. As he said when he conceded defeat: Australia is handed over… in as good a condition or better condition than any other Western country in the world.","Former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser died 'peacefully' aged 84 on Friday morning .

"Cuts of 20 per cent to the police budget by the Conservatives will leave the public unprotected against crime and terror, a retiring senior officer has warned. Sir Hugh Orde, the retiring president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), claims the 'tipping point' between cutting resources and staff and increasing the risk to the public is close. Since 2011 the Home Office reduced the amount spent on police by 20 per cent  and the Home Secretary Theresa May has said there will be further cuts if the Tories win the forthcoming election. Sir Hugh Orde, the retiring president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, warns that cuts to the police budget of 20 per cent, proposed by the Tories, will leave the public unprotected against crime and terror . One way some forces are reportedly going to try to operate on smaller budgets is by reducing the number of officers. Sir Hugh, who is due to stand down ahead of the creation of the National Police Chiefs' Council, told the Observer that taking police off the streets is a clear risk in the fight against extremism. He said: 'The critical element, it seems to me, with dealing with people who will start to behave differently in their communities is the confidence in that community to speak to the local cops. 'If the cops aren't there and that relationship has not been built we won't get the intelligence.' Asked directly whether police would have adequate resources to protect the public in the context of cuts, he said: 'In my professional judgement, the answer is no.' He added that cuts to other public services had put an increased pressure on the police, with officers having to fill in for ambulance crews and  those let down by depleted mental health care. Sir Hugh, who left Acpo two weeks ago, said while it is accepted police cannot be exempt from cuts, he questioned how much more the forces can take. He added that 44 police forces is too many and collaboration is important and cited the work of Sir Stephen House, chief constable in Scotland, who has brought together eight forces, where crime is at an all-time low. Yvette Cooper MP, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, said cuts would take spending back to 1930s levels and would sign the end of neighbourhood policing . Labour has claimed another 30,000 police officers could be lost if the Conservatives are returned to power in May. Almost 7,000 police community support officers could also be cut by 2020, Labour said,  after commissioning figures from the House of Commons Library based on trends during the current Parliament. Yvette Cooper MP, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, said:  'Conservative plans to cut spending back to 1930s levels would mean the end of neighbourhood policing. 'These figure show that under these extreme and risky Tory plans a further 30,000 police officers could be lost - the equivalent of almost the entire Metropolitan police force. 'This is on top of the 17,000 cut since 2010 and would mean police numbers falling by a third after ten years of the Tories. And it would mean we would have fewer than 100,000 police officers. 'More serious and violent crimes including child abuse, rape and domestic violence are being reported, the terror threat has grown, and there has been a massive increase in online crime.' Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said his force had lost about 15 per cent of its grant, £600 million, in 12 months. It had managed to maintain police numbers by making savings in the back office - they had lost 3,500 staff and buildings had been sold. He told LBC: 'We have maintained the front line, so we are proud of that. Over the next few years, it is going to get very hard.' He said he feared that after the next government gets in, the force will lose another 15 per cent, a total of a third, or £1.4 billion. 'When we have to find that amount, numbers will drop,' he said. 'We will have less police, we will have to manage it. 'We have still got to invest in counter terrorism, if people out there are trying to kill us, we'd better do something about it, and that means a lot of hard work.' A Home Office spokesman said:  'Police reform is working and crime has fallen by more than a fifth under this Government, according to the Independent Crime Survey for England and Wales. 'While we acknowledge that the police funding settlement is challenging, there is no question that the police will still have the resources to do their important work. 'What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are in total. 'The reduction in crime nationwide demonstrates there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels, the visibility of the police in the community and the quality of service provided.' The spokesman added: 'Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has found that the police are successfully meeting the challenge of balancing their books while protecting the frontline and delivering reductions in crime.'","Sir Hugh Orde is retiring president of Association of Chief Police Officers .

"They have eluded explorers, hunters and scientists who have been searching the Himalayan mountains for the mysterious yeti for over a century. Now it seems we are no closer to knowing what creature lies behind the mysterious sightings and footprints that have led to the legend of the Abominable Snowman. A key piece of evidence that suggested many of the sightings were due to an unknown type of bear living in the Himalaya has now been ruled out. This footprint taken by British explorer Eric Shipton in 1954 is regarded as one of the best pieces of evidence for the existence of a yeti and new research on hair samples shows that the mystery is far from being solved . Biologists used DNA analysis to examine claims that hair samples attributed to yetis appeared to belong to a scientifically undiscovered species of bear. Instead they have found that the DNA in the hair samples has degraded making it impossible to attribute them to any species of bear. The . first accounts of Yetis emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists . who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas. They . depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and . carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound. The . term Abominable Snowman was developed in 1921 following a book by . Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury called Mount Everest The . Reconnaissance. Popular . interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists . began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the Yeti. They reported seeing strange markings in the snow. The . Daily Mail led a trip called the the Snowman Expedition in 1954 to . Everest. During the trip mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson . photographed ancient paintings of Yetis and large footprints in the . snow. A number of hair . samples were also found that were believed to have come from a Yeti . scalp. British . mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when . scaling Annapurna in 1970. He said that while searching for a campsite . he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a Yeti's call. That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. The researchers conclude, however, that from the colour and shape of the hair samples, they were likely to have come from common Himalayan brown bears rather than an unknown species of bear. This means that the identity of the species behind yeti sightings is still a mystery. Dr Eliécer Gutiérrez, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian Institution, said one of the hair samples had apparently come from a bear that had been shot by hunters. He said: 'We have concluded that there is no reason to believe that the two samples came from anything other than Brown Bears. 'What strikes us as odd is that an “experienced hunter”, who was very familiar with the Brown Bear, could mistake the animal that he had shot for anything other than a bear of some sort and, specifically, for a “yeti”. 'Corroboration and documentation of, as well as other information concerning, the anecdote of this bear being shot by the hunter and the subsequent history of the hair that was saved would be most welcome.' In 2014 Professor Bryan Sykes, a geneticist at the University of Oxford, found that DNA extracted two samples of 'yeti' hair from the Himalaya were a 100 per cent match with a 40,000 year old fossil polar bear but not to modern species of polar bear. However, subsequent analysis by researchers from the University of Copenhagen found that the hair was not from a polar bear. Professor Sykes and his colleagues maintained, however, that the hair samples must be from an otherwise unknown species of bear living in the Himalaya. Although no DNA match was found the researchers say it is likely yeti hair samples came from a brown bear . An artists reconstruction of what a yeti may look like based on reports and descriptions from past sightings . Now Dr Gutiérrez and Dr Ronald Pine, a zoologist at the University of Kansas, have found that the DNA from the samples cannot be assigned to any species of bear. Writing in the journal ZooKeys, they said: 'The molecular data obtained and analyzed by Sykes are not informative enough to suggest the possibility that a taxonomically unrecognized type of bear exists in the Himalayas. 1832: A book on trekker B.H Hodgon's experiences in Nepal recalls the sighting of a tall, bipedal creature covered in long dark hair. Mr Hodgson concluded it was an orangutan. 1899: Laurence Waddell reports his guides seeing an ape-like creature and seeing footprints. He suspects they spotted a bear. 1925: N.A Tombazi, a photographer, wrote that he saw a creature in the Himalayas that was walking upright like a human, was dark coloured, and wore no clothes. 1951: Eric Shipton captured images of what some believe is a Yeti footprint . 1948: Peter Byrne claimed to have discovered a Yeti footprint in India . 1953: Sir Edmund Hillary reported seeing large footprints while scaling Mount Everest. He discounted Yeti reports as unreliable. 1954: Mountaineering leader John Jackson photographed symbolic paintings of the Yeti along with many sets of footprints in Nepal, some of which could not be identified. 1959: Supposed Yeti feces were collected and analysed. They were found to contain a parasite that could not be identified. 1959: Actor James Stewart, while visiting India, reportedly smuggled Yeti remains to London . 1960: Sir Edmund mounted an expedition to collect and analyse physical evidence of the Yeti. He found nothing conclusive. 1970: British mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature while scaled Annapurna. 1983: Daniel Taylor and Robert Fleming Jr led a Yeti expedition into Nepal's Barun Valley where footprints were discovered. 1996: A hoax Yeti movie called The Snow Walker Film was aired . 2007: U.S TV programme Destination Truth reported finding Yeti-like footprints in the Everest region. 2008: The BBC reported that hairs collected in North-East India were tested, but results about what creature it came from were inconclusive . 2008: Japanese adventures photographed footprints thought to have been left by a Yeti. 2011: At a conference in Russia , scientists and enthusiasts claimed to have 95 per cent proof of the Yeti's existence. It was later claimed to be a publicity stunt. 2011: A hunter claims to have spotted a bear-like creature trying to kill one of his sheep in Russia. 2013: British climber Mike Rees captures an image of footprints in the Himalayas thought to offer further proof of the Yeti's existence. 2014: A video of a 'hairy figure' is captured stumbling through a forest in Russia . 'We emphasize that no evidence has ever been presented to suggest that an unknown bear species occurs in the Himalayas . As part of their study, Dr Gutiérrez and Dr Pine examined how gene sequences can reveal the relationships between the six present-day species of bears. They found one sequence from an Asian Black Bear from Japan indicated that it was not closely related to the mainland members of that species. Professor Sykes insisted that the findings from the new study did not invalidate his own findings. He said: 'What mattered most to our project was that these two hairs were definitely not from unknown primates. 'The explanation by Gutierez and Pine might be right, or it might not be. 'The only way forward, as I have repeatedly said, is to find a living bear that matches the 12S RNA and and study fresh material from it. 'Which involves getting off your butt, not an activity I usually associate with desk-bound molecular taxonomists.' Last year, in what was the first serious scientific study of the abominable snowman for 50 years, Professor Bryan Sykes from the University of Oxford analysed 30 samples of hair. The hairs had supposedly been shed by yetis, or their bigfoot cousins, and were part of museum and private collections from around the world. Twenty eight of the hairs were genetic matches to known animals from bears to racoons, horses and cows. But two did not fit the mould. Their DNA matched that recovered from a 40,000-year-old polar bear fossil. One hair was reddish brown and found in a Yeti nest in a bamboo forest in Bhutan, ten years ago. The second was golden brown and taken from a Yeti in Ladakh on the Tibet-India border 40 years ago. But new research suggests Professor Sykes's findings were in fact down to an error in analysing the data. Researchers Ross Barnett, from the University of Copenhagen, and Ceiridwen Edwards from the University of Oxford looked at the same hair samples that led Professor Sykes to make his bold claim. They proposed that the previously unexplained samples come from the Himalayan bear - a sub-species of the brown bear that lives in the higher reaches of the Himalayas, in remote, mountainous areas of Pakistan, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and India. The latest research, however, concludes that it is difficult to attribute the DNA to any species of bear.","Latest research dismisses theories that yeti is an unknown species of bear .

"The Equality and Human Rights Commission, chaired by Baroness Onora O'Neill (above), said the Human Rights Act has 'proved its value' Tory MPs reacted angrily last night after a supposedly impartial £19million-a-year taxpayer-funded quango tore into the party’s plans to reform human rights law. Despite there being under two months to the election, the Equality and Human Rights Commission piled into the political debate over the future of Labour’s Human Rights Act. In a statement posted on the commission’s website, backed by a letter to MPs, it claimed that changes ‘to human rights laws that would water down the protections we all enjoy, would be “regressive” and undermine Britain’s reputation as a global leader that can challenge human rights abuses abroad’. The quango also declared the Act a success, saying it had ‘consistently proved its value’. This is despite the way it has been repeatedly used by foreign criminals and terrorists to avoid deportation. The Tories have a manifesto commitment to scrap the Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling also plans to give Britain’s Supreme Court the final say over human rights cases – not the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. But senior Conservative Party figures view the commission’s intervention as a nakedly political act. As a quango, in receipt of £18.7million of public money last year, it is supposed to remain outside the political fray. Government sources said it had not even got its facts right. In the letter to MPs, it said: ‘UK courts do not have to follow the judgements of the Strasbourg court. Our courts only need to take account of such judgements’. But a senior government source said: ‘For a start, it is plain wrong to claim that our courts are not bound by decisions made by ECHR in Strasbourg. They are. ‘This taxpayer-funded quango of Labour’s creation is deliberately trying to play politics on the eve of an election.’ Tory MP Michael Ellis, part of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘This is grossly improper so close to an election from a quango which receives millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money. Tory MPs blasted the online statement, calling it a nakedly political act, which had got its facts wrong. The post said British courts were not bound by the ECHR (pictured), when in fact they are . 'This country was protecting human rights when many members of the EU were under dictatorships and well before Labour’s Human Rights Act, which has only served to create extra tiers of bureaucracy, legal costs, delays and an imbalance of justice.’ Fellow Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The commission’s intervention shows just how politicised this self-serving quango has become. ‘Their blanket opposition to any re-balancing of our skewed human rights law ignores the concerns expressed by countless senior UK judges, and displays an arrogant contempt for the basic principle of democratic accountability we’ve lost in this area.’ The commission was established by Labour in 2006 ‘to protect and promote equality and human rights in Great Britain’. In 2011, Home Secretary Theresa May decided to scale back its powers drastically after a report found the commission had ‘struggled’ to do its job, while providing low-quality work and poor value for money. EHRC chief executive Mark Hammond said: ‘We are at a crossroads for human rights. One path risks undermining and diminishing our influence and status as a global leader in human rights and civil liberties. ‘The other will safeguard our reputation for fairness and moral authority when confronting human rights abuses abroad.’","Equality and Human Rights Commission provoked fury from Tories .

"Repeated exposure of children to secondhand smoke is child abuse, a leading doctor has warned. Adam Goldstein, a professor in family medicine, says exposure is as abusive as leaving children unattended in hot car, or drink driving. He claims he was forced to speak out after caring for 'too many children hospitalised with asthma and pneumonia, caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke'. Adam Goldstein, a professor in family medicine, says exposing children to secondhand smoke is 'as abusive as leaving them unattended in hot car, or drink driving' His controversial opinion piece has been published in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. In it, he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse. 'But what if the substance is secondhand smoke?,' he asks. Dr Goldstein, who is director of the tobacco intervention programs in the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, says the damage from smoke is 'as abusive as many other commonly accepted physical and emotional traumas of children'. His comments come after years of caring for children who have suffered severe respiratory illness due to secondhand smoke exposure. In the opinion piece, he writes: 'Scientific research over the last decade has increasingly demonstrated that exposure to secondhand smoke is not simply a nuisance; it is deadly. 'Secondhand smoke exposure causes multiple diseases in children, including asthma and pneumonia, and results in thousands of avoidable hospitalisations. 'It is a major cause of sudden infant death syndrome and may cause lung cancer and heart attacks with repeated exposure. He argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse . 'No safe level of exposure exists. '[Therefore], purposefully and recurrently exposing children to secondhand smoke - a known human carcinogen - despite repeated warnings, is child abuse.' In the paper, he goes on to explain how he and his colleagues treated two children of smokers 'at least 10 times over three years'. Despite repeated attempts to get the parents to quit, they continued to smoke - and the children, aged 5 and 7, repeatedly visited the clinic with ear infections, coughing, bronchitis, and asthma. In the end, the younger child developed pneumonia, he says. After treating her with antibiotics and inhalers,' Dr Goldstein and his colleagues implored the parents to stop smoking - or at least avoid smoking anywhere near the children - and offered them counselling. 'The parents, however, refused to engage with us about quitting smoking, pharmacotherapy for cessation, or about not letting their children be exposed to cigarette smoke,' he says. Shortly after, the child appeared in the emergency room with a recurrence of pneumonia and severe asthma. 'By the time we heard about it, she was already on a ventilator in the pediatric intensive care unit, where she stayed for several days before ultimately improving. 'Out of the 10 adults gathered in the waiting room - parents, extended family members, and several friends - six were heavy smokers,' he writes. 'In retrospect, it is easier to see where and why we failed: our patient was suffering from child abuse, and we had failed to intervene beyond offering medication, counseling, and referral.' As a result, Dr Goldstein says it is time for society - including doctors - to do much more. Dr Goldstein claims he was forced to speak out after caring for 'too many children hospitalized with asthma and pneumonia, caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke'. 'We must intervene to stop this abuse,' he writes. Options he suggests include counselling of parents that smoke, legislation, and even taking children away from their parents. The key message, he says, is that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. He points out that some U.S. states, including Texas, Vermont and Washington - already prohibit foster parents from smoking around children in cars and homes. 'If this is true for foster families and smoking, shouldn't it be the case for all parents?,' he asks. Additional legal protection for young children exposed to secondhand smoke makes common 'sense'. He adds that children already suffering from chronic lung illnesses should be protected from ongoing exposure. 'Secondhand smoke exposure decreases lung function and has dozens of carcinogens; yet often the most vulnerable children continue to be exposed, and these children often have no voice.'","Adam Goldstein is professor in family medicine in North Carolina .

"Rumoured to be hidden in the jungles of Honduras since the 16th century, the country's fabled White City has finally been discovered. Buried deep in the remote La Mosquitia region, with its exact location kept secret to protect it from looters, the so-called 'lost city', whose inhabitants disappeared without a trace, is just one of the ruins around the world that give us a glimpse of another time. The magnificent town of Machu Picchu, Peru, and the pumice rock-veiled ruins of Pompeii in Italy may be some of the most frequented among adventurers from around the world, there are plenty of lesser known sites that are just as breathtaking - and not nearly as busy. From the ancient city of Babylon in Iraq, also home to the mythical hanging gardens that have been named one of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World, to the medieval Armenian ruins of Ani, Turkey, these civilizations of yesteryear are nothing short of awe-inspiring. MailOnline Travel has compiled a list of 10 must-visit 'lost cities,' guaranteed to satisfy everyone from history buffs to backpackers. Scroll down for video . The 'city of Persians,' which lays at the foot of the Kuh-i-Ramat mountains, was once the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire . The Greeks burned a lot of the city to the ground when they invaded in 330 under the leadership of Alexander the Great . Persepolis, Iran . Persepolis, or 'the city of Persians,' dates back to 515 BC when it was once the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, the ruins lie at the foot of Kuh-i-Rahmat, or Mercy Mountains, near the city of Shiraz. It was built on a half-artificial, half-natural terrace where a palace complex inspired by Mesopotamian models was developed by cutting into the rocky mountainside. All that remains today is that which was not burned by the Greeks in 330 under the leadership of Alexander the Great. The ghost town of Epecuen, Argentina, may not be ancient, having flooded in 1985, but many former residents were sure it was lost forever . Epecuen, Argentina . This ghost town may not be ancient, but there was a time when many former residents were sure that it was lost forever. Once a busting lakeside resort, the Argentinean town was flooded without warning in November 1985 when heavy rains caused the lagoon to burst its banks and submerged the small community in corrosive salt water. Although the town was never rebuilt - most cafe owners and hoteliers simply moved to a nearby seaside town to set up shop - it's now become a popular tourist destination once again, in particular for the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Ciudad Perdida, located high in Colombia's Sierra Nevada mountains, has recently been dubbed 'the new Machu Picchu' Ciudad Perdida, Colombia . High in the Sierra Nevada mountains, the country's Lost City has recently been dubbed 'the new Machu Picchu,' after being first discovered in the 1970s. The site is believed to date back to about 800 AD, which is over 600 years earlier than the world's most famous lost city to which many comparisons have been drawn. Made up of 169 terraces, which are carved into the mountains, Ciudad Perdida, or Teyuna as its known by the local tribes, also boasts early tiled roads and several small plazas. However, to access the ruins, guests must be in good shape as they will be required to climb up 1,200 stone steps through dense jungle. The 15th century Inca site of Machu Picchu is one of the world's most famous and offers several hiking options for daring trekkers . Machu Picchu, Peru . This 15th century Inca site is a tourist favourite among those interested in exploring ancient cities, attracting over one million visitors last year alone. Adventurers can choose from one of several multi-day treks that lead hikers deep into the Sacred Valley, though the Inca Trail is far and away the most popular. Coaches are also available for those who are unable to climb the 500-year-old citadel and still wish to take in the impressive views. Tour operators recommend arriving at dawn or dusk for the most breathtaking views and warn that between 11am and 3pm is busiest. The ancient city of Babylon in Iraq dates back 4,000  years when it was then the capital of 10 dynasties in Mesopotamia . Today, its walls and mythical hanging gardens are considered to be one of the Seven Ancient World Wonders . Babylon, Iraq . Founded 4,000 years ago, the ancient city was the capital of 10 dynasties in Mesopotamia, and its walls and mythic hanging gardens are considered to be one of the world's original Seven Wonders. Also believed to be the birthplace of writing and literature, due to unrest in the region in recent years, Babylon has not drawn as many visitors as expected from the far reaches of the globe. The city is located 85km south of Baghdad and is accessible only after going through several security checkpoints. Where once stood towering gates and a bustling market city packed with traders, now only remains remnants of the city's walls and a 2,500-year-old statue of a lion. The in-tact buildings at the ancient city are mainly ill-advised attempts by former dictator Saddam Hussein who tried to reconstruct monuments 'to glorify Iraq' and rebuilt the Nebuchadnezzar II palace on top of the original's ruins. Angkor, in Southeast Asia, stretches over 400 square kms and offers remains of several different capitals of the Khmer Empire . Located in the Siem Riep Province, two of the site's most famous monuments are the Temple of Angkor Wat (pictured) and Bayon Temple . Angkor Wat, Cambodia . One of the most important archeological sites in Southeast Asia, Angkor stretches over 400 square kms and features the remains of several different capitals of the Khmer Empire. All were constructed from between the 9th and 15th century, but the most famous are the Temple of Angkor Wat and the Bayon Temple. The impressive monuments, ancient urban plans and large water reservoirs, as well as evidence of centuries-old communication routes, are all located in the Siem Reap Province and are indicative of an exceptional civilization.

The historical city, located in the Ma'an governorate, is famous for its architecture, carved into the red sandstone rock, as well as for its ancient water conduit system. Ideally situated between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea, Petra was once an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia. The surrounding mountains are riddled with passages and gorges, though the UNESCO World Heritage Centre is subject to erosion due to wind, including windblown sand, and rain. The ancient Roman town of Pompeii, Italy, was buried by burning pumice stone in 79 AD after Mount Vesuvius erupted . Pompeii, Italy . The ancient Roman town is situated near the current city of Naples, and researchers believe that it was founded as early as six century BC. However, the impressive architecture was mostly buried and destroyed after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD blanketed the region in burning pumice stone and ash. Today, the ghostly ruins, which include an amphitheatre and a port, are one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, drawing 2.5 million guests each year.

"A lesbian couple have spent £13,000 having Danish semen and fertility treatment shipped to their British home so their child will look like a Viking. Kelly and Anna Cooke, both 34, have chosen to buy sperm from Denmark because they want their child to have blonde hair and blue eyes and because British sperm 'doesn't cut the mustard'. The married couple, from Camberley, Surrey, used Kelly's eggs for the insemination after receiving £300-a-time vials of Danish sperm in the post and later successfully conceived via IVF. Anna and Kelly Cooke (right), from Surrey, have chosen to buy sperm from Denmark because they want their child to have blonde hair and blue eyes just like them and because UK sperm 'doesn't cut the mustard' The married couple used Kelly's eggs for the insemination after receiving £300-a-time vials of Danish sperm in the post. Anna is now pregnant and they are expecting their baby in late July . Anna put herself forward to carry the child so that they both had an input into the pregnancy and, after a heart-breaking miscarriage, she is now five months pregnant. Kelly, a buildings manager, said: 'Danish sperm is the best in the world and such high quality. 'British sperm is more than double the price and just doesn't cut the mustard. 'At least with a Dane we knew our baby would be attractive and blonde like us. 'I suppose he would look a bit like a Viking, but we want our son to look like us.' The pair, who got legally married in February, ordered their Danish semen from Cryos International - the world's largest sperm bank which has a motto of: ‘Congratulations, it’s a Viking’. However, after inseminating Anna with four vials of Danish sperm, she had still not fallen pregnant so they forked out £5,000 for a round of IVF treatment. The couple said they chose to go to Denmark to buy the sperm because they wanted their child to look like them - blonde with blue eyes. Both women are naturally blonde, although Anna dyes her hair dark brown . Anna (left) put herself forward to carry the child so that they both had an input into the pregnancy and, after a heart-breaking miscarriage, she is now five months pregnant. The pair are delighted with the results of IVF . Anna shows of her baby bump (left) while partner Kelly (centre) and a friend look on. Right: The couple pictured on their wedding day last year. They said they are 'so pleased' they finally have a baby on the way . That worked but she miscarried, so they spent another £5,000 on IVF and have so far bought ten vials of Dutch sperm. Anna is due to give birth on July 23 but the couple want to keep the sex of their fair-haired baby secret for the time being. Anna, a chef, who dyes her hair brown, said: 'We are just so pleased that after spending £13,000 we finally have a little one on the way. 'It doesn't matter that we have rinsed our savings and scrimped and saved for years to get where we are.' Her partner added: 'With my eggs and Anna carrying the baby, he or she really is ours and we couldn't be happier.' The couple are eagerly awaiting the arrival of their little one, but have chosen to keep the sex a secret for now . Kelly and Anna are among thousands of British women who are flocking to Denmark to buy foreign sperm . Danish sperm now accounts for a third of the total used by British fertility clinics. Women from all over the world are choosing to go Scandinavian when they need a sperm donor, with shortages of homegrown sperm and better service cited as the main reasons for doing so. According to Dr Alan Pacey, a fertility expert at the University of Sheffield, people prefer going abroad because of a lack of British sperm donors. He said: 'We don't have enough donors in the UK to meet the national need. We don't have the clinic infrastructure sufficient to recruit enough donors - even when men want to donate. 'Often there simply isn't the size and scale within small NHS clinics to consider having a donor recruitment programme - plus if you're not confident that sufficient men are going to ring up and become sperm donors, the economics of it simply aren't going to work.' Danish clinic Cryos International – which is the world's largest sperm bank – is also popular because of its customer service, according to experts. Laura Witjens, CEO of the National Gamete Donation Trust, said: 'It's much easier for a British clinic to order sperm from Denmark which is Fed-exed the next day than to try and recruit their own donors and all the hassle that goes with them. 'The Danish model is customer service driven. It knows how to deal well with customers, it has a good website, and that's what we could do in the UK as well - it's not rocket science.' Choice: Denmark's sperm banks, among them Cryos, deploy excellent customer service to help boost sales . Dr Pacey added: 'Denmark is geographically close to the UK. I think there's some sort of philosophical and intellectual bond that we have with Denmark.' Most women flocking to Denmark for sperm are lesbians or single women in their 30s and 40s who do not see why a lack of partner should be a barrier to motherhood. It is only in the past few years that there has been a 'Viking invasion' of Britain, due to changes in the law that banned anonymous sperm donation in Britain, leading to a rapid decline in donors. A British sperm donor has to be prepared for the fact that any resulting child will have the right to trace them at the age of 18. However, Danish sperm donors aren't anonymous and the detail given about the donor is extensive, which is part of the attraction. With a British sperm donor, you get a number and choice of hair colour, while Danish sperm donors offer detail you can imagine including family background, job description, education and pictures of the man as a baby or child. One expert said: 'Donors write personal messages about why they are a donor. You even get to hear their voice.' The Cryos clinic has been running for 25 years and boasts 30,000 babies born worldwide. But a Viking baby doesn't come cheap, with Danish sperm bought over the internet and delivered to an address in Britain costing £460.","Kelly and Anna Cooke have bought sperm from Denmark to get pregnant .

"Sarah Silverman is coming under fire for a list of ten 'rape prevention tips' that she shared on Twitter, because they offer tongue-in-cheek advice to men. The post, which has been retweeted nearly 5,000 times, includes points such as 'don't put drugs in women's drinks' and 'when you see a woman walking by herself, leave her alone'. She posted a graphic of the tips, writing: 'These are great - send to all the men in ur life.' But dozens of angry men on Twitter seized on her joke, tweeting in to call her 'sexist' and saying it was 'offensive' to imply that all men are looking for ways to rape women. A tongue-in-cheek list of rape prevention tips that are aimed at the attacker have gone viral on Twitter . Sarah Silverman tweeted the list with a post advising people to 'send it to all the men in ur life' Although the Ten Rape Prevention Tips have been shared and favourited thousands of times, the comedian faced a backlash on social media, with men calling them 'degrading' and 'sexist'. The sarcastic set of rules, which focus on the perpetrator of the crime rather than the victim, also include 'if you are in an elevator and a woman gets in, don't rape her', as well as 'when you encounter a woman who is asleep, the safest course of action is not to rape her'. Number nine on the list is 'carry a rape whistle. If you find you are about to rape someone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you'. And the final one reads: 'Don't forget, honesty is the best policy. When asking a woman out on a date, don't pretend that you are interested in her as a person; tell her straight up that you expect to be raping her later. If you don't communicate your intentions, the woman may take it as a sign that you do not plan to rape her.' Silverman is currently dating Welsh actor Michel Sheen - whom she has been with since January 2014. Before that, she had a highly publicized romance with late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, whom she dated for five years until they split in 2008. The set of tips was first shared in a blog on Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence back in 2011. The post was uploaded by Leigh Hofheimer who said a co-worker had produced the set of rules. Comedian Sarah Silverman shared the list over Twitter dividing the opinion . Silverman's tweet left many men feeling offended . Social media users said the list suggested  all men were capable of such crimes . Hofheimer wrote: 'I couldn’t decide if I should laugh or be horrified by the reality that violence prevention tips are always aimed at what the targeted person should do (judgment strongly implied) to protect themselves.' Despite being almost four years old, the list has caused controversy after being tweeted by the comedian. Silverman's tweet has received a mixed reaction from the public. Although Silverman did not write the list some users attacked her directly in response to the list . However several users argued that the list pointed out that victims are too often blamed for their attacks . The list has divided opinions with some feminists arguing it shows it is not victims who need to change their behaviour but the attacker. D Kramer wrote: 'I get the point, we always tells the women they are responsible to prevent rape & not the men.' However, men on Twitter have hit out at the list implying that it's all men who would commit such crimes. Silverman has been dating Welsh actor Michael Sheen (left) since January 2014. Before that, she was with Jimmy Kimmel (right) for five years . Zac Lee posted: 'It's extremely offensive.

And Paul Jukes tweeted: 'Rather harsh on those of us who, you know, wouldn't dream of hurting anyone.' User Ben Morpy wrote: 'I feel like battling sexism with sexist propaganda is the best way to promote sexism.' This is not Silverman's first controversial tweet involving rape. In November last year, the 44-year-old comedian came under fire for tweeting a gag about being sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby. She later removed the post and edited it after causing offense online.","Sarah Silverman tweeted an image of the ten rape prevention tips .

"A Philadelphia police officer fatally shot while trying to stop a video game store robbery was remembered as a 'hero' at a somber funeral on Saturday. Services for Officer Robert Wilson III began at 10 am on Saturday at the University of Pennsylvania. The solemn ceremony honored 30-year-old Wilson, who was killed in a gunfight March 5 at a GameStop store in north Philadelphia. He had stopped for a security check and to buy a game for his son Quahmier when two men with semi-automatic weapons stormed in to rob the shop. Scroll down for video . Philadelphia officer Robert Wilson III, 30, was remembered at a funeral on Saturday after he was slain at a GameStop in the cities north while buying a video game for his son Quahmier, 10, earlier this month .

Wilson's funeral procession marched through Philadelphia during a rainstorm. He will be buried after a funeral at the University of Pennsylvania where he was remembered as a fun-loving family man . Police say the father of two was getting the game to reward his son for good grades and for his 10th birthday, which was Monday. His second son Robert Wilson IV is one year old. Wilson did not take cover behind the counter inside the store so as to not draw fire towards employees and customers while he exchanged shots with the would-be robbers. More than 50 shots were fired during the incident. The slain officer was hit multiple times but 'fought til the very end,' Philadelphia Police Department's Captain James Clark said . Two brothers, Ramone Williams, 26, and Carlton Hipps, 29, have been arrested and charged with murder in Wilson's death. Hipps served five years in prison for armed robbery of a liquor store and Williams has a record for assault, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

"It seems to be a perfectly timed stunt just in time for April Fool's... with a blue-dyed fish dish taking centrestage in this takeaway. But despite appearances, this Yorkshire chippy is playing it straight. Audrey's Fish and Chips in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, is dying their batter a bright blue to mark Tour de Yorkshire's upcoming arrival, which gets under way in the town on 1 May. Trying out the dish is Audrey's Fish & Chips proprietor James Morrison and  member of staff Sharon Skeggs . The fish is taking a bit of an odd battering by being dyed blue  to mark the start of Tour de Yorkshire's upcoming arrival . The world's top cyclists, including British icon Sir Bradley Wiggins, will be competing and shop proprietor James Morrison hopes he and others will stop by to try their quirky new product. The blue fish will be served on the day the race begins and Mr Morrison says that, while some may not be convinced, the idea has got the seaside townsfolk talking. 'I've done a few tasters for customers and posted a few pictures on Facebook. Some have pulled their face but some have said they will give it a go,' he said. Audreys Fish and Chips in Bridlington, East Yorks . On the chippie's Facebook page, user  Debra Swaryczewska Oliver posted: 'Why would u want blue fish. Doesnt look appetising.' And another customer Jason Bowers agreed, writing: 'No thank you to blue fish I prefer the traditional way.' However some customers have encouraged the move. 'I think it looks ace! I'll definitely be trying that,' Savannah Jones wrote. Mr Morrison has assured customers that the dye won't affect the taste of the dish. 'It tastes exactly the same - it still tastes great,' he said. 'Some people will just have to eat it with their eyes closed.' 'Everbody has been dressing the town in blue and yellow with bunting and blue bikes, so I fancied doing something a bit different,' he said. 'The chips are slightly yellow so I thought about adding some blue food colouring to the batter - something a bit gimmicky. 'It cooked really well. It's not the most appealing looking fish but it's got the town talking.' The three-day race will be broadcast live on ITV and is a by-product of a highly successful Yorkshire leg of last year's Tour de France.","Audrey's Fish & Chips in Bridlington, East Yorkshire introducing blue fish .

"Masa Vukotic was murdered in a random attack at a Melbourne Park last Tuesday . In the lead up to the funeral for random stabbing victim Masa Vukotic, the school girl's mother has shared her 'heartache' after her daughter's tragic death. Natasa Vukotic has publicly paid tribute to her 'funny, intelligent and kind-hearted' 17-year-old for the first time since she was killed at a Melbourne park near Doncaster last Tuesday. 'The loss of Masa has left a heartache that will never heal, but her love has left us with memories that no on can take from us,' Ms Vukotic said, according to the Herald Sun. 'She will be remembered for her bright smile and her inspirational attitude to life… she was our everything.' A funeral for the teenager, who was killed just five minutes from her home at 7pm while exercising at the park, will take place on Thursday with hundreds of people expected to attend. Devastated friends and family have  organised numerous pink-themed parades and marches for Masa, who was known to have loved 'Lolita Japanese fashion', with her mother thanking the public for their support. Hundreds of flowers, stuffed toys, cards and candles have also been left at the scene of the tragedy by loved ones and strangers alike, who have also paid tribute to 'beautiful Princess Marci' on Facebook.

Her mother, Natasa (pictured far right with her three children) publicly paid tribute to Masa on Wednesday . Sean Price, 31, was charged with murdering Masa, along with committing six other crimes, at Melbourne Magistrates Court last week. Police allege he went on a rampage of rape, assault and an attempted car-jacking in the hours after he is accused of killing the 17-year-old and before he handed himself into police. Ms Vukotic's grief-stricken father, Slabvoljub Vukotic, locked eyes with Price during the court hearing while sitting just 10 metres away from the accused. In a Facebook event post for the memorial tribute, Ms Vukotic's friends wrote: 'On the 28th of this month, we will be holding a memorial for our dear friend. Please, invite your friends to come.

'The world has certainly become a darker place without her,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. 'Marci was without a doubt one of the most wonderful people I've ever met,' another friend said. 'She was so full of personality and passion and her sense of humour was incredible.'

"A transgender woman whose wife stayed with her through sex change surgery, helped her shop for a new wardrobe and join a dating site is now repaying her  by becoming her carer. Emily Dodge, 62, who was born a man revealed she needed to live as a woman to wife Jean Smith, 68, after the couple, from Cornwall, had been happily married for 20 years. Today Emily describes her relationship with Jean as like 'close sisters' and has pledged to stand by her loyal spouse now that she has   dementia. Emily Dodge (left) was born with a male body and revealed to wife of 20 years, Jean Smith (right) that she wanted to transition to a woman. Emily now cares for Jean, who suffers from early onset dementia . The Cornwall-based couple were married for 20 years before Emily (right) transitioned. Things took a turn for the worse when Jean began to suffer memory loss in 2013. She was diagnosed with early onset dementia in 2014 . Emily - who has not revealed her birth name - will stand by Jean, who was diagnosed with early onset dementia in 2014. The former IT worker said: 'I always promised Jean we would be best friends and that will never change. I will never leave her.' Jean, a former financial advisor, discovered her then 55-year-old husband needed to live as a woman and stayed by her side, helping Emily through gender reassignment surgery in February 2011. The couple, from Helston, in Cornwall, were so close after the operation Jean helped the woman who had been her husband with some wardrobe advice. Emily said: 'Jean was amazing. Once I was well enough after the operation, we went shopping together and she'd pick out outfits for me. 'She even helped me enrol for online dating. Our relationship is now like close sisters. She's my best friend.' Emily spoke candidly about life before the operation. 'I had felt like a woman trapped in the body of a man and the only time I felt happy was when I was wearing women's clothes and make-up' - Emily Dodge (pictured) was tired of living a double life . 'To the outside world, including Jean, I was a guy who liked DIY, football and a pint with my mates of an evening, but actually, that wasn't me at all.' - Emily shocked wife Jean with the revelation that he wanted to live life as a woman . She said: 'To the outside world, including Jean, I was a guy who liked DIY, football and a pint with my mates of an evening, but actually, that wasn't me at all. 'I had felt like a woman trapped in the body of a man and the only time I felt happy was when I was wearing women's clothes and make-up. 'I kept it all hidden in the loft and would only get it out if I was sure Jean was going to be out for a while.' But living a double life was not easy and after 20 years of marriage, Emily decided to come clean. Jean said: 'It was a huge shock when my husband told me how he wanted to live as a woman. He came into the living room wearing a skirt. I nearly had a heart attack.' Initially, she thought it was a joke. But after a lot of discussion, Mrs Smith gave her blessing, as long as her husband didn't dress in women's clothes in front of her. Before and after: Emily underwent gender reassignment surgery and wife Jean helped her shop for new clothes and enroll on online dating sites . Emily said: 'At first, that was okay. I'd lock myself in the spare room, put on one of my favourite dresses and read a book for an hour. It felt so good to finally be myself, but when I wiped off the make-up and put on a short again, it didn't feel right. 'Eventually I knew that would never be enough for me and I plucked up the courage to tell Jean I wanted to live as a woman full time. 'Jean said she didn't want to lose me and she wanted me to be happy,' she said. 'It meant the world to me.' With her approval, Ms Dodge changed her name to Emily and started taking female hormones. She had gender reassignment surgery and breast augmentation on the NHS in February 2011. 'I spent eight days in the hospital afterwards but it was worth it,' she said. 'When I looked in the mirror I was in the body I was always meant to be in. It felt right. Still best friends: Emily Dodge (left) is repaying Jean's loyalty by becoming her sole carer, and has put finding a man to share a life with, on the back burner . 'Jean fully accepted the new me too. We'd go clothes shopping together, get our hair and nails done and gossip over coffee. But soon I realised something was missing. I wanted to experience every aspect of being a woman.' She wanted male company – and Emily encouraged her to explore this. Jean said: 'I knew I'd already lost my husband, so letting Emily see other people was almost inevitable. Emily says she'll never leave me and I believe her.' She vetted Emily's potential dates and helped her choose what to wear. Emily met up with several men and also had a brief relationship with Mrs Smith's knowledge. She said: 'Jean knew all about them and spoke to the guy on the phone. It was only brief but none of it was behind her back.' Sadly, in 2013 Emily started to notice Jean was suffering some memory loss. She said: 'Jean would ask visitors if they wanted a cup of tea then go into the kitchen and come out and ask again. 'She couldn't keep up with television programmes and struggled to use the remote control.' Emily alerted the doctor and two health care workers came to the house to conduct a memory test. Emily now also runs a support group for people considering genital reconstructive surgery . After her results came back below average, Mrs Smith had a brain scan and was subsequently diagnosed with early onset vascular dementia. This means there is a reduced blood supply to the brain due to diseased blood vessels, causing brain cells to die and reduce cognitive function. Emily has since been her sole carer and consigned finding a man to share her life with, on the back burner. She said: 'I'm always worrying I'm not doing the right thing for her, so for now dating is on hold. 'Meeting someone does cross my mind from time to time. If it happened, it would be nice, but I'm not going looking for it.' Emily also runs a support group and advises other people who are planning on having genital reconstruction surgery. Now the couple, who have been together 39 years, are taking things a day at a time. Emily said: 'It's very hard as I don't know how Jean will be from one day to the next. But I do know one thing - Jean will always come first.'","Emily Dodge, 62, was born a man but had surgery to become a woman .

"Forward thinking: Dell Williams, 92, died last Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She founded what's believed to be the first sex-shop catered to women in the U.S. in the 1970s . A woman who changed the sex-shop industry died last week at her home in Manhattan. Dell Williams, owner of sex-shop Eve's Garden, passed away last Wednesday, a friend confirmed to the New York Times. Williams started the first sex shop catered to women from her home in the early 1970s, after having an awkward interaction with a male sales clerk when she tried to buy a vibrator at Macy's. In the four decades since that fateful encounter, Williams has made it her life's work to help women become more comfortable with sexual expression. A former actress, advertising executive and Army WAC, Williams took a workshop on sex from  legendary instructor Betty Dodsen in the 70s, who recommended she buy a Hitachi Magic Wand. The Magic Wand is designed as a personal massager, and available in most department stores, but Dodsen said it could also be used as a vibrator. But when Williams went to pick up the product at a Macy's she ran into a 'pimply 20-something' male salesmen who made her uncomfortable about the purchase. 'What do you want it for?' he asked Williams. 'I left Macy’s that day, clutching my precious, anonymous brown shopping bag and thinking: Someone really ought to open up a store where a woman can buy one of these things without some kid asking her what she’s going to do with it,' Williams wrote of the experience. Williams store first started off as mail-delivery only, but grew to include a brick-and-mortar location in Midtown New York and a website. Pioneer: Williams founded Eve's Garden after having an uncomfortable experience buying a vibrator at Macy's. Pictured on the left during her years in the Women's Army Corps . Today, Eve's Garden sells vibrators, flavored condoms and bondage kits. Williams' approach to selling sex toys has helped turn it into a multimillion-dollar industry today with several chains now dedicated to female shoppers. Williams became somewhat of a talking head for women's liberation issues after starting her store, and was often called upon my newspapers and TV shows to give her opinions on the feminist issues of the day. When asked about the 2003 Britney Spears song about masturbation called 'Touch of My Hand, Williams said: 'In the past 50 years or so, even as the medicinal and moral fears of masturbation have ebbed, the stigma still remains — and that’s what is shameful. Hopefully, Britney’s honesty and her song can help women overcome feelings of embarrassment and instead embrace something so natural.' Williams was born Dell Zetlin in Manhattan in August 1922, and grew up in the Bronx. She had a brief wartime romance, which ended in a painful abortion before enlisting in the Women's Army Corps in 1945. During the war she performed on Army radio broadcasts and in a touring WAC musical. Following the war, she moved to Los Angeles where she focused on acting, but eventually moved back to New York to pursue a career in advertising. In 2005, she wrote a memoir titled 'Revolution in the Garden' detailing 'how a nice Jewish girl from the Bronx ended up owning a sex toy store'. Williams leaves behind no close relatives. Her creation: Today, Williams' store Eve's Garden has grown to include a brick-and-mortar location as well as a website .","Dell Williams passed away at her home in Manhattan last Wednesday .

"SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. is mounting a public defense of its animal handling in a new advertising campaign following the release of a highly critical documentary, Blackfish - which left the park with declining revenue and attendance. The company has faced backlash since the release of the 2013 documentary that examined what led killer whale Tilikum to drown trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 at SeaWorld's Orlando park. The print and YouTube campaign that began on Monday also comes only a day before former SeaWorld trainer John Hargove is set to release a book detailing his experiences at the park, which could bring more negative attention to the company. However, SeaWorld senior corporate affairs officer Jill Kermes claims the timing of the campaign has nothing to do with Hargrove's book release, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Scroll down for video . SeaWorld is mounting a public defense of its animal handling in a new advertising campaign following the release of a highly critical documentary, Blackfish - which left the park with declining revenue and attendance . SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. has faced backlash since the release of the 2013 documentary that examined what led killer whale Tilikum to drown trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 at SeaWorld's Orlando park . 'I think there's been a lot of misinformation out in the public about who we are and what we do,' said Kermes. 'It has been a one-sided conversation and this is an opportunity for us to give people the information they need so they can make up their own minds.' The campaign focuses on the marine-life theme park's efforts of caring for animals in captivity and in the wild, while 'setting the record straight on false accusations by activists who oppose whales and other animals in zoological settings'. 'There's been a lot of misinformation and even lies spread about SeaWorld, and we recognize that it has caused some people to have questions about the welfare of killer whales in human care,' said David D'Alessandro, Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. in a memo on Monday. 'This long-term campaign will address those questions head on. We want to provide the facts, so people can make up their own minds on this important issue.' Jim Atchison (above), who had served as CEO and president since 2009, stepped down in January amid accusations that the company's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers. Last week, the new President and CEO was named as Joel Manby, who will take over the role in April . The print advertisements are set to appear in publications including the New York Times, The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. They ads feature staff from SeaWorld such as veterinarians and researchers, who will explain how the company cares for its killer whales. The print ads began running on Monday and TV commercials will air next month, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The marketing campaign will also  highlight the company's latest initiatives including a commitment of $10million in matching funds to study endangered killer whales in the wild. Last Monday, SeaWorld launched its  'Meet the Animals'  campaign which introduces individual animals as it gives a look into sea life. The YouTube campaign also shows videos of behind-the-scenes caring for SeaWorld's marine mammals by the company's veterinarians. Critics of that campaign said SeaWorld failed to explain that like orca whales and dolphins, sea lions fare poorly in captivity, as documented in an editorial by The Dodo. An official for the animal rights group PETA called SeaWorld's campaign 'a last-ditch effort.' PETA has led organized campaigns against SeaWorld. 'The tide has turned for SeaWorld,' said Jared Goodman, PETA's director of animal law. 'It's a last-ditch effort to sway a public that has already made up its mind.' It was reported in February that SeaWorld had a wider loss in its fourth quarter of $25.4 million as attendance to its theme parks continued to fall - due in part to Blackfish. Jim Atchison, who had served as CEO and president since 2009, stepped down in January amid accusations that the company's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers. The company also announced plans to build larger environments for its killer whales.

"Forget switchblades it's shears that will be the new weapon of choice for members of New Zealand's notorious Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs who are set to take up a new community initiative. The New Zealand Herald reports that in July the council of Dunedin City, on the South Island's east coast, will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work - such as mowing lawns, trimming hedges, and cutting back foliage. Both the Mongrel Mob and Black Power have shared a violent rivalry spanning decades. The gangs have been involved in drug trafficking, alleged murder, and robbery - but last year the gangs surprised everyone by suddenly making peace, not war. The council of Dunedin City, on New Zealand's South Island, will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work . It's a very different kind of work than they're used to, but the gangs have joined forces in a submission to the Dunedin City Council, asking for help in acquiring paid work to support their families. 'It's remarkable they're working together. They've had a long history of just shooting each other,' Dunedin Mayor Dave Cull said. 'But I think they're both beginning to realise that violence won't provide them much of a future anymore.' Rather than shoot and knife each other the proposal was put forward for them to work together as an employment solution for gang members who were struggling to support their families, and steer them from a life of crime. The Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs have been involved in drug trafficking, alleged murder and robbery . Mayor Cull explained that as the men approach middle age they've found their reputation and appearance have prevented them from finding traditional and regular employment. In response to concerns that work is being spoon-fed to gang members and that there are others more deserving of the chance, the Dunedin City Council said it will ensure that both Mongrel Mob and Black Power have to meet standard expectations. This includes meeting state health and safety requirements and providing insurance cover like any other commercial landscaping company.","Mongrel Mob and Black Power shared a violent rivalry spanning decades .

"A woman who tried to video conference with her colleagues was left red-faced after she accidentally called them while she was naked.

She claimed she worked for 'a corporate job at a big firm' and the incident happened on Wednesday morning, while she was working from home. An Australian woman (not pictured) claims she accidentally video called her colleagues naked while working from home . On the day she decided to work from home, she also decided not to wear clothes. 'There's lots of perks working from home, one being that clothes are optional,' she wrote. 'I set up my laptop and sit it in front of my naked body.' The corporate worker explained she then went to boot up a new program that allowed her to take calls on her computer from her office phone. As it was the first time she had used it, she chose to test it out - with awkward results. 'I first call my mobile from the program and all works great. I then proceed to call my boss [45 year old awkward male] from my laptop,' swallowing_panda said. The woman, only known as redditor swallowing_panda, said the incident happened on Wednesday morning (above is a stock picture) 'And, like a baby boomer using Skype for the first time, lean up close to the mic to test the audio: ""Hi Boss! Just testing the new program out! Hows everything going?""' swallowing_panda said she was puzzled when her boss did not respond and heard only background noises for 10 seconds before he hung up. She then goes on to call a colleague who she describes as a 'mid-30s nerd-like male'. But his reaction was as confusing as the first after she asked her workmate if he could hear her. 'A stumble of words come out from my mic, I hear a faint gasp, a laugh and then after a few seconds he too hangs up,' swallowing_panda said. She is on the cusp of giving up when she receives a call from another colleague named Patricia. 'I answer with a ""Hi Patricia!"". There's a long pause. I lean in further to my screen, boobs perked above the keyboard, ""Patricia, I'm working from home today, can you hear me?""' swallowing_panda wrote. 'I hear a ""oh my God"" then she too..hangs up.

"A bus driver sacked after testing positive for cocaine has won a substantial pay out by proving the drug came from bank notes handed over by passengers. Alan Bailes was fired by First Bus after 22 years of employment when he failed a saliva test – despite insisting he has never taken drugs. His only explanation was that the trace of the Class A drug had come from the hundreds of pounds in cash he handled that day. Alan Bailes (left) has won a five-figure payout from First Bus after he proved that a saliva test which got him sacked for taking drugs was incorrect. Mr Bailes, pictured with his daughter Stefanie (right) and his wife Rita (centre) was forced to borrow money after being sacked to cover his mortgage payments . It is thought up to 88 per cent of bank notes in the UK carry traces of illegal drugs. After a two-and-a-half year legal battle, Mr Bailes, 58, has won a five-figure sum from First Bus, which fired him for ‘gross misconduct’ in June 2012. To clear his name, the grandfather-of-three spent £440 on a more accurate hair follicle test through his GP – which proved he had not had drugs in his system for at least 90 days. Despite this First Bus refused to reinstate him. It must now pay out after its appeal against a court ruling of unfair dismissal failed. Alan Bailes has won a five-figure payout from First Bus after he proved that a saliva test which got him sacked for taking drugs was incorrect . Mr Bailes and his wife, Rita, had to borrow money from friends and family to cover mortgage payments while they took the company to an employment tribunal, which ruled he was wrongly dismissed and condemned First Bus’s ‘flawed investigation’. Last night Mr Bailes said: ‘We’ve been left feeling stressed, incredibly worried and upset, all for something I didn’t do. ‘I’m sure First Bus don’t like the fact that the little man took them on and beat them… But I was accused of doing something I knew I hadn’t done and I was determined to fight back.’ Mr Bailes, from Bristol, was asked by First Bus to take a saliva test in May 2012 after an anonymous complaint that he had driven under the influence of cannabis. He had not washed his hands before the test and had eaten his sandwiches after counting the cash, increasing the likelihood of the drug being transferred to his mouth. Mr Bailes said: ‘I hadn’t smoked cigarettes for 16 years and I have never taken drugs in my life. I took the test and ten days later it came back with cocaine. I couldn’t believe it.’ Following his dismissal, Mr Bailes’s family found a Daily Mail article about traces of illegal drugs on bank notes. During the tribunal an expert witness presented evidence that the positive result was down to ‘sample contamination’ from the money Mr Bailes handled. A study by the Forensic Science Service in 2010 found that almost every British bank note in circulation is likely to contain traces of cocaine. Most bank notes now have traces of cocaine . Contamination is believed to occur within weeks of notes entering general circulation. Notes are either contaminated by coming into contact with someone who has used cocaine, or other bank notes that contain traces. Experts said notes are no longer routinely tested to identify drug users and dealers because most contain background traces of cocaine. The number of notes detected is said to be an indicator of the prevalence of cocaine use in the UK. Scientists found one in 20 notes gave very high readings for cocaine, showing they were likely to have been handled by dealers. A study by Mass Spec Analytical (MSA), based in Bristol, tested 500 banknotes in circulation in London and found just four did not contain traces of cocaine. Banknotes are more likely to be contaminated with cocaine rather than heroin or ecstasy which degrade more rapidly. Traces of cocaine use in the UK is now believed to be so widespread it is found in the water supply, tests by the Drinking Water Inspectorate found last year. Employment judge Christa Christensen said: ‘The respondent [First Bus] was aware that bank notes in general circulation are or could be contaminated by cocaine. 'This in turn means that it was incumbent on the respondent, as part of a reasonable investigatory process, to investigate the possibility that that reality may have some significance to the claimant’s positive cocaine drug test.’ A First West of England spokesman said: ‘We believe that we followed due process throughout.’ The 55-year-old had been a First Bus driver for 22 years and previously had an unblemished record .","Alan Bailes was given a random saliva test for drugs after day driving bus .

"Shia LaBeouf made an appearance in a Manhattan criminal court early this morning. The Nymphomaniac actor wore a sharp suit as the judge held a progress hearing following his arrest last June on disorderly conduct charges for an incident in which he yelled at and slapped actors during a Broadway performance of Cabaret starring Michelle Williams and Alan Cumming. LaBeouf pleaded guilty to two counts of disorderly conduct, one count of trespass, one count of criminal trespass and harassment in the second degree  last September, and was ordered to undergo continued alcohol treatment.

During the Cabaret melee, LaBeouf screamed profanities at performers and then slapped Cumming on the behind as he performed at the emcee. As he was escorted from the theater he began screaming; F*** you! This is f***ing bull****!' He then added; 'Do you know my life? Do you know who the f*** I am? Do you know who I am?' He is also reported to have spat on one of the police officers. Judge Ann Scherzer announced today a plan to drop the charges againt the star in six months . LaBeouf's next court appearance has been scheduled for September .

"The College of Policing have conducted a study into chief officer misconduct (file picture) Police chiefs put gifts for their lovers on taxpayer-funded expenses and preyed on young female colleagues out of arrogance, a scathing report has found. They saw themselves as captains of industry rather than public servants, research into a string of misconduct scandals concluded. A culture of entitlement meant some in the highest ranks believed they had a right to perks and privileges including gym membership, school fees, overseas travel, hospitality and executive cars. The report added that too many forces tolerated bullying with a ‘boys club’ culture that allowed misconduct to thrive. It was compiled as part of a College of Policing drive to improve leadership and integrity within the 43 constabularies in England and Wales. Academics studied the cases of 33 police chiefs, all assistant chief constables or above, who were investigated for, or guilty of, offences including financial misconduct, dishonesty, bullying, racism and sexism since 2008. Although not named in the report, one is understood to be Terry Grange, the then chief constable of Dyfed-Powys Police who used his corporate credit card to pay for meals with his mistress and exchanged politically insensitive and sexually explicit emails with her via the force computer system. In 2008, the Independent Police Complaints Commission upheld the allegations it investigated. Mr Grange did not face disciplinary action because he had already retired. In October 2012 Sean Price, of Cleveland Police, was the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years for gross misconduct after he lied to the police watchdog and ordered a member of staff to do the same. Experts commissioned by the College of Policing, a professional body for police in England and Wales, studied misconduct investigations triggered by complaints about professional conduct made by spouses or partners when the relationship collapsed. Other cases studied included internal probes over expenses incurred while officers conducted affairs, and inappropriate and potentially predatory sexual conduct towards junior colleagues. The study carried out by the College of Policing was described as the first step towards understanding how police leaders can get drawn into misconduct . Police chiefs were also investigated for misconduct over pay, perks, hospitality, travel and expenses, racism, sexism, dishonesty and abuses of their force’s recruitment and procurement processes. One senior officer was given an executive car fitted with blue lights and sirens, even though not trained to use it, because emergency vehicles received tax breaks. The report found: ‘It was clear in a number of cases that there were factors specific to particular chief officers that appeared to be relevant to their behaviour. [They had] individual weaknesses that were regarded as risk factors. Some [interviewees] suggested that arrogance is a corollary of decisiveness, which is considered a desirable and necessary attribute in chief officers.’ The academics, who interviewed nearly 40 senior police officers and investigators, found that despite cuts of millions of pounds from police budgets, senior officers retained a culture of entitlement towards taxpayer-funded perks. It said: ‘Some chief officers tended to see themselves as being more akin to “captains of industry” than public servants – with all the entitlements and privileges that came with the CEO role. ‘Several interviewees described a ‘‘culture of entitlement” at chief officer level. A culture of entitlement among some leaders had become ingrained to an extent that rendered it impervious to the changing ethical landscape associated with austerity.’ Sean Price, former chief constable of Cleveland Police, left, and Grahame Maxwell, former chief constable of North Yorkshire Police, right, were at the centre of misconduct investigations . The College of Policing has a number of offices including one in London, on the 11th floor of this building . It found chief officers operated in a ‘distinctive environment that presents considerable risks, pressures and temptations’. They were powerful police officers, who were often isolated and unchallenged by less senior officers. Part of the problem was that challenging a senior officer’s judgement was ‘widely considered to be career-limiting’. But the report said there were encouraging signs police chiefs were shifting to more inclusive and open leadership styles, which was less likely to lead to corruption within forces.","College of Policing publishes report on chief officer misconduct .

"A Maine ski resort where seven people were injured over the weekend after a ski lift suddenly moved backwards has said a malfunctioning gearbox and backup brake system were to blame. Three people were taken to hospital after the King Pine lift, carrying around 230 people, began operating in reverse at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort in Carrabassett Valley on Saturday morning and riders began jumping off. None of the injuries are life-threatening. On Sunday, the resort said a preliminary investigation found that a gearbox on the lift malfunctioned and disabled two brake systems, while a third backup brake also failed to deploy properly. A lift attendant pulled an emergency brake to stop it after chairs slid back about 450 feet, Sugarloaf spokesman Ethan Austin said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Wounded: Seven people (some of whom are pictured above) were injured after a chair lift at a Maine ski resort malfunctioned and started traveling down the mountain backward on Saturday . The lift had passed its annual state inspection and a dynamic load test that's required every seven years last fall, Austin said, while the gearbox passed a routine procedure that identifies potential problems on Friday. The resort said the investigation is ongoing and the lift remains closed. Riders who were still on-board when the lift eventually stopped were evacuated. Two of the three injured skiers transported to a hospital 40 miles have since been treated and released, while the third was transported to another hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said. The condition of the third skier was not known, but the resort said the injuries were not believed to be life threatening. On Saturday afternoon, David Segre, who was standing in the crowded lift line, described the terrifying moment the machine started traveling backward, picking up speed by the second. Evacuation: Three people were taken to hospital after the King Pine lift began operating in reverse at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort in Carrabassett Valley. Above, a skier is evacuated from the lift after it stopped . Team effort: None of the seven  are thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries, a resort spokesman said . 'It was really scary. It was like a gear had let loose and it was slowly picking up speed going the wrong way. So all the chairs... they were slipping backward,' said the 42-year-old skier. 'And as gravity works they started to go faster and faster and people were jumping off at the lower levels,' he added, estimating that the lift traveled backward for up to 300 yards before stopping. Susan Haws Clifford, who was on the lift with her daughter, told WMTW News 8 that it 'started heading backwards really fast', adding: 'We were able to unbind our skis and jump off uninjured.' But while some skiers close to the ground leaped off the lift, one man who was not able to ended up going around the loading area and heading up the mountain on the other side, Segre said. It is unclear whether the injured riders jumped off the lift, or fell off due to its erratic movements. Scene: People can be seen stuck on the lift after it stopped when a worker pulled an emergency brake . The seven were treated by ski patrol and taken off the mountain for treatment by an emergency medical responder, Austin said. Three of the riders were later transferred to a nearby hospital. Segre told AP it looked like three or four people were being tended to in the loading area of the lift, adding: 'I think everybody was being very careful not to move them until ski patrol arrived.' On Saturday afternoon, photos and videos emerged on social media showing terrified riders, who were stranded meters high up in the air, being evacuated from the malfunctioning lift via ropes. Officials have said the cause of the accident is under investigation. The chairlift, which can transport 2,100 skiers an hour on 122 chairs, receives routine daily inspections for safety, Austin said. It remains closed in the wake of the incident, according to ABC 9. Sugarloaf was the site of another chairlift accident in 2010 in which a 35-year-old lift derailed, causing five chairs to fall to the ground, injuring eight skiers. That lift was replaced in 2011 .

Famous: The U.S. Alpine Championships are due to take place at the famous ski resort (pictured) in a few days . One of the passengers injured in the 2010 accident, Rick Tonge, said this latest incident highlighted the need for the lifts to be looked at more closely. 'It's got to bring it to people's attention that something's got to be done,' Tonge said. 'This is an old mountain. It's been around a long time.' He added that he worries that the resort has been slow to upgrade aging equipment. 'They have plans in the works to replace lifts. There have been plans right along. But they're late,' he said. The latest incident comes just days before the U.S. Alpine Championships are scheduled to take place at the world-famous ski resort. It will be the fifth time Sugarloaf has hosted the event.","Chair lift at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort malfunctioned on Saturday and began traveling down  mountain backward, prompting riders to jump off .

"A report has been reportedly been released that hints at a hostile workplace for women in the Victorian Liberal Party. The internal report is believed to show that some women have been asked inappropriate questions about their marital status and had been discouraged from seeking leadership positions. SBS reported that Upper House MP Inga Peulich, for one, believes she was was subjected to bullying and cyber bullying from within her own party. Victorian Liberal MP Inga Peulich claims she was bullied by members of her own party . Upper House Mary Wooldridge admits that the the party has lost female voters which is perhaps due to the inappropriate treatment of women during the preselection process and also workplace bullying . The internal Liberal Party report apparently found that, during preselection, only female candidates were asked questions about their family and personal life. The report outlines the Liberal Party's unprofessional questions toward women about their personal lives during the preselection process . 'How were they going to balance family and political life?' and 'Who would cook the meals?' were some of the questions asked according to the report. It also mentioned a number of occasions that 'involved party members in limited areas engaging in intimidation, threatening and bullying behaviours towards female party members and members of Parliament,' The Age reported. The report made 14 recommendations, including stepping up general participation of women and increasing the number of females in the party. Upper house Mary Wooldridge reportedly noted that the Liberal party has lost female voters. 'We've gone from a party where women clearly vote for us, to one where they clearly do not,' she said. The internal report also suggested that a women's network be created to boost morale and allow Liberal women to connect to each other and questioned the need for spouses to be included in the preselection process.

"Most afternoons I can be found huffing and puffing my way up Primrose Hill in North London, pushing what feels like the world's heaviest baby in a buggy. The view of the city from the top is spectacular but for a few precious days I swapped it for an even better one - with the magnificent backdrop of the Italian Dolomites. After a two-hour car journey from Innsbruck we were greeted at Rosa Alpina - a five-star, family-owned hotel and spa tucked in a valley in the tiny village of San Cassiano - with a local speciality: a sweet and comforting hot apple juice. Rosa Alpina - a five-star, family-owned hotel and spa is tucked in a valley in the tiny village of San Cassiano . In the sunshine, the village looked pristine, with pretty wooden chalets stacked against mountain pastures which would have been snow-covered in winter but were now a vivid green. The grass was impossibly neat and as I wondered how many cows it must take to maintain, I spotted sit-on mowers weaving up and down the slopes. Completing the alpine scene was a hefty-looking herd with jangling cowbells. Having picked out a buggy from the hotel lobby, with map in hand we set off on a mountain walk but took the lazy way up - in a cable car. As the cable car lurched, my four month-old daughter Romilly wobbled in my lap, lip trembling; looking back down the mountain and up to the peak seemed a long way off. I began to doubt my fitness for what was my first post-baby trip away - billed as a Yummy Mummy healthy strolling break. I had feared craggy paths at the summit, precariously winding round the mountain, but found gentle, undulating trails. There was a restaurant, playground, park and fountain. It was as family friendly as the nursery department at John Lewis. Families and groups were starting out or finishing walks, with children in backpacks and buggies, or just jogging alongside their parents, perfectly content without a gadget in sight. Some were Nordic walking, others speed hiking. Would this sort of family outing happen back home? Not likely and what a shame. The views were awesome and the air so pure I took in great gulps in the hope it might benefit my London-worn lungs. We could have easily taken a different trail each day of the week. Rosa Alpina boasts St Hubertus, a stunning Michelin-starred restaurant, where chef Norbert Niederkofler uses seasonal vegetables - so no tomatoes in winter . At one hilltop restaurant, deckchairs overlooked the spectacular view like a sort of mountain beach, and children played on swings. For a different view of the mountains, the larch trail runs through meadows and up into the mountains opposite the hotel. It makes for a wonderful outing for energetic children (and their parents) and Rosa Alpina has produced a brilliant educational booklet which encourages little ones to look out for flora and fauna, plus answer questions on their surroundings. Tucked up inside at Rosa Alpina, the rooms were wonderfully warm - all sweet-smelling pine and herringbone fabrics - but come dusk it was far too tempting to resist lighting the wood fire. Perhaps it was the mountain air, but bedtime passed without a murmur from Romilly, who was spoilt with a beautifully made-up cot and goodie bag including baby slippers, towelling robe and a cuddly bear. Adults get treats too - of the culinary variety. Rosa Alpina boasts St Hubertus, a stunning Michelin-starred restaurant, where chef Norbert Niederkofler uses seasonal vegetables (no tomatoes in winter) and 90 per cent local produce. Romilly and Sarah sank into a neat routine: a walk after breakfast, a swim after lunch . Romilly and I sank into a neat routine: a walk after breakfast, a swim after lunch. The peace was enough to move me to tears. For my daughter to experience so little intrusive sound apart from cockerels, cowbells and church bells was bliss. My ideal partner (apart from my partner) on the trip would have been my mother. The walks here are challenging enough to invigorate but easy enough to be a comfortable, Clare Balding-type ramble. I began to wonder if Romilly would grow up craving a life of outdoor activities, of escaping and exploring. As a quote from Fred Astaire painted on the wall of the pool said: 'Old age is like everything else - to have success in it you have to start young.' GETTING THERE .

"It could be days before Australian Tahnia Cook hears from her husband, Cameron, who was caught up in a devastating cyclone, which has wiped out villages in Vanuatu. At least eight people have been confirmed dead after Cyclone Pam hit the 80-island-strong archipelago, with winds of up to 270km/h and causing heavy flooding, landslides, and mass destruction of buildings.

She said it had been a terrible few days for her as she awaits news of her husband. 'It's looking to be a couple of days [before I hear from him],' Ms Cook said.

"A Florida man was hospitalized after he crashed his remote-controlled plane this morning. The unidentified man was flying the radio-controlled jet as part of the Florida Jets RC Air Show in Lakeland in Polk County. It crashed into Paradise Field near the runway at Linder Regional Airport. The remote-controlled jet that crashed on Friday in Lakeland, Florida, is 'similar to one of these in size' The jet crashed into Paradise Field at Linder Regional Airport during the Florida Jets RC Air Show this morning . Fog stopped the man from going to Tampa General Hospital so he was was taken to Lakeland Regional Hospital . The man suffered non-life threatening injuries, but was severely burned during the crash, according to 10 News. When the aerial enthusiast's three-foot, $20,000 plane crashed near him, some of its fuel sprayed out and caused the burns. Polk Fire Rescue originally wanted to fly the injured man to Tampa General Hospital, but there was too much fog for the medical chopper to navigate. The man was taken to Lakeland Regional Hospital instead. Although the accident was originally reported as an actual plane crash, that notion was dispelled. The Florida Jets Air Show is not a competition, but more of a 'fly-In, or Jet-Together', according to its Facebook page from last year. The page reads: 'Florida Jets is one of the most exciting R/C Aviation events on the planet. 'FJ features the ultimate technology in airframe construction and power plant, and has the highest level of pilot proficiency of any radio control model aviation discipline.' The Florida Jets Air Show is not a competition, but more of a 'fly-In, or Jet-Together', according to Facebook . There were some initial reports that a plane had crashed, but Sgt Gross quickly cleared up the confusion . Although this mishap might seem out of the ordinary, it is more common than you might think. Remote-controlled planes crash frequently enough that there is a webpage about it. The No. 1 cause of remote control plane crashes is pilot error, according to R/C Airplane World. According to the site: 'Either the pilot is flying beyond his or her abilities, or flying a plane that's too advanced or simply unsuitable for his/her level of experience. 'Or perhaps they make a genuine mistake because of, say, disorientation - even experienced rc pilots make the wrong stick movements sometimes! 'Equipment failure is another reason. In fact pilot error is commonly disguised as equipment failure! 'Flying surface or control surface failure can also be the guilty culprit in bringing down our planes, especially if the builder did a less than satisfactory job on the hinges! 'Prevention is better than cure, but sadly it takes a crash to figure out what went wrong and hopefully prevent it happening again in the future.'","Plane was part of the Florida Jets RC Air Show in Lakeland in Polk County .

"A pair of car thieves who stole £110,000 worth of Range Rovers in a sophisticated scam targeting sellers on Autotrader  have been jailed. Nathan Bates, 27, and Liaquat Ali, 29, were part of a cunning gang who would turn up at addresses of people advertising their vehicles on the classified motoring website and secretly clone their car keys, a court heard. They would then return later on to steal the luxury cars. The duo and accomplice Michael Griffiths, 31, targeted their first victim on November 3, 2013 when a Range Rover Sport worth £36,500 was stolen from an address in Redditch, Worcestershire. Nathan Bates (left) and Liaquat Ali (right) were part of a criminal gang who stole £110,000 of Range Rovers . Then on November 24, another Range Rover Sport, worth £45,000, was driven off in Leicester. It has never been recovered. Just four days later, the gang stole a Range Rover Evoque, worth £30,000, from Surrey. But the crooks ended up dumping the car in a layby on the M40 near Wheatley, Oxfordshire - when Griffiths disappeared. Griffiths' body was later discovered in the River Thame on December 24 after a police appeal for his whereabouts. Despite their missing friend, Ali and Bates targeted another address in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, on December 1 and tried to steal another Evoque. But they were foiled when the owner realised the pair had tampered with the diagnostics of the car, which was worth £28,500, and that his key fob no longer worked. The pair were arrested that month and linked to the thefts and attempted theft of the four vehicles - worth a total of £140,000. The pair who would turn up at addresses of sellers on Autotrader and secretly clone their car keys before returning to steal the vehicles . And yesterday Bates and Ali were jailed at Birmingham Crown Court and received lengthy driving bans. Ali, from Hall Green, Birmingham, was jailed for three and a half years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to steal, theft of a motor vehicle and failing to surrender to custody. He was banned from driving for four years. Bates, from Shard End, Birmingham, was jailed for 15 months after admitting conspiracy to steal and was banned from the road for 18 months. Sentencing them, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said: 'This was significant professional crime. It involved calculated and technically astute pre-planning and professionally carried out thefts or attempted thefts of high value motor vehicles. 'They were offences of pure and unadulterated greed. Ali you were centrally involved in this. I accept there were other people but you were the man on the ground, organising and carrying out this sophisticated and carefully planned theft.' The duo  stole £110,000 worth of Range Rovers, including a Range Rover Sport (file picture, right) worth £36,500 from Redditch, and a Range Rover Evoque (file picture, left) worth £30,000, from Surrey  - when Griffiths disappeared . Joseph Keating, defending for Bates, said: 'The loss of Mr Griffiths is something that he has really been affected by. 'He understands that had it not been for his involvement in this enterprise it is very likely Mr Griffiths would still be here with us today.. That is a burden he has on his shoulders.' Ali pleaded guilty to all four thefts, but Bates admitted the Redditch, Leicester and Surrey offences. Ali and Bates used classified website Autotrader to track down their potential victims. The men would pose as interested buyers and tell the householder they needed to check the car for faults. They then inserted an electronic device into the vehicle’s on-board diagnostic slot to supposedly check the vehicle's history or mileage. In fact, it was a tool - used by locksmiths to re-programme car keys. The thieves would then clone the keys and return later while the owner was asleep or at work and steal the car. Police had issued an appeal for the 'missing man' in December 2013 and, after appealing for sightings in the Oxford area, Griffiths' body was pulled out of the river. After the sentencing, detective constable Rob Clarke from West Midlands Police said: 'Ali never wanted to be caught with the stolen vehicles and would pay Bates to take the risk of driving them away once they had been stolen from the victim's home address. 'Ali thought that he was above the law but a combination of information from the public and thorough checks by our intelligence analysts led to his downfall. 'Unfortunately, this is not a new method used by criminals and there were around 1,234 'keyless' car thefts between April and December last year. 'We are working hard to reduce these thefts by regularly stopping high value cars to check they are not stolen and advising legitimate owners of the steps they can take to protect their vehicle. 'However, I would like to take this opportunity to remind car sellers that if anyone comes to see your vehicle and asks to plug something into it then don't let them. There is no need for them to do this and any checks they want to do should be carried out at a garage.'","Nathan Bates and Liaquat Ali were part of a gang targeting Range Rovers .

"'The failure to detect a fracture on an X-ray is the most common diagnostic error made in A&E,' says Michael Kelly, an orthopaedic trauma surgeon . Shirley Johnstone had mixed feelings when the A&E doctor said the X-ray of her elbow showed no sign of a fracture. ‘It was a relief there was no serious damage. But I was in agony — I couldn’t move or straighten my arm, and felt I needed more than just paracetamol and a few days off work,’ recalls Shirley, 60, a chef from Great Wakering in Essex. The pain had begun suddenly when she stretched up to adjust a showerhead. ‘At first I thought I’d slept on my arm badly,’ she says. ‘But it was so painful, my partner advised me to get it checked.’ Six days after she was seen at A&E, Shirley received a phone call from the hospital. Doctors had reviewed the X-ray and there was a fracture after all, in the olecranon, the protruding bone that forms the tip of the elbow. It was a mistake that, four years on, is still affecting Shirley’s life. For a second X-ray showed that the fractured bone fragments had moved 4mm in the intervening days. Her arm was put in a cast, then a week later she had surgery to pin the bone in place. But a year after the operation she developed a painful infection because fluid had built up around the fracture. And three years later she still gets pain in the joint, especially in cold weather. ‘I had to have so much time off work, I was demoted and put on a lower wage,’ she says. ‘I’ve never got back on track.’ Shirley has never had a proper explanation for the delay in spotting the fracture. ‘One doctor told me, “I’m afraid sometimes these things get missed”,’ she says. Every year one person in 100 in the UK breaks a bone, and about half the 20 million or so visits to A&E involve having an X-ray, mostly to check for bone injury. But research suggests that thousands of patients walk out of A&E with doctors having failed to spot their fracture. ‘Numerous studies have shown that failure to detect a fracture on an X-ray is the most common diagnostic error made in A&E,’ says Michael Kelly, consultant orthopaedic trauma surgeon at North Bristol NHS Trust. And if a broken bone is not stabilised quickly, the impact can be devastating. ‘At the very least, people suffer prolonged pain and inconvenience,’ says Mr Kelly, ‘but it can also lead to ‘chronic functional limitation with long-term pain, early symptoms of osteoarthritis or a stiff joint.’ The bone may also fail to fuse and need complex surgery later. So why does it happen? Ordering the correct X-ray, then detecting an abnormality on the image takes skill and experience. Yet A&E patients are most likely to be seen by junior doctors, with new doctors ‘fresh from medical school being the most senior staff working at evenings and weekends in one in five A&E departments’, according to a study by the College of Emergency Medicine. ‘You can identify a major fracture of a large long bone across the room,’ says Mr Kelly. ‘But more subtle injuries require a systematic approach that comes with experience.’ About half the 20 million or so visits to A&E involve having an X-ray, mostly to check for bone injury . A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2002 showed that junior doctors in A&E miss up to 39 per cent of ‘clinically significant abnormalities’ on X-rays. This is why many, but not all, hospitals have introduced a safety net: all X-rays should be reviewed by a specialist — either a radiologist (a clinician specialising in interpreting scan images) or a specially trained radiographer, whose main job is taking X-rays. This can make a big difference. A study at North Tyneside General found that people whose fractures were reviewed only by an A&E doctor were ten times more likely to be wrongly given the all-clear. And patients whose X-rays were checked by a specialist before they left A&E were three times less likely to have a missed fracture, according to a 2013 study by the University of Bradford School of Health Studies. However, there is currently no time-based target for specialist reviews, which can be postponed for weeks. A recent audit of missed fractures and abnormalities at one London hospital revealed that, at worst, it took 48 days before X-rays were reviewed. Meanwhile, a survey of a quarter of NHS radiology departments last year revealed it had taken more than 30 days before over 80,000 X-rays were reviewed by a radiologist. ‘This suggests that nationally about 300,000 patients are waiting more than a month for their X-rays to be analysed,’ says Dr Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists. This means the NHS also picks up a substantial bill for surgery and other treatments that would have been avoided if fractures were detected earlier. Yet observers have noted an increase in missed fractures. Rebecca Campbell, a clinical negligence solicitor at Slater and Gordon, says the firm has seen a rise in cases of patients misdiagnosed with sprains and soft-tissue injuries, only to be later diagnosed with fractures that could be clearly seen in the first radiology images. ‘As a result, the patients have had a delay in treatment, often resulting in the fractures becoming worse,’ she says. Certain types of fractures are more susceptible to being missed in X-rays . Certain types of fractures are more susceptible to being missed. ‘Hairline fractures, where the bone is broken but not misaligned, appear as a fine line on an X-ray which can be overlooked,’ says Dr Adrian Boyle, emergency medicine consultant at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, in Cambridge. ‘Or the bone may be hidden — this commonly happens with fractures to the scaphoid bone, one of the smallest in the wrist and the one most likely to break.’ Guidelines issued by the College of Emergency Medicine recommend that patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture and tenderness in the wrist area should be offered a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan even if the X-ray comes back clear. This year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is due to issue wider guidelines on the diagnosis of fractures in emergency departments. Like Shirley Johnstone, Jacqui Hunt suffered after a fracture was missed in A&E. The former nurse, now 57, broke her wrist after tripping on the steps of her London home in August 2013. At A&E she was told that the X-ray showed a broken bone in her right wrist, and her arm was put in a cast. ‘I went home expecting it to gradually get better but it didn’t,’ she says. ‘I was in such agony I couldn’t even brush my hair.’ Two months later, when the cast was removed, a further X-ray showed a second fracture — she had also broken the ulna bone (which enables the wrist to rotate), but it had been missed. She needed specialist surgery and she was put on a waiting list for several months. While she was still recovering, Jacqui lost her job. People who walk out of surgery with an undiagnosed fracture may not seem obvious victims, but their lives can still be blighted, says Richard Evans, chief executive of the Society of Radiographers. ‘We should be working towards a system where every patient has his or her X-ray reviewed before being discharged from A&E. The evidence shows how powerful this would be. ‘If a medication had the kind of impact this simple change in procedure has, every hospital in the country would have to provide it.’","For Shirley Johnstone, a fracture of her elbow that was missed is still affecting her life .

"A carer who was caught on camera stealing money from a vulnerable pensioner's purse has been jailed. Sheryvone Brooks, 20, was filmed taking £30 from 85-year-old Evelyn Nicholson after her suspicious employers installed a recording device in the elderly woman's home in Stourbridge, West Midlands. A camera - hidden between an ornamental teapot and a box of water filters after the pensioner's money started going missing in December last year - captured crystal-clear footage of Brooks removing the purse from a kitchen drawer before taking out and pocketing the cash. Sheryvone Brooks was filmed taking £30 out of Evelyn Nicholson's purse after the elderly woman's family installed a camera when they noticed money going missing from her home . A camera - hidden between an ornamental teapot and a box of water filters after the pensioner's home after money started going missing in December last year - captured crystal-clear footage . The footage shows Mrs Nicholas sitting in a chair with a cup of tea next to the drawers at her home. It then cuts to Brooks, who was 19 at the time, perched in the same chair and captures the moment she takes a look to see if he OAP is watching before quickly opening the drawer. She then calmly takes out a red purse and stands up before pinching cash and stuffing it in her tracksuit pocket. Brooks, of Sedgley, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to one count of theft at Dudley Magistrates Court on February 19. She wept in the dock as she was sentenced to 26 weeks in a Young Offenders' Institute at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Judge Martin Walsh told her: 'You're 20-years-old and fall to be sentenced for what was a mean and despicable offence of theft arriving out of a gross breach of trust. 'You, whilst inside her home address, stole £30 from her purse. 'The aggravating feature here is not the value of property, it's the nature of the relationship between you and the elderly person whom you were responsible for providing care for. The footage shows Mrs Nicholas sitting in a chair with a cup of tea next to the drawers at her home. It then cuts to Brooks, who was 19 at the time, perched in the same chair and captures the moment she takes a look to see if he OAP is watching before quickly opening the drawer . She calmly takes out a red purse and stands up before pinching cash and stuffing it in her tracksuit pocket . 'The sentence is designed not only to punish you, it's also essential that other members of the profession which you are a part of understands that offences of this sort committed against vulnerable and elderly people in their home will result in an immediate prison sentence. 'It is a deterrent to others.' The court heard the pensioner's family became suspicious when money began going missing in December last year. Prosecutor Geoffrey Dann said Brooks admitted the offence to officers and said she had stolen the money in order to buy Christmas presents. Mr Dann added: 'Mrs Nicholson is 85-years-old. She lives alone and she is under the care of Gateway Health and Social Care. 'The defendant was one of the carers who visited Mrs Nicholson's home on a regular basis. 'Mrs Nicholson's family ensured that she had cash and she had some money in a purse which was kept in a drawer in the kitchen. 'They noticed that money seemed to go missing. They asked Mrs Nicholson if she had given it to anyone and she hadn't. 'On January 6 the company installed a camera with the family's permission. 'The defendant attended the address on that day and she can be seen to go to the drawer, to open the drawer and take out the purse. 'The defendant was spoken to by the deputy manager and she admitted she had stolen the money. 'She was interviewed by the police on January 15 and said she she needed the money for Christmas gifts. 'She showed remorse for her actions and wanted to pay the money back. The court heard the retired farm worker, who has 11 children, 16 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and 11 great-great-grandchildren, fell ill as a result of the theft . 'Mrs Nicholson's son says in his statement this offence has made his mother very ill. 'The doctor has attended her twice since the theft, it has left her feeling very vulnerable.' Jason Aris, defending, said Brooks had faced 'embarrassment and shame' as a result of the CCTV footage of her theft being placed online. He added: 'She has shown considerable insight into her offending behaviour. 'She identified that her actions would have left the victim feeling vulnerable in her own house. 'The CCTV footage that captures her taken the money has ended up online. This has given her a certain sense of notoriety that she didn't seek to achieve. 'This has compounded her embarrassment and shame and family and friends across the other side of the country have learned about her escapades. 'By engaging in this stupid and thoughtless behaviour, she has pretty much ensured that any possibility of work in the future is going to be difficult for her. Brooks, of Sedgley, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to one count of theft at Dudley Magistrates Court on February 19 . She is filmed opening the drawer after looking around the room to see if anyone is watching her . 'She certainly won't be working in the care industry in the near future. 'The remorse that has been expressed by her is genuine. She has described the shame as all consuming.' Speaking outside court after the hearing, Mrs Nicholson's eldest son Robert Smith, 65 said around £200 had gone missing from his mother's purse in total. He said the retired farm worker, who has 11 children, 16 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and 11 great-great-grandchildren, fell ill as a result of the theft. Mr Smith, who works as a courier, added: 'I'm pleased with the sentence, I was hoping she was going to go down. 'She was one of the primary carers and had been going in to my mother for six months. 'I knew it was a carer, they were the only people who could have taken the money out of the drawer, but I didn't know who it was. 'My mother was devastated and it has affected her health. 'She knows one of the carers has stolen from her but she wouldn't be able to tell you which one, we have tried to keep it away from her. 'She had to go into respite for a couple of weeks because it really upset her but she is back home now and she is settling back down. 'She can't walk, she can't stand without the assistance of the carers. 'She loves the carers and with their assistance that allows her to stop at home which is what she wants.' A spokesman for Gateway Health and Social Care Dudley confirmed Brooks had been dismissed.","Sheryvone Brooks was filmed stealing from Evelyn Nicholson's home .

"A federal appeals court has given new life to a Holocaust survivor's claim that the University of Oklahoma is unjustly harboring a Camille Pissarro painting that the Nazis stole from her father during World War II. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan has directed a lower-court judge to consider whether the lawsuit she threw out should be transferred to Oklahoma, saying she has authority to do so. The court's order on Thursday came as the school found itself amid a racial controversy after video of fraternity students engaged in a racist chant spread across the Internet. Dr. Leone-Noelle Meyer maintained she is entitled to Pissarro's 1886 'Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep' because it belonged to her father when it was taken by the Nazis as Germany moved across France . University President David Boren ordered a fraternity house closed and expelled two of its members after reviewing clips of the chant that referenced lynching and said blacks would never be allowed in the fraternity. The school and Boren are defendants in the lawsuit brought in 2013 by 75-year-old Holocaust survivor Leone Meyer, who lives in Paris. She maintained she is entitled to Pissarro's 1886 'Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep' because it belonged to her father when it was taken by the Nazis as Germany moved across France. Her father, Raoul Mayer, died in 1970. Swiss records show Meyer's father in Paris had owned the painting. But a Swiss court ruled that the painting's post-war owners had properly established ownership and rejected her claim. Bequeathed to OU by Clara Weitzenhoffer, the wife of oil tycoon Aaron Weitzenhoffer, the school displayed it publicly for over a decade. The painting: Swiss records show Leone-Noelle Meyer's father in Paris had owned the painting 'Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep' by Camille Pissaro . Disputed item: This Monday, May 12, 2014 photo shows a display of information on the 1886 painting 'Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep' by Camille Pissarro . The Weitzenhoffers bought the painting from a New York gallery in 1956. When she died in 2000, she donated more than 30 works worth about $50 million to the University of Oklahoma. In an emailed statement Saturday, Oklahoma University spokeswoman Catherine F. Bishop said: 'The University is continuing its efforts to work with the plaintiffs to determine all the facts in this matter, some of which may still be unknown, and to seek a mutually agreeable resolution.' Last year, Boren defended Oklahoma University's ownership, saying the school does not want to keep any items it does not legitimately own but also wants to avoid a bad precedent by automatically giving away gifts it receives to anyone who claims them. Boren and the school have opposed the lawsuit on largely procedural grounds, saying the school has sovereign immunity and that Meyer was not diligent in pursuing her claim and had sued in New York rather than Oklahoma as a 'forum shopping strategy' to avoid Oklahoma's more restrictive statute of limitations. Several Oklahoma lawmakers who authored a resolution in the state Legislature seeking to force the school to turn the painting over have spoken out against the university's position. In a letter to the people of Oklahoma, Meyer has said her quest 'has nothing to do with money. It is about justice and a duty to remember.' Pierre Ciric, a lawyer for Meyer, said Saturday he welcomed 'any progress toward the resolution of our client's claim.' 'It appears that everyone involved with this case agrees that `La Bergere' was the property of my client's father prior to the Nazi occupation of France, which we have asserted since the complaint was filed,' he said.

"Police in Chicago have launched a murder investigation after a 98-year-old former nurse was found to have died of morphine and hydrocodone toxicity while living in a care home. The Cook County medical examiner has investigated three suspicious deaths at the Holland Home in South Holland, Chicago. Six residents at the care home were all hospitalised on February 3 with former nurse Dorothy Byrd, 98, Robert Rundin, 88, and 98-year-old Leon Krynicki all dying. Former nurse Dorothy Byrd, pictured, died from an overdose of morphine and Hydrocodone in February . Frank Shuftan of the Cook County Medical Examiner's office said Mrs Byrd's death was caused by morphine and hydrocodone toxicity, combined with hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. An autopsy performed immediately after Mrs Byrd's death was inconclusive but further toxicology tests discovered a fatal dose of painkillers in her system. Mrs Byrd's daughter Sandra Peterson said she cannot understand why anyone would want to kill her mother, who was a former nurse. She told Fox Chicago: 'There aren't words that adequately describe the shock and the horror and just the inability to comprehend the who, what, why just many many questions . Mrs Byrd, pictured, was one of six patients to fall ill in February at the Chicago nursing home . 'She loved sweets and so on that day I brought her a couple of slices of cake and some cookies and she just sat there eating it and enjoying it and I left saying I'll see you tomorrow.' Ms Peterson said her mother died the following day despite seeming in good form during her visit. The family's lawyer Tom Paris said: 'She has taught nurses, she's been a nurse to nurses, she has been a nurse to thousands of patients. Ultimately Dorothy Byrd was betrayed by a nurse.' According to Mr Paris, the nurse on duty at the time of the deaths has been suspended as have two nursing assistants. Emergency services were called to the nursing home on the morning of February 3 when six patients fell ill. Investigators are preforming further tests on Mr Rundin's body who died on March 7, more than a month after he fell ill. David Mills, chief operating officer of Villa Healthcare who run the Holland Home confirmed they are helping authorities with their investigation.

"A police officer told the Hillsborough inquest if a big gate had not been opened to relieve the crush at the turnstiles, ‘we would have been dealing with bodies outside the ground’. John Morgan, a South Yorkshire Police sergeant on duty  on the day of the football disaster, also said he would have opened the gates himself if more senior officers had not given the order. Some 96 Liverpool fans died after a crush on the Leppings Lane terrace of Sheffield’s Hillsborough ground as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest kicked off on April 15, 1989. Scroll down for video . Evidence: John Morgan (pictured today in a court sketch), a police sergeant on duty on the day of the football disaster, also said he would have opened the gates himself if more senior officers had not given the order . Around 2,000 fans entered the ground when match commander Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield ordered Gate C at the Leppings Lane end to be opened at 2.52pm. But many fans headed straight for the tunnel under the seated upper stand and leading directly to the already-packed central pens of the terrace behind the goal. The tunnel was not closed off by police beforehand and the numbers of fans in each pen was not restricted - with police and club officials having a policy of allowing supporters to ‘find their own level’ by distributing themselves along the terraces. In the run-up to kick-off Mr Morgan was in charge of a serial of officers inside the ground at the Leppings Lane end when a massive crowd built up at the turnstiles with those at the front being crushed and ‘screaming for help’. He said: ‘I just could not understand what I was seeing because it was unprecedented. What I would say, I froze, in fact I was gobsmacked. It was an alarming situation. ‘One guy I remember getting hold of my anorak and saying, “Do something, people are getting crushed, open the gates”.’ Shocking incident: Some 96 Liverpool fans died after a crush on the Leppings Lane terrace of Sheffield’s Hillsborough ground as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest kicked off on April 15, 1989 . Mr Morgan went outside and with other officers managed to pull some fans out of the crush amidst an ‘aura of menace’ and ‘alarm’ due to the numbers and the crushing. ‘I thought people were going to die. There was imminent danger,’ he added. Mr Morgan said he had ‘formed an intention’ to open the gates to relieve the pressure but would have first had to get permission from more senior officers first. Later he made a statement, saying if Gate C had not been opened, ‘we would have been dealing with bodies outside the ground’. He said he ‘assumed’ there would be a controlled opening of the gates to allow fans to filter into the ground, but was left surprised when Gate C was ‘flung open wide’ at 2.52pm. A police officer stands outside Hillsborough as jurors on the inquest into the fans' deaths visit the stadium . The former officer told the jury: ‘At that stage, that took me by complete surprise and I’m forced through the gates and I turn around in mid-stream and try to force my way back outside. 'I thought I was going to be trampled under the press behind me.’ Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquest, asked Mr Morgan if he had himself instructed stewards to open the gates - a suggestion dismissed by the witness. Ms Lambert continued: ‘Why are you confident you did not give the instruction?’ Mr Morgan replied: ‘Because I can’t remember it. It’s not within my memory, that I knocked on that door and spoke to anybody. I just did not do it. I don’t think I had the rank to be able to issue that order.’ Liverpool football fans pay their respects to the dead at Anfield Stadium two days after the disaster in 1989 . He said there was ‘every possibility’ Gate C was opened at 2.52pm on the orders of Mr Duckenfield. After the gate was opened Mr Morgan went to help other fans outside then he heard a call on his police radio calling for help with a pitch invasion. But he was left ‘shocked’ when he got to the scene with fellow officers, ‘standing in disbelief’, in front of the Leppings Lane pens with fans crushed against the perimeter fence. Mr Morgan then went to the back of the stand through the tunnel to get fans off the terrace to relieve pressure at the front. Ex-chief superintendent Mr Duckenfield will give evidence to the inquests, in Warrington, tomorrow.

"His legacy is everywhere on this glorious island. From roads and agriculture to the design of the local flag, Napoleon Bonaparte transformed Elba when he was banished here in 1814. Famously, he didn't stay for long. It was 200 years ago that he escaped, bound for Waterloo and on to a more permanent exile in St Helena. But the locals still revere the celebrity prisoner who, for just under a year, was formally recognised as the King of Elba. Inviting: The pretty harbour of Portoferraio in Elba, an island which lies just 12 miles off the coast of Tuscany . In this anniversary year, there are plenty of pageants and parades in his honour. Yet, as I sit bobbing on the waters below his villa, I can't help thinking that Napoleon must have spent his later years wondering why he ever left. For there is something magical, something other about Elba. Half the size of the Isle of Wight, this fish-shaped island has 3,000ft peaks, coral reefs, beaches of every complexion and Italy's lowest crime rate. Though just 12 miles off the coast of Tuscany, it bears little resemblance to the chi-chi tourist trap of Chiantishire. The vast majority of visitors who make the one-hour ferry crossing from Piombino are ordinary Italians (we don't meet a Briton all week). With a tiny airport, it has been spared major development, and half of its 85 square miles area is national park. Many beaches and bays can be reached only by hiking, biking or, better still, by boat. That is why Elba is perfect for a sailing holiday, whether you are a sailor or not. A comfortable six-bed, 40ft yacht can be a lot cheaper than a hotel or villa. You'd be hard-pushed to find a view to match the one from our deck as we sit back, beer in hand, and watch the sun set behind Monte Capanne. Blissful bobbing: Lovely Porto Azzurro is an ideal place to drop anchor, perfect for pizzas and people-watching . Kent-based Nautilus Yachting has yachts all over the Med and has been organising charters around Elba and the Tuscan archipelago for years. We settle on a Bavaria 40, a popular cruising yacht with a flip-down bathing platform at the back. Little sailors: Robert's children adored life on board . The only question is: who will do the sailing? Nautilus can organise a skipper for £90 a day. But having been messing around in boats since childhood, I want to take charge. You might almost call it a Napoleon complex (my wife does). So I have to go back to school. The basic requirement for renting anything larger than a day boat is the Royal Yachting Association's Day Skipper certificate, within easy reach of the average dinghy sailor. It involves a five-day practical sailing course plus a detailed theory course. You can do the latter online, but you must live aboard for the practical part. Sunsail runs flotillas and courses all over the world, and I join the fleet on the Solent. It proves invaluable; after five days mixing with ferries, container ships and hovercraft in one of Europe's busiest sealanes, I am more than ready to steer a course for Elba. And you don't have to worry about tide in the Tyrrhenian Sea. We pick up the boat at Puntone di Scarlino, a mainland marina 90 minutes by car from Pisa Airport. Cleverly designed, it has three double cabins, two separate shower/loo rooms - plus a shower on deck - and a solar panel for extra power. Setting off in Napoleon's wake, we are swimming off Elba's eastern shores three hours later. I had feared that our three children would soon start moaning - or being sick. But they adore life aboard. We keep the sailing to an hour or two each morning before dropping the anchor in a pretty bay, swimming and exploring in the rubber dinghy (every boat comes with one). I had hoped to spend a night or two on the quayside in a pretty little fishing town such as Marciana Marina on Elba's northern coast, but there's no chance in mid-August (unless you know the harbour master). So we anchor off towns like Porto Azzurro and go ashore for pizzas, ice cream and people-watching, then head back - by torchlight - to our haven, far from the nightlife. Favoured spot: The Gulf of Biodola has a three-mile crescent of sand - as well as Elba's smartest hotel . Elba's capital, Portoferraio, is well worth a visit. Walk through the old town to the ramparts at the top. Napoleon lived up here and his villa is now a popular museum. You don't need to eat on the waterfront; the best local food is to be found in the back streets. A few miles further along the coast, we find our favourite spot, the Gulf of Biodola. This three-mile crescent of sand, where the trees come right down to the water, is home to Elba's smartest hotel, the Hermitage. When Daddy's attempt at spaghetti al pesto results in a thumbs-down followed by a mutiny, we jump in the dinghy and, five minutes later, are at the poolside buffet. More adventurous sailors would, no doubt, sail right around the island, taking in the wild western shores. Some would trek up to the mountain town of Capoliveri or strike out for the other islands in the Tuscan archipelago - or even reach Napoleon's native island of Corsica. Pottering along at our child-friendly pace, we only do half of Elba. And I never do find the place where Napoleon hatched his escape plan. Never mind. It means that, unlike him, we will have to return. British Airways (0844 493 0787; ba.com) flies to Pisa from £82 return. Nautilus Yachting (01732 867 445; nautilusyachting.com) offers seven night yacht charters in the Tuscan Archipelago from £1,149, excluding flights.

"Nearly 300 children under the age of five have been stopped and searched by police over the last five years, it has emerged. Officers across the UK have been condemned for using their powers to stop and search toddlers on suspicion of a host of offences including drug or knife crime, possession of weapons and terrorism. Police said that in nearly all cases, officers had carried out the searches after believing the child had been an innocent party who had been used by adults to conceal drugs, weapons or stolen goods. Officers across the UK have stopped and searched nearly 300 children aged under five on suspicion of a host of offences including drug or knife crime, weapon possession and terrorism in the last five years (file picture) Police can stop and search children under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which states that there is no requirement for an adult to be present during the search of under-10s. Officers from Metropolitan Police, the largest force in Britain, exercised their powers against under-fives the most – but Scotland Yard said it was because children are 'among the most vulnerable in society' and needed 'safeguarding'. One former Met Police officer, who worked at border control at Heathrow Airport, said he believed stop and search powers on children were used only in exceptional circumstances. He said that on one occasion his team had firm intelligence that a couple with a baby were trying to transport drugs into the UK. However, when nothing was found on the two adults, officers decided not to search the child for fear of being condemned. He told The Sunday Times: 'Can you imagine the headlines if we had searched the baby's nappy and found nothing?' In total, Met Police officers in London have stopped and searched a total of 184 children under the age of five over the last five years. Greater Manchester Police was found to be the next prolific at stopping and searching children, with 45 toddlers frisked. While nearly 300 children aged under five have been stopped and searched across the UK during the last five years, a total of 612 children under the age of 10 - below the age of criminal responsibility - have also been searched. Last month, Home Secretary Theresa May announced plans to change the law regarding stop and search powers if police do not halt the 'excessive and inappropriate' use of them. Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) announced plans last month to change the law regarding stop and search powers if police do not halt using them in an 'excessive and inappropriate' manner . Ms May warned officers that she wanted to see a dramatic improvement in figures, which recently revealed that only one in every 10 of the searches ends in arrest. Stop and search has been frequently blamed for inflaming tensions between the public and the police. A recent report by the police watchdog found that more than a quarter of police stop and searches were 'unlawful' and risked promoting 'major disorder'. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary said that, in 27 per cent of cases, police failed to show they had reasonable grounds to carry out the search. Enver Solomon, director of evidence and impact at the National Children's Bureau, told The Sunday Times: 'The police should review how they deal with children and ensure they are always treated as having district separate needs from adults.' Releasing the figures for London, Scotland Yard said the majority of searches on children were to dectect and defer adults using youngsters to conceal weapons or drugs. A spokesman said: 'The stop and search of individuals under 10-years-old represented only 0.02 per cent of total MPS stop and search activity in both 2011/2012 and 2012/2013. 'Children are amongst the most vulnerable members of society. It is therefore vital that the MPS considers how best to safeguard them and promote their welfare in everything we do. 'There are occasions when young children are concerned in crime and anti-social behavour, and it is necessary for officers to undertake searches to allay or confirm suspicions without exercising their powers of arrest. 'Any young child or baby being searched will be as a result of it being suspected that they are in some way the unsuspecting and innocent assistant in a criminal act. 'For example, it has been known for some adult and teenage criminals to operate with babies or young children to conceal their illegal items (e.g. drugs, knives or other weapons) in children's pushchairs or about their person in an attempt to avoid detection. 'Removing illegal articles from children under 10-years-old not only detects crime, it enables officers to ensure the safety and protection of those children and the wider community.'","Nearly 300 children under the age of five stopped and searched across UK .

"The health service is facing scores of claims relating to Jimmy Savile, after almost £60,000 was paid out in relation to the first three cases of people abused by the former DJ . The NHS has paid out £12million to patients sexually abused in hospitals, GP surgeries and dental practices in the last two decades, it can be revealed. More than 400 claims have been made against NHS workers since 1996, with dozens more assaulted by non-clinical staff. Now the health service is facing scores of claims relating to Jimmy Savile, after almost £60,000 was paid out in relation to the first three cases of people abused by the former DJ. The Department of Health insists changes have been made to change the culture in the health service to encourage staff and patients to speak up and be listened to. The NHS is one of several public sector institutions rocked by revelations about Savile's reign of terror on wards across the country. A damning report ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last month revealed the TV and radio personality was given unfettered access to the NHS where he raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals. The catalogue of abuse has raised serious questions about the NHS's failure to protect patients, especially children, from the paedophile. Kate Lampard, who carried out a review into the way the NHS handles abuse claims, warned that 'most NHS organisations still do not have adequately explicit and robust processes for managing their relationships with celebrities, important visitors, fundraisers and donors'. The Savile reports were dismissed as a 'cover up' by victims after NHS chiefs were cleared of any wrongdoing. Details of litigation claims obtained by MailOnline reveal the scale of abuse carried out by NHS staff over several years. From 1996 to 2014, there were a total of 407 claims of clinical staff abusing patients in the NHS. The NHS Litigation Authority paid out a total of £11.6million, which included £5.3million in damages and £4.2million in claimants' costs. A further £2million was spent on defence costs. The number of claims varied markedly from year to year, from just a handful in the late 1990s, to 60 claims in 2001-02, of which 19 were successful. From 2000 to 2014, a total of 61 claims have been made about abuse carried out in the NHS by non-clinical staff. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the NHS Litigation Authority will pay compensation to victims of Savile after the £2.9million in the disgraced star's estate have run out . More than half – some 37 – were submitted in 2013-14, which reflects the impact of the so-called 'Savile effect' of people coming forward in the wake of revelations about his abuse which emerged in late 2012. One claim from 2013-14 was unsuccessful and the other 36 were classed as still open. In the 14 years covered, just £80,681 was paid out in damages for abuse by non-clinical staff, while £101,252 was spent defending claims. However, the Department of Health has revealed that the first payments have now been made to victims of Savile. Liz Dux, from lawyers Slater and Gordon, is representing around 50 people making claims of abuse against the NHS . The disgraced star died in 2011, and his estate – estimated to be worth £2.9million – was liable for claims by the victims of his abuse. Ministers said that if the funds do not cover all valid claims, then the NHS Litigation Authority would step in. The Department of Health said that so far £58,625 has been paid out to three claimants, including £18,125 in compensation and £40,500 costs. The payments were made in December 2014. Lawyers acting for abuse victims expect more to follow, and accuse the NHS of being slow to react. Liz Dux, from lawyers Slater and Gordon, is representing around 50 people making claims of abuse against the NHS. 'We have seen a big rise in cases against medical practitioners particularly locum GPs, she said' 'People who are abused sexually by doctors a lot of the time come out thinking, did that happen? 'Doctors or medical practitioners who sexually abuse are often quite clever about it. People come out thinking was that supposed to happen. They want to have faith in the doctor they are going to. 'People are questioning much more what they had concerns about all along but not voiced them at the time.' She added: 'The Department of Health has been incredibly slow on Savile which is causing people a lot of concern because they just want to put it behind them.' Alison Millar, from law firm Leigh Day, is representing some victims of Savile but several others who have suffered abuse in the NHS more recently. 'These claims do go on and sadly it is not just an historic problem, to do with Jimmy Savile. 'When you talk about the Savile effect, generally what you mean is people who have been living with the effects of abuse for many years. 'What we are seeing in addition to people who were abused in childhood and are coming forward, now we are seeing claims coming forward in relation to the NHS and a number of cases involving children at schools with special educational needs. She suggested people were now more willing to speak out: 'There is a climate in which ill-treatment which in a rather British way we would have looked the other war and not done anything about it people are now ready to come forward.' A damning report ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last month revealed how Savile was given unfettered access to the NHS where he raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals . The Department of Health stressed that extensive changes have been made in safeguarding patients over the past quarter of a century, including criminal records checks and key agencies working together better to safeguard children, young people and adults. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has accepted 13 recommendations from Kate Lampard's report. All health trusts are to review their current practice in three months and report back on their progress. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We have a responsibility to make sure that patients are safe. 'All trusts have been asked to review their safeguarding practices and will report back with action plans for any improvement needed against Kate Lampard's recommendations. 'Importantly we are also working to encourage a culture within the NHS where staff and patients feel supported to speak up, to challenge and be listened to.'","EXCLUSIVE: 400 claims of sex abuse made against NHS staff since 1996 .

Retail chain Debenhams has seen the most popular size of the average handbag sold shrink by almost 200 per cent, according to a recent sales analysis with styles such as H! Henry Holland iridescent 'milk carton' bag and Bailey and Quinn's mini tote bag leading new trend. Two years ago the average handbag size was 12' wide x 8.5'high x 5'depth, which due to the tapering shape of most larger bags, plus lining fabric and compartments, would create an average of 350 cubic inches of internal space. But now the average size of bags purchased this year, has dropped to 8'wide x 5'high x 3' depth, with approximately 120 cubic inches of space inside - almost three times smaller than the previous most popular bag size. One in three female shoppers already own or are planning to buy a smaller bag thanks following in the footsteps of celebrities such as Alexa Chung . Both Taylor Swift and Lily Aldridge have been spotted recently carrying the new bijou tote . The trend for a bijou bag may have been helped along by a strong celebrity following with famous faces such as Taylor Swift, Alexa Chung and even the Duchess of Cambridge downsizing their arm-candy. An additional survey for the retailer found that the trend was set to increase among the public with one in three female customers (32 per cent) either owning, or were intending to buy a smaller handbag within the next four months. Recent designer brands to launch mini and even micro bags include Moschino, with one of the smallest at 2.4' x 3.5', Valentino, Mulberry, and Dolce and Gabbana with one of the largest at 5' x 6.7'. For most women a slightly larger bag is needed for everyday accessories, but many are jumping on the downsizer bandwagon and using it as an excuse for a personal-possession detox, according to the Debenhams study. The most popular item which women said they would dump to make room for essentials in a smaller bag was, old receipts, closely followed by 'old/used-up' make-up, with extra pairs of tights, umbrella, knickers and even spare shoes, getting a mention. Head of Accessories Natelle Baddeley said: 'For years women have filled holdall size handbags with everything from make-up and hair straighteners to laptops, ipads and even a change of clothes on occasion. 'So it's not surprising that this latest fashion for a lighter load on our arms has taken off. 'The designs are gorgeous, but the size means women have no choice but to be ruthless about the items they carry around with them. 'There is something very appealing about stripping back possessions to the bare essentials and realising that all those 'just in case items' were weighing us down physically and maybe mentally too.'","Sales of smaller bags have risen by 200 per cent according to Debenhams .

"A bride who shot her niece dead during an argument on her wedding night has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Christina George-Harvan, 30 and Katelyn Francis, 21, were celebrating at Jimmy K's bar in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, after the ceremony on April 24, 2014 when they started arguing over who should drive home. The row spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband Jeremy Harvan's car when the gun went off. On Friday a jury convicted her of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment - both class one misdemeanors. Her bond was revoked and she was led back to the jail cells in tears - but her family say they are pleased with the outcome. Scroll down for video . Christina George-Harvan, 30 (pictured in court on Friday) has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after shooting her niece Katelyn Francis dead after her wedding last year . George-Harvan and Francis, 21, (pictured) were partying after a wedding 30 miles south of Pittsburgh on April 24, 2014 . Her mother Julie Francis told WTAE: 'I didn't think there would be a not guilty verdict. We figured there would be something. And this is the least of those charges . Prosecutors were seeking third degree murder, but the jury agreed with the defense's argument it was an accident. George-Harvan, a former nurse, took to the stand on Thursday during her trial.  She told the court about the hours leading up the shooting - saying there was no tension with her niece. According to CBS Pittsburgh, she said: 'I was happy…she was so cute. We were only nine years apart. The first thing she did was say, 'Aunt Tina, I'm so happy for you,' and gave me a big hug.' George-Harvan's mother (pictured) admitted she didn't think there would be a not guilty verdict and was pleased her daughter was given the lesser charges . As the night went on they drank more, the court heard, and soon Mr Harvan was determined to drive home. However Francis demanded she be the designated driver and tried to take the keys off of him. George-Harvan said: 'When I turned around, the glove box is open and I see this gun. I think I gotta move this gun. I go get it out of the glove box to move it and boom the gun goes off. The defense attorney then asked: 'Did you squeeze the trigger?' And she replied: 'No.' Recounting the moment she realized she had shot her niece, she said: 'Everything freezes, Jeremy says, 'You just shot your [expletive] cousin'. 'He steps over her dying body and he runs. I put pressure on [Katelyn's] wound and I screamed and dialed 911. She added, 'I felt devastated. It was like a nightmare. Your wedding day is supposed to be the best day of your life and my niece is dead.' George-Harvan (pictured before her first court appearance the day after the shooting) said during the trial she would never hurt her niece and insisted there was no tension between the pair earlier in the evening . The row had spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband Jeremy Harvan's car (inside on night of shooting pictured) when the gun went off. George-Harvan has said it fired when she tried to move it .

"A 59-year-old married father-of-two arrested on suspicion of murdering chef Claudia Lawrence (pictured) has been released on bail . The man arrested by police yesterday on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence has been released on bail, police say. A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said the man, who is a 59-year-old married father-of-two from the York area, was released on bail 'to allow detectives time to follow up lines of inquiry'. Searches at a linked property were completed last night, police said. Yesterday, officers could be seen searching a semi-detached house in a quiet cul-de-sac in York. A spokesman said yesterday that Miss Lawrence, who was 35 when she went missing, had not been found. Claudia's family have been informed about today's developments. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, of North Yorkshire Police, repeated his plea for people not to identify the suspect. He said: 'I am very grateful to the media and the public for supporting my request that this individual should under no circumstances be identified, either in traditional media or on social media platforms. 'That is because identification is an issue and publishing this man's identity could cause serious harm to my investigation. 'This continues to be the case, even though the man has been released on bail, and I must ask that the media and public continue to support me and make no attempt to identify him, his place of work or his home address.' Her parents, Peter and Joan, were told about the arrest shortly before it was made public and are being supported by trained officers. Officers from North Yorkshire Police were yesterday pictured searching a property in a quiet cul-de-sac in York. Another property was searched overnight, and the man was bailed earlier today . A spokesman for the North Yorkshire force said the man had been released 'to allow detectives time to follow up lines of inquiry' (pictured, an officer searches a house in York yesterday) The father-of-two drank in the same pub as the missing university chef and lives within half a mile of her home in York. Miss Lawrence was reported missing by her father after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at work in March 2009. North Yorkshire Police began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's home, in the Heworth area of the city, and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge, while a 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Mr Malyn said he was 'actively pursuing new leads' and that his team had made 'significant progress' since the force began reviewing the case in 2013. The detective said some people locally knew Miss Lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef. The family of Claudia Lawrence have been informed of today's developments, it has been reported. Yesterday her father, Peter, said the news of an arrest was 'encouraging' The arrest came days after police released previously unseen CCTV of a mystery man caught on camera walking towards the back of her terraced house on the evening she was last known to be alive. The footage, released to mark the anniversary of Miss Lawrence's disappearance, was taken at around 7.15pm on March 18 showing a man walking towards the rear of the missing chef;s house. The camera picks him up returning about one minute later and he appears to be carrying a bag over his shoulder. As he walks back to the main road he is seen to stop briefly as another man walks in front of him. Police appealed for information to identify both men and the arrest came five days later.","Police released man 'to allow detectives time to follow up lines of inquiry'

"One of the first victims to receive an NHS payout after being sexually assaulted by Jimmy Savile has spoken out against the ‘derisory and insulting’ amount he received. Steve Ashton, 50, was awarded just £3,125 after a two-year legal battle. Mr Ashton, who was repeatedly abused by the late DJ from the age of ten, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I would have got more for whiplash. 'It makes you wonder how many more of Savile’s victims have been fobbed off with such a derisory amount.’ Victim: Steve Ashton (left) who was abused by Jimmy Savile when he was 10,  was awarded £3,125 after a two-year legal battle . Mr Ashton said his case was not about the money, but he felt the figure was a snub to all victims. ‘What is this going to show to other people in this situation?’ he asked. ‘Do they want to go through years of absolute hell for such an amount? Hundreds of people who have yet to come forward will think, “I’m not having my life made into an open book for such a small amount.” It’s a disgrace. ‘No money can make up for Savile’s effect on my life. But there should be some recognition from the authorities of the damage done.’ Mr Ashton added that his payout, which had been contested by the NHS Charitable Trust, ‘is probably one day’s work for the law firm that represented me’. He added: ‘You hear of celebrities receiving £50,000 after having their phones hacked, but how does that compare with being sexually molested as a ten-year-old boy again and again? ‘I’ve been going through this for 40 years and I still feel Savile laughing at me.’ Mr Ashton’s award was calculated using a compensation ‘tariff’, which sets payouts at between £1,500 for indecent assault over clothing to £40,000 for rape. Victims are entitled to more if they can prove lasting psychiatric damage or repeated abuse. The compensation scheme, set up jointly by Savile’s estate, the BBC, the NHS, children’s charity Barnardos and lawyers acting for the victims, was finally approved by the Court of Appeal three months ago. Payments capped at £60,000 have been awarded to more than 200 people who applied. Each claim triggers payments of up to £16,000 to lawyers. ‘My law firm was very caring, but they will come out of this far wealthier and happier than I did,’ Mr Ashton said. He added that he was advised he might be able to secure more by continuing his fight in the High Court, but decided not to as success was not guaranteed. Savile befriended Mr Ashton at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where the victim’s mother Pamela worked as a spinal injuries researcher. The abuse happened in the Porter’s Lodge and in Savile’s private room at the hospital. Mr Ashton recalled: ‘He used to say, “This is our secret.” ‘If everywhere was busy he would take me to the mortuary. He once pointed at the fridges and said, “If you’re a naughty boy for Jimmy, this is where you’ll end up”.’","Repeatedly abused victim said he would have 'got more for whiplash'

Mrs Clayton, a hypnotherapist who runs Data Bubble Consultancy with her husband Steve, said the consumers were on file after buying medical products, claiming insurance or even simply because they declared their conditions when booking a holiday. ‘If they bought products for mobility or even if they’ve gone on holiday and they’ve ticked to say that they are needing help on the flight, we can then identify that they actually have problems with mobility,’ boasted Mrs Clayton, smiling widely in her caravan. ‘It may be that they’ve booked a holiday and they’ve claimed a higher risk insurance or if they’ve ticked disabled to go on to the plane.’ The Mail’s undercover team contacted Data Bubble after being tipped off that Mrs Clayton, 46, and her football fanatic husband, 45, had sold data to suspected fraudsters. The couple, who are from Bradford, outline their qualifications and ambitions in online profiles. Mrs Clayton says on Friends Reunited that she loves ‘my present job within Direct Marketing. Even set up my own company so can’t be that bad eh!’ After her first failed marriage, Mrs Clayton married Steve, a former banker who specialised in debt recovery, 11 years ago. Mrs Clayton said the consumers were on file after buying medical products, claiming insurance or even simply because they declared their conditions when booking a holiday . Within minutes of our reporter’s first call with Mrs Clayton, she explained how she could sell a ‘custom list’ of contact details passed on by a variety of big name firms . They usually run Data Bubble from their £200,000 four-bedroom home in Bradford, but are currently trading in data while travelling abroad, apparently in a mobile home. Within minutes of our reporter’s first call with Mrs Clayton, she explained how she could sell a ‘custom list’ of contact details passed on by a variety of big name firms. ‘The information actually comes from a database of companies such as magazine subscriptions, finance companies, insurance companies, as well as then holiday companies, people that buy mail order. ‘So all these different companies contribute towards this particular database to then create one big, one transactional database. And from that, that’s how we can then make selections,’ she explained. A follow-up email outlined the data they were selling, broken down into hundreds of categories of different people cold calling firms might like to target. Among them were lists of those who had pensions, who taken out loans, read specific newspapers and even lists of parents broken down by the age of their children, from one to 17. Other categories were dedicated to those with conditions including osteoporosis, arthritis, back trouble, hearing difficulties and diabetes. HEALTH . - Whether you smoke . - If you want to lose weight . - Whether you have diabetes, arthritis or osteoporosis . - If you suffer from bladder problems or back trouble . - If you wear glasses or contact lenses . - Whether you us a hearing aid . FINANCE AND FAMILY . - Your salary . - Relationship status and ages of any children . - Mortgage application details . - The size of your pension pot . - What shares you own . - Your investment portfolio . - What credit card you use . - Credit history and any loans . - Any county court judgments against you . - The car you drive and your car insurance renewal date . - What you spend on utility bills . - What your house is worth . - Home insurance renewal date . - Your council tax band . - What ISAs you have . - Whether you have life or private medical insurance . - Any will or funeral plan . LIFESTYLE . - Your mobile network . - What DVDs you watch . - Your family’s pets . - The charities you give to . - Where and how often you go on holiday . - Any property overseas . - Where you buy groceries . - Loyalty/store cards . HOBBIES . - If you like bird watching, stamp collecting or antiques . - If you like wine, gardening, needlework or crosswords . - Your favourite sports . In total, Data Bubble claimed its consumer database held 42million records covering 24million households. This equates to every household in the UK. Mrs Clayton would not meet our reporter in person because, she said, she was out of the country. Instead, she spoke in a follow-up meeting on the internet call programme Skype, waving, smiling and giving thumbs up during discussions about medical data. She spoke from what appeared to be a mobile home. Mrs Clayton explained: ‘Different ailments – it could be people that have bought mobility products from a catalogue. ‘Even if they’ve gone on holiday and they’ve ticked to say that they are needing mobility.’ Asked who buys this data, she replied: ‘People that are selling beds or selling mobility scooters or them types of products.’ But she was happy to sell the same data to the Mail’s fake pensions firm to target disabled pensioners with investment cold calls. She sold 3,000 of these records to an undercover reporter with no checks on the Mail’s supposed firm. Had she done any due diligence she would have found that it was not a registered or regulated company at all. The cost was £576 – just 16p per record plus VAT. Thousands of people are thought to have been scammed over the phone (file picture) Later it emerged that Mrs Clayton had no idea whatsoever where the data had come from. In an email about the information to controversial data firm B2C Data, which was passed on to the Mail, she wrote: ‘I’m guessing you have provided all of these.’ B2C Data insisted it had not provided the records. In a follow up call with the undercover reporter, she was asked if she knew which companies supplied the mobility data. ‘No, I don’t know,’ she admitted. ‘Even the list owner has got an agreement. ‘If I turn round to their staff and say please can you tell me which specific company, they’ll turn round and says that they do not know. They’re not allowed to give that information out.’ When confronted with the Mail’s evidence, Mrs Clayton denied any wrongdoing. ‘We are a reputable data broker which supplies data legally,’ she said. She claimed she had done ‘nothing illegal’ by selling the data, which contained only the names of those who had opted in to having their details passed on.","Joanne Clayton sold data on 3,000 pensioners’ personal medical details .

"The Graduate School of Business at Stanford University has come out on top over rival Harvard in the battle to be named top business school in the U.S. for graduates. The two heavyweight institutions together with Wharton School ​at the University of Pennsylvania had tied for first place in last year's list compiled by U.S. News & World Report. This time around the 2016 Best Graduate Schools rankings released on Tuesday have placed Stanford out top on its own, followed by Harvard and then Wharton. Graduating Stanford University students participate in the 'Wacky Walk' before the start of the commencement ceremony: The Graduate School of Business at Stanford  has beaten rival Harvard and been named top business school in the U.S. for graduates . Chief Data Strategist Robert Morse told DailyMail that the scores for the top three schools remained extremely close but Stamford scored slightly better in several categories including undergraduate GPAs, admission scores and number of 2014 graduates employed within three months. Lower down the league table of institutions offering MBA programs there was significant movement. Mays Business School at Texas A&M University rose 10 spots to No. 27, where it's tied with two other schools. Wake Forest University's business school, which tied for No. 58 in last year's rankings, leaped to a tie for No. 45. Among part-time MBA programs, the University of California-Berkeley's Haas School of Business again took the No. 1 spot, followed by the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago in second place and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in third. For the U.S. News Best Business Schools rankings, all 464 master's programs in business accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International were surveyed in the fall of 2014 and early 2015. A total of 385 responded. Harvard Business School students cheer during their graduation ceremonies in Boston, Massachusetts: The school MBA program has been beaten into second place in the latest rankings . Of those, 126 provided enough of the data needed to calculate the full-time MBA rankings, based on a weighted average of the indicators described below. All 464 schools appear in the online directory. The business programs were assessed according to factors including peer assessment, recruiter assessment, placement success and mean starting salary and bonus. 'Nearly half of college students see value in pursuing graduate degrees,' said Brian Kelly, editor and chief content officer of U.S. News. 'Our Best Graduate Schools rankings are designed to help prospective students research programs in their field of interest and evaluate the potential return on their investment.' The 2016 edition also features information and rankings for law, education, engineering and medicine. Stanford University's campus in California: The median monthly earnings for young adults with master's degrees were 24 percent higher than for those with bachelor's degrees . In the law school rankings, Yale University held onto its No. 1 spot, while Harvard University and Stanford University tied for second. Harvard is again the No. 1 medical school for research, with Stanford holding onto the second spot. In evaluating graduate school data, U.S. News found that fewer Americans are heading to graduate school overall, with first-time enrollment shrinking by about 1 percent between fall 2012 and 2013. Skipping grad school could have a detrimental effect on an individual's earnings, the magazine noted, citing a Pew Research Center analysis of salary data. The research firm found that median monthly earnings for young adults with master's degrees were 24 percent higher than for those with bachelor's degrees.","The Graduate School of Business at Stanford University has beaten rival Harvard in the battle to be named top business school in the U.S.

"Generations have flocked to the Isle of Wight to see Queen Victoria's magnificent seaside home Osborne House. It was 'impossible to imagine a prettier spot', she famously declared. And now the island is gearing up for a wave of interest after the Valentine's Day wedding of Oscar-nominated Benedict Cumberbatch and Sophie Hunter. Fit for a king, queen or prince: The George occupies a splendid spot on the shoreline in Yarmouth . Victoria and Albert were newlyweds when they fell in love with the island. They designed and built Osborne House as a refuge from the stifling royal court, a place to relax with their nine children. The house still boasts the same private beach where they bathed far from the prying eyes of her subjects. Today, you can stay within the grounds - in two cottages called No 1 and No 2 Sovereign's Gate. They both sleep four, and you can explore the grounds long after the house has closed to the public. Not all the royals were so enthused by the island, however. Charles I was a prisoner in Carisbrooke Castle before being shipped back to be executed. After a couple of nights at Osborne, we set off for The George Hotel in the harbour town of Yarmouth, driving past 110-year-old thatched St Agnes church and on to the chalk stacks of the Needles. The Charge of the Light Brigade was required reading at my school, so I took another detour to Faringford, the estate of Alfred Lord Tennyson, who was a familiar figure striding the downs amid the wild orchids in his distinctive hat. The bracing sea air was worth, according to Tennyson, 'sixpence a pint'. A pint costs a bit more these days in Yarmouth, where sleek speedboats are moored yards from the hotel garden. Keeping it under his hat: Benedict Cumberbatch enjoyed his last night as a 'free man' on the Isle of Wight . The wall of Henry VIII's fortress gives shelter from the sea winds so you can dine alfresco for most of the year. It might only be a matter of time before The George boasts its first Michelin star, which explains why Cumberbatch and 140 of his friends spent the night here. In years to come, will there be a plaque saying the Sherlock idol spent his last night here as a bachelor? A much earlier visitor, Charles Darwin, summed up the Isle of Wight as 'the nicest seaside place which we have ever seen'. I couldn't agree more. The Wightlink car ferry (0333 999 7333, www.wightlink.co.uk) from Portsmouth to Fishbourne costs from £47.50 return for a car. A three-night stay at Sovereign's Gate (0370 333 1187, www.english-heritage.org.uk) starts at £402. Double rooms at The George (01983 760331, www.thegeorge.co.uk) cost from £195 B&B.","Britain's south coast island was a getaway favourite of Queen Victoria's .

"Two teenagers had to be rescued by firefighters on Saturday after the chuck of ice they'd foolishly stepped onto broke away from the shore and started floating out into Lake Michigan. The males, ages 17 and 18, were roughly 40 yards into the lake when the Racine Fire Department arrived to rescue them just after 12:40 p.m., reports The Journal Times. Three divers in scuba gear from the department had to swim out to rescue the pair. Scroll down for video . The two males, aged 17 and 18, had stepped onto a chuck of ice that broke away from the shore and they had to be rescued by three members of the Racine Fire Department in scuba gear . The firefighters, with help from Kenosha's Coast Guard, gave the teens life vests to put on and then pushed the chunk of ice back to shore. They then put a ladder down for the two to climb back to safety. Neither teenager was injured, reports Racine Uncovered. The incident took place at the beach behind Racine Zoo. Frequent visitors to the lake say it is currently difficult to tell where the beach ends and the ice begins. The incident is the second strange ice rescue this week - on Thursday a U.S. Coast Guard ship was cutting ice on frozen-over Lake St Clair when they came across a young man walking out on the ice alone in sub-freezing temperatures. When crew members brought the curious 25-year-old man on board, he said he was trying to walk from Detroit to Toronto. Detroit lies on the southwestern shore of Lake St Clair, and the unidentified ice-walker was found just half a mile from Seaway Island on the opposite shore. From there it's a 201-mile journey on land to reach Toronto. Snow coats Navy Pier surrounded by ice-covered Lake Michigan in Chicago. For the second consecutive winter, bitter weather threatens to turn the surface of the Great Lakes into a vast frozen plain . For the second consecutive winter, bitter weather has threatened to turn the surface of the Great Lakes into a vast, frozen plain. During February there were days when as much as 85 percent of the lakes' surface area was covered with ice, the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory has reported. Records show the lakes' most widespread freeze was 94.7 percent in 1979. The ice cover topped out at 92.2 percent last March. Significant portions of the lakes typically froze over decades ago, Leshkevich said, but the frequency of severe winters has declined since the late 1990s. 'Two almost record-setting years back to back would be very unusual,' he said. One likely explanation for the rapid buildup this month is that 2014's freeze lasted so long — Lake Superior wasn't completely ice-free until June — and summer was so mild that the lakes didn't absorb much heat, he said. 'So we started this season with below-water temperatures to begin with.' Rescued: The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a man on Thursday morning, who they found walking alone on the middle of frozen-over Lake St Clair . The ice blanket reaches across more than 90 percent of Lakes Superior, Huron and Erie, while Lakes Michigan and Ontario are more than halfway covered. It has produced some spectacular visual images, from ice caves along the Lake Michigan shoreline to a glacial buildup making it appear that Niagara Falls had frozen in place. But it's a headache for the Coast Guard, whose cutters open channels for vessels hauling vital cargo such as heating oil and road salt. The Detroit-based tug Bristol Bay has struggled for days to free the Arthur M. Anderson, a freighter stranded about 70 miles east of Cleveland in ice up to 10 feet thick. The Canadian Coast Guard has dispatched an icebreaker to assist. The job has taken so much longer than expected that the Bristol Bay's crew ran low on food and had to receive a delivery by helicopter, which lowered supplies in their rescue basket. Things will get even busier in mid-March, when the shipping season begins for the lakes' regular traffic of vessels carrying iron ore, coal, grain and other bulk cargo. 'We're probably going to be looking at situations like we had last year, where we had to put together convoys — lots of vessels together to make it through,' Coast Guard spokesman Lorne Thomas said.

"Chef: Police think Claudia Lawrence was murdered . The detective leading the search for missing chef Claudia Lawrence revealed last night he is ‘actively pursuing new leads’ on the sixth anniversary of her disappearance. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, of North Yorkshire Police, said his team had made ‘significant progress’ since the force began reviewing the case in 2013 and may make more arrests in the coming weeks and months. He warned anyone who had not yet disclosed details about their relationship with the chef or the events in the days leading up to her disappearance to come forward or risk arrest. Miss Lawrence was last seen on March 18, 2009, and reported missing by her father on March 20 after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at York University. Police believe she was murdered. A number of new searches have been carried out since 2013, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's house in Heworth, York, and a fingertip search of the alleyway that leads to the back of her home. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge, while a 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Mr Malyn said: ‘In the months since we started our review, we have made very significant progress. We have arrested and interviewed two men about Claudia's disappearance. More arrests possible: Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn (pictured), of North Yorkshire Police, said his team had made ‘significant progress’ since the force began reviewing the case in 2013 . Fingertip search: Mr Malyn said he believes the alleyway near Miss Lawrence's home in the Heworth area of York has ‘potential significance’ in explaining what happened to the chef and is still being investigated . 'One remains on bail while our inquiries in relation to him continue. In the coming weeks and months we may make additional arrests as we continue to develop our lines of inquiry. ‘In the light of information that has only recently come to the fore, we are actively pursuing what are rightly described as new leads.’ Mr Malyn said he believes the alleyway has ‘potential significance’ in explaining what happened to Miss Lawrence and is still being investigated. The detective said some people locally knew Miss Lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some have deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef, who was 35 at the time. Appeal: Miss Lawrence was last seen in March 2009, and was reported missing by her father Peter (above) Probe: Police believe Miss Lawrence - seen on CCTV on her way home from work in 2009 - was murdered . Map: She did not arrive for a shift at York University . He said: ‘I would make a further appeal for those to come forward now and provide these explanations. ‘If I reach the point where we believe people continue to obstruct this investigation or assist or cover up for the person or persons responsible, they will be arrested.’ Mr Malyn continued: ‘Six years have passed since Claudia disappeared. ‘For her loved ones, the pain caused by her absence and the circumstances of her disappearance has not faded. 'And nor, I assume, has the guilt and knowledge that one or more people have about what happened to this young woman.' He added: ‘Ultimately, we may not be able to prove what happened to Claudia, or be able to find her. 'But that will not be for lack of determination, tenacity and meticulous detective work, nor whilst there are still clues that need to be investigated. ‘If you know what happened to Claudia, or know that you have some relevant information but have not yet come forward, then do so, today. ‘Six years is a long time to live with that knowledge.’","Dai Malyn says North Yorkshire Police has made 'significant progress'

"American Airlines has refunded a family's ticket for their daughter who died after a public outcry following their initial refusal to do so. Madison 'Scout' Cantrell, 9, died tragically from an asthma attack that led to cardiac arrest five months ago, sending her family into deep and sudden grief. The Cantrells,from St Charles, a suburb of Chicago, had been planning a trip to Bald Head, North Carolina this month, but decided to call it off. Scout's sister Katie, 13, said going to their traditional family vacation spot would be too emotionally painful. American Airlines refused to offer a refund for Scout's seat, transfer the ticket to someone else or issue a voucher. Scroll down for video . American Airlines originally refused to refund the ticket of Madison 'Scout' Cantrell, 9, who died in October after an asthma attack led to cardiac arrest . Felicity Cantrell, Scout's mother, applied for a refund and sent in a death certificate but was told that the documents did not 'meet exception requirements' The airline's website says that a travel vouches are given to family members of passengers who die before their flight. Felicity Cantrell, Scout's mother, said on Facebook that she had sent in the required documentation and death certificate, but posted a letter  from the company denying her request for a refund. The callous letter said 'the request does not meet our exception requirements' and that the fee for changing the flight would be waived 'as a one-time courtesy.' 'I know that I would never write this to someone. I don't know how someone could send this to another family,' Katie Cantrell told NBC Chicago. Katie Cantrell (right) said that going to her families normal vacation spot in North Carolina would be too emotionally painful without her sister Scout (left) Senior management from American Airlines got in contact with Felicity Cantrell on Wednesday night, and the family finally got their refund after a 'genuine' conversation . Social media users shared the mother's tragedy and American Airlines' corporate team got in touch with her, saying that she had gotten a refund when they actually hadn't. The customer service representatives that first contacted the family 'further exacerbated how American has treated us,' Mrs Cantrell said. On Wednesday night senior management from the company called and gave the Cantrells their refund. 'Were they doing corporate damage control? Yes, absolutely' Mrs Cantrell said. However, she added that her conversation with the manager was genuine and that he was 'thoroughly embarrassed and horrified by this whole situation'. The American Airlines representative also said that changes would be made in corporate training so  that employees will 'reflect empathy'. Mrs Cantrell posted on Facebook that the family would be vacationing in South Carolina this year.

"A pilot who once flew with killer airman Andreas Lubitz yesterday spoke of how he flew the 'route of death' between Barcelona and Dusseldorf just two days after the Alps tragedy. Frank Woiton said he hugged each individual passenger as he boarded the plane and prepared to retrace the route taken by the ill-fated Germanwings jet. The father-of-two described a 'crazy mood' among the crew and passengers, saying 'you could read it in their faces'. Speaking to German newspaper Bild, the 48-year-old told of how he received a huge round of applause after he delivered an emotional speech before take off. Reassuring: Pilot Frank Woiton, who once flew with Andreas Lubitz (pictured), said he hugged each individual passenger as he boarded the plane and prepared to retrace the route taken by the ill-fated Germanwings jet . 'Sure, I will take your from Dusseldorf to Barcelona. You can rely on the fact that I want to sit this evening with my family at the dinner table,' he told passengers over the intercom. He added: 'People should see that in the cockpit there is also another human being.' Mr Woiton, who also volunteered to work the day after the crash when a number of Germanwings crew refused to fly, also described a flight he shared with Lubitz. 'I remember him well and I left my seat from time to time in the air to use the toilet. ‘When I flew with him he told me of his training and how happy he was. He said that he wanted to fly long-haul routes and become a captain. ‘He had mastered the plane very well, he had everything under control. That’s why I left him alone in the cockpit, to go to the toilet.’ His revelations came after a woman travelling on another Germanwings flight described how another pilot had gone above and beyond to reassure passengers. Britta Englisch wrote on the airline's Facebook page that the pilot on her domestic flight in Germany had greeted each passengers individually before making a speech in the cabin. The unnamed pilot, flying a Germanwings plane from Hamburg to Cologne the day after the crash, was met with applause after assuring passengers they would be coming home safe to their families. Admirable man: Britta Englisch wrote on Germanwing's Facebook page how her pilot had greeted each passengers individually before making a speech in the cabin, promising to get them home to their families . Translated from German, Mrs English writes: 'Yesterday morning at 8:40am, I got onto a Germanwings flight from Hamburg to Cologne with mixed feelings,' Englisch wrote on the Germanwings Facebook page. 'But then the captain not only welcomed each passenger separately, he also made a short speech before take off. Not from the cockpit — he was standing in the cabin.' 'He spoke about how the accident touched him and the whole crew. About how queasy the crew feels, but that everybody from the crew is voluntarily here.' 'And about his family and that the crew have a family and that he is going to do everything to be with his family again tonight.' 'It was completely silent. And then everybody applauded. I want to thank this pilot.' Loss: Relatives of the victims of the Germanwings Flight 4U9525 crash on Tuesday put down flowers at the memorial in Le Vernet, south-eastern France earlier today . Killer: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is suspected of having deliberately piloted Germanwings flight 4U9525 into the mountain, killing all 150 people on board, including himself, in the worst air disaster in Europe in recent history . All 144 passengers, including two babies, 16 teenagers from a German high school, and six crew members lost their lives in the crash . 'He understood what everybody was thinking. And that he managed to give, at least me, a good feeling for this flight.' The story, posted by Mrs Englisch on Germanwings Facebook, has since become a social media hit, with nearly 300,000 likes and 17,000 shares. All 144 passengers, including two babies, 16 teenagers from a German high school, and six crew members lost their lives when Germanwings Flight 4U9525 crashed on Tuesday. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit of the Airbus  before setting the airliner's controls to descend into a rocky valley, obliterating the plane and killing all 150 people on board. Germanwings chief executive Thomas Winkelmann said those who died came from at least 13 different countries - with 72 German nationals and 49 people from Spain confirmed to have been on passenger lists for the plane. Today, investigators trying to piece together why Lubitz crashed the plane have revealed he tore up a doctor's sick note for the day of the disaster. Investigators revealed today that medical sign-off notes were found at Lubitz's home and Dusseldorf University Hospital confirmed he had been a patient there over the past two months, although it would not disclose his condition.","Pilot delivered emotional before flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf .

"It is an amazing view of one of the most incredible volcanoes on Earth. This image from over the Azores island of São Miguel features a volcanic complex called the Sete Cidades Massif. The circular crater or caldera dominates the image and measures about 5 km across. The interior has lakes, volcanic cones, lava domes and maars – or shallow, flooded craters. Scroll down for video . This image taken by the Spanish Deimos-2 satellite on 6 December 2014 was taken over the Azores island of São Miguel features a volcanic complex called the Sete Cidades Massif. The circular crater or caldera dominates the image and measures about 5 km across. Kelsea Brennan-Wessels from the ESA said it was a unique structure. 'In the surrounding area we can see the lines where there are agricultural plots.' The Lagoa das Sete Cidades – or Lagoon of Seven Cities – is comprised of two ecologically different lakes that are connected by a narrow passage, visible at the centre of the image. The lake to the north is known as the Blue Lake while to the one to the south is the Green Lake for the colours they reflect. 'According to the legend, the protected daughter of a king escaped to the surrounding hills, where she met and fell in love with a young shepherd,' said Brennan-Wessels. 'When the shepherd asked the king for his daughter in marriage, the king refused and forbade his daughter from seeing the boy again. 'The two met secretly one last time and cried until their tears filled the valleys to form the two lakes: one green as the Princess's eyes were green, and the other blue like the shepherd’s eyes.' This image, also featured on the Earth from Space video programme, was acquired by the Spanish Deimos-2 satellite on 6 December 2014. With its high-resolution optical imager, the satellite can see down to a 75 cm ground resolution. The ancient story recounts the tale of a bad-tempered widower King and his daughter in a Kingdom in the Western Sea. He was a King, Lord of Alchemy and sorcerer, who lived exclusively for his daughter, Antília, and who would not let the Princess speak to anyone. Apart from the King, the Princess was raised by an old nurse, after the Queen had died. As the years progressed, the princess grew-up to be a beautiful young woman and able to attract the attentions of any boy in the kingdom. However, the King restricted her movements to the castle and garden, and few ever saw her. But, un-intimidated by her father, and with the help of the nurse, she escaped to the local hills and valleys, as her father slept after his lunch. During one of her escape adventures, she heard a song: the music was beautiful and enchanted her to follow it to its origins. Hiding from view, the princess found a young shepard playing a flute, sitting on top of a hill. For weeks she returned, listening to the young shepard, until she was discovered behind some bushes. The shepard boy fell in love with the princess, and they continued to meet afterwards, talking, laughing and enjoying each other's company, until the boy decided to ask the princess in marriage. Early in the morning, the couple knocked on the door of the Castle, and asked the servants to speak to the King. Very nervous but determined, the shepard asked the King for his daughter in marriage. Reacting angrily, the King refused and expelled him from the Castle, and forbade his daughter from seeing the young boy. Not wishing more ill-feelings, she followed the orders of her father, but met secretly with the shepard that afternoon in order to tell him that he would never see him again. Antília and the shepard boy cried all afternoon, embracing, and their tears formed two beautiful lakes, one green, for the Princess's eyes were green, and the other blue, for the shepard's eyes were likewise colored.

But it's not just the space and facilities that make the plane so ideal, it is also stacked with the latest safety equipment. According to White House information the onboard electronics are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse - such as a nuclear explosion - and Air Force One is equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a 'mobile command centre'. The plane can reach speeds up to 620 miles per hour, 40 miles per hour faster than their commercial counterparts. And, according to Business Insider, there are also mirror ball missile deflectors embedded in the wings of the plane should the aircraft come under attack. Interestingly, there are two identical planes used by the President and they are referred to as SAM 28000 and SAM 29000 when they are flying without the President on board. The cost an estimated $330million each when bought in the early 1990s for the first President Bush. There is no chance the leader of the free world will go hungry on board - the plane also has two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time. Although the plane is popularly known as Air Force One, this is technically the call sign of any Air Force aircraft carrying the President. Pictured here are George Bush with the Obamas and others as the group flew to Nelson Mandela's memorial on Air Force One back in 2013. This room is called the 'Situation Room' that can also be used for conferencing . Obama talks with US Senator Lamar Alexander aboard Air Force One during a flight May back in 2011 from Memphis, Tennessee, to Joint Base Andrews, Maryland; there is casual as well as office space for all sorts of discussions . Capable of refuelling midair - as seen in the Harrison Ford film, Air Force One - the Boeing 747-200B aircrafts have unlimited range and don't need to land for days at a time. The planes are a powerful symbol of American power and a presidential aircraft was first used by President Kennedy. The US military has recently chosen a new Boeing model to replace its current fleet of Air Force One presidential aircrafts. The new Air Force One planes will be Boeing's commercial 747-8 airliner, replacing the old Boeing 747-200Bs. The Pentagon had considered the A380 made by European aerospace giant Airbus, but opted for home-grown talent. There appear to be plenty of meeting rooms on board so that business can continue as usual despite travelling at 35,000ft . The jet can cater for 100 people, whether they want to relax back with snacks and a drink, or perhaps a more formal meal . 'The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States (that) when fully missionized meets the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission,' said Air Force secretary Deborah James in a statement. Boeing welcomed the Air Force's decision to skip a competition and opt for the 747-8, citing its 50-year history of building presidential aircraft. The Air Force now operates two VC-25s, specially configured Boeing 747-200Bs. It said it planned to purchase enough of the technical baseline to permit competition for maintenance during the plane's planned 30-year life. James said the Air Force One program would use proven technologies and commercially certified equipment to keep the program affordable. The president's plane has long been a symbol of American power and the setting for historic moments, including the somber 1963 ceremony when Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office on board -- hours after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The plane is equipped with the latest in communications and security systems, and is capable of functioning as a mobile command centre in the event of an attack on the US . The US President is pictured enjoying a joke with former leader George Bush during a flight on board Air Force One . The plane is often portrayed in Hollywood films and inspired a 1997 thriller titled 'Air Force One' in which the US president, played by Harrison Ford, fought off hijackers. Outfitted with secure communications equipment and other gear, Air Force One is designed to serve as a 'mobile command center' and served that role briefly after the attacks of September 11, 2001. It also features a suite for the commander-in-chief that includes a large office, a conference room as well as a medical area that can function as an operating room. The body of the plane is said to be able to withstand a nuclear blast from the ground and has a number of emergency exits . Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy (pictured), Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office on board Air Force One . The plane's galley can feed up to 100 people and there are additional quarters for senior aides, Secret Service agents and other staff. Air Force One is technically the radio call sign adopted by any aircraft with the president on board but it has become identified with certain planes reserved for the president's air travel.","Obama's Boeing 747-200B is capable of functioning as a mobile command centre in the event of an attack on the US .

"Breast implants in France will come with a health warning after experts discovered a link with a rare form of cancer. France's National Cancer Institute said there was a 'clearly established link' between a specific type of implant and the disease. Experts said they have identified 18 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma since 2011, linked to silicone breast implants. Given the rarity of cases, the Institute said there is no need to recommend the removal of the implants. Breast implants in France will come with a health warning after 18 women were found to have a rare form of cancer after having an augmentation operation . 'This complication presents very infrequently,' the body said. France's health minister immediately sought to calm fears haunted by a similar scare in 2011. French firm PIP sparked a global health scare in 2011, when plastic surgeons began reporting an unusual number of ruptures in their products. The PIP implants were banned and the company eventually liquidated. 'We do not recommend that women carrying these implants have them removed,' Health Minister Marisol Touraine said. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma - a blood cancer. It is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which forms part of the body's immune system. The rare disease is more common in children and young adults. It develops when abnormal white blood cells divide in an uncontrolled way. The cancerous white blood cells then travel to parts of the body, commonly the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow and blood and form a tumour. Symptoms of the disease include: . The disease makes up around three per cent of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas in adults and 10 to 30 per cent in children. It grows quickly and usually needs immediate treatment with chemotherapy. Some patients may also need radiotherapy or stem cell transplants. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support and Lymphoma Research Foundation . She urged women not to get 'carried away by excessive worry', about the implants. 'Our vigilance is absolute,' she said. Ms Touraine said no particular brand of implant was in question. However the Parisien Daily reported that 14 of the 18 cases of the rare cancer were found in women with breast implants made by US pharmaceutical company Allergan. Allergan said in a statement: 'The security of patients is our first priority.' It added the company is collaborating closely with the health authorities and the drug agency ANSM. The company added that all women aged 25 or over should have an annual health check. The head of the National Cancer Institute, Agnes Buzyn, said the increased detection rate could also be attributed to better screening. According to Francois Hebert, deputy head of the ANSM drugs agency, around 400,000 women in France have had breast implants. Of those 80 per cent had the procedure for cosmetic reasons, while 20 per cent had the operation following breast cancer. Almost 50,000 women in the UK and some 400,000 worldwide, were affected by the PIP scare came to light. There was uproar when it emerged the French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) had been manufacturing implants using industrial grade silicone intended for use in mattresses. However a report into PIP scandal, published last May, found 'no convincing' medical data which suggests women with PIP implants should have them removed. French firm PIP sparked a global health scare in 2011, when plastic surgeons began reporting an unusual number of ruptures in their products . European health officials found no medical or toxicological evidence to justify removal. The European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks found no reliable evidence that ruptured PIP implants posed a health risk. They concluded a ruptured PIP implant posed not greater threat than a ruptured implant from another manufacturer. Their findings backed a 2012 review by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, which concluded the implants were not toxic or carcinogenic. However Jean-Claude Mas, the founder of the company, was jailed for four years in 2013 for fraad, at a court in France.","France's National Cancer Institute found 'clear link' between breast implants and a rare form of cancer .

"A schoolboy was 'excluded' from   World Book Day celebrations after turning up dressed as a Fifty Shades of Grey character. Liam Scholes, 11, arrived at Sale High School, Greater Manchester dressed as Christian Grey from the erotic novel, wearing a suit and holding cable ties and an eye mask. But teachers failed to see the funny side and phoned his mother Nicola - who is herself a primary school teacher - to tell her the outfit was inappropriate. Scroll down for video . Liam Scholes (left) was told off by teachers after turning up to World Book Day dressed as Christian Grey from the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, a character played by Jamie Dornan in the film of the book (right) Liam's mother said the costumer, which included cable ties and an eye mask, was just a bit of fun . Children around the country were encouraged to go to school dressed as literary characters yesterday as part of the global event. Liam and his mother thought it would be fun for him to dress up as the character following the global success of the book by E.L. James, which has since been made into a Hollywood blockbuster. But after packing her son off to school in the risqué outfit, Mrs Scholes was phoned and told he would not be allowed to participate in themed events or a planned class photo. She said: 'We thought it was funny. We were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as Christian Grey. 'At first we laughed it off but the we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea. 'He went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties. The cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them. We didn't think there would be a problem. 'I got a phone call home from the school saying the outfit was inappropriate and that he had been excluded from taking part or being in any of the photographs.' Liam's mother Nicola said this morning that children his age knew about the book and its content . Ms Scholes said the costume was Liam's idea to amuse his friends. She said he hasn't read the book or seen the film (which features the character playing a piano) but knows about it from all the advertising of the film . She added: 'Me and the teacher agreed to disagree and it's not being taken any further but I was disappointed for Liam that he'd been stopped from taking part and that he's had a dressing down. Was the school right to take action over schoolboy's Christian Grey outfit? Was the school right to take action over schoolboy's Christian Grey outfit? Now share your opinion . 'One of the teachers went dressed as Dexter and I don't see why sex is seen as more offensive than murder. 'If it was a primary school I could understand but it's a secondary school and the book and the film have been everywhere - it's one of the most famous books in recent years and it's not like the pupils will be unaware of it.' Liam told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'It's the content of the book that people might think is inappropriate, but I went in dressed as Christian Grey just for a laugh.' His mother told the programme that children his age knew about the book and everyone recognised the character when he arrived for class register. She insists her son - who hasn't read the book or seen the film - suggested the outfit after seeing advertising for the movie on TV and the internet. Ms Scholes told Radio 4's Today Programme: 'I don't think I was breaking the rules. He went as a book character. 'Christian Grey is one of the most famous book characters of recent years. 'He's aware that the book is saying things of a sexual nature. If you looked on Twitter after the film came out it was everywhere.' Despite the dispute, Ms Scholes insists she and the school have 'agreed to disagree' and there are 'no hard feelings'. The Fifty Shades of Grey series has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide and depicts a relationship between college graduate Anastasia Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey. It is notorious for explicit sex scenes involving bondage. Sale High school has yet to comment on the row. The book was recently turned into a Hollywood blockbuster, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan . Among the more traditional Oliver Twists, Burglar Bills and Where's Wallys, schools around Britain welcomed some more unusual 'literary' characters yesterday. Jamie Peek, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, surprised his friends at Woods Loke primary by turning up as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. His mother, Caroline, said: 'He's mad about cars and a massive Top Gear fan so he told me he wanted to go as Jeremy Clarkson.' Jamie Peek from Lowestoft, Suffolk went to World Book Day as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson . Mrs Peek added: 'It was a bit of a strange costume to pull together but I got a wig from eBay and trimmed it to look right. Most of the clothes are his own. He even impersonated Jeremy Clarkson's grumpy faced Twitter profile picture for the class photo. 'He's got a number of Top Gear annuals and books. I think it's good for his reading.' Parents around the country were divided over whether superheroes more famous for films than books, such as Ironman and Spiderman, count as literary characters. But the biggest debate on Twitter centred around the army of girls dressed up as Princess Elsa and Princess Anna from Disney's Frozen seen turning up at schools. Benjamin Johncock tweeted: 'A little girl is dressed up as Elsa from Frozen. I want to shout at her, THAT’S NOT A BOOK' Hundreds of girls around the UK arrived dressed as Princess Elsa from Frozen, though some parents questioned whether the Disney characters is truly literary . Claire Anderson added: 'My daughter is VERY unimpressed by the 23(!!) girls dressed up in Frozen costumes for #WorldBookDay at school' A website user called saraurora added: 'The boy dressed as an oompa-loompa in a sea of Elsa's and superheroes is my idol' Others insisted Frozen now has plenty of follow-up books based on the film and is an adapted version the classic Snow Queen tale. Atticus Beaterband replied: 'Frozen is a riff on the Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen so technically it maybe could sneak in under the bar?'

"Thousands of cases of diabetes and cancer could be avoided, saving the NHS £300million, by putting a health tax of 12p a can on sugary drinks, it is claimed. Academics have calculated the likely reduction in consumption caused by putting up the price of full sugar drinks like Coca-Cola and Pepsi and the resulting health benefits. The work by experts at the University of Liverpool and the Children’s Food Campaign will fuel the growing campaign to extend the principle of a duty on unhealthy products from cigarettes and alcohol to some types of drink and food. Scroll down for video . Academics have calculated the likely reduction in consumption caused by putting up the price of full sugar drinks like Coca-Cola and Pepsi and the resulting health benefits . Health campaigners and doctors have controversially likened sugar and its contribution to obesity and ill-health as the ‘new tobacco’. However, the drinks industry have challenged the figures, insisting a sugary drinks tax will only hit the poorest in society with higher living costs while doing nothing to improve their health. The Liverpool team calculates that a tax of 20p per litre – 12p per can – would reduce the number of cases of diabetes by just under 50,000 over 20 years. They estimate there would be a fall of 33,000 in cases of stroke and heart disease and some 9,000 fewer victims of bowel cancer. Malcolm Clark, co-ordinator of the Children’s Food Campaign, said a 20p per litre sugary drinks duty would save lives and money across England . These figures relate to England alone and the researchers estimate it would lead to savings of £300m in the cost of treating these people over the 20 years, releasing money for other patients. Soft drinks are the largest single source of sugar for children aged 4-10 years and teenagers, consequently any new levy would particularly hit consumption among this group. Money raised from the charge would support a new Children’s Health Fund, which would pay for sport and fitness schemes and equipment for youngsters. The campaign for a sugary drinks duty is supported by over 60 organisations, including public health and medical professional bodies, dentists, children’s charities, Action on Sugar and school food experts. Malcolm Clark, co-ordinator of the Children’s Food Campaign, said: ‘Current taxes on foods are a mess, and don’t support people choosing healthier options. ‘A 20p per litre sugary drinks duty would save lives and money across England, and ease the pressure on NHS services locally. It is a logical, proportionate and effective measure. ‘Using the revenue to set up a Children’s Health Fund, paying for programmes to improve children’s health and protect the environment they grow up in, would also ensure that this was a progressive measure, benefiting families in poverty and on low incomes.’ Public health directors in North West England and in Cardiff, as well as the London Health Commission, have publicly backed a sugary drinks duty. Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association’s scientific adviser, said: ‘A tax on sugary drinks and food is a no brainer. It's a scandal that one in eight of our three-year olds currently experiences tooth decay. It's time we tackled the problem at source.’ Health campaigners and doctors have controversially likened sugar and its contribution to obesity and ill-health as the ‘new tobacco’ The research looking the impact of the levy was led by Brendan Collins, Research Fellow in Health Economics, University of Liverpool, who has created a model showing the effect by local authority area across England. This found the areas likely to see the biggest benefits by virtue of the fact they have a younger population and higher consumption of the drinks were Slough, Manchester, Luton, Blackburn, Leicester, Birmingham, Milton Keynes, Bradford and Nottingham. Robin Ireland, the director of Food Active, which is supported by Directors of Public Health in the north west of England, said: ‘Just as extra taxes on cigarettes have helped to change purchasing habits and reduce smoking, adding 20p per litre onto the price of sugary drinks would encourage people to consume less and lead to improvements in quality of life. ‘We want to see the next Government introduce a sugary drinks duty without delay.’ CitizensUK, which is an alliance of local community groups, said: ‘We are calling for a Children’s Health Fund to enable a step-change in early intervention. Since there is no spare money in the NHS, we are calling for a duty on sugary drinks, which will itself reduce diabetes and obesity.’ Director of the British Soft Drinks Association, Gavin Partington, rubbished the research and its figures. He said: ‘This is a flawed model based on misleading figures created by campaigners in support of their cause. The overwhelming evidence suggests that ill-health is linked to a range of factors including lifestyle, levels of exercise and overall diet. ‘A tax on soft drinks would adversely impact the poorest in society while doing nothing to curb obesity.’","Experts believe there should be a 12p tax cans of sugary drinks like Pepsi .

"Long before he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Ronald Reagan's speech may have contained clues to his worsening mental state. This is according to US scientists who have found subtle changes in the former president's speech during his term in office from 1981 to 1989. Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 1994, and always maintained that he would resign from his post if his mental health went into decline. Scroll down for video . Long before he was diagnoised with Alzheimer's, Ronald Reagan's speech may have contained clues to his worsening mental condition, according to a new study by the University of Arizona. This image was taken in 1991 in California, just three years before the President was diagnosed with dementia . Early detection could slow the progression of the disease before it severely damages the brain. Ronald Reagan died at the age of 93 in 2004. In 2010, a book marking the 100th anniversary of his birth included claims by his son Ron, that he saw early signs of dementia in 'an out-of-touch president' during the 1984 campaign. He says he saw those signs again in 1986 where he claimed his father could not remember the names of the familiar California canyons he was flying over. This didn't stop his adversaries claiming his tendency to forget names and make contradictory statements was the result dementia. Now researchers at the University of Arizona believe Reagan was suffering from the early onset of Alzheimer's while acting as president. They came to the conclusion after comparing transcripts of 46 news conferences that Reagan held to the 101 sessions George H. W. Bush held in his term. 'Key word counts previously associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease were extracted and regression analyses were conducted,' the authors wrote. Reagan used words such as 'thing' as a trigger to recall the correct words more often Bush. He also used more repetition. The team used a new algorithm based on a technique used by others to analyse changes in writing by novelists, according to a report in the New York Times. 'President Reagan showed a significant reduction in the number of unique words over time and a significant increase in conversational fillers and non-specific nouns over time,' the researchers said. 'There was no significant trend in these features for President Bush,' they added. The findings, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, do not conclusively prove that Reagan had dementia that affected his judgment as president.

But the scientists involved in the project hope the technique will help reveal signs of Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases much earlier. Early detection could slow the progression of the disease before it severely damages the brain. Ronald Reagan died at the age of 93 in 2004. In 2010, a book marking the 100th anniversary of his birth included claims by his son Ron, that he saw early signs of dementia in 'an out-of-touch president' during the 1984 campaign. The telltale signs of Alzheimer’s can be seen in people as young as 20, research shows. The ‘unprecedented’ finding suggests that the disease starts to eat away at the brain half a century before symptoms develop. This is a ‘much younger age than the scientists ever imagined’. The discovery raises the prospect of giving people drugs in the very earliest stages, when it is easiest to treat, and even stopping the disease in its tracks. However, British experts cautioned that the research is still at an early stage. Crucially, it isn’t known how many people who have the early signs of Alzheimer’s in their brains in their 20s will go on to develop the disease. Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and, worldwide, the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050 as the population ages. He says he saw those signs again in 1986 where he claimed his father could not remember the names of the familiar California canyons he was flying over. While some people suggest they knew Reagan had the disease while in office, his four White House doctors said they saw no evidence of it. Alzheimer's is an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells. Mr Reagan informed the nation in a hand written letter when he was formally diagnosed. 'Had the diagnosis been made in, say, 1987, would he have stepped down?', Ron asks in the book. 'I believe he would have'.

"Atheists are the latest group that controversial Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson has decided to train in his cross hairs. At a Florida prayer meeting last week, the 68-year-old used a very graphic and brutal story about murder, castration and child rape to explain the inherent problems with non-believers. In his lucrative second career as a Christian speaker, Robertson used the hypothetical situation to illustrate whether or those who don't believe in God can know right from wrong. Scroll Down to Listen . Controversial: Phil Robertson has developed a second career speaking at Christian events (seen here at one prior to his speech in Florida on Friday) The story begins with Robertson challenging his audience to make a bet with him: 'Two guys break into an atheist's home. He has a little atheist wife and two little atheist daughters. Two guys break into his home and tie him up in a chair and gag him.' With the unsettling scene set, Robertson carried on with his morality tale. 'Then they take his two daughters in front of him and rape both of them and then shoot them, and they take his wife and then decapitate her head off in front of him and then they can look at him and say, 'Isn't it great that I don't have to worry about being judged? Isn't it great that there's nothing wrong with this?'' Robertson said. 'There's no right or wrong, now, is it dude?'' To finish off his point and leave his audience in no doubt about his point, Robertson then took relish in describing a castration. 'Then you take a sharp knife and take his manhood and hold it in front of him and say, 'Wouldn't it be something if there was something wrong with this? But you're the one who says there is no God, there's no right, there's no wrong, so we're just having fun. We're sick in the head, have a nice day.' Outspoken: Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson (pictured here in Maryland in February) made another controversial speech in Florida on Friday . To finish off his modern-day parable, Robertson then said, 'If it happened to them, they probably would say, 'Something about this just ain't right.' This of course is just the latest in a long ling of controversial comments the Duck Dynasty star has made. In 2013 during a GQ interview he likened homosexuality to bestiality and adultery and also said that black people were happier before the civil rights movement. In response to the speech, the Friendly Atheist blog said that Robertson probably doesn't know any atheists and therefore is unqualified to make his damning assessment. 'I don't know a single atheist or agnostic who thinks that terrorizing, raping, torturing, mutilating, and killing people is remotely OK, and I frankly think that Robertson doesn't either,' wrote the blog.","Duck Dynasty patriarch exercised his First Amendment rights again at Florida Christian meeting .

"A convicted sex offender who had been on the run for two months was found in a hidden room that he apparently built at his wife's Illinois home. Shawn Lipsey, a 40-year-old father, was convicted in November of six counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child and two counts of indecent solicitation of a child. He was released on bail but failed to appear at a January sentencing hearing, The Aurora Beacon-News reported. Arrested: Shawn Lipsey, left, was found hiding in a secret room at his wife's home, two months after he failed to turn up to a sentencing hearing. His wife, Raissa Jarosz-Lipsey, right, has also been arrested . But this week, authorities received a tip that he was at his wife's home in Newark, about 50 miles southwest of Chicago. He was taken into custody following a SWAT raid on the home. 'It was wild,' said Kendall County sheriff's Deputy Bryan Harl. 'Lipsey was located in the home, hiding in a specially constructed room. He made a fake wall, and it had hinges. He was hiding behind it.' The room looked lived-in, Harl said. Deputies don't know how long Lipsey had been hiding inside the home, which is on a rural road near just a handful of other houses. 'Once we located him, Lipsey surrendered and was taken into custody,' Harl said. 'There was no resistance. There was no fighting.' On the run: Lipsey had been convicted of multiple sex offences in November but then went into hiding . Hidden: Lipsey was kept inside a home on this quiet street in Newark, Illinois, but it is not clear for how long . The team looking for him included officers from the Kendall County Sheriff's Office, the county's Cooperative Assistance Team and U.S. marshals. He remains in custody on a no-bond warrant and faced a hearing on Friday afternoon. His wife, Raissa Jarosz-Lipsey, 40, was also charged with obstruction of justice, concealing or aiding a fugitive and filing a false police report for allegedly knowing where he was when she reported him missing. Her bail has been set at $500,000 and she remains in custody.","Shawn Lipsey was found living behind a wall with hinges in his wife's Newark, Illinois home on Tuesday after a tipster alerted authorities .

"We've all been tightening our belts for a few years and judging by the Chancellor’s trousers, so has he. But now things are looking up, perhaps Mr Osborne could afford to pop out and buy a pair of suit trousers that actually reach his shoes. While he undoubtedly hoped the country would be listening to what he had to say, many seemed more interested in what he was wearing. We've all been tightening our belts for a few years and judging by the Chancellor’s trousers, so has he . In fact, his half-mast turn-ups attracted almost as many comments among Twitter users as some of his Budget measures. Some accused him of looking like a schoolboy while others pointed to the fact that his navy blue suit, unusually, had three buttons rather than the standard two and curiously high lapels. The budget suit – accessorised with a sombre, pale grey tie - provoked the strongest reaction on Twitter yesterday. While some users complimented him on the cut, many more questioned his ‘strange’ choice. It is not known from where Mr Osborne bought his unorthodox suit. His father, Sir Peter Osborne, is said to favour Savile Row tailors Richard James where a navy ‘160s’ suit costs £1,150 and Turnbull and Asser shirts £145. George Osborne's half-mast turn-ups attracted almost as many comments on Twitter as his Budget measures . Some even accused Mr Osborne, 43, of wearing make-up, pointing to what appeared to be a tell-tale foundation line along his jaw, while his hair was compared to that of Hollywood star Antonio Banderas. It is not the first time his appearance has attracted comments. By 2014 his rather full figure of the year before had been replaced by his current slim look thanks to him adopting the fashionable 5:2 diet. In an interview last year, he said he had lost two stone on the diet, popular with celebrities, after seeking advice from his doctor. It involved him limiting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week but eating normally on the other five. He was also seen jogging around St James’s Park, across the road from the Treasury and changed his haircut, favouring a shorter crop, part of an apparent bid to appear more youthful. His new look is said to be down to one of his senior government aides, Thea Rogers. She used to work as a producer for BBC political editor Nick Robinson before Mr Osborne hired her to overhaul his image. His look yesterday was a far cry from his appearance back in 2010, when he first took up the government post and favoured a slightly more old fashioned hair-cut and suit.","Chancellor's half-mast trousers attracted more comments than Budget .

"A 25-year-old nurse who dated Sanford Rubenstein is claiming the 70-year-old New York civil rights attorney begged her to stage an orgy - just a month after he was cleared of rape allegations. Laura Abraham told the New York Post that when she tried to break up with the multimillionaire lawyer, he suggested that she should round up several male friends and have an orgy. She claims the attorney said he wanted to watch her have sex with multiple men at once. 'He wanted me to be a live porno star in front of him. ...I told him that’s not something I ever fantasized about,' she told the newspaper. Sanford Rubenstein, a prominent civil rights attorney who works with Rev. Al Sharpton, was accused of rape in October, but later cleared . She also claims that Rubenstein tried to give her money to buy drugs for her to take - but she refused. Abraham says her romance with Rubenstein was unfolding as he was defending himself against accusations he had raped an unconscious Macy's executive after taking her home from his pal Rev. Al Sharpton's birthday party in October. Rubenstein, who won tens of millions of dollars pursuing police brutality lawsuits with the help of Sharpton, was cleared in January after investigators concluded there was not enough evidence to charge him. Rubenstein vehemently denied the rape allegations and said the sex was consensual. Abraham says she met Rubenstein in November and finally ended things last week. She says they occasionally shared a bed - but that she never had sex with him. Through his attorney Ben Brafman, Rubenstein confirmed to the Post that he had a 'brief personal relationship' with Abraham. However, he called Abraham's allegations 'ridiculous' and 'patently false.' Brafman referred to Abraham as a 'scorned woman.' Rubenstein and Abraham were pictured together at a hotel in South Beach in Miami at the end of February. She says that she never was sexually attracted to him - but that she met him once a week for dinner or to hang out at his Manhattan apartment. She says his indecent proposal came around Valentine's Day when she tried to end things. 'He said, ""It’s OK if you don’t want to be exclusive anymore, because I would love to see you have sex with multiple men at the same time...""' she told the Post. Despite turning him down, Abraham continued to see the wealthy septuagenarian lawyer. She claims the final straw came when he encouraged her to do molly - the potent powdered form of the party drug MDMA - and tried to give her cash so she could buy it. She claims he wanted her to get high so he could 'have his way' with her.","Laura Abraham, 25, says she started dating Rubenstein while he was defending himself from rape allegations .

"Dressed in seductive corsets, fishnet tights and glittering heels, they enticed audiences at burlesque theaters with strip shows. And decades on, these former burlesque dancers - some of whom are aged over 90 - have shown they can still draw attention and strike a pose. The pensioners, who were successful performers in their heyday, were photographed by Marie Baronnet for her book, Legends: The Living Art of Risqué. While some are pictured flashing their flesh in sensual bodices, others are seen donning less revealing, but just as glamorous, gowns and jackets. Striking: La Savona is among many ex-burlesque dancers pictured by Marie Baronnet for her book, Legends: The Living Art of Risqué .

Born performer: While some of the women are seen flashing their flesh, others are donning less revealing, but just as glamorous, costumes. Above, Bambi Jones is pictured posing outside her home in Henderson, Nevada, in 2012, donning a skimpy pink outfit . And one particularly brave woman is captured wearing only black underwear and leopard-print heels (with a pair of sunglasses completing her look). Speaking to CNN,  Ms Baronnet said that despite all being over the age of 65, the women are 'very self-sufficient', with a wealth of knowledge. 'I really enjoyed being around those women,' she told the news station. 'I found that they had a real knowledge of life but also of this work. 'We would put on the costumes and makeup, we'd do the hair and the lights, and then suddenly they would just know how to move.' The LA-based photographer described the pensioners as charismatic, rhythmic and artistic - three things that she said are vital for burlesque dancing. 'They have to have personality and rhythm, they have to know how to dance, and they have to be an artist because they have to do all those costumes and create a choreography,' she said, explaining how stripteases empowered many women in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, often enabling them to travel abroad.

But while the women thrived off enticing audiences with glamorous, feathery outfits during these decades, they were soon asked to bare more flesh. They were told by their bosses to throw away their outfits and 'show more' amid an influx of strip clubs across the US in the 80s, Ms Baronnet said. The transition, she told CNN, was extremely difficult for many of the performers, some of whom were in their later forties and early fifties by this point. It caused some retire from their beloved profession.

"A new tax by the European Commission could see 80 per cent of small cider producers affected . Four out of five British cider makers would be put out of business after a new ruling by the European Commission. The UK government was formally told last week to change its current excise duty, which means cider makers that produce less than 70 hectolitres (12,000 pints) a year do not have to pay duty. Changes to the 39-year-old exemption is likely to affect 80 per cent of Britain's 480 cider and perry makers, according to the National Association of Cider Makers (NACM). In a statement, the European Commission, said it was 'unanimously agreed' that the UK excise duty scheme contravenes EU legislation. It said: 'EU excise duty rules oblige Member States to levy an excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages. 'There are no provisions which would provide for an exception to the general obligation to levy excise duty in respect of cider and perry made for sale by small domestic producers.' David Kaspar runs a small apple juice, cider and perry business in Brookthorpe, Gloucestershire, and makes under 170 hectolitres of cider from the 16 acre orchard to sell at markets and a pub. He told the Observer the tax introduction would be 'another nail in the coffin'. 'The exemption is fundamental to keeping craft cider-making going. If we had to pay an extra £2,500 it would probably stop us risking making wooden-barrel cider and perry because it's too fragile. 'It would be very sad if the tax came in. Not just for financial reasons. It would hasten the demise of traditional orchards and would be another nail in the coffin of traditional cider-making and would be a loss to the natural habitat.' The volume of cider produced annually in the UK is in excess of 6 million hectolitres or 130 million UK gallons, according NACM. Some have blamed the industrial-scale cider makers who account for the production of 130 million gallons of cider in the UK every year for the intervention by the EC, according to the paper. The European Commission, said it was 'unanimously agreed' that the UK excise duty scheme contravenes EU legislation. Currently those that produce less than 70 hectolitres do not have to pay an excise duty . Simon Russell, spokesperson for NACM, told the Financial Times: 'We will make the positive case for the effect of the exemption to be protected whether by retaining the existing legislation or by other means.' The Treasury has been given two months to respond to the commission without a 'satisfactory response'  the Commission may refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. A Treasury spokesperson said: 'The government's support for small cider makers has helped create a diverse and vibrant market, improving consumer choice and creating jobs. 'While we will study the commission's arguments carefully, our support for this industry will continue.'","Commission said UK must change its current excise duty for cider makers .

"A New York mother claims her daughter was left partially paralyzed by a marijuana-infused brownie she bought at her high school. Danieel Buchanan, 17, was sold the snack by a classmate at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn on February 27, thinking its ingredients were innocent. But the teenager started to feel sick soon after and went to the school nurse with a racing heart rate and high blood pressure. Scroll down for video . Concern: Danieel Buchanan, 17, was sold a pot brownie at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn. She fell sick soon after and her mother claims she has been partially paralyzed ever since . The school then called her mother Allison at 11am to say they were taking her daughter to the emergency room at Brooklyn Hospital. After an initial check-up she was released into her parents' care - but her condition started to dramatically deteriorate. Her mother told PIX 11 she couldn't walk by herself, could barely eat and could only handle a few sips of tea at a time. At 3am the next morning, she took the youngster to Beth Israel in Manhattan, but was quickly transferred to nearby Mount Sinai. Her mother says when Danieel arrived she began convulsing and has been partially-paralyzed ever since. 'She’s not able to walk. She can’t stand. She can’t sit up,' Mrs Buchanan told the station. 'They have never seen anything like this before.' Blood tests revealed she had marijuana in her system - but no other drugs were present. Impact: The teenager is being treated in Mount Sinai hospital in New York. Her mother claims she cannot sit up by herself, walk or eat properly . Action: The 18-year-old student who sold her the brownie at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn has been suspended and the NYPD are investigating the incident . Mrs Buchanan insists she has never been involved in drugs or alcohol before and doesn't have any underlying health problems. 'She didn't know it had weed in there, she thought it was just a regular brownie,' Mrs Buchanan said. Doctors told her she needed rehabilitative therapy, but her insurance company , Empire Blue Cross, Blue shield, has denied her the coverage. The Daily Mail Online has contacted them for comment.

"Barbaric Islamic State militants have dealt yet another blow to Christian history in Iraq by using explosives to destroy the 4th Century Mar Benham monastery. The ancient building, built by Assyrian king Senchareb 1,600 years ago, stood in the Christian-dominated town of Bakhdida, just 20 miles south east of oil rich ISIS stronghold Mosul. Locals took to social media to share images of the massive blast, which reduced the ancient monastery to little more than vast piles of rubble. The attack was later confirmed by Kurdish journalists familiar with developments in the city. Blast: The ancient building, built by Assyrian king Senchareb 1,600 years ago, stood in the Christian-dominated town of Bakhdida, just 20 miles south east of oil rich ISIS stronghold Mosul . Up in smoke: Locals took to social media to share images of the massive blast, which reduced the ancient monastery to little more than vast piles of rubble . Barbaric: Islamic State militants dealt yet another blow to Christian history in Iraq this week by using explosives to destroy the 4th Century Mar Benham monastery . Mar Benham monastery was captured by ISIS last July in a lightning advance that saw the militants seize control of vast swathes of northern Iraq - including the country's second largest city, Mosul. Resident monks who live in the building - which is also known as the Monastery of the Martyrs Saint Behnam and his Sister Sarah, and was once visited by thousands of Christians and Muslims every year - were subsequently forced to leave and flee to nearby Christian villages. The destruction of the religious building was subsequently confirmed by Barzan Sadiq, executive producer at Kurdish Rudaw media network, according to the International Business Times. '#ISIS blew the monastery of the two martyrs ""Mar Behnam & His sister Sarah Mart"",which dates back to the fourteenth century eastern #Mosul,' he was quoted as saying on Twitter, citing the Islamic calender. The destruction of the monastery came just days it was claimed that 'ancient' statues infamously filmed being smashed to pieces by ISIS militants in a Mosul museum were all worthless fakes. The terrorist organisation  released shocking footage at the end of February purportedly showing jihadis destroying 3,000-year-old artworks with sledgehammers in their northern Iraqi stronghold. But Baghdad museum director Fawzye al-Mahdi ridiculed the propaganda exercise, claiming the genuine priceless Assyrian and Akkadian statues and sculptures are still safely in his possession in the Iraqi capital, adding that those in Mosul were plaster cast replicas.

Real: An ISIS militant uses a power tool to destroy a 7th century winged-bull Assyrian protective deity. The statue is thought to have been one of only two genuine artifacts destroyed by ISIS in the video . The destruction of the monastery emerged as the United Nations human rights office said that ISIS fighters may have committed genocide against the minority Yezidi community in Iraq as well as crimes against humanity and war crimes against civilians including children. In a report based on interviews with more than 100 alleged victims and witnesses, it urged the U.N. Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court for prosecution of perpetrators. The report also said Iraqi government forces and affiliated militias 'may have committed some war crimes' while battling the insurgency. The U.N. Human Rights Council launched its inquiry in September after the Islamist militant group Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, seized large swathes of northern Iraq. The oil-rich northern Iraqi city of Mosul is a notorious stronghold for the Islamic State terrorist organisation . Stronghold: Last summer ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) made his first and so far only filmed public appearance when he delivered a firebrand sermon in Mosul's Great Mosque . The report said the Council had found 'information that points to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes', and that the Security Council should 'consider referring the situation in Iraq to the International Criminal Court'. There was a 'manifest pattern of attacks' by Islamic State on Yezidis as well as Christians and other minorities as it laid siege to towns and villages in Iraq. The U.N. investigators also cited allegations that ISIL had used chlorine gas, a prohibited chemical weapon, against Iraqi soldiers in the western province of Anbar in September. Captured women and children were treated as 'spoils of war', and often subjected to rape or sexual slavery, it said. The report said that ISIL's Islamic sharia courts in Mosul had also meted out cruel punishments including stoning and amputation. 'Thirteen teenage boys were sentenced to death for watching a football match,' it said. The U.N. investigators said it was 'widely alleged' that Iraqi government forces had used barrel bombs, an indiscriminate weapon banned by international law, but this required further investigation.","Jihadis used explosives to destroy Mar Benham monastery in Bakhdida .

"Once upon a time, the Borscht Belt beat with life. Resorts dotting the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York were filled with families spending their summer days swimming in pools, and their nights dancing in clubs or watching stand-up from soon-to-be-famous comedians.

"Josh Campbell, who has anger management issues, injured the infant by his rough handling of it, a court heard . A man who broke a baby's arm and leg through  'reckless cruelty' has been spared jail. Doctors said the infant's broken leg may have been caused by Josh Campbell 'yanking' it out of its cot, while its broken arm appeared to be the result of a 'forceful rapid rotation injury'. But Campbell, who has anger management issues, denied yanking the baby, telling the court he had lifted it out its cot by its arms. At Newcastle Crown Court, the 20-year-old pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of 'reckless rough handling'. He was allowed to walk free from court after he was handed a suspended sentence. Michael Hodson, prosecuting, said: 'The Crown are opening the case on the basis of rough handling and reckless behaviour. 'The Crown say there was not deliberate pulling in order to hurt the child, but an impatience to get the child to do what the defendant ignorantly thought the child ought to be able to bear. 'It's clear the defendant has a short fuse and can be an angry individual who has a problem with his temper, especially when drunk. 'When he was told about the injuries he became very silent and dropped his head.' Newcastle Crown Court heard how the baby was taken to hospital because it's right arm was not moving freely and X-rays discovered fractures to the arm and leg. Campbell from South Shields, who admitted child cruelty, was given an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, with supervision and 150 hours of unpaid work. Judge Robert Adams told Campbell: 'You accept you were too rough. The child suffered two separate fractures. 'I accept that you bitterly regret this, it is clear from your letter. You were 19 at the time, you are now 20, have clearly grown up and are determined to put this behind you. But the 20-year-old denied yanking the baby's leg at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) and pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of 'reckless rough handling' 'I don't consider you are a dangerous offender and sending you to immediate custody is going to achieve very little in this case.' Katherine Dunn, defending, said: 'He is a 20-year-old man who is young, immature and naive. 'The injuries were caused when he was roughly handling the child. He has learned a very harsh lesson indeed.'","Josh Campbell had broken the infant's leg and arm lifting it out of its cot .

"Draft legislation aimed at boosting a flagging birth rate threatens to reduce Iranian women to 'baby-making machines' and set their rights back by decades, Amnesty International warned on Wednesday. The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures.","Draft legislation aimed at boosting a flagging birth rate  has come under fire .

"It is a sight to make every man around the world wince in sympathy. A Chinese builder was left in agony when he impaled his genitals on a steel rod. Wu Hsing, 40, had reportedly tried to jump between two beams at a building site in the city of Zhangzhou in south-eastern China's Fujian province. But as he leapt from one to the other he slipped, plunging more than 6ft to the ground and landing crotch-first on the 7ft steel rod, reported People's Daily Online. Wu Hsing, 40, had to be rescued by firefighters after impaling his genitals on a steel rod, leaving the porr builder bloodied and pale with pain . Work pal Cheng Ni, 38, said: 'He was showing off his balancing skills and was doing a pretty good job until he missed his footing and slipped. 'When he landed, he let out a howl of such pain I thought the steel rod had gone right inside. Mind you what had happened was bad enough. 'I looked down and saw him sitting on the ground with this huge pole sticking out of his trousers. 'There was a lot of blood and he was very pale, sitting and staring at it.' When an ambulance arrived, paramedics sawed off the top and bottom of the steel rod before rushing Wu to hospital where surgeons were able to remove the rest. A hospital spokesman said: 'It was a very tricky operation as the rod had mangled his genital area. 'We had to make sure we didn't make the situation worse. 'It is too early to say if he will regain use of his reproductive organs but in the first instance he is incredibly lucky that the bar only penetrated there and didn't go through his body, or pierce his neck. 'It was long enough that it could have come out through his head.' The man is now recovering in hospital.","Wu Hsing, 40, reportedly tried to jump between two beams at building site .

"Almost half of all eight year olds and a third of children aged five have fillings or teeth missing because of tooth decay. Furthermore in 2013, 46 per cent of 15 year olds and 34 per cent of 12 year olds had 'obvious decay' in their permanent teeth. While high those figures do represent a slight reduction over the course of a decade, when the comparable figures were 56 per cent and 43 per cent respectively. The latest figures, published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, reveals children are so embarrassed by their rotting teeth that they try to avoid smiling or laughing. Scroll down for video . The Child Dental Health Survey has revealed almost half of all eight year olds and a third of children aged five have fillings or teeth missing because of tooth decay . Various levels of decay affect different parts of the tooth, the initial stages wearing away at the enamel, while more serious forms attack the dentine and pulp, pictured . The survey of more than 13,500 children and nearly 10,000 dental examinations found dental decay was most pronounced in lower income families - where children are eligible for free school meals. Of those a sample size of 9,866 were surveyed and underwent an examination. Around 40 per cent of five year olds from more deprived families had tooth decay, compared with 29 per cent from less deprived families. In addition, 59 per cent of 15 year olds from deprived families had tooth decay, compared with 43 per cent from better off families. Meanwhile Northern Ireland is uncovered as the childhood tooth decay capital of the UK, with 72 per cent of 15 year olds suffering oral disease. In England that figure is 44 per cent, and Wales it is 63 per cent. But while remaining high, the levels have fallen since 2003 when the comparable figures were 78 per cent, 55 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively. The Child Dental Health Survey reveals a promising trend, experts said, with the extend and severity of tooth decay in permanent teeth of children aged 12 and 15 falling. The Child Dental Health Survey examined the prevalence, severity and extent of dental caries, also known as tooth decay. Each tooth is classified based on how decayed it is. Three components qualify as  different levels of decay. They are: . But they warned large swathes of the childhood population 'continue to be affected by disease, and the burden of disease is substantial in those children that have it'. Tooth decay was still found in 34 per cent of 12-year-olds (compared to 43 per cent in 2003) and 46 per cent of 15-year-olds (56 per cent in 2003). Just 38 per cent of children were classed as having good overall oral health, meaning they had no obvious decay, no tooth surface loss into the dentine, which is the layer under the tooth enamel, and no tartar. In July the HSCIC published figures that showed the number of admissions for dental problems, among five to nine year olds rose from 22,574 in 2010-11 to 25,812 in 2013-14. Acting chief dental officer for NHS England Serbjit Kaur said: 'These results are very encouraging and are a credit to the dental profession and all those who promote dental health. 'There have been significant reductions in the numbers of 12 and 15-year-olds with obvious decay in their adult teeth. 'Future progress requires further work on prevention and a joined-up approach to dental care and wider health and social care services for children, as set out in the Five Year Forward View.' The survey also highlighted how girls are better at brushing their teeth, with 69 per cent of boys aged 12 saying they brush at least twice a day, compared to 85 per cent of girls. Sugary drinks were also found to be a cause for concern, with 16 per cent of 12 year olds and 14 per cent of 15 year olds saying they drink the beverages at least four times a day. The 2013 survey is the fifth in a series of national children's dental health surveys that have been carried out every ten years since 1973, focusing on the dental health of five, eight, 12 and 15 year olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Dr Sandra White, director of dental public health at Public Health England (PHE), said: 'PHE welcomes the overall fall in tooth decay levels and the fact that more and more children are brushing their teeth twice a day and regularly visiting the dentist. The diagram above reveals the various stages of tooth decay. The survey found in 2013, 46 per cent of 15 year olds and 34 per cent of 12 year olds had 'obvious decay' in their permanent teeth . Girls were found to be better at brushing their teeth, with 69 per cent of boys aged 12 saying they brush at least twice a day, compared to 85 per cent of girls . 'However, children from low-income families are twice as likely to have tooth decay, which is not only painful but can require hospital treatment and also affects their confidence and self-esteem, so there is no room for complacency. 'Tooth decay is a serious, preventable disease and this survey echoes the need to urgently reduce the amount of sugary snacks and drinks in our children's diets.' Anna Bradley, chair of Healthwatch England, said: 'Tooth decay is preventable as long as parents have the right information about and access to NHS dentists. 'Yet we know from local Healthwatch research into dentist access that some parents can't find a dentist who will treat their children on the NHS and others don’t know when to take their child to the dentist. 'It seems that, as a result, children with tooth decay are increasingly needing emergency dental treatments in hospital. 'Last year alone 26,000 five-nine year olds required emergency dental surgery. 'It’s crucial that information about which dentists are available to NHS patients is up-to-date and there is good information for parents about how to care for their children's teeth. 'This means decay can be prevented and there is no need resort to emergency A&E treatments when decay has already set in.'","Child Dental Health Survey shows 46% of 15 year olds and 34% of 12 year olds had 'obvious decay' in their permanent teeth .

"Tony Abbott has pleaded with Labor to back legislation to crack down on illegal firearms, which will be reintroduced to parliament this week. The coalition will again push for a mandatory five-year minimum sentences for traffickers by tabling legislation already rejected by the Senate in February. The prime minister on Sunday called on Labor to support the tough new gun laws, saying it was crucial to cracking down on criminals involved in the illegal firearms trade. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (L) and Attorney General George Brandis (R) at the Australian Federal Police Headquarters . 'I say to Bill Shorten and the Labor Party, if you're fair dinkum about protecting our community from gun crime you should support these mandatory minimum sentences for people who traffic in illegal firearms,' he told reporters in Sydney. Labor voted against the measures earlier this year, citing an opposition to mandatory sentences. But Mr Abbott said Labor had supported mandatory minimum sentencing for people smugglers when it was in government, and should back its gun trafficking legislation. 'The Labor Party to its credit has a fair record in this parliament on national security,' he said. There are an estimated 250,000 illegal firearms in Australia . 'I don't believe you can properly separate out this crackdown on illegal trafficking in firearms from our overall national security effort.' But shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus ruled out support for the measure, saying heavy penalties already existed for firearms trafficking. 'There is no evidence that mandatory minimum sentences work as a deterrent,' Mr Dreyfus said. Greens' senator Penny Wright said she was she did not believe tougher gun sentences would make Australia a safer place. The coalition will again push for a mandatory five-year minimum sentences for traffickers by tabling legislation already rejected by the Senate in February . 'Tougher sentencing for trafficking is not the way to address gun crime in Australia,' she said. 'While more certainly needs to be done to stop illegal imports, many illicit firearms are actually stolen from legitimate sources or taken from the 'grey market', including the gun used in the Sydney siege. 'Tackling gun crime requires a multi-faceted approach, not national security scaremongering.' There are an estimated 250,000 illegal firearms in Australia.

"A bond between two longtime family friends has deepened after both Michigan men received organs from the same donor. Fred Nelis, 60, of Holland, got a new heart, while 67-year-old Gordon Veldman of Pentwater, got a new pair of lungs. The operations were held at the exact same time at a Grand Rapids hospital last June. Nelis and Veldman have been close friends for over a decade, however their transplants were completely coincidental. Incredible bond: Gordon Veldman and Fred Nelis have been friends for over a decade, but now consider themselves 'organ brothers' after each received a transplant from the same donor last June, saving their lives . Lifesaving operation: Fred Nelis, 60, underwent a heart transplant after living with idiopathic cardiomyopathy for the last 20 years . On-the-mend: Gordon Veldman, 67, received a lung transplant to escape a genetic disease that reduced his lung capacity to 15 percent last year . The medical director of the heart and lung transplant program at Spectrum Health says it was the program's first simultaneous friend-transplant that he's aware of. 'It's pretty wild,' Dr. Michael Dickinson told The Grand Rapids Press. 'We thought it was quite a remarkable story when it happened. 'It's nice for us because it kind of shows the growth of the program - that we were able to help both of these two friends right here in West Michigan.' Both men suffered from chronic conditions that caused their health to rapidly deteriorate before their transplants. Nelis has been suffering for 20 years with idiopathic cardiomyopathy - a progressive heart disease with an unknown cause. Then in 2013 he developed atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat, and was placed on the heart transplant in March 2014. 'Organ brothers': Godron Veldman (left) and Fred Nelis (right) say they now put their heart and lungs together each time they see each other to show how thankful they are for their transplants . Veldman has a genetic disease called Alpha-1, which would potentially destroy his lungs, and caused him to develop emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One year ago his lung capacity fell to 15 percent, making everyday talks like walking incredibly difficult. 'The end was very near,' he said. 'I probably had two months left.' Then on June 18, 2014, both men received a call - the wait was over. They were both admitted to Spectrum Health and underwent transplants, with Nelis getting a new heart and Veldman new lungs. New lease on life: Fred Nelis was a competitive swimmer for 40 years, before developing heart issues . Both have rebounded since the operations. The men known little about their 32-year-old donor, however were able to send a letter to the man's family through Gift of Life Michigan. Veldman said that he and Nelis put their new heart and lungs as close as they can every time they meet. 'We got a gift, and it's best that we treat it as such,' Nelis said. Grateful: Gordon Veldman (left) and Fred Nelis (right) say a single organ donor saved them both .

"The father of a Scottish woman who fled to join Islamic State has denied she was involved in recruiting three London schoolgirls believed to have travelled to Syria. Aqsa Mahmood, 20, left her home in Glasgow in November 2013 and married an IS militant the following February. Today, her parents told ITV News she had been in contact with them to deny recent reports that she had encouraged Bethnal Green Academy students Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16 and Amira Abase, 15, to join the radical Islamist group. Scroll down for video . The father of jihadi bride Aqsa Mahmood (pictured left and right) denies she was involved in recruiting three London schoolgirls believed to have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State . Muzaffar Mahmood said his daughter had claimed she didn't even know the names of the girls, and he added that he believed her. 'She texted when this was going on,' he said. 'She was never in contact with them and I believe her. 'A lot of press - everything happening is Aqsa Mahmood.' But after the girls went missing last month, it emerged that Shamima had messaged a Twitter account belonging to Mahmood asking her to follow her. She did so, opening a private line of communication. At the time, the family expressed their horror that she may have been involved in recruiting the girls and branded her a 'disgrace'. Muzaffar Mahmood said his daughter had contacted the family to insist she didn't know the names of the missing London schoolgirls, and he said he believed her . Aqsa's mother Khalida Mahmood also called for her daughter to leave Syria and return to Britain . Shamima Begum, 15, sent an open message (pictured) to Aqsa Mahmood, 20, who had fled to Syria from Glasgow to be a 'jihadi bride' in 2013, asking her to open a private line of communication . But today, Mr Mahmood said: 'They are making her…everything happening is Aqsa Mahmood. 'Security services…if they know anything they should come out with it. 'She was very angry with me that 'why are you not standing up for me? I wasn't in contact. I don't even know their names. 'That's what she told us. We feel really bad when we hear in the press that she recruited them. 'We regret what she is doing and we condemn what's going on over there but she hasn't been in touch with them [the runaway girls] at all. It's very painful.' The former diagnostic radiography student had been educated at a top private school in the city, but after joining the terror group, began tweeting under the nom de guerre Umm Layth. She posted a series of radical messages, including a call for others to copy the shocking murder of soldier Lee Rigby, the Boston Marathon bombing and the massacre at the Fort Hood US Army base in Texas. Kadiza Sultana, 16 (left), Amira Abase, 15 (centre) and Shamima Begum, 15 (right), all pupils at Bethnal Green Academy in east London, are believed to have travelled to Syria as jihadi brides . Clutching their luggage, the three teenage friends were pictured preparing to board a flight to Istanbul, Turkey . Mahmood has also posted a series of blog posts entitled 'Diary of a Muhajirah' instructing young women on how to prepare for life in Syria and what to do expect there. She also wrote a guide on how to be a war widow in January, sparking rumours her extremist husband has been killed. After the former student's identity was revealed in the media last September, her family branded her a 'bedroom radical' and condemned her actions. Sharmeena Begum was named as the first of four Bethnal Green Academy schoolgirls to have fled home to join IS . At a press conference, they said: ‘We still love you Aqsa but we now have to put your family, your brother and sisters first as you have betrayed us, our community and the people of Scotland when you took this step. ‘All parents want to be proud of their children but sadly we feel nothing but sorrow and shame for Aqsa. 'Aqsa you have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever, please come home.’ Her family said Mahmood was ‘brainwashed and deluded’ but maintained there was no individual to be blamed for her radicalisation. But today, when asked if there was anything that pointed to her being radicalised, Mr Mahmood said: 'This is something we want to know. She did pray and wore a scarf. 'Freedom of expression and she's allowed to do that. There's nothing wrong with that, we never see she's going that far. 'That's something we're still trying to find out. Who are these people radicalising all the children here and why is something not happening to them? Where are people going all the time? 'There are people here who are doing this. And police and security services? We've not had any answers yet.' Mr Mahmood pointed the finger at intelligence services for failing to discover who was 'radicalising our children', and claimed he and his wife had simply given their daughter freedoms afforded in any 'normal' family. He also criticised British police for not doing more to 'save our daughter' when she initially made the journey. His comments come after the families of the three London schoolgirls appeared before appeared before the House of Commons home affairs committee this week. And the country’s top police officer was forced to apologise to their families over a misplaced letter relating to a fourth girl’s disappearance, who was identified this week as Sharmeena Begum. The report will air on ITV News at 6.30pm and Ten and can be found online at itv.com/news . Khadiza's cousin Fahmida Aziz (left), Shamima's sister Sahima Begum (centre) and Amira's father Hussen Abase (right), appeared before the House of Commons home affairs committee this week . Bethnal Green Academy student Shamima Begum, 15, sent an open message to Aqsa Mahmood, 20, who had fled to Syria from Glasgow to be a 'jihadi bride' in 2013, asking her to open a private line of communication. Four days later, the teenager flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey with friends Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15. Last month, a lawyer for Mahmood's family said they were 'full of horror and anger' that she was being allowed by Twitter to 'recruit and encourage' others to travel to Syria. 'You are a disgrace': The family of Aqsa Mahmood (pictured) said they are 'incredulous' that her messages are not being checked and her victims' families did not get a 'knock at the door' Aamer Anwar said they were 'incredulous' that her messages were not being checked and her victims' families did not get a 'knock at the door'. He said the grooming of children through Twitter by terrorists was 'tantamount to child abuse'. The family's statement in full: . 'The family of Aqsa Mahmood are full of horror and anger that their daughter may have had a role to play in the recruitment of these young girls to ISIS. They are not sure how much more misery that Aqsa can inflict on her own family but the fact that she is now accused of destroying other families is beyond the pale. However the Security Services have serious questions to answer- Aqsa's social media has been monitored since she disappeared over a year ago, yet despite alleged contact between the girls and Aqsa, they failed to stop them from leaving the UK to Turkey a staging post for Syria. Sadly despite all the Government's rhetoric on ISIS, if they can't even take basic steps to stop children leaving to join ISIS, what is the point of any new laws? As for Aqsa- you are a disgrace to your family and the people of Scotland, your actions are a perverted and evil distortion of Islam. You are killing your family every day with your actions, they are begging you stop if you ever loved them.'","Aqsa Mahmood left Glasgow in November 2013 and married an IS militant .

"WhatsApp has overtaken traditional mobile phone texts for the first time as users send 30 billion messages every. The app allows people to send instant messages and photographs via the internet rather without incurring charges from their network provider. Its growing popularity saw people send 30 billion WhatsApp messages a day last year, compared to 20 billion SMS text messages, according to research by The Economist. WhatsApp has overtaken traditional mobile phone texts for the first time as users sent 30 billion messages every day . Messaging apps have exploded in popularity over the last few years thanks to the growth of smartphones and 3G and 4G allowing fast internet connection. But the move is predicted to hit telecoms firms hard. Research company Ovum found that the decline in the use of traditional text messages in favour of messaging apps was estimated to cost mobile network providers $54billion by 2016. WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly users and claims it is currently registering one million new users a day . Last month, WhatsApp, which was only founded in 2009, was bought by Facebook for $19 billion- the most ever paid for a venture-capital-backed company. It was the social networking giant's biggest acquisition to date. In a statement announcing the deal, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg described WhatsApp's services as 'incredibly valuable'. WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly users and claims it is currently registering one million new users a day.

"The families of three runaway schoolgirls who fled to Syria to join ISIS have issued a new appeal for their 'beloved' daughters to return home immediately. Describing their loss as 'more acute' on Mother's Day, the families of Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana, said they were praying for the 'immediate, safe return' of their children.

But the families today pledged to do 'everything possible' to ensure the girls returned back safely. In the joint statement, they said: 'We, the families of missing schoolgirls, pray for the immediate safe return of our beloved daughters. We feel our loss more acutely on Mothers-Day as we look over to their beds and see only the spaces left behind by them. 'We will continue to do everything we possibly can to ensure our girls are brought back to us safely.' The families also used the statement to again lash out at authorities, suggesting the school, Met Police and the local authority 'failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information'. They said: 'As parents, we expect the safeguarding of our children to be the top priority of schools and the local authority whilst our children are in their care. 'Had we been made aware of circumstances sooner, we ourselves could have taken measures to stop the girls from leaving the UK.' The schoolgirls are understood to now be in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK last month. The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes. Fahmida Aziz (left), cousin of Kadiza, Sahima Begum (centre), sister of Shamima, and Abase Hussen (right), father of Amira, gave evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee in the House of Commons last week . Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Metropolitan Police Commissioner (pictured at the Home Affairs Select Committee) said that, with the benefit of hindsight, officers should have communicated directly with the families . They were later seen on CCTV in Turkey, dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with Syria. They are believed to be staying with Sharmeena Begum, the fellow pupil from their school who went missing in December. Sharmeena Begum, the first of the schoolgirls to go to Syira, is thought to be in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa . The 15-year-old student, the first of the four to disappear from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, had not been identified by the authorities but was named this week. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has admitted that 'with the benefit of hindsight' officers should have communicated directly with the families. But he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology. However, the families refused to accept any responsibility for the teenagers' actions when they appeared before a committee of MPs earlier this month. Instead, they spent spent more than an hour castigating police over what they claimed was a failure to inform of their children's potential radicalisation. They were led by their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, once the representative of a close associate of the Woolwich killers, who repeatedly demanded an apology. The country's top police officer was later forced to apologise to the families over a misplaced letter relating to Sharmeena's disappearance, apologising that it 'didn't get through'. The  letter had been given to the three pupils instead of being sent directly to the parents, after the girl were spoken to by police as potential witnesses after she went missing. However, senior figures, led by David Cameron, have previously insisted parents must take responsibility and play their part in stopping the spread of militant beliefs. 'Everyone has a role to play,' said the Prime Minister. Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond echoed the comments saying: 'Parents have responsibilities, schools and community workers have responsibilities as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators.' 'We, the families of missing schoolgirls , pray for the immediate safe return of our beloved daughters. We feel our loss more acutely on Mothers-Day as we look over to their beds and see only the spaces left behind by them. 'As you can imagine, the last few weeks have been incredibly difficult. We would like to thank the public for their generosity of spirit and support in this most trying of times. 'With respect to the disappearance of our children we have been disappointed by the handling of this matter by the school, Met police and the local authority, all of whom we feel failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information to us or indeed between each other. 'As parents, we expect the safeguarding of our children to be the top priority of schools and the local authority whilst our children are in their care. Had we been made aware of circumstances sooner, we ourselves could have taken measures to stop the girls from leaving the UK. 'We note and appreciate Tower Hamlets Council's very recent attempt to educate parents with respect to such dangers with a pamphlet on radicalisation and extremism. Likewise, we appreciate the police's apology with respect to their mishandling. We hope other families won't have to bear the same pain that we are enduring at the moment, and that lessons are learned from our experience.

"Human rights campaigners have presented police with a 'dossier' of new evidence against a Bahraini prince accused of torture after he revealed on social media he was staying in London. Prince Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa, 27, accidentally let slip he was back in Britain on Thursday when he posted a video of himself running in Hyde Park. The prince posted the video on Instagram alongside a squadron of the Life Guards of the Household Cavalry with the caption: 'That's how it feels and sounds when you run in Hyde Park, London.' Prince Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa posted this video of himself running in Hyde Park on Thursday . The video was captioned: 'That's how it feels and sounds when you run in Hyde Park, London' He now faces fresh calls for his arrest following a High Court ruling last year which stripped him of diplomatic immunity. A Bahraini refugee in Britain, referred to only as FF, alleged Prince Nasser was involved in the torture of detained prisoners during 2011 Arab Spring protests. Today The Independent reported human rights lawyers acting for FF have delivered a 'dossier' of new evidence to Scotland Yard in a bid to have him charged following the revelation he is visiting the capital. Previous allegations which gave rise to the diplomatic immunity row did not stick. No charges were brought against him due to a lack of evidence and both he and the government of Bahrain strongly deny the accusations. The case arose after FF, who has been granted asylum in the UK, claims he was badly beaten - though not by the prince directly - and given a prison sentence after taking part in protests in the Gulf state in February 2011 which left dozens dead. Following the decision to revoke his diplomatic immunity in October last year, a spokeswoman for the Government of Bahrain said: 'As the British DPP has today affirmed, an arrest would have been improper given the absence of evidence of the conduct alleged. 'As Bahrain has never sought anonymity or sovereign immunity from the English Courts for anyone in respect of this case, it expresses no view on the DPP's statement that immunity was inappropriate. 'This has been an ill-targeted, politically-motivated and opportunistic attempt to misuse the British legal system. The Government of Bahrain again categorically denies the allegations against Sheikh Nasser.' Lawyers for Prince Nasser said: 'The allegations are entirely false and categorically denied by Prince Nasser. The presentation of the ""dossier"" to the police appears to be a politically-motivated and opportunistic attempt to use the British justice system once again to ventilate damaging allegations about Prince Nasser. 'FF stated last October that he intended to submit further evidence to the police, but some five months passed and nothing had been forthcoming until today. The timing of the actions of the campaigners suggests this is nothing more than a publicity stunt designed to coincide with Prince Nasser's visit to the UK and FF's lawyers' threatening earlier this week to bring judicial review proceedings in respect of the UK-Bahrain naval agreement. 'The police have previously declined to investigate Prince Nasser on the basis of the insufficiency of the evidence against him. The submission of this new dossier at this time coincides with other attempts by opposition activists to exploit the British justice system to influence UK-Bahraini relations.' Prince Nasser, born in May 1987, is the fourth son of the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and his second wife, Sheia bint Hasan Al-Khrayyesh Al-Ajmi of Kuwait. He was educated in Bahrain at the Ibn Khuldoon National School, before commissioning from Royal Sandhurst Military Academy in August 2006, two terms after Prince William. During his Sovereign's Parade, Prince Nasser was presented with the King Hussein Medal, awarded to the overseas officer cadet considered to be the most improved recruit. He currently serves as commander of Bahrain's Royal Guard and as president of the Bahrain Olympic Committee. Bahraini anti-government protesters wait at barriers they had set up for Saudi forces called in to  prop up the monarchy against demonstrations in 2011. The barrier in the foreground reads: 'Down with Hamad' Inspired by the Arab Spring, protesters in Bahrain had initially wanted to achieve greater political freedom and equality for the Shia muslims who form the majority of the population, as opposed to the ruling Sunni royal family. However, following an attack on protesters who had gathered at the Pearl Roundabout in Manama on February 17, 2011, demonstrators began to call for an end to Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa's rule. The following month 1,000 troops from Saudi Arabia and 500 troops from UAE arrived in Bahrain to quell the protests, and on March 15 the king of Bahrain declared martial law and a three-month state of emergency. A man identified only as FF was later granted refugee status in the UK, and from there, set about trying to bring charges against Prince Nasser. Claiming the prince should be held responsible for his beating and imprisonment during the turmoil, his accusations were stopped when the prince was granted diplomatic immunity. In October last year, this was overturned, creating the possibility - albeit an unlikely one - that he could be charged when travelling outside Bahrain. However, these charges collapsed due to a lack of evidence.","Bahrain's Prince Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa let slip he is visiting London .

"Usually when President Obama steps out on St Patrick's day, it's his brilliant green tie which steals the show. But today another accessory won the day - the enormous new 'smart watch' festooning the Commander-in-Chief's wrist. Obama was seen today wearing the hefty item - a Fitbit Surge device - as he walked around D.C. and met with Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, and later lunched with congressmen on Capitol Hill. Scroll down for video . New accessory: Obama sported the watch at a meeting today with Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland . Check it: Obama has recently said that he was considering getting a Fitbit, or its rival the Apple watch . Device: The Fitbit Surge, pictured above in publicity photos, monitors heart rate, sleep and even the location of those that wear it . The Fitbit surge is an advanced piece of wearable technology that constantly monitors the body of the person wearing it. It uses LED sensors to measure heart rate, and can function as a calorie counter and GPS device. It also tells the time. The Surge model is the largest and most sophisticated Fitbit model, and sells for around $250. Obama has previous expressed his interest in emergent 'wearable' technology. In a February interview with Re/code, he seemed torn between getting a Fitbit and an Apple watch. Testing it out: Obama . Suiting up: Obama was pictured earlier today with the watch while getting dressed . He said: 'I don’t have a Fitbit yet, but I work out hard. Word is these Apple Watches might be a good companion for my workouts. So I’m gonna see, I’m gonna test it out.' The testing had evidently begun by Tuesday, when Obama prominently wore the device for his public engagements. Fitbit enthusiasts are encouraged to even wear their device to sleep, where it collects data while the subject is unconscious, and can wake them up with silent, vibrating alarms. One feature the President may be particularly keen on is that the device is programmable to have a golf mode. Fitbits are set up to communicate with mobile devices regularly to store the data they collect - however the President is only allowed a Blackberry because of security concerns, which is incompatible with his new toy. Both the White House and Fitbit have yet to respond to requests for comment.","President wore $250 body-monitoring device around Washington, D.C.

"Robert Durst was denied bail in a New Orleans court room on Monday afternoon after a judge deemed him to be a potential danger to others and a likely flight risk. The real . estate scion, who is awaiting extradition to California to face a first-degree murder . charge, appeared on . local weapons charges in Louisiana. Durst, 71, who is being held in a psych prison ward, appeared in court wearing an orange jumpsuit with his head newly shaven and a surgery scar visible. He must remain in Louisiana on local weapons charges at least until his next court date on April 2, Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell ruled. 'There is a substantial risk the defendant might flee,' Cantrell said. Scroll down for videos . Murder suspect Robert Durst is seen with a newly-shaved head as he sits in a hearing in this court sketch in New Orleans on Monday. He was denied bail after the judge deemed him a flight risk and danger to others . Robert Durst grinned as he was escorted from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on March 17. He was denied bail on Monday and deemed a flight risk . Prosecutors said Durst was considered a flight risk after he dumped his cell phone on the way to New Orleans with five bags, ABC reported, and was found with a latex mask and bundles of cash in small bills. The 71-year-old, who has used aliases in the past, also had a Texas ID in a different name. Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, did not seek bail on Monday but argued his client's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier this month in New Orleans were improper. Durst's attorneys have said they plan to seek both to expedite his extradition to LA County, where he has been charged with the 2000 execution-style murder of longtime friend Susan Berman. The lawyers will also challenge the basis for his arrest on a Los Angeles County murder warrant earlier this month in New Orleans. The final installment of the HBO documentary, The Jinx: The . Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, broadcast evidence that Durst's . handwriting appeared to match that of Berman's likely killer. Susan Berman was found shot execution-style outside her home in LA in 2000. Her friend, Robert Durst, was charged with her murder . The 71-year-old's voice was then captured on a . microphone saying to himself that he had 'killed them all'. Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen . Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the . dismemberment killing of his male neighbor in Texas in 2003. Durst is long estranged from his powerful family with its billion-dollar New York real estate holdings. The final HBO episode aired one day after Durst's arrest at . a hotel in New Orleans, where he was staying under an assumed . name. He had in his possession more than $42,000 in cash, a . revolver, a stash of marijuana and a latex mask that could fit . over his neck and head, authorities have said. He had allegedly been withdrawing $9,000-a-day for more than a month. He also had an ID with the name, Everette Ward. FBI agents arrested Durst out of fear he would flee the . country, an FBI spokeswoman has said. They suggested that Durst may have been attempting to flee to Cuba, where direct, non-stop flights started from New Orleans last Saturday. Maps of New Orleans, Florida and Cuba were found in his hotel room, The New York Times reported. ABC reported that agents were unable to locate Durst in New Orleans and instead bumped into him in the lobby of a hotel. James O'Hern, an investigator for the local district attorney's office, testified that authorities tracked Durst down after he placed two calls from a phone at the hotel to the voicemail on his personal phone. They also found a piece of paper in his room with a tracking number for a package that authorities later seized and found to contain $117,000, O'Hern said. Durst faces local charges of one count of possession of a gun as a convicted felon and one count of possessing a weapon with a controlled substance. His lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, has expressed frustration with . the charges, saying he is eager to get Durst to California to . clear his name in Berman's killing. Durst was transferred last week to a facility 70 miles . outside of New Orleans equipped to handle acutely mentally ill . inmates after the local sheriff's office asserted he was . suicidal, a contention his lawyers disputed.

Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Manu Feildel had a noisy night out with his friends in the early hours of Sunday morning . The My Kitchen Rules star was partying at an apartment in Ben Buckler, North Bondi . 'To be involved in something like this where he's disturbing people in the middle of the night is unbelievably bad behaviour,' one neighbour told Daily Mail Australia. 'Here he is on television being portrayed as this respectable guy when he’s behaving like this. The fact that he’s bothering other people like this is not good enough.' The man renting the apartment only moved in this week and he is believed to be an employee at North Bondi Fish restaurant owned by another celebrity chef Matt Moran in North Bondi. Neighbours complained that they heard 'yelling and screaming' at the apartment Feildel was in . 'They kept everyone in the area awake. After the police arrived they were quiet though,' the neighbour said. Another neighbour said she could hear the revelry from across the street and that it was 'obviously a boy’s own night out'. 'They were screaming and shouting on the balcony. Manu was the ring leader. They were acting like teenagers – climbing on the balcony, gyrating and yelling out. They were very, very loud.

"The body of an ex-Royal Marine who was the first Briton to be killed while fighting against ISIS has been returned to his family in a special ceremony attended by hundreds of Syrian Kurds. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting alongside Kurdish forces in the frontline village of Tel Khuzela in Syria. His coffin, which was draped in both the Kurdish flag and the Union Jack, was handed over to his father and uncle in a special ceremony on the Syria-Iraq border yesterday. Scroll down for video .

Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting against ISIS in Syria . Soldiers turned out to form a guard of honour during the procession, while hundreds of Syrian Kurds lined the streets and waved brightly-coloured flags. The former Royal Marine, described as a 'one-man army' who was 'very angry about the Middle East', was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults. Prior to his death, he recorded video footage of himself – dressed in army fatigues – in which he said: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' His family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated to hear of his death. They were under the impression that he had left Britain in November last year to provide 'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine. Shortly after his death, Mr Scurfield's father Chris and uncle travelled out to Syria to try and repatriate his body. A Kurdish women stands beside the body of Mr Scurfield and pays her respects. It is not known when his body will be returned to his hometown in South Yorkshire and the Foreign Office has been unable to confirm . Mr Scurfield's coffin was carried into an ambulance by Kurdish fighters, who had gathered to pay respect . Mr Scurfield's coffin, which was draped in both the Union Jack and Kurdish flags, was taken to Erbil in Iraq . Mr Scurfield's body was taken to the Syrian-Iraqi border by car before being handed over to his family . Mr Scurfield described yesterday's ceremony as 'overwhelming' and said it was 'very special and very comforting' to his family. His son's coffin was draped with the Kurdish and Union Flags and hundreds of people, including Kurdish fighters in the region, watched as it was loaded onto an ambulance to be taken to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine. He had been training with the U.S. Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline. But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities. His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said, and his luggage, phone and laptop were examined. The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of ISIS, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland. It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. At one point during the procession, a woman dressed in a headscarf offered Mr Scurfield's devastated father support, by pulling him close to her and kissing him on the head. According to the Kurdish Female Fighters page on Facebook, those who gathered at the ceremony chanted ‘slogans of heroism’ as Mr Scurfield’s body was handed back to his family. The group said the chants included: ‘Oh immortal martyr! We swear by your blood, your blood will never be left on the ground, we will take your revenge and we will never forget you. 'With our life and with our blood we are with you, oh martyr.’ Another post by the Facebook group said: ‘The body of British YPG fighter Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, is on the way back to UK. ‘You will never be forgotten, you will always live in our hearts. ‘RIP Hero.’ It is believed that it will be some time before the fighter's body is repatriated to the UK, due to paperwork, and the Foreign Office refused to comment on the matter. Mr Scurfield, who was known as Kosta to his comrades, is the first Briton to be killed while fighting ISIS - also known as Islamic State - in Syria. The former drama student had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines, aged 21. However, he fled to Syria to fight alongside the Kurdish forces after becoming 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out by ISIS'. Hundreds of Kurdish women and soldiers turned out for the ceremony yesterday ahead of the repatriation .

Kurdish fighters formed a guard of honour (above) to pay their respects to Mr Scurfield during the ceremony . Mr Scurfield is said to have fled to Syria last November to fight alongside the Kurds against ISIS after becoming 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out' by the terror outfit. He died in mortar fire on March 2 . Mr Scurfield's body was transported to Semalka Gate at the Syria-Iraq border ahead of yesterday's ceremony . His family, including archaeologist parents Chris and Vicci and his student sister Georgianna, said they were heartbroken but proud of him. In a statement following his death they said: 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.' While high numbers of foreigners are known to have joined ISIS, around 100 Westerners - including several Britons - are thought to have travelled to fight alongside the Kurds. Last month, a 19-year-old serving British soldier was returned to his unit after joining the Kurdish peshmerga.","Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, was killed fighting against ISIS in Syria .

"Footage showing murderer Jodi Arias pleading for her life in a secret testimony has been released, in which she says she regrets stabbing her boyfriend to death, and calls her attempts to cover it up 'revolting'. Arias spoke before jurors in Phoenix, Arizona, last year - but only after demanding that journalists and film crews be barred from the court. She escaped the death penalty after jurors failed to reach a verdict in a sentencing retrial last week - because one member of the jury held out against executing her as punishment for killing Travis Alexander in 2008. At one point she said that seeing Alexander's family speak of their grief in court made her 'wish so badly that I could just take that away from them, and that I could reverse what I did.' Scroll down for video, and a full transcript of Arias's testimony . 'It was horrific': Jodi Arias watches the jury enter the courtroom for her sentencing phase retrial in Phoenix on Thursday morning . Secret testimony: Footage of Jodi Arias speaking before a jury has been released by an Arizona court. Arias, shown above on different days of the testimony, spoke on condition of media not being allowed to film - but a legal challenge forced the court to hand over records . The footage, recorded in October and November of last year, was only released after media organizations challenged the decision to allow the secret testimony, and asked for full records. Authorities at the Maricopa County Superior Court have now released video footage of Arias, in which she is questioned by defense attorneys. ABC News ran portions of the film on Friday. The questioning began with Arias openly admitting the murder - but saying she did not admit her guilt to anybody until 2010 because she was so shocked at herself. When asked why she did not confess immediately, she said: 'Because what I did was so horrific that I couldn't have - I could never have imagined myself doing that to another human being.' Alexander, 30, was found dead in a shower in his Phoenix-area home in 2008. He had been stabbed more than 20 times, his throat was cut almost from ear to ear, and he had been shot in the face. Together: The secret testimony included questions about Arias' time with Alexander, whom she repeatedly stabbed, then shot . She was then asked for her reaction to hearing of the grief of Alexander's family - and said that it made her wish she could undo the killing, which she claims was an act of self-defense. She said: ' I wish so badly that I could just take that away from them, and that I could reverse what I did, and that I could take away what all these people are feeling that I have hurt, including Travis. She also admitted lying to a detective, whom she called of her own volition, about the murder. When confronted with footage of interviews she gave, Arias branded herself 'revolting'. She said: 'It was something that I was years from being able to even come around to admitting to myself that I did something that horrible. '[Lying to police about the murder] is revolting. I look at that [footage], I just think about how stupid I was. 'I was lost - I think of what just those lies put so many people through, and I just wish I could - there are a lot of things I wish I could do over again, but that is just one of them.' When asked to recall photographs of Alexander's mutilated body, she said: 'I caused that pain, and those were his last moments; and it makes me sick and I wish so badly that I could just so that whole day over again'. 'I caused that pain': Arias reacted to gruesome pictures of Alexander's body, which had some 30 stab wounds. The above image of the shower where his corpse was found is among the publishable ones . Most of the rest of the testimony focuses on Arias's childhood and her past relationships, and also the time she first met Alexander, at a convention in Las Vegas. She described having sex with him for the first time, and how he started suggesting that she join the Mormon church. The line of questioning was never completed,  because Arias refused to continue her testimony after the promise of secrecy was removed. The jury, eight men and four women, ultimately failed to reach a verdict after one of the women voted against the death penalty. After the trial, fellow jurors said the holdout juror was biased. Many said Arias did not genuinely feel remorse, and was trying to manipulate them. The judge in the retrial will decide on April 13 whether Arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or if she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years. Since going back to prison, she has been punished for breaking jailhouse rules - and will not be able to buy items such as candy, has had 10 visitors banned, and will not be able to make phone calls unless they are to do with her legal case.","Convicted killer spoke in sentencing retrial where she dodged execution .

"She's a great-grandmother and 102 years old but that doesn't stop Margaret Deas working out five days a week. Incredibly the Sydney woman was never keen on exercise in her youth - the only thing she did to keep fit was walking - but that all changed when she reached her 90s and broke her pelvis. Now Margaret enjoys the gym and exercise classes with her friends at the Thomas Holt Sans Souci Gardens aged care facility, in Sydney. Margaret Deas, 102, could very well be Australia's fittest great grandmother after she completed 102 squats on her birthday this year . She's a great-grandmother but that doesn't stop Margaret Deas working out five days a week . Incredibly Margaret was never keen on exercise in her youth - the only thing she did to keep fit was walking - but that all changed when she reached her 90s and broke her pelvis . And while some may like to take it easy on their birthday, Margaret decided to complete her most impressive feat yet in celebration of her special day earlier this year. ‘Last year my physio John said I'm going to get you to do 102 squats for your birthday, I said 'you have to be joking',’ Margaret told the Daily Mail Australia. ‘I've never really exercised. When I was young I did the Girl Guides and all the activities that came with that,’ she added. ‘But later it was mainly walking; my eldest girl was about 15 or 16 before we had a car so we used to walk to the train station when we wanted to go somewhere.’ Physio John Abd-Mariam has been working with Margaret, a mother of four daughters, for a number of years, and when they first met the 102-year-old was not nearly as fit as she is now. One of her four daughters Suzanne said her mother was never really into exercise when she was younger . But she did enjoy riding horses in her leisure time - pictured here on horseback with her husband Colin . Margaret initially took a bit of persuading to start exercising but once she started she didn't look back . ‘Initially we worked on basic standing balance exercises. She could manage about two minutes before fatiguing,’ John told Daily Mail Australia. A few years earlier Margaret had broken her pelvis in three places, at the age of 93, and needed to be rehabilitated after that. ‘Through her regular attendance at the classes (over 12 months), and her willingness to be encouraged to improve, she managed to increase to over 10 minutes of continuous standing exercises,’ John continued. Her daughter, Suzane, said the improvement in her mother in recent years has been phenomenal . Her transformation is incredible as Margaret had broken her pelvis in three places when she was 93 and needed rehabilitation . From there John continued to encourage Margaret to keep getting better. And in January 31 this year she completed over 102 squats – and all in the name of charity. ‘It was in late December last year that I initially suggested to Margaret that she should do one squat for every year of her life',’ John said. ‘I tried persuading Margaret over several days, initially to no avail, however as Margaret has such a lovely and selfless spirit I suggested that she could use the opportunity to raise money for a charity. ‘(This was) an idea which Margaret jumped at, and with that motivating drive we are where we are today.' ‘At first I was going to do it for the children in the third world countries,’ Margaret revealed. ‘Then I thought I've been in the Wildlife Society (of Australia) for about 15 years and I thought well… I’ll do it for them’. One of her four daughters Suzanne said although her mother was never really into exercise, the improvement she has seen in her in recent years has been phenomenal. 'One of the biggest differences we've noticed is the emotional difference,' Suzanne told Daily Mail Australia. 'Mum has a lot more of a positive outlook, she has always been positive... (but) there's definitely a difference in her contentment. The 102-year-old has always loved being outdoors - especially with horses . Margaret's fitness involves some singing, balance activities, weights, and a little bit of cardio . 'She's still very well mentally, she is very interested in politics and current affairs.' A few months on Margaret now has some tough competition as her friend Pauline Sciberras, who is nearly 92, has also joined in exercising with her, and is getting very good at her squats. ‘Pauline, Enid and I come up here straight after breakfast I do the pedals while we sing Amazing Grace, All Things Bright and Beautiful, and Onward, Christian Soldiers,’ Margaret said. ‘Pauline has just lately started doing the squats, she can do about 100 but she does them quicker than me. She does about two or three to my one, but I go all the way down.' The exercise is making a big difference for Margaret not only physically but also mentally who turned 102 on January 31 . Margaret was given a silver medal from the President of Ireland, her home country, on her birthday . The gym and exercise classes at the Thomas Holt Sans Souci Gardens aged care facility where Margaret lives have proved very popular . ‘I love it!' Pauline told the Daily Mail Australia with great enthusiasm. ‘I wouldn't stay without it.’ The women also revealed that since John has been running classes for the residents, which involve some singing, balance activities, weights, and a little bit of cardio, more and more people have been joining in. ‘Sometimes we have six, sometimes we have nine. One time we even had ten people come,’ Margaret revealed. To this day Margaret has raised over $5,000 for charity, which was donated to the Marine Sea Turtle Project in Cairns, Far North Queensland. In Margaret's honour one of the sea turtles recently rescued in the area - believed to be over 80 years old - was named after her. She also received letters from the Prime Minister Tony Abbott, the Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove and a silver medal from the President of Ireland, her home country, on her birthday. As for what she might do for her 103rd birthday, Margaret isn't sure. But John hinted that he might have something up his sleeve to help her celebrate the next milestone.

"Andreas Lubitz (above) had received treatment for 'suicidal tendencies' but doctors were apparently unable to tell his employer because of strict secrey laws introduced after WWII to prevent a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era . Strict German privacy laws which prevented doctors treating Andreas Lubitz from telling his airline about his 'suicidal tendencies' were introduced in response to Nazi rule. The Germanwings pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week's Alps disaster. But German law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. The findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in Germany on a patient's right to privacy, with Chancellor Angela Merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law. Draconian legislation was initially brought in after World War Two to prevent a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era and subsequently the Stasi secret police in East Germany. This extends far beyond confidential medical data, however, to stringent protection of someone's identity, meaning many German publications only referred to Lubitz as Andreas L, even after his death. Further data protection laws traced back to 1907, which enshrines the 'right to your own picture', also mean images can only be published with the individual's consent, it was reported by the Times. With respect to medical data, the criminal code can ultimately leave doctors between a rock and a hard place. For it only allows them breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent 'a particularly serious crime' or a threat to someone's life. They can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy, but up to five years in jail for withholding 'credible information about the planning or commission' of serious acts like murder. Despite the variation in sentences, doctors have tended to favour the individual's privacy. Still reeling from last Tuesday's disaster that killed 150 people, many in Germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor-patient privilege. A transport policy expert from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), Dirk Fischer, said strict confidentiality policy should be loosened when their patients work in sensitive fields. Professionals such as pilots 'should only see doctors designated by their employers,' Fischer told the daily Rheinische Post. He added that such doctors 'should be relieved of their pledge of secrecy in communication with the employer and the aviation authority'. Military vehicles arrive ahead of operations at the site of the Germanwings plane crash in Seyne-les-Alpes . A military vehicle  carrying a crash site investigation team heads towards the site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 crash, in Seyne-les-Alpes in the French Alps . Member of parliament Thomas Jarzombek, also of the CDU, called for the creation of a commission of experts to study how to handle illnesses among those whose jobs mean they hold the welfare of many people in their hands. German prosecutors said Monday that Lubitz had been diagnosed 'several years ago' with suicidal tendencies and was still in treatment. Although his symptoms had abated, he was apparently written off sick on the day the Airbus crashed. Media reports have indicated that Lubitz, 27, was taking medication for severe depression and was being treated for problems with his vision, possibly for a potentially career-ending detached retina. Investigators evaluating voice recorder data say Lubitz remained silent and breathed calmly as he allegedly locked his captain out of the cockpit and slammed the plane into a French mountainside. Carsten Spohr, the head of parent company Lufthansa, has said the airline was utterly unaware of any health issues that could have compromised Lubitz's fitness to fly, calling him '100-percent airworthy'. His professional performance and behaviour had never attracted cause for concern, Spohr added. The German Medical Board has clear ethical policies on doctor-patient relations: 'Doctors must remain silent about what is told to them in confidence or what they learn in their capacity as doctors.' It applies even after the death of a patient and includes keeping medical facts secret even from family members of the person in treatment, under penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine.

Calling for change: Anneli Tiirik with her boyfriend Paul Bramley, who died in the Alps plane disaster . The grief-stricken girlfriend of a British student killed in the Alps plane disaster today called for tougher controls to weed out psychopathic pilots. At present, airlines carry out regular checks on their pilots, but this often just involves a brief chat with a doctor to assess their wellbeing. Anneli Tiirik, who is from Estonia, told MailOnline: 'Besides general physical, psychological and behavioural evaluation, another test should be added, I believe, to help avoid more deaths in the future. '(This should be) a neurological PET scan to discover and attentively observe psychopathic tendencies, so as to find out whether the subject is prone to violence and therefore not be given the extensive power that would most likely lead to harming other people. 'It is one thing to be suicidal or obsessive, but feeling no remorse or even nervousness when killing other human beings is a whole new level - a zone only real psychopaths can fully understand.' Ms Tiirik also called for laws to be relaxed to allow doctors greater freedoms to flag up patients with mental health problems if they are responsible for the live of others. German law meant it was left entirely up to Andreas Lubitz to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. She said: 'I personally think that the problem doesn't lie in the management of the airline as much as in the general tendency of the society to be overly protective about people's medical data. 'It is visible to everyone if somebody has a serious physical illness, but when it comes to major mental problems, these are hidden away at any cost for fear of embarrassment or judgement. 'However, those are illnesses as well and should be treated and inspected accordingly, especially when it comes to job positions regarding huge responsibilities.' Her boyfriend, Paul Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with her. He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days' holiday with friends. Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family. Richard Spillett . One exception, however, is when medical professionals have been excused from this duty by the patient, or when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent 'a particularly serious crime' or a threat to someone's life. A doctor is also obliged to come forward in cases of 'psychiatric illnesses or a possible threat of suicide', member of parliament Karl Lauterbach, himself a physician, told the daily Bild. The German board's head, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, urged caution in reassessing the policy. Patient privacy is a 'cherished fact and, for all the citizens of Germany, a human right,' he said. 'You can tell a society that cares about rules when it doesn't slip into hasty action-for-action's-sake. Or populism,' weekly magazine Stern wrote in an editorial on its website. 'You can also tell a society that can handle the incomprehensible when it becomes clear it was a one-off case, extreme in every way. 'And, according to the rules of a humanitarian society, indeed - as terrible as it is - unpreventable.' The daily Die Welt noted a change in policy could have a chilling effect on people seeking the necessary treatment. 'Police also have the right... to a frank talk with a doctor without worrying that their employer will be told.' Meanwhile investigators sifting through the wreckage and hundreds of body parts in the French Alps were forced to resume the hunt on foot as bad weather hampered helicopter flights. 'The teams will get to the site via the path that is already in existence,' said Yves Naffrechoux from the local mountain police. Authorities are hoping to identify more DNA from the 150 people who died, as well as locate the jet's second black box that should provide more clues as to the circumstances of the tragedy. Forensic teams have isolated almost 80 distinct DNA strands from the shattered aircraft and have described the grim task as 'unprecedented' given the tricky mountain terrain and the speed at which the plane smashed into the rock.","Strict laws left it up to Andreas Lubitz to tell employers about health issues .

"Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen could face up to 40 years in prison after he admitted recruiting three female officers into a prostitution ring . An army officer whose role was to advocate for victims of sexual abuse has admitted recruiting cash-strapped female soldiers to work in a prostitution ring. Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen recruited the female soldiers to serve as prostitutes for high ranking officers at Fort Hood in Texas - one of the biggest bases in the country. One female officer was told she could make lots of money at swinger and stripper parties, while another claimed McQueen arranged for her to have sex with an officer for $100. At a court martial McQueen admitted  getting the three officers involved in the sex ring, and betraying the trust of commanders who had appointed him as an advocate for victims of sexual abuse at the base, home to 40,000 soldiers, the Austin American-Statesman reported. McQueen admitted 15 counts including charges of pandering and conspiracy to solicit prostitution. As part of his plea arrangement, other charges were dismissed, but McQueen still faces one count of assault that may be considered by the court later. He could face up to 40 years in prison. One of the female soldiers had previously testified that McQueen arranged for her to have sex for $100 with an officer, Master Sergeant Brad Grimes. But prosecutors told Judge Lt. Col. Rebecca Connally that while there were plans for a tryst, the two never had sex. The woman had told investigators she was 20 when she confided in McQueen about money problems after her husband left her and her three-year-old son and drained the couple's bank account. She also testified that McQueen had sex with her and took photos of her naked to show potential clients. Grimes has already been demoted and reprimanded after he was found guilty by a jury conspiring to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery. Initial charges were filed against McQueen in March 2014. Fort Hood officials haven't indicated whether anyone involved in the conspiracy actually had sex, according to the San Antonio Express-News. McQueen was an officer in Fort Hood's sexual assault prevention program and counseled victims of abuse. McQueen admitted breaching his role as an advocate for sexual abuse by encouraging the prostitution ring . He told the hearing: 'I was fully aware I violated those duties.' The maximum penalty for his crimes is 40 years in prison and McQueen could be sentenced later on Thursday. In addition to trying to recruit the young female soldiers, McQueen admitted trying to get two higher ranking officers to agree to have sex with junior female officers. These senior ranking officials refused, KCEN TV reported. He told the judge 'I engaged in conduct fully aware of my duties, and I willfully arranged for soldiers to engage in acts of prostitution,' he told the judge. 'My acts discredited the service.' Speaking after the hearing, South Texas College of Law professor Geoffrey Corn said the case was a 'very rare' occurrence that merited prosecution. Corn, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former military lawyer, told mySA: 'Not only is risk of significant punishment necessary for this misconduct, but there is an important deterrent message here. We entrust subordinates to leaders to make them better, not to exploit them.' The case is part of a spate of sex-related incidents in the military which have prompted further investigation by Congress. The US Senate last year blocked a bill that would have stripped military commanders of their authority to prosecute or prevent charges for alleged rapes and other serious offences. Instructors, recruits and others have been prosecuted in a series of sex-abuse cases at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. A Pentagon study released last May on sex assault in the military found that more than 5,000 reports of sexual abuse had been filed in the previous fiscal year, a 50 percent increase from the previous 12 months.","Gregory McQueen admitted recruiting female soldiers to work in a sex ring .

"Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are on death row with seven other convicted criminals, with all expected to face the firing squad in the next round of killings. Six of the other people awaiting execution are also foreigners and, despite having the support of their respective countries, are expected to be executed at Nusakambangan island in the coming weeks. It is unclear how long the delay on the executions will last. The drug felons' prospects are dire as they all have convictions in Indonesia, a country with some of the toughest drug laws in the world. The country executed six drug offenders last month, five of them foreigners. Scroll down for video . Nine people are currently on death row, awaiting execution by firing squad in Indonesia. Seven of those convicted criminal are (top row from left) Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, Frenchman Serge Atlaoui and Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte (Bottom row from left) Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, and Nigerian Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise .

Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) being transported to 'Death Island' Many political figures continue to appeal for clemency with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. However, Widodo is a staunch supporter of capital punishment and pleas have repeatedly been unsuccessful. As Chan and Sukumaran await news about their fate, so too do six men and one woman; including a single mother-of-two, a father-of-four and a man with serious mental illnesses. The only woman set to be executed is a Filipino single mother-of-two, Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso. Philippine death row prisoner Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso is a single mother-of-two. She was arrested in April 2010 in Yogyakarta airport for attempting to smuggle 2.6 kilograms of heroin and now awaits her execution . ary Jane Fiesta Veloso,(L) is comforted by an Indonesian counsellor at a court in Sleman in central Java island while waiting for a hearing of judicial review on March 3 after a plea for clemency was rejected by Indonesian President Joko Widodo . Family members of Australian death row prisoners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran leave Nusakambangan prison island after visiting the two prisoners on March 9 . Coming from a poor rural family, she was just 25-years-old when she was arrested in 2010 with 2.6 kilograms of heroin in her luggage. She was transporting two suitcases from Malaysia to Indonesia to earn money for her family and maintains that she did not know the luggage contained heroin. She speaks only Tagalog and has had extensive difficulties in court due to her inability to understand proceedings. Another inmate at Nusakamgangan prison island is French national Serge Atlaoui. Atlaoui is a father-of-four who was arrested near Jakarta in 2005 whilst working in a secret laboratory producing ecstasy. He was sentenced to death in 2007 on drug trafficking charges. Imprisoned in Indonesia for ten years, he has always maintained his innocence. He is adamant that he was installing industrial machinery in what he thought was an acrylics factory.

The 51-year-old has the unwavering support of his wife Sabine, who has sworn to continue to fight for his release. She is certain of her husband's innocence. 'He is scared that he will never see his children again,' said Ms Atlaoui. She is still 'holding onto hope'. French President Francois Hollande wrote to President Widodo last month asking for Atlaoui to be granted a reprieve but his efforts were futile. Atlaoui's wife Sabine travelled to visit her husband in prison with a young boy on March 5. She has campaigned for her husband's release. He is scared that he will never see his four children again . Brazilian national Rodrigo Gularte, 42, was arrested in 2004 for attempting to smuggle six kilograms of cocaine into Indonesia. His family continue to appeal for a pardon due to his mental illnesses. Gularte has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychotic features and is reportedly deeply disturbed. Sadly due to his paranoid schizophrenia, Gularte believes that there is a microchip in his arm and he is being monitored by satellites, according to news.com.au . He also believes that he works in security at the prison and refuses all medication and treatment. He is a surfer from an affluent family and has the full support of his devastated family. The Brazillian President removed the country's ambassador from Indonesia in January after their citizen Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira was executed. Brazillian national Rodrigo Gularte is on death row. He suffers from serious mental illnesses including schizophrenia. His family are appealing for his release due to his condition . In 1999 Nigerian Jaimu Owolabi Abashin was sentenced to life in prison, a year after he was caught smuggling 5.3 kilograms of heroin through Indonesia's Juanda airport. For seven years he believed that there was a chance he could walk free. However in May 2006 a judge ordered his execution and he was not given an opportunity to appeal. When first arrested, he purported to be a Spaniard named Raheem Agbaje Salami and held a fake passport. 17 years after his arrest, Indonesian authorities continue to use the man's false identity. It has been reported that the Nigerian joked about the mix-up with Australians Chan and Sukumaran last week through their cell walls on the island where they will be executed. Like Chan and Sukumaran, lawyers for Nigerian death row inmate Raheem Agbaje Salami failed to have a challenge against his clemency rejection heard in the administrative court on Monday. Nigerian death row prisoner Raheem Agbaje Salami has already made friends with Chan and Sukumaran . Silvester Obiekwe is another Nigerian on death row. He was arrested in 2003 for smuggling 1.2 kilograms of heroin into Indonesia, discovered with 66 capsules in his stomach. He is a 'priority' for execution as he has since been caught operating drug syndicates whilst on death row. Another Nigerian man, Okwudili Ayotanze, could also possibly join the 10 on death row to face the firing squad with Chan and Sukumaran. He was caught trying to smuggle 1.15 kilograms of heroin from Pakistan into Jakarta. However, he has now become a gospel singer. He performs with prison guards and has released an album from behind bars. Silvester Obiekwe is another Nigerian on death row.

"They are often seen as the quintessential emblem of Scotland. But when it comes to wearing kilts, it seems the Scots are being outdone by their English counterparts these days. New figures suggest more kilts are being rented south of the border than they are north – with English hires totalling almost double those of the Scots. New figures suggest more kilts, loved by the Royal family, are being rented south of the border than they are north – with English hires totalling almost double those of the Scots . Of the 7,646 kilt hires made, most kilts were hired out in London, where the company conducted a fifth of its Highland trade . According to Young’s Hire, the largest formalwear hire company in the UK, only 2,645 Scots took out the attire last year- in comparison with 5,000 English. And of the 7,646 kilt hires made, most kilts were hired out in London, where the company conducted a fifth of its Highland trade. Elsewhere in the UK, 12 per cent of its kilts were hired in Leicester, 10 per cent in Manchester, 10 per cent in Sheffield and 6 per cent in Liverpool. Only 9 per cent of all kilts hired went to enthusiasts in Dundee, and Aberdeen accounted for just two percent of the highland wear hires. Industry insiders said in the wake of Scotland’s vote against independence earlier this year, it seems Hogmanay is becoming ever more popular in other parts of the UK. The researchers analysed more than 400,000 garment hires during the last 12 months, focussing on kilts rented for Christmas parties, New Year’s celebrations, winter weddings and other formal occasions. The researchers analysed more than 400,000 garment hires during the last 12 months, focussing on kilts rented for Christmas parties, New Year’s celebrations, winter weddings and other formal occasions . Chris Burns, at Young’s Hire, said: ‘It’s always fascinating to take a more holistic look at the formalwear trends around the UK. ‘It’s great that traditional Scottish highland wear is still going strong and is growing in popularity across England.’ The most popular kilt was the Grey Granite, a conservative dark tartan design which accounted for 30 per cent of total rentals. The more colourful Pride of Scotland print was a close second with 23 per cent, followed by the Help for Heroes Kilt with 10 per cent. The kilt is thought to have originated in the 16th Century, but some historians have claimed it was Thomas Rawlinson, a Quaker from Lancashire, who first popularised the look in the 18th Century. Industry insiders said in the wake of Scotland’s vote against independence earlier this year, it seems Hogmanay is becoming ever more popular in other parts of the UK . The original kilt was an all-over body covering known as the feileadh mhór or ‘big wrap’, but later evolved into something like what is worn today. The research also showed that the traditional ‘top hat and tails’ was keeping its popularity in the South East for formal occasions. London accounted for more than 10 per cent of the traditional wedding garb, while Essex accounted for 6 per cent and Berkshire 5 per cent. Northern cities on the other hand, tended to avoid the outfit, with Newcastle accounting for a measly 0.014 per cent of all top hat rentals. Also choosing to err against traditional top hat and tails get up were the people of Manchester, who rented 1 per cent, and Leeds which rented 2 per cent. Young’s Hire has more than 195 locations across the UK, with concessions in stores including Debenhams, Suit Direct and Jeff Banks.","When it comes to kilts, Scots are being outdone by  English counterparts .

"April Jones would have been eight next month. The schoolgirl was murdered by lifeguard Mark Bridger in 2012, who abducted the five-year-old whilst she was out playing on her bike, just minutes from home. Speaking to Closer magazine this week about how she will mark her dead daughter's birthday, Coral, 43, admitted that she will be baking April's favourite chocolate cake. April Jones was murdered by lifeguard Mark Bridger in October 2012. The schoolgirl would have been eight next month . Coral, who still carries April's teddy bear everywhere she goes, says: 'I’ll make a chocolate sparkly cake because that was her favourite. We’ll take balloons to her graveside and release lanterns into the sky in our garden in her memory. 'April loved birthdays and would get so excited. On her fifth birthday, we had a children’s entertainer, and she was singing and dancing – we had no idea that would be her last party. 'April is a hard month for us. I still can’t go out alone and I can’t eat or sleep properly.' April is pictured here with sister Jazmin, father Paul, mother Coral and brother Harley . April's violent murder united the country in revulsion and shock in 2012. Bridger, it emerged, was obsessed with violent child pornography: he hoarded 400 disgusting images on his computer and watched a horrific rape scene in a film before killing April. Bridger’s depravity and evil were matched by his duplicity: he failed to admit to his crime, lying that he had killed April by running her over in his car. He has also steadfastly refused to say what he did with her body. What remained of April's body was buried in September 2013 in the family's home town of Machynlleth, Wales . As a result Coral, and April's father Paul have been denied the scant solace of burying their little girl. ‘Mark Bridger is behind bars, but we are trapped in our own prison, too,’ Coral told The Daily Mail in January last year. ‘We’ll carry our pain for the rest of our lives. We’ll never be free from it. I cry every day.' It emerged that April Jones's killer Mark Bridger made as many as 100,000 indecent searches online . Coral and Paul, who have two other children, Jazmin, 18, and Harley, 12, have since set up April’s Law – a campaign to stop indecent images of children being allowed on the internet. The full article appears in this week’s Closer magazine real-life special, on sale now . The couple have met with Prime Minister David Cameron and say: 'We want a new law to stop people being able to access online child pornography. We also want longer sentences for paedophiles and think they should be on the sex offender's register for life. 'I am really overprotective towards April’s brother and sister now. Jazmin is 19 and has a boyfriend, but I need to know where she is all the time. 'I miss April every day. She was such a kind-natured girl. She wanted to swim with dolphins, but she’ll never fulfil that dream now. 'I wish April was here to celebrate her birthday.

"Matthew Fry (pictured) broke his girlfriend's wrist after she accused him of flirting with another woman at a civic function . A former Labour councillor who broke his girlfriend's wrist after she accused him of flirting with another woman at a civic function has been spared jail. Matthew Fry, 34, shoved partner Ann Simmons, 41, into a door after they rowed about his 'flirtatious behaviour' at a council ball on Boxing Day last year. A court heard the bust-up started after the politician attended the Stoke-on-Trent City Council event alone because Miss Simmons was unable to attend. The next day she saw Facebook messages about his flirty behaviour at the party before accusing him of chatting up a woman and trying to sleep with her. The councillor then lashed out and pushed her into a door causing her to suffer a broken wrist. Magistrates also heard Fry punched Miss Simmons in the face while she was driving a month later on January 24. The following day he attacked his partner again after turning up drunk at her home at 4am where he punched her twice in the face. Fry admitted one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two charges of assault by beating at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on February 12. But he avoided prison and was sentenced to 16 weeks in jail, suspended for 12 months at the same court. Fry - who represents the suburb of Weston Coyney, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire - was also ordered to pay £1,000 compensation and attend a domestic abuse programme. Prosecutor Edward Saulsby said the couple had been together for about one year and were planning to get engaged. But the relationship became strained following the row following the Boxing Day function. He said: 'Miss Simmons believed there had been a flirtatious incident at the ball between Mr Fry and another lady. It caused a row. 'This resulted in him storming off to leave and her blocking the door.

"Tourists visiting Buckingham Palace when it opens for the summer season will be able to experience a taste of royal hospitality for the first time. Paying tourists will now be allowed to enter the State Rooms through the Grand Entrance - just like a visiting head of state - as they are given unique insight into the preparations that go into hosting opulent state banquets, investitures, garden parties and private audiences. As such, this year's annual summer opening exhibition is entitled, A Royal Welcome, as the Palace reveals just how it copes with the 62,000 guests it entertains each year. Forthcoming exhibition, A Royal Welcome, will reveal exactly how Buckingham Palace prepares for its opulent events, like state banquets . Anna Reynolds, the curator of the summer season exhibit, prepares a silver gilt centrepiece, which will be on display from June . In the ballroom, the horseshoe shaped table will be set for a state banquet, complete with silver gilt centrepieces, candelabra and 170 place settings using 2,000 pieces of cutlery. Also on display will be the Grand Service, which has been used by successive monarchs for 200 years and was originally commissioned by George IV when he was Prince Regent. It consists of 12 ice-pails, 14 soup tureens, 118 salt cellars, 140 dishes, 288 dinner plates, 58 dessert stands and centrepieces, and 107 candelabra. Each year, the Palace hosts 62,000 guests, many of whom will eat dinner in the ballroom at a horseshoe shaped table . A mustard and salt cellar from 1721 is among the items used at state banquets, and will be included in the summer opening display . A nautical themed silver gilt salt cellar is another item that will be available for paying tourists to view during the summer season . Little known facts will also be revealed during the exhibition. For example, at a state banquet, a special salt cellar with two compartments for salt and mustard, originally acquired by George I, is placed in front of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. A newly commissioned time lapse film will also show how the grand room is transformed for the elaborate banquets, which are hosted for foreign heads of state who are carrying out formal visits to the UK. Visitors will also have the chance to see the copper moulds used to create chocolate bombe desserts, the red leather seating planner and evening dresses and glittering jewellery worn by the Queen at high-profile state affairs.

"One of the two brave teens who thwarted a 15-year-old's attempt to run off with a toddler in broad daylight has revealed the suspect is his school classmate. Andrew Crain, 15, along with his 16-year-old friend Isaac Yow gave chase after an unidentified minor allegedly snatched a 22-month-old toddler from a city park and helped get the child home safely. Prior to the boy's arrest, he was identified as a 30-year-old man. Crain has since realized it was his classmate in a fake mustache and glasses. 'I'm feeling happy, I'm feeling angry at the same time. I do know the person,' Crain told KXLY. Scroll down for video . 'I do know the person': Andrew Crain, 15, along with his 16-year-old friend Isaac Yow gave chase after an unidentified minor allegedly snatched a 22-month-old toddler from a city park and helped get the child home safely . Residents of the tiny town of Sprague expressed relief Thursday that an arrest has been made in the attempted kidnapping — an incident that drew wide attention after it was caught on surveillance video. A 15-year-old boy who lives in Sprague was arrested Wednesday, Lincoln County Sheriff Wade Magers said. 'They're so relieved,' said Dorothy Giddings, an antique store owner in Sprague who was involved in the rescue of the toddler on Sunday. 'The only sad part is it is a young boy who lives here in town.' Sprague is a farm town of about 500 people located about 40 miles west of Spokane along Interstate 90. The parents of the toddler expressed praise for their two older children, who chased the kidnapper and screamed for help. Bizarre: The suspect who allegedly snatched a 22-month-old from a park while security cameras rolled is Crain's 15-year-old classmate . Loner? Crain's friend Isaac Yow, 16, helped stop the kidnapping. Folks in the small Washington town say the suspect lived in Sprague but didn't associate much with other teens . The 15-year-old boy arrested in connection with an attempted kidnapping in Sprague had previously been investigated a year ago for allegedly trying to lure a minor, Lincoln County Prosecutor Jeff Barkdull said Thursday. The sheriff's office forwarded a report accusing the boy of luring, but the prosecutor's office decided not to file charges in that case, Barkdull said. 'It did not meet the elements of luring,' Barkdull said. 'We re-reviewed it and I stand by the decision.' Barkdull said the previous incident also occurred in Sprague. The 15-year-old boy, whose name has not been released, is scheduled to appear in Lincoln County Superior Court in Davenport on Friday afternoon. Barkdull said he has not made a charging decision yet. According to a document involving last year's incident released Thursday by the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office, the responding deputy spoke with a woman who had phoned in the luring report involving her 11-year-old son. She said that the suspect had taken her son by the hand and walked away from her residence. She questioned him and the suspect let go, the report said. 'They have a motherly instinct,' Michael Wright told The Spokesman-Review about his two older children. 'We're going to watch each other closer and even more diligently than we did before.' Giddings said the 15-year-old boy lived with his family, but did not socialize much with other teenagers. He apparently wore a disguise during the attempted abduction to mask his identity, she said. Authorities announced the arrest on Wednesday afternoon, culminating a tense four days in Sprague. 'Deputies and detectives have worked relentlessly on this case,' Magers said in a press release. They started focusing on the arrested suspect in the past 24 hours. 'Additional evidence, interviews, DNA collection, and surveillance' were carried out, Magers said. 'A search warrant was executed at the suspect's residence.' The identity of the youth was being withheld because he is a juvenile. The dramatic surveillance video footage showed a male running down a sidewalk with the toddler in his arms last Sunday. The child's two siblings screamed and chased him. The scene ended after two teenage boys joined the chase, and the man put down the toddler and fled. The toddler was not hurt. Reunited: Nicole and Michael Wright hold their 22-month-old son Owen who was abducted from Sprague City Park on Sunday. Owen's sister Delicia, 8, and brother Brenden, 10, were with the toddler and alerted a pair of teenage boys . Brave: Breden said he wasn't scared by the kidnapper and jumped into action because they he wanted his brother back so they could go to their cousin's birthday party . Heroes: Delicia Wright, 8, said that the kidnapper told them he was nice to kids and had been babysitting for a long time, she didn't believe him and her screams helped raise the alarm . One of the kidnap victim's young siblings also positively identified the suspect, Magers said. The 15-year-old was booked into a juvenile detention facility on suspicion of second-degree kidnapping, Magers said. The Lincoln County Prosecutor's Office will make the formal charging decisions. Magers thanked the media for distributing pictures of the suspect and the public for providing tips. The incident began after Michael Wright left his three children with a baby sitter in Sprague on Sunday while he went to work. The children — Brenden, 10, Delicia, 8, and the toddler — were playing unsupervised in a city park near the sitter's house. Sheriff's deputies said the suspect talked with the children for a few minutes, then scooped the toddler out of his stroller and ran down the street. Surveillance video from a grocery store showed the kidnapper running, child in arms, with Delicia chasing and Brenden not far behind. Misidentified: Witnesses originally said the kidnapper was around 30-years-old, 6-foot-2 and had a mustache . Owen's older sister Delicia, left, and brother Brenden, right, were also captured on security video footage as they gave chase after the man who had taken their younger brother Owen . Delicia's screams alerted Giddings, who was working at her antique store downtown. Giddings said she realized what was happening and sent her grandson Crain, 15, and his friend Yow, 16, to chase the kidnapper. As the older boys approached, the kidnapper put the child down in a vacant lot and fled, the sheriff's office said. No vehicle was seen with the kidnapper, who was initially described by the sheriff's office as about 30 years old, 6-foot to 6-foot-2, with a thin build, brown hair and a mustache. Giddings said Crain and Yow did not recognize him Sunday. 'He was wearing glasses and a fake mustache,' she said.","Washington teen Andrew Crain, 15, and his friend Isaac Yow, 16, helped save the 22-month-old toddler as their fellow teen ran off with her .

"The new Isa for first-time buyers is unlikely to solve the housing crisis – and could even worsen the property price 'bubble', economic experts warned yesterday. The Help to Buy Isa was announced by the Chancellor in Wednesday's budget, delighting thousands of young buyers struggling to save for a deposit. Under the plans, the Government will boost people's savings by £50 for every £200 they put away, with a maximum bonus of £3,000. And couples can have separate Isas, meaning they can receive a £6,000 bonus towards their first home. The Help to Buy Isa was announced by the Chancellor in Wednesday's budget, delighting thousands of young buyers struggling to save for a deposit . The policy has been welcomed by mortgage brokers, who believe it could inject some life into a slowing property market. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies and two leading free market think-tanks yesterday warned that the scheme could backfire. They said it would only fuel demand without addressing the severe lack of new homes across the UK. IFS economist Stuart Adam said those who would find it easiest to take up the offer were people already able to afford a deposit. 'This is a rather dubious policy, intended to help first-time buyers which is more than likely to have the effect of inflating housing prices,' he said. 'A lot of the benefit of the policy will go to people who would have done that saving anyway.' The policy has been welcomed by mortgage brokers, who believe it could inject some life into a slowing property market . The Institute of Economic Affairs described the new Isa as 'hopeless' and said it offered short-term help while failing to tackle the affordability crisis. It also warned it could worsen the 'housing bubble' by driving up demand. The TaxPayers' Alliance said the real problem was Britain's 'restrictive planning regulations' – an issue the Isa failed to tackle. 'This expensive policy will do nothing to address the housing shortage,' a spokesman said. Jonathan Harris, of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, added: 'Yesterday's Budget announcement about the Help to Buy Isa is a welcome boost for first-time buyers. 'However, we would like to see a greater emphasis on building more homes. There is a danger that giving first-time buyers assistance with a deposit will only push up property prices further.' But Peter Rollings, of estate agents Marsh & Parsons, said the Isas, coupled with cheap mortgage rates, would 'up the ante in the housing market in the coming months'. David Hollingworth, of brokers London & Country, added that the scheme would particularly help in areas where house prices had been 'outpacing the rate at which first-time buyers can save'. The Help to Buy Isas will be offered by banks and building societies in the autumn. They can be opened only by first-time buyers, and while money cannot be transferred straight from a relative's account, there is nothing to stop a relative transferring money into an account belonging to the buyer, who can then transfer it into their Isa. The Treasury says it will not decide exactly how and when to pay the money until it has consulted with the industry. The bonus will be available on home purchases of up to £450,000 in London and up to £250,000 outside London.","Help to Buy Isa was announced by the Chancellor in Wednesday's budget .

"A teenage beauty queen survived a horrifying car crash on an accident blackspot en route to her first ever pageant - but still managed to make it on time. Gemma Hartery, from Old Conwy, Wales, was on her way to her Miss Wales selection interview when her boyfriend Ellis' Ford Fiesta flipped on to its roof on the notorious Snake Pass road near Macclesfield, Cheshire. An air ambulance was dispatched for the 19-year-old after her screams sparked fears that there was a child in the car. Gemma Hartery, 19, survived the accident after her boyfriend's car slid on an oil spill and flipped upside down . Gemma's boyfriend's car overturned in a collision as they made their way to her Miss Wales interview . But Gemma managed to escape with just a cut to her hand and her mum Cheremane Smith, 42, stepped in to get her to the interview on time. After a two-hour trip to A&E, the International Sports Management student at the University of Derby composed herself and sailed through her selection interview. Gemma, who had been travelling from her university digs in Buxton, Derbyshire, to the interview, said: 'We were just driving up the twisty road and there had been oil spill but there was no warning at all. 'The back end of the car went and we flipped over upside down. It was terrifying. 'We were so lucky. And I managed to escape with just a cut on my hand from the glass on the passenger side window. 'I was fine after my mum gave me some sugary drinks to calm me down and I didn't even mention it at the interview.' The beauty queen was on the way to her Miss Wales selection interview, and escaped with only a cut . The car Gemma was travelling in flipped over, leaving her trapped inside . Gemma, who has never competed before at a pageant, impressed judges at the Miss Wales event in Swansea last weekend, taking the Old Conwy title on Saturday. But she missed out on the ultimate prize after being pipped by newsreader Emma Jenkins, 22, from Llanelli. This weekend's competition will be the first time that Gemma will compete at a pageant and comes after years of caring for mum Cheremane. Gemma has looked after her mother since she was diagnosed with breast cancer while the girl was at high school. Although Gemma, who had never previously competed at a pageant, ultimately lost out on the Miss Wales titles, she impressed judges and took the Old Conwy title on Saturday . Cheremane has since received the all-clear but has been dealt with a devastating blow after being diagnosed with osteoperosis of the spine. Her health issues inspired Gemma to enter the pageant after Cheremane told her to 'live her life'. Gemma said: 'My mum told me to just go for it. 'They have basically had to rebuild her breast so I have had to look after her for years. 'The chemotherapy has really affected her joints so she couldn't move so I've had to been on hand to help out for years.' Gemma has insisted that her mother, Cheremane (left), who escorted her to the Miss Wales pageant following the accident and who is also a survivor of breast cancer, was the one that prompted Gemma to enter the pageant, encouraging her to just 'live her life' Gemma insists that she managed to put all her troubles behind her, even though she is juggling her modelling with her degree. She said: 'The big thing for me is with confidence - it is something I've struggled with and I've had a hard time battling with dyslexia. 'And it was such an absolutely amazing experience - it wasn't anything like I thought it was going to be, in fact, it was a million times better. 'I said I just wanted to give a pageant a go beforehand and said I'd only do one. 'But this has given me such a big smile on my face I think I may do more.'","Student Gemma Hartery was on her way to the pageant when her boyfriend's Ford Fiesta lost control on an oil spill .

'Does this mean that Valentino are going to be making the Zoolander 2 clothes? (sic)' on person tweeted, while another added: 'Zoolander and Valentino are the dream team.' But despite the immense popularity of the first Zoolander movie, which was released back in 2001, Ben admitted that he was shocked to see how excited fans were after the pair made their appearance on the Valentino runway. 'I was a little surprised,' the 49-year-old  said about the reaction. 'I mean it's been 15 years since the movie came out so we really didn't know if people remembered or cared, and it was nice to know that there was a little bit of a connection there that people had.' Strike a pose: Ben and Owen have been in Paris for a couple of weeks to promote the sequel to their 2001 comedy Zoolander . Indeed, Ben and Owen's commitment to ensuring they made their Zoolander 2 debut with a bang was admirable. Not only did the pair manage to take some of the spotlight away from a couture fashion house (with its permission, of course) they also did it during one of the world's most respected fashion-focused events, while still earning a round of applause from the fashion community. Ben added however, that he was 'just happy we were able to keep it a surprise and nobody tripped'. 'We thought it would be a fun idea as a way to announce the movie,' he further explained, when asked why they chose Paris Fashion Week to make the announcement.

"A babysitter sexually assaulted an 11-month-old child before sending photographs of the assault to her boyfriend, according to authorities. Ashley Virginia Dack, 29, and Patrick Schuneman, 37, were arrested last week after another friend, whom Dack had told about the assaults, went to the Harris County Sheriff's Office in Texas. The friend took text messages from Dack's phone after she asked him to charge it for her and when he went to authorities last October, they executed search warrants on the couple's homes. After seizing an iPhone from one of the homes they discovered horrifying messages, investigators said, according to Click2Houston. Arrested: Ashley Virginia Dack, left, and her boyfriend Patrick Schuneman, right, allegedly sexually abused children and sent each other text messages plotting or describing the attacks, investigators said . In one exchange on August 30, 2012, Dack described 'a little girl at lunch with blonde pig tails' and said she wished he had been waiting in the car so she could bring him the child. 'Would love that,' he responded. Dack allegedly then detailed how they would hold the girl down, saying: 'No one could hear her if we were in my car.' In another text message in 2013, Dack sent her boyfriend an image showing her inappropriately touching an 11-month-old child, to which Schuneman responded: 'Incredible... Thank you.' Investigators found the mother of the child and learned that Dack had been looking after the 11-month-old the same day the pictures and texts were sent, Click2Houston reported. She and Schuneman conspired to sexually abuse children and photograph their exploits for their sexual gratification, investigators said. The couple has now been charged with super aggravated sexual assault of a child and sexual performance by a child under the age of 14. Dack is being held on a $350,000 bond, while the court declined bond for Schuneman.","WARNING: GRAPHIC DETAILS .

"Arrest: Jefferey Williams (pictured) admits he fired the shots that hit two Ferguson officers but insists he was aiming at someone else . The man accused of . wounding two policemen during a protest rally outside the . Ferguson, Missouri, police headquarters last week appeared in . court on Monday briefly and did not enter a plea. The shooting was the latest violent incident in months of . demonstrations in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, after a white . police officer shot dead unarmed black teen Michael Brown during . a confrontation in August. Jeffrey L. Williams, 20, has admitted to firing the shots . that wounded the officers early Thursday and also told . authorities he was not shooting at police, Prosecuting Attorney . Robert McCulloch said on Sunday after announcing the arrest. Williams did not give any statements on Monday during his . brief appearance before Judge Joseph Dueker in St. Louis County . Circuit Court. He is charged with first-degree assault and his . bond is set at $300,000. Williams told Dueker he was going to hire a private . attorney, St. Louis County Public Defender Stephen Reynolds . said. No one responded Monday at the Williams address listed in . court records, a one-story blue house that had trash strewn on . the lawn. Neighbors declined to comment. Police had called the shooting an 'ambush' of the officers, . who were standing side by side, by a gunman embedded with . protesters, but McCulloch said on Sunday Williams may have been . shooting at someone else. Several long-time activists have said they did not recognize . or know Williams as a protester. 'He never protested before,' Bishop Derrick Robinson, an activist, told CNN on Monday. The shooting of the officers, who were treated at a local . hospital and released, followed a flurry of resignations and . protests in the week after the U.S. Justice Department released . a damning report accusing Ferguson of racially biased policing. Wounded: In the shooting early on Thursday, a 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound. Another officer, 32, suffered a facial wound. Above, one of the officers  is seen being taken away by EMT . Shooting: Police take cover after two officers were shot while standing guard in front of the Ferguson Police Station last Thursday . St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said he believed the 20-year-old suspect attended last week's protest before the shooting happened. Activists said Williams was not a consistent fixture in their tight-knit group. 'We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,' McCulloch said of Williams' contention that he did not fire at the officers. Williams is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action. He made a brief court appearance Monday, and the case was scheduled for a later date. Court officials said he did not yet have an attorney. Williams' arrest came as anti-police protesters (pictured) have resumed demonstrations outside Ferguson police station . McCulloch said there may have been other people in the vehicle with Williams and that the investigation is ongoing. Williams used a handgun that matches the shell casings at the scene, McCulloch said. He also said tips from the public led to the arrest. Williams is being held on $300,000 bond. Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest leader with the group Millennial Activists United, had just left a meeting with other leaders Sunday when word of the arrest circulated. She said no one in the group knew Williams, and they checked with other frequent protesters, who also had not heard of him. Ferrell suspected McCulloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement. 'This is a fear tactic,' she said. 'We are very tight-knit. We know each other by face if not by name, and we've never seen this person before.' John Gaskin, a St. Louis NAACP leader, said of Williams, 'I don't know him. I've never seen him.' St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the officers could have easily been killed in the shooting, which came amid protests in Ferguson over alleged police violence. Above, a Michael Brown supporter . Many protesters were pictured arguing with pro-authority demonstrators and police officers (pictured) on Sunday night . The Justice Department, which launched an investigation after Brown's shooting, found pervasive racial bias in Ferguson's policing and municipal court practices. Its policeforce is mostly white and two-thirds of residents are black. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, its city manager and . its municipal court judge have resigned. Williams, who had been on probation for possession of stolen . property, is accused of firing shots early Thursday from a car . just as a rally after Jackson's resignation was breaking up.

"Sir Richard Ottaway (pictured) said  a 'troubling pattern' of reduced freedoms was emerging as Hong Kong's autonomy comes 'under pressure' Freedom in Hong Kong is being undermined by the Chinese government, British MPs warned yesterday. Beijing's involvement in Hong Kong's elections is 'unduly restrictive' and freedom of speech, the Press and assembly are being eroded, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said in a report. Chairman Sir Richard Ottaway added that a 'troubling pattern' of reduced freedoms was emerging as Hong Kong's autonomy comes 'under pressure'. The parliamentary committee urged the UK government to be more outspoken in support of democracy in Hong Kong, warning that failing to do so could damage Britain's reputation there. The committee also accused the British Government of abandoning its 'moral obligation' to support democracy in the former UK colony. The report added that Britain 'can and should take a position' on democratic reforms in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Candidates in Hong Kong's first public vote for a leader in 2017 will be vetted by a Beijing committee, meaning voters will not be offered a 'genuine choice', the MPs said. They argued that Britain's reputation in Hong Kong may be damaged if the Government does not speak up in support of democracy, and urged the UK to take 'an unambiguous position on its expectations for constitutional reform'. Tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong turned out for pro-democracy protests that rocked the city for 11 weeks last year. The student-led protesters occupied key streets in financial districts to demand the removal of restrictions in place for 2017 elections. The report also criticized British officials for not summoning the Chinese ambassador after China banned members of the parliamentary committee from visiting Hong Kong in December. Beijing's decision to treat the visit as interference in China's internal affairs 'raises wider concerns about the state of UK-China relations,' it said. China said the UK had 'no right to interfere' in the matter.

"This unusual mixture of tattoos includes Disney characters, patterns found on Russian prison inmates and even a Louis Vuitton logo. But what makes them even more strange is that they have been decorated onto live pigs while they are anaesthetised. Wim Delvoye began tattooing live pigs in 1997 in the US, before doing it in China from 2004 to 2008, where animal welfare laws are more lax. Creation: The unusual mixture of tattoos includes Disney princesses, patterns found on Russian prison inmates and even a Louis Vuitton logo . 'Spoiled': Belgiam artist Wim Delvoye moved to China in 2004 and set up an art farm tattooing his creations onto living pigs . Drawings: Mr Delvoye kept around 20 pigs that were tattooed based on his designs by a team of Chinese experts in anaesthesia and tattooing . Characters: A worker tattooed Ariel from the Disney film The Little Mermaid onto the skin of a pig (left), which can also be seen (right) The Belgian artist claimed the pigs were spoiled - with locals in Yang Zhen, Beijing, said to have been amazed at how well they were treated. Up to three artists applied a tattoo simultaneously while each pig was under anaesthetic, and carers regularly moisturised the pigs' skin. But animal rights campaigners complained that the pigs were suffering unnecessarily and being abused for improper commercial profit. The animals' skins were sold for up to £55,000 a piece, with one canvas featuring Disney characters sold to Chanel and made into two bags. A People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals spokesman said Mr Delvoye’s actions would have left the pigs ‘sore, scared and confused’.

He told MailOnline: ‘Talented and visionary artists do not rely on cruelty to animals to get attention. ‘Pigs, cows and chickens are emotional, thinking animals who feel pain every bit as much as we do, and they value their lives.’ Since these photographs were taken, Mr Delvoye, 49, has worked on other projects including marble replicas of twisted Gothic-style towers. And he even tattooed a man’s back before selling it as art - with the collector bizarrely able to keep the person’s skin when he dies. Last year Mr Delvoye told the Wall Street Journal: ‘Art must fascinate people and doing easy things is not a good way to seek fascination.’","Wim Delvoye began tattooing live pigs in 1997, before doing it in China where animal welfare laws are more lax .

"If we must imagine the fiery depths of hell, the mental image can't be far from these incredible images by Karel Tupy of Ethiopia's Erta Ale, the world's oldest continuously active lava lake. Photographer Tupy, 35, says he feared his camera would melt from the overwhelming heat of the lava as he captured the daunting scenes of the 150-ft wide basalt volcano. 'The view is simply staggering,' said the 35-year-old. 'Lava inside the volcano is constantly moving, bubbling and bursting.' Scroll down for video . Mental images of the fiery depths of hell can't be far from these very real photographs of Ethiopia's Erta Ale . These incredible images by Czech photographer Karel Tupy capture the world's oldest continuously active lava lake . Lava sprays from the centre of the lake, a rare phenomenon said to be one of just six in the world . Lava illuminates, peeks through cracks and spits (left) and a haze forms above the blazing hot pool in shot by the adventurous 35-year-old . 'The heat was immense, when I got to an edge of the crater, it was unbearable. After couple of seconds, my facial skin was so hot, I had to get away. 'There was even a point where I was afraid my camera was going to melt.' Found in the badland desert area of the Afar Depression in north-eastern Ethiopia, Erta Ale's famed lava lake formed around 1906 and is one of six in the world. The volcano's name translates in the local Afar tribe's language as 'smoking mountain' while the pit to its south is known by locals as 'The Gateway to Hell', an appropriate moniker given the luminous lava spitting lava and searing heat. Karel Tupy said the view is 'staggering', as lava inside the volcano is constantly moving, bubbling and bursting . Erta Ale's name translates as 'smoking mountain' in the local Afar language while the pit to its south is called 'The Gateway to Hell' While locals aren't particularly welcoming to outsiders and the surrounding terrain is far from hospitable, tourists do make the journey to witness the natural phenomenon. In 2009, BBC TV show The Hottest Place On Earth went there to record a world first 3D laser image of the volcano. Durham University earth scientist Dr Dougal Jerram and a team from the BBC explored the Danakil desert, officially known as the hottest place on Earth. 'Like a true journey to the centre of the Earth, volcanoes provide a unique window into our planet's interior,' he later wrote for BBC News. 'Standing at the lip of the lava lake you can see why the locals see this as ""The Gateway to Hell"", as the incandescent bubbling lava lake hisses like some badly burned porridge cauldron, overturning and occasionally belching molten lava.' A visitor mounts his camera on a tripod in a bit to capture the volcano in its full glory while a small group of tourists line the other side . The ferocity of the volcano is clear as lava splashes up from a pool that is said to have formed around 1906 . Having gained his own access to the area, in which five people in a group of scientists and tourists were killed while others were taken as hostages in a 2012 attack claimed by the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF), Tupy couldn't agree more with Dr Jerram's impression. 'Even though the lava is about 25 feet below the edge, sometimes during a burst the lake spits the lava outside the crater, so you have to be careful not to get hit by it,' he said. 'What you get hit by quite often though is fumes.' The photographer says while it's vital to avoid contact with lava, obviously, it's the fumes that can be the worry . Poor road access means the only way to efficiently get to the crater is via four-wheel-drive over rugged terrain . A far less dramatic sight, the lava forms a hard, grey layer when it is given the chance to cool . However, the environment gets far worse that what he experienced. In September 2005 an eruption killed 250 head of livestock and forced locals in the surrounding area to flee. There were further evacuations in August 2007 caused by lava flow, after which two people went missing. The most recent eruption came in November 2008 . 'This place is something you don't see every day,' said Karel. 'As a photographer, I get to see amazing places and when you see that people like those photos. This is kind of a reward in itself.'","Czech photographer Karel Tupy visited Ethiopia's Erta Ale, the world's oldest continuously active lava lake .

"Embattled Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has expressed concern over her family's safety in her first comments to media since she admitted her terminal cancer may have been 'misdiagnosed'. In an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Ms Gibson claimed her son's childcare details, her home address and floor plan had been posted online amidst the fierce  backlash against her. She said that was the reason 'police came to our home checking in on my safety' last week. Ms Gibson also hit out at some of her critics, saying that while she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion', some people had responded 'maliciously'. Belle Gibson: Doubt has been cast on the Whole Pantry founder's stories as people demand answers from the health guru . Doting young mum: Ms Gibson has expressed concern about her family's safety after her son's childcare details were allegedly placed online . Ms Gibson's remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The Whole Pantry, a popular app, gained media attention because of Ms Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival . 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. The Instagram star did not address questions concerning her cancer diagnosis, saying she would 'have a statement live this week' where she would address medical questions. 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. 'I do think it's important for myself and the company to recognise everyone's anger and confusion surrounding this last week, though this doesn't justify how others have perpetuated this or responded so maliciously.' She has not provided evidence of her childcare or floor plan claims at time of publication. Her remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The book had been written in conjunction with her hugely successful app of the same name, which is set to feature on the Apple Watch. The app gained popularity after Ms Gibson claimed she warded off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis through diet and a holistic approach to life. But after close friends last week cast doubt on these claims, Ms Gibson herself admitted in an interview with The Australian that an announcement last year that her cancer had spread to her liver, spleen, blood and uterus was a 'misdiagnosis'. Ms Gibson explained why she today wiped all her remaining photos from her Instagram account - some had already been removed - and had the Whole Pantry Facebook page deleted. 'At the end of the day, I am a human being on the receiving end of comments, questions and emails and even if the public are used to a digital interaction with me, it does not warrant some of the recent responses,' she said. The Whole Pantry was voted Apple’s Best Food and Drink App of 2013 and will feature on the Apple Watch. The technology giant did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's requests for comment on Tuesday . She said the social media accounts were 'further encouraging interactions between those who were angry and encouraging personal data, information or other security-sensitive content to be shared or made light of. 'My son's childcare details were posted online in the midst of this, so I'm sure you can understand how unnecessary, concerning and threatening that is.' Ms Gibson said the statement she was writing was taking 'longer than anticipated' because of media requests and 'constantly arising issues', 'with the paramount focus being protecting the safety of myself and my son'. Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia they visited an Elwood home last Tuesday evening 'as part of a welfare check. They left shortly after with nil concerns.' Some of Ms Gibson's former followers have taken to social media to try to 'expose' her - posting images of her drinking alcohol before she became a clean-living star and old claims about her battle with cancer. The  Belle Gibson Uncovered Facebook page has been sharing images of her sipping beer . Clean-living Belle Gibson, seen here with a pint in her hand, told the friends who have spoken out about her to 'make yourself invisible to me, and my life' The administrators of the Belle Gibson Uncovered Facebook page, which has been sharing images of her sipping beer and champagne and eating vegan doughnuts, said they are doing so because Ms Gibson 'fiercely censors The Whole Pantry Facebook page'. 'The reason is simple, to educate and inform the many people who have already commented on this page feeling betrayed, deceived and let down by someone who they trusted,' they wrote. 'Many people followed this person, they believed in her and some even abandoned conventional medicine in favour of embracing her lifestyle in desperate hope they could cure their illnesses. On Monday afternoon, Australian publisher Penguin said it had been left with 'no other option' but to stop supplying her book in Australia. 'Despite our best endeavours, Penguin Books has not received sufficient explanation from Ms Gibson, author of The Whole Pantry recipe book, in response to recent allegations,' the comapny said in a statement. 'We remain hopeful that we will receive the formal assurances we have requested in the coming days. Ms Gibson has deleted thousands of photos and social media posts which directly reference her multiple cancer diagnoses, but an example of them - seen by Daily Mail Australia - can be found below: . Back in July 2013, Ms Gibson posted on The Whole Pantry Facebook page: 'It's unfortunate that there is someone on my Instagram trying to discredit the natural healing path I am on.' She went on to say: 'As always, with everything, this is my journey and I encourage you to do what is best for your body and situation with love and an open mind. 'I have been healing a severe and malignant brain cancer for the past few years with natural medicine, gerson therapy and foods. 'It’s working for me and I am grateful to be here sharing this journey with over 70,000 people worldwide. Thank you for being here - xx Belle.' In a reference to her liver cancer, she posted on Instagram under her account @healing_belle, a photo of a pink smoothie enriched with 'extra support'. 'This one is for my rash (thanks, liver cancer), inflammation (thanks flying) and for general immunity.' In another Instagram post she wrote: 'Going from 6 weeks to live, to celebrating my fourth year with brain cancer, I know now that respecting your own journey and intuitively healing, listening and living as YOUR body, mind and path intended is staple.' In July 2014, she broke the news of further illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal Instagram page. It read in part: 'With frustration and ache in my heart // my beautiful, gamechanging community, it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that I've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer. 'One is secondary and the other is primary. I have cancer in my blood, spleen, brain, uterus, and liver. I am hurting,' Ms Gibson wrote. About 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up, revealing she was undergoing 'German integrative oncology protocol'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) is also a popular app, which costs $3.79 to download.

"A man is distraught after visiting his wife's grave to find that a stranger has been buried in the plot next to her that he had bought for himself. And to make matters worse, it is the second time this has happened to  Abdul Charara, 75, at the United Memorial Gardens cemetery in Plymouth, Michigan. In 2011 he and his daughter, Waad, had learned a stranger had been placed in the plot next to his late wife Mahassen Charara, who died at 44 from a brain aneurysm in 1996. Following a lawsuit and a settlement with the cemetery, they thought they had put that traumatic and emotional experience behind them. Scroll down for video . Abdul Charara (left), 75, was left devastated after he realized for the second time his reserved plot next to the grave of his wife, Mahassen Charara (right), and been buried with a stranger . In 2011, the Charara family filed a lawsuit against United Memorial Gardens in Plymouth Michigan after a man, with the same first and last name as Mr Charara, was buried in the plot next to his wife. They reached a settlement and received the plot back . After his wife passed away, the family had purchased three more plots in 1997 which were paid off in 2000, according to Fox 2. Mr Charara said the latest mistake hurts. 'It's been a couple days, I still get upset when I try to eat. It hurts,' he said. Waad Charara, Mr Charara's daughter, said she nearly dropped the phone when her father called breaking the news . Waad said she received a frantic call from her father who broke the news, according to the Washington Post. 'I almost dropped the phone,' she said. 'It was shocking because this was the second time it had happened and it was devastating to think that we'd have to go through all of this again. My jaw was on the floor.' The most recent person buried in the plot, a man who has not been named, was placed in the wrong grave in February, according to the Arab American News. Mr Charara made a trip to the cemetery on the 19th anniversary of his wife's death on March 17 when he made the discovery. He also found his wife's grave had been disturbed as it was covered in dirt from the man's burial. The Charara family then contacted cemetery officials to inform them of this second mistake, and the family was informed that they might have to have their family member's body exhumed and relocated. Waad said the error is tragic for both families involved. 'What's even harder is the other family,' Charara told the Arab American News. 'Islamically putting someone in the grave and then taking them out, it's just horrible. Mr Charara, as he fights back tears, said the latest mistake has left him hurt . 'I just can't imagine if someone else comes along and says 'that's our spot'. 'But we've owned these plots for 19 years and now these people have to make that decision of moving their father. How horrible is that?' Tarek M. Baydoun, one of the Chararas' attorneys, who also represented them in 2011, said he does not know what led to this mistake, but that the family will sue if there is no immediate action. The first time he took legal action on behalf of the Chararas, he said he learned that the cemetery has a history of 'disastrous record-keeping', he told The Post. The United Memorial Gardens has told the family they are going to make a proposal following the incident . The cemetery is used by several Muslims in the community and contains an Islamic Garden that is supposed to maintain the procedures and protocols of Islamic burials. Four years ago, Waad said her father was in such shock from the news that a man with the same first and last name and been placed in his plot that he ended up in hospital. And in light of the most recent mistake, Baydoun said he made it very clear to the cemetery that the Charara family will not settle on anything that does not confirm this will not ever happen again. 'We are waiting right now for the cemetery's response. They've indicated that they were going to make a proposal, he said. 'I do hope the families at some point have a discussion between each other and come to a resolution.' Many Muslims in the area use the cemetery as it has an Islamic Garden that is meant to maintain the procedures and protocols of Islamic burials .","Abdul Charara, 75, visited grave of his late wife, Mahassen, last week on 19th anniversary of her death when he made the discovery .

"Whether it is tasty beef or succulent chicken, only the best will do for our beloved pets. But many dog and cat foods are not all they seem. Research by vets has shown many popular tinned foods contain high quantities of meat not on the label. One beef stew dog food was found to be predominantly chicken. Of the 17 pet foods subjected to DNA testing at Nottingham University, 14 contained meats that were not spelled out on the can. As good as it looks? 63 per cent of meat detected in Bakers As Good As It Looks Succulent Stew ‘with beef’ was chicken and 22 per cent was pork. Only 15 per cent was beef . Researcher Kin-Chow Chang, a fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said misleading labelling could put dogs and cats at risk of serious allergic reactions. Latest figures show Britons spend £1billion a year on more than 400,000 tons of tinned pet food. More than three quarters of the nation’s eight million cats and almost half of the nine million dogs eat canned food. Professor Chang tested ten popular dog foods and seven types of cat food for DNA of cows, pigs, chickens and horses. None of the tins had horsemeat in them, but most contained beef, pork or chicken despite it not being mentioned on the label. Some of the ‘beef’ foods actually contained more pork or chicken. For instance, 63 per cent of meat detected in Bakers As Good As It Looks Succulent Stew ‘with beef’ was chicken and 22 per cent was pork. Only 15 per cent was beef. Not all brands were criticised – all of Encore’s chicken breast cat food was determined to be the meat labelled . Pedigree dog food labelled as being ‘with beef’ had far more chicken and pork than beef, and 81 per cent of the meat detected in Felix Complete cat food was chicken or pork – despite it being the ‘beef’ version. But not all brands were criticised – all of Encore’s chicken breast cat food was determined to be the meat labelled. Professor Chang said the research suggested ‘a considerable mismatch in the labelling standard of the pet food industry and what the purchaser would reasonably expect’. He added: ‘In a human situation, this would be completely unacceptable. If I was to buy a tin of ham, I wouldn’t want to be eating rabbit as well.’ The foods complied with the law, which allows the phrase ‘with beef’, even if beef is not the main meat. But writing in journal Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica, Professor Chang called on manufacturers to make labels clearer, allowing ‘more informed choices … particularly important for pets with food allergies, reduce the risk of product misinterpretation … and avoid potential religious concerns’. Cats Protection’s Maggie Roberts said pet food makers follow guidance laid down by the EU, adding: ‘It may be beneficial for these guidelines to be amended so the information is clearer … to allow people to make a more informed choice.’ The Pet Food Manufacturers Association said makers may use meat from different animals as supply levels fluctuate but the nutritional quality does not vary.","Research shows many popular tinned foods contain meat not on the label .

"A writer and mother has candidly revealed that she was left emotionally 'scarred' by her agonizing drug-free childbirth and struggling with a condition known as postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder following the delivery of her daughter. Toronto-based mother-of-one Tara-Michelle Ziniuk recalled how the traumatizing birth of her now four-year-old daughter Anna left her with nightmares and vivid memories of her painful experience in an essay for Today's Parent. 'At the time, in that moment, I remember very clearly thinking I wanted it to stop more than I wanted to have my baby,' she wrote. 'It was horrible. I was exhausted and borderline suicidal.' Traumatic event: Tara-Michelle Ziniuk (not pictured) said she was left with nightmares following the painful, drug-free birth of her daughter Anna, who is now four-years-old . Miss Ziniuk explained that by the time she asked for something to help with the pain she was 'too far along for it to be administered.' The mom, who suffered from painful cramping almost her entire life because of her endometriosis, said she dreaded the idea of giving birth before she had even gotten pregnant, noting that although she wanted to 'experience pregnancy', she never wanted to 'experience childbirth'. When it was time for her baby to be welcomed into the world, Miss Ziniuk passed on having an epidural because the prenatal class she had attended was 'biased towards natural home births'. According to Postpartum Support International, symptoms of postpartum PTSD may include: . Intrusive recollection of a past traumatic event, including child birth . Flashbacks or nightmares . Avoidance of stimuli associated with the event, including thoughts, feelings, people, places and details of the event . Persistent increased arousal, including irritability, difficulty sleeping, hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response . Anxiety and panic attacks . Feeling a sense of unreality and detachment . Miss Ziniuk, who is currently co-parenting her daughter, was a single mother at the time of her pregnancy. She said she was given information that made her 'fear epidurals, pain medications and any other “unnecessary” interventions""', although she noted that there was no 'shame associated' if the interventions were needed for medical reasons. 'The contractions felt like an extreme version of the menstrual cramps I’d experienced with endometriosis,' she recalled. 'It also felt similar to chronic illness in that I felt like I had no control over what was happening - a familiar, yet difficult, experience for me.' Miss Ziniuk wrote that she 'disassociated' and wanted her personal support system and her midwife to leave her alone because she 'didn't want to talk to anyone'. Tara-Michelle (pictured) said she hated giving birth . 'I felt disgusting and embarrassed and sick; nothing was comfortable or bearable. I wanted it to stop,' she recalled. Although Miss Ziniuk said that her daughter's birth was 'not complicated', it was a 'long early labor'. Her water never broke, and her daughter even came out with a scratch on her head from the doctor trying to break her water for her. After her experience in the delivery room, Miss Ziniuk started having nightmares and was unable to talk about her experience when others asked about her birthing experience. She was eventually diagnosed as having PTSD - the same condition that plagues soldiers who have engaged in war-time battles. According to Postpartum Support International, one to six percent of women experience postpartum PTSD, an illness that can be caused by a real or perceived trauma during delivery or after childbirth. While Postpartum PTSD greatly differs from postpartum depression, which is a form of depression that results from the hormonal changes that occur in a woman's body, they can occur at the same time in certain cases. But both conditions are temporary and can be treated with professional help. Although Miss Ziniuk explained she struggles with recommending drug-free childbirth, she knows that her terrible experience was specific to her particular situation. She ended her essay by saying: 'My wish that I was unable to recall my daughter’s birth does not negate the good that came from becoming her mother - but my experience of parenthood to date has had nothing to do with my so-called natural childbirth.","Tara-Michelle Ziniuk, from Toronto, Canada, recalled how the birth of her four-year-old daughter Anna left her with nightmares .

"It’s a classic Easter meal loved by families around the world: a juicy lamb joint served with rosemary, roast potatoes, carrots and sprouts. But one London restaurant is giving the traditional roast a twist this spring, serving the entire spread deep-fried. In fact, everything on this menu is doused in batter and then fried, from buttered crumpets and cheese strings to Tunnock’s tea cakes, hot cross buns and even a whole pizza. London's latest pop-up #FryHard plans to offer more than 100 deep-fried items over the long Easter weekend . The calorific eaterie is the brainchild of Messhead, a collaboration between chef Jim Thomlinson (left)  of London Mess and freelance creative director Emma Thomas (right), better known as Miss Cakehead . London’s latest pop-up restaurant #FryHard in Boxpark, Shoreditch will be serving more than 100 different deep-fried foods during the long Easter weekend (2 to 5 April). The calorific eaterie is the brainchild of Messhead, a collaboration between chef Jim Thomlinson’s London Mess and freelance creative director Emma Thomas, better known as Miss Cakehead. Miss Cakehead told FEMAIL: We will be serving deep fried quiche Lorraine, pasties, pork pies, Scotch egg, frankfurters and burgers.' The pair will also offer fried desserts alongside their savoury items, with doughnuts, cakes and even coconut ices all getting the deep-fried treatment. ‘We are handmaking most things, ‘ she continued, ‘and people are going to bring along stuff for us to fry and we don’t know what people will bring. ‘It has got to be edible and the final decision [whether they should be deep-fried] comes from Jim. ‘ . The fully fried Easter feast will serve six people and has to be booked in advance. The duo will deep fry cake (pictured), doughnuts, chocolate and even coconut ices . As well as sweets #FryHard will also offer savoury items such as deep-fried pork pies (left) and pizza (right) ‘We had this idea at Christmas as Die Hard is my favourite Christmas movie,’ Miss Cakehead continued. ‘Messhead loves a good pun - it's great to see other Die Hard fans get the 'Now I Have A Deep Fat Fryer' reference in the images by Travis Hodges.’ She did however admit that the idea is a trifle silly. She said: ‘Jim is about to launch his street food concept Prawnography at Old Street Roudabout - part of Burger Bear HQ - so we want to do something really fun and ridiculous before the hard work begins. ‘We also tried deep fried chocolate at Jim's previous pop up The Dead Horse Society - once I tasted it for the first time I knew I had to revisit!' But while the venture has been greeted with interest the pair have no plans to make it into a more permanent thing. 'It is just for Easter - after which Jim will continue with Prawnogrpahy and I will continue on goodness knows what alongside,’ Miss Cakehead continued. ‘The response has been amazing though one dentist on Twitter said we were ""disgusting"". ‘So many people want to come and try the foods on offer with deep fried Babybel getting the strongest response so far.'","London's latest restaurant is open for one weekend only from 2 to 5 April .

"An illegal tobacco factory believed to be producing £700,000 of fake cigarettes per day has been raided. It was shut down in Derbyshire after an investigation by HM Revenue and Customs, who miss out on billions a year in tax because of the illicit trade. Tax officials, along with Derbyshire Police, dismantled the suspected illicit tobacco factory at an industrial storage unit near Derby city centre. More than 1.2 tonnes of tobacco, worth an estimated £283,000 in duty and taxes, was seized during the operation. Scroll down for video . Raid: This Derbyshire illegal cigarette factory has been shut down, and was capable of producing £700,000 of cigarettes per day . Stash: The factory hidden at an industrial storage unit near Derby city centre held more than 1.2 tonnes of tobacco . Afterwards, Stuart Taylor, Assistant Director, Criminal Investigation, HMRC, said: 'Tobacco fraud costs the UK £2 billion a year in lost tax and this factory alone had the potential to rob taxpayers of hundreds of thousands of pounds a day in evaded excise duty. 'In addition to significant revenue loss, illicit tobacco products damage legitimate businesses and the trade is unregulated making cheaper tobacco more readily available to the young and vulnerable.' A 38-year-old man from the city of Derby was arrested and has been released on bail until June 2015. Investigations are ongoing. In the last two years, almost 3.3 billion cigarettes and over 800 tonnes of illicit hand-rolling tobacco have been seized and 593 criminals involved have been prosecuted. In that time warehouses linked to other tobacco seizures were all part of a suspected network of organised criminals. Other swoops were made in Essex, Preston and Blackburn - netting 11 tonnes of raw tobacco in total last year. A warehouse in Bury was raided by HM Revenue and Customs officers at the same time as two domestic houses and a garage in the area, which were all searched as part of Operation Eel last April. The tobacco was found wrapped in boxes and bags and is believed to have been illegally brought into the UK without excise duty being paid. Held: A 38-year-old man from the city of Derby was arrested and has been released on bail until June 2015 over the bags full of tobacco found . HMRC said it was 'in the process' of being mixed with chemicals at the unit by a gang and converted into hand-rolling tobacco. How many illegal cigarettes are in the UK? Border officials say that close to 50 million cigarettes are seized each month - but the overall figure is much higher . What do they cost? Illegal packets of cigarettes can cost between £3 and £4 - less than half the price of legal packs . How much revenue is lost? £2.1 billion was lost in the last year because of illegal tobacco trade . Of the average pack of fags, how much of the price goes to the government in tax and duty? On a typical pack of 20  cigarettes the total tax burden is £6.17 on typical £7.98 pack . Dry, harvested tobacco leaves are believed to have been imported from tobacco growing country then processed using and white vinegar, and flavoured with vanilla, according to HMRC. 'There are no controls over what is mixed into counterfeit cigarettes and by buying it smokers are funding international organised crime gangs,' an HMRC spokesman told MailOnline. 'We are cracking down on it.' Fake printed wallets would be filled with tobacco and used to dupe customers into believing they were genuine. Sandra Smith, assistant director of criminal investigation's at HMRC, said: 'Illicit tobacco factories hidden in our communities are packaging low quality tobacco and I'd urge people to be wary. 'Cheap tobacco may seem like a bargain, but there are no controls over what is mixed into the product and by buying it smokers are funding organised crime gangs.'

"Adrian Ernest Bayley, the sex offender who murdered Jill Meagher, has been found guilty of raping three more women prompting her father to slam the system for failing to protect his daughter. The brutal rape and murder of the 29-year-old ABC staffer on her way home from a night out in Brunswick in Melbourne's north in September 2012 rocked the entire nation. His attack on Ms Meagher led to a review of Victoria's parole laws, after he was mistakenly allowed to remain on the streets. Ms Meagher's father, George McKeon, said although nothing could bring back his daughter, it was evident from the findings in the report that the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community. Mr McKeon has spoken out following his daughter's killer, who has been described as deriving pleasure from inflicting pain, being convicted of three more rapes - two sex workers and a Dutch backpacker - bringing his number of victims to 12. Scroll down for video . Adrian Ernest Bayley, the sex offender who murdered Jill Meagher, has been found guilty of raping three more women as an expert claims the notorious predator gained pleasure from inflicting pain . The brutal rape and murder of the 29-year-old ABC staffer on her way home from a night out in Brunswick in Melbourne's north in September 2012 rocked the entire nation . Ms Meagher's father George McKeon (right) with on Jill's wedding day with her cousin Louise McKeon (left) said the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community . Ms Meagher's murder triggered a parole system review by retired High Court judge Ian Callinan, who released his findings in July 2013. Bayley was released from prison on parole in 2010, but that should have been cancelled after he was convicted of assaulting a man in February 2012. Instead he appealed the assault charge and was released on bail, leaving him free to rape the 25-year-old, the backpacker and kill Ms Meagher. Ms Meagher's father George McKeon said although nothing could bring back his daughter, it was clear from the Callinan report that the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community. 'As a family, we have until now been very mindful not to make any statement or take any actions that might delay the outstanding criminal proceedings against Gillian's murderer,' McKeon said in a statement. 'However now that these proceedings are completed, we want to try and obtain closure and to ensure that other families don't have to endure this trauma.' 'In particular as a family we would like to: . 'A - Continue to raise awareness of the systemic problem of violence against women, an issue we as a family and Tom Meagher, in particular, is very closely associated with in both his writings and his role as an ambassador for the White Ribbon Campaign. 'B - Ensure that the proposed Coronial Inquest into the circumstances of Gillian's death does not proceed. Following the Callinan Report, the 20 May 2013 amendments to The Corrections Act 1986 (Vic) and the criminal proceeding in relation to her murder, we see little to be learned or gained from an open Inquest into her death.' The coroner removing Ms Meagher's body found on Black Hill Road in Gisborne South, north of Melbourne, Ausatralia, September 28 2012 . To add to his string of offences, Bayley has been convicted of raping an 18-year-old sex worker in his car in St Kilda in 2000 and a 25-year-old sex worker in April 2012 in eerily near identical circumstances. The 43-year-old also raped a Dutch backpacker in July 2012, just two months before his fatal attack on Ms Meagher, after telling her she was in danger and convincing her to climb into his car for safety. Bayley picked up all three women in St Kilda and drove them to a secluded laneway where he parked with the passenger side door pressed against a fence, blocking their escape. He contested each charge but juries found him guilty in three separate Victorian County Court trials. Suppression orders prohibited media outlets from publishing any details from the rape cases until the third guilty verdict was handed down on Thursday. His defence team argued that the three sexual assault victims had mistaken their attackers for Bayley because he featured heavily in the media spotlight with Ms Meagher's case. Bayley has now been found guilty of raping 10 women and attempting to rape two more. He is currently serving a life sentence with a 35-year-minimum for the rape and murder of Ms Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012. Bayley was found guilty of raping the 18-year-old in July 2014, but suppression orders prevented reporting of the case until he faced the two other trials this month. Judge Sue Pullen lifted the orders when the final jury returned its verdict on the backpacker's case on Wednesday and will sentence Bayley at a later date. Born Adrian Ernest Edwards on July 14, 1971, he grew up in Melbourne with four younger siblings and an abusive father, who once smashed his son's head through a wall . Ms Meagher's body was found six days after the horrific murder by the hands of Bayley . Born Adrian Ernest Edwards on July 14, 1971, he grew up in Melbourne with four younger siblings and an abusive father, who once smashed his son's head through a wall. Bayley told a prison psychologist he was also sexually abused from age nine to 15 by an older female, though this claim has not been verified. 'There is certainly evidence of physical abuse - in my opinion, some evidence of the possibility of sexual abuse,' psychologist James Ogloff later told a court. Professor Ogloff believes Bayley's borderline personality disorder contributes to his impulsiveness and unstable self image. Bayley fantasises about assuming power and control over his victims, and the psychologist believes he derives pleasure from inflicting pain. His criminal record suggests this is the case. FIRST TRIAL: July 2014 . Victim raped in late 2000 when aged 18 in a laneway in St Kilda. Bayley put his fingers down her throat so she couldn't breathe and threatened to kill her, the ABC reported. She became addicted to heroin at 14 and turned to sex working to supplement her habit. Bayley was her third and last client. SECOND TRIAL: March 2015 . Another sex worker, aged 25, was told by Bayley 12 years later in April 2012 that she needed a pimp to 'look out' for her while he was raping her in the back of his car. He then drove her to a hotel to use the bathroom when Bayley drove away after she refused to get back in the car. THIRD TRIAL: March 2015 . A Dutch backpacker was beckoned by Bayley to get in his car because he said another car was following her while she was walking from a pub in St Kilda to her home to Balaclava in July 2012. The woman was so fearful of dying while being raped that she invited Bayley back to her place where he took a couple of steps into her house but left when he realised her flatmates were home. Bayley is currently serving a life sentence with a 35-year-minimum for the rape and murder of Ms Meagher (pictured as a teenager) in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012 . Bayley picked up all three women in St Kilda and drove them to a secluded laneway where he parked with the passenger side door pressed against a fence, blocking their escape . His first rape was committed just months after he walked down the isle, in 1990, and a string of sexual assaults soon followed. In June 1991, a 19-year-old Bayley was jailed for five years, with a three-year non-parole period, for raping a teenager and attempting to rape two more women. He spent almost two years in prison before being released in 1993, when he trained as a pastry chef. Bayley had two children with his first wife before they split. He married again, fathering another two children. He changed his last name from Edwards to Bayley in 2000, but returned to violent sexual crime. In the early 2000s there were reports to police that a young, fit man was targeting prostitutes in St Kilda. He was jailed again in April 2002 for 11 years, with minimum of eight, for 16 charges of rape against five victims. He would drive them to a laneway, park so his victims could not escape, and then brutally rape them. Bayley's first rape was committed just months after he walked down the isle, in 1990, and a string of sexual assaults soon followed . When a judge jailed him in 2002, he said Bayley used threats and violence to satisfy his 'gross sexual appetite'. Bayley was released on parole in 2010, and was working as a labourer in 2012 when he attacked again. This time he killed his victim, Jill Meagher. Bayley did appear to be sorry, Prof Ogloff said. Though he said it was quite common for people to be very remorseful but to persist in engaging in that behaviour. Bayley seems to agree. 'They should never have let me out,' Bayley told police after confessing to killing Ms Meagher. 'How many chances does a person need.'","Adrian Ernest Bayley, the sex offender who murdered Jill Meagher, has been found guilty of raping three more women .

"An abandoned dog has saved the lives of ten sick, newborn puppies and their weak mother after incessantly barking to alert passersby and then leading them to the dogs'  location in dense woods. The Labrador mix, who has since been named Hero, had spent weeks eluding members of Dallas Dogrrr-Rescue, Rehab, Reform in Texas, who were trying to rescue him from a south Dallas park. But on Tuesday night, he greeted rescuer Marina Tarashevsce and dog behaviorist John Miller with persistent barking. Every time the pair moved closer to him, Hero inched backward and barked.

According to Dogrrr-Rescue, Hero may be the puppies'' father, although this is not confirmed. But regardless, he will undoubtedly be 'the most loving and nurturing dog dad', the group remarked. Speaking to 'Fox and Friends Weekend' on Sunday, Ms Tarashevsce said she and Mr Miller were greeted by a 'loud barking' when they walked across the park to retrieve black-furred Hero. 'When I got there in the evening, Hero was barking really loudly,' she told the program. 'And it wasn't just a regular bark. He just wouldn't stop and it sounded like he was in distress of some sort.' Ms Tarashevsce said that she had often seen Hero with Mona, whom she  suspected to be pregnant, in recent weeks, so she assumed that something must be wrong with the expectant mother.

Mr Miller, who is an expert in dogs' behavior, had apparently known straight away the pair needed to follow Hero. He determined that the Lab's barking and movements meant he wanted them to come.

"A baby who developed a life-threatening heart defect in the womb has had a heart transplant - at just 23 days old. Doctors said little Dravyn Johnson 'could die at any moment' after being born with just half a heart in Orange County, California. The right side of the organ, which is essential to provide blood to the lungs, had not formed and the only hope of survival was a transplant. Miracle baby: Dravyn Johnson spent just two days on the transplant list before a new heart was found for him . With the average wait for an infant heart being six months, Dravyn's chances looked slim so his family were amazed to get the call after after just two days on the transplant list. Mother, Nicole Eggleton, who was 22 weeks pregnant when she learned of his condition, said she spent the rest of the pregnancy in fear. 'I never bought him clothes. I never got anything. I was just scared,' she said. But now she challenges anyone to see that there was ever anything wrong with him. He looks perfect. If you didn't know, you wouldn't know anything was wrong,' Doing well: Little Dravyn gets a cuddle from mother Nicole Eggleton, after undergoing the successful transplant at just 23 days old . Doctors had initially thought that his heart could be repaired with a series of corrective surgeries in the first few years of his life. At just 23 days old, Dravyn Johnson is UCLA's youngest heart recipient in 25 years. Pediatric heart surgeon, Brian Reemtsen, said they were worried he would not live long enough for surgery. He said of the heart: 'It had such severe disease that we were afraid that the baby could arrest or die at any moment.' Infants usually have to wait an average six months for an organ to become available on the list so Dravyn was lucky he only had to wait two days after being listed. A six-day-old premature baby became the youngest infant to receive a heart transplant at a US hospital in January. Baby Oliver Crawford underwent the operation at Phoenix Children's Hospital in Arizona after being born seven weeks ahead of schedule with a heart defect which meant her parents didn't expect him to survive. But when he was born in early February at an Orange County hospital, they discovered he had only one coronary artery instead of two and determined that surgery would be too risky. He was airlifted to Mattel when he was five days old where doctors confirmed that the only hope for his survival was an urgent heart transplant. Incredibly, within two days of being on the list, a donor was found and the operation was able to go ahead. The operation made Dravyn the second youngest heart recipient at the hospital, only surpassed by a 16-day-old tot who received a transplanted heart in 1994. Dr. Juan Alejos, professor of pediatric cardiology and director of the Pediatric Heart Transplant Program at Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA, said Dravyn's case was 'special'. 'Any surgery that potentially could have been done aside from transplant was exceedingly high-risk, so the decision was made that we would list for heart transplantation,' he said. 'All of our heart transplant patients are special, but I think this one was special because we knew there was a risk we might not find a donor in time.' At five weeks old, he was well enough to go home yesterday and join his two older brothers. Dravyn is expected to remain on medication and will need follow-up care. Doctors expect that his new heart should last up to 20 years before he'll need another transplant.","Dravyn Johnson spent just two days on the transplant list .

"Former US representative Anthony Weiner was spotted taking his son for a quick stroll amid claims his wife has been caught up in the Hillary Clinton email scandal. The 50-year-old house husband was seen pushing three-year-old Jordan on the swings at a playground near to his house in downtown Manhattan yesterday. The pair later rushed across town to get pizza. Former US representative Anthony Weiner was spotted taking his son for a quick stroll near his downtown Manhattan home yesterday. They were seen enjoying themselves amid claims Weiner's wife has been caught up in the Hillary Clinton email scandal . They were spotted enjoying themselves as Weiner's wife Huma Abedin faces scrutiny about using a private email account. Abedin is one of three top Clinton aides who reportedly used email addresses hosted on the former secretary of state's private server. Senior figures in Congress were already investigating Clinton's communications from 2009-13, which they say were not conducted via official State Department accounts but a 'clintonemail.com' address. Clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of communications from the time - but admitted on Tuesday during a news conference that she deleted more than 30,000 emails she decided were personal in nature and unrelated to her job. The 50-year-old house husband made sure he pushed three-year-old Jordan high on the swings before the pair ran off to get pizza . The investigation has now widened after it emerged that one of Abedin's email addresses is Huma@clintonemail.com, showing that she could have also been using the server to conduct official business. Daily Mail Online confirmed the address through Lexis-Nexis, a commercial service that compiles public records. It comes nearly four years after Weiner's own scandal where he resigned from Congress for sending sexually suggestive photographs of himself via his public Twitter account to other women. Longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Abedin (left), shown with then-Secretary of State Clinton during a 2010 diplomatic meeting in Vietnam, was her deputy chief of staff and is expected to play a key roll if Clinton runs for president . At the time he admitted that he had sent images to six women in three years and said that he had stopped. But in 2013 further claims were made that he sent more under the alias 'Carlos Danger' to a 22-year-old woman. He tried to return to politics by taking part in the 2013 New York Mayoral race but lost after receiving less than five per cent of votes.","Weiner pushed three-year-old Jordan to park in Manhattan yesterday .

"Two Polish men were caught trying to leave the UK in a stolen rowing boat this morning as they attempted to paddle across the English Channel to France. The men were rescued by Dover's Lifeboat crew just two miles into their 21-mile trip after they were spotted. The two men, who are believed to be in their 20s, are thought to have stolen the boat from Folkestone, Kent, before setting for France just after 8am today. The men are thought to have stolen the boat from Folkestone before setting out on the 21-mile trip across the Channel just after 8am today. Folkestone Coastguard tweeted this picture of the two men being rescued . They were rescued by the crew at Dover Lifeboat station, and told them they 'had no money' and could not find jobs in the UK - and so were 'going to France to find work'. James Clapham, who works at Dover Lifeboat station, said: 'They were trying to make it to Calais, but with the strong breeze and incoming tide they didn't get very far. 'It's quite unusual to try and get to the other side. 'They said they had been looking for work but didn't find any in Britain and they said they were going back to France.' The men told the lifeboat crew they 'had no money' and were going to France to find jobs . The men were handed over to officers from Kent Police at around 11am. Derek Edwards, 45, who lives in the town, said: 'It's crazy that they were trying to leave Britain when all those people in Calais are desperately trying to get into the country. 'They were lucky they were spotted before they got half way across the Channel or it could have ended in tragedy.' A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'We were called just before 9am to reports that two Polish men had taken a boat from Folkestone and were rowing to France. 'They were picked up by Dover Lifeboat and the men were questioned by UK Border Force. 'Kent Police is trying to locate the owner of the boat which is believed to be stolen.' A Border Force spokesman said no immigration offences had been committed so they were taking no further action. In July last year a group of 28 illegal immigrants - 22 men, four women and two children - were caught as they tried to sneak out of the UK by stowing away on a lorry. They were found after the truck they were hiding in disembarked from the P&O ferry The Spirit of France in Calais - and were promptly send back to the UK. The unnamed Romanian driver of the lorry was questioned by French police before being allowed to continue his journey to Poland.","Two Polish men in their 20s were spotted paddling in stolen rowing boat .

"A millionaire has won a legal victory which could see a £10.5 million solar farm removed at a cost of £1.5 million - because it overshadows his Grade II listed home. Daniel Gerber from Broughton Gifford, Wiltshire, was horrified when developers started constructing the 54-acre site on the doorstep of his six-bedroom Grade-II listed home - which is worth almost £3million. He claims he was not informed of the planning application by the local authority - despite the development being just 45 metres from the boundary of his property. Gifford Hall (pictured) Mr Gerber's Grade-II listed home has six bedrooms and is worth almost £3million . Norrington Solar Farm, based near Mr Gerber's home, was opened in June last year at a lost of £10.5 million . Mr Gerber only became aware of the project when he went out for a walk in March last year and found construction was already underway. He took his case to the High Court where he argued that English Heritage should also have been consulted as a listed property was involved. One of the country's top judges, Mr Justice Dove, upheld his claim and has ordered Wiltshire Council to reconsider the planning application for the site. Daniel Gerber (pictured) was 'horrified' when developers started constructing the 54-acre solar farm on the doorstep of his Grade-II listed home . If it is refused the solar farm - which became operational in June last year - may have to be ripped up and the council could be sued by the developers. Mr Gerber, who has lived in Broughton Gifford for five years, has now spoken of his victory for the first time. The father-of-three said he was compelled to act and save the beautiful countryside around his home for future generations. 'This case is about Wiltshire Council not following a prescribed, legal planning process but it is also about what it means to live in the countryside and what we leave for the next generation,' he said. 'You can imagine my shock and horror in March 2014 when I left my house with my two year old to take a walk through our garden into the open countryside. 'I could not believe the scale of the development that had started and immediately rushed back inside to phone Wiltshire Council. 'The decision to place a 22.1 hectare solar farm on productive farmland, next to a Conservation Area and in beautiful, open countryside was made by one person - the planning officer. 'A decision to build a massive, industrial development in the countryside should have gone to the Planning Committee. 'With help one family was able to challenge a multi-billion pound U.S. company and a local council with a £350 million overall budget. 'That shows the UK legal system works and should encourage other individuals to stand up against inappropriately sited, large-scale development.' Daniel Gerber is pictured addressing Wiltshire council over the installation of a solar farm near his home . The submitted plans - the council has now been told to reconsider the planning applicatiom . Norrington Solar Farm, operated by Norrington Solar Farm Limited and TerraForm Power, was opened in June last year at a lost of £10.5 million. Should the solar farm be forced to be dismantled it could cost more than £1.5 million to restore the site. Wiltshire Council could also face a hefty bill if they are sued by the solar giants. Mr Justice Gove granted ruled that the site had been built with an unlawful planning permission on the grounds that the effect on Mr Gerber's listed home had not been considered. He said: 'It follows that from the record of the decision, the listed building and its setting was affected. 'This needed to be evaluated. The statutory scheme requires English Heritage to have the chance to input into that evaluation. 'It is precisely the matter on which English Heritage's expert views should be sought. The failure to do so in this case was in my view a clear legal error. 'The issues in relation to Gifford Hall have not been considered properly. 'The status of Gifford Hall as a Grade II listed building and the failure to give its interests a proper and lawful consideration attracts in my view very significant weight in the overall balance of considerations.' Mr Gerber, who lives with his wife, Victoria and his daughter, Alice, added that if the solar development was removed the locals could once again enjoy their village. He said: 'The future of the Norrington solar farm is bleak. 'As of Thursday, March 5 2015, the whole development does not have planning permission and is unlawful. 'It is clearly inappropriately sited, destroying what were once productive and beautiful, open, agricultural fields. 'Broughton Gifford has been treated unfairly by the Wiltshire Planning Department. 'These planning officers pushed to approve three, large-scale, industrial solar farms in one, idyllic, beautiful village. Mr Gerber claims he was not informed of the planning application by Wiltshire Council - despite the solar development (pictured) being just 45 metres from the boundary of his Grade-II listed property . A protest organised by Wiltshire Protect group who have mobilised to fight the development of solar farms . 'These once beautiful fields were where I was privileged to meet other residents of Broughton Gifford. 'It is a friendly village and families used to enjoy walking these once open, productive fields with their dogs. 'That is impossible now with a fenced-in, 22.1 hectare solar farm and believe me; I have not once seen a sheep grazing in this solar monstrosity, as claimed by the Planning Officers and developers. 'We all are in favour of renewable energy, if the planning process is lawful and the development is appropriately sited. 'This was not the case with the Norrington Solar Farm.' A spokesperson for Wiltshire Council said it carried out 'extensive publicity' about the application and will now consider an appeal. 'We are disappointed with the ruling and will be considering our position regarding a possible appeal. 'We carried out extensive publicity concerning this application at the time, including site notices, a press notice and notifying neighbours we considered would be affected. 'We will now meet with the landowners to ensure accurate plans of the development are submitted before consulting with English Heritage. 'The application will then be re-determined taking account of the findings in the judgement.'","Daniel Gerber was 'horrified' when a solar farm was built on his doorstop .

"Two kittens have been saved after they were covered in yellow paint and abandoned in a cardboard box at the side of the road in China. The animals were only discovered when a nearby resident heard them crying and went to investigate. Animal rights campaigners today blasted whoever left them there, labelling the act 'terribly cruel'. Yue You Meng, from Guangzhou, said she was walking down the road when she realised the noise was coming from a battered cardboard box. Two kittens have been saved (right) after they were covered in yellow paint (left) and abandoned in a cardboard box at the side of the road in China . She said: 'When I opened it up I saw the two kittens inside covered in sticky yellow paint. 'It had almost dried and their legs were stuck together, they were stuck together, and even their eyes had been closed by the paint. 'They were really in a pitiful state so I picked the box up and took them home where I tried to clean off some of the paint.' But the 27-year-old was unable to remove the paint and took the animals to a vet who had to cut off their fur. The sticky paint had dried and stuck the kittens' legs together, as well as matting their fur and covering their eyes . A vet painstakingly cut the paint-covered fur off both the kittens, which took several hours. They were then wrapped in tiny blankets . A spokesman for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said: 'Slapping paint on animals is terribly cruel and could cause allergic reactions, blood poisoning and other life-threatening complications, including suffocation. 'Unfortunately, this type of abuse is legal in China, where there are no penalties for abusing animals. 'PETA Asia regularly communicates with municipal governments in China in an effort to implement better animal welfare legislation, including dispelling myths about rabies and assisting with other animal control issues.' Miss Yue added: 'The kittens are better now and can walk around and do not seem to have suffered any permanent damage to their eyes or ears. 'But they still look really poorly because they had so much fur cut-off. Yue You Meng, from Guangzhou, took the kittens back to her home in a cardboard box and they are now recovering . The 27-year-old said: 'They are better now and can walk around and do not seem to have suffered any permanent damage to their eyes or ears. But they still look really poorly because they had so much fur cut-off' 'They are very resilient and despite the bad start in life they are already starting to play around with each other like ordinary kittens.' It is unclear whether the kittens were accidentally covered in paint and abandoned or deliberately targeted before being dumped. Police are not investigating.","Discovered in a box by Yue You Meng near her house in Guangzhou .

"Google has taken a fight with the Wall Street Journal to a new level - by countering what it sees as misleading, inaccurate reporting with a gif of a laughing baby. The search giant turned to fodder more usually seen on teenage blogs and social media in an escalating conflict based on a Federal Trade Commission report uncovered by the Wall Street Journal. The search giant used the looping clip while retaliating against an article in the newspaper which quoted the report, which uncovered officials' reservations about Google's business practices, and was supposed to remain private. gif war: A Google public relations official deployed this picture of a laughing baby to counter reporting she objects to in the Wall Street Journal . Boss: Rachel Whetstone, pictured, was the author of the blog post. She worked for the British Conservative Party before joining the search giant . It also took umbrage to the suggestion that Google staff members visiting the White House 230 times President Obama took office could have affected the probe. Ultimately the FTC concluded that it wasn't worth trying to sue Google, and instead negotiated changes to its practices, which the company implemented. But rather than respond directly to what it saw as the Journal's inaccurate reporting, Google posted the cutesy image and implied that the newspapers' publishers were being hypocrites. Implications: Whetstone's post took aim at Wall Street Journal owner Rupert Murdoch, whose lower-brow publications were also given a mention . Rachel Whetstone, senior vice president in Google's Communications and Policy department, wrote the post, which began with aspersions against News Corp, the company which ultimately owns the journal. She said: 'Last year Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp, accused Google of creating a ""less informed, more vexatious level of dialogue in our society."" 'Given the tone of some of your publications, that made quite a few people chuckle.' She then followed up with the baby gif. The mention of the 'tone' of some News Corp titles is evidently a reference to the fact that, as well as the Journal, News Corp ultimately owns the New York Post tabloid, as well as The Sun in Britain. She also responded to the Journal's supposed claims that Google has 'undue political influence' by linking to a famous Sun front page claiming that its endorsement swayed the country's 1992 general election. Only then did Whetstone, a former high-ranking political adviser for the British Conservative Party, address a list of grievances with the Journal's report, which cited instances when FTC officials recommended suing Google. Clincher: Whetstone used the above image to end her argument, after pointing out that Google's business practices had been approved by several government bodies . She also drew in another report which pointed out that Google's 230+ meetings at the White House during Obama's presidency, and cited an FTC statement saying the Journal had been 'misleading' by juxtaposing that fact with reporting on the anti-competitive practices investigation. After citing a number of other rulings vindicating, by state-level government bodies and also officials in Europe, Whetstone fired off another gif - this one a jubilant Jewish New Yorker winning an argument. The piece was a seemingly rare intervention by Whetstone, who hadn't written a blog for Google since 2012. A recourse to gifs in otherwise serious discussion isn't unprecedented. In January, House Speaker John Boehner fired off a salvo of 12 Taylor Swift gifs to trash the President's community college plans. A spokesman for the Democrats responded in time, harnessing the pop icon to declare 'Haters gonna hate' over Twitter.","Search engine took umbrage to reporting on federal probe from 2012 .

"You may actually have to tell the truth at your future job interviews thanks to new software that acts as a 'lie detector' by analysing your facial expressions. It has been created by American company ooVoo who believe it will be useful in the world of business and politics, according to the Telegraph. Researchers fed a computer huge amounts of pictures showing human expressions - collected as part of a project on autism - to 'teach' it how to read emotions, Christopher Williams reported. But even the firm behind the technology admits 'it is going to cause some worries for people' because of privacy issues. 'Lie detector': Researchers fed a computer with images of facial expressions and 'taught' it to read emotions (file photo) It could also be used during financial negotiations to gauge if someone is going to commit to deal, according to ooVoo, which is working in partnership with a leader in perceptual computing and emotional analytics. Affectiva's technology was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The firm is also planning to use the app in retail to see how customers react to a particular product or display. The company - whose web-conferencing app has been downloaded by over 100 million people worldwide - unveiled their new software at the mobile industry's biggest technology showcase in Barcelona this week. Political pollsters are already planning to use it on a wide scale during the next US presidential election next year after testing it in the country. With more and more employers interviewing potential candidates over video chat, it could be used to gather more information about their body language - and even if they are lying. The managing director of Myrian Capital who own ooVoo believes this would simply be 'another source of data' for employers. Poker face: With more and more jobs taking place over video chat, employers could get an added insight into potential candidates (file photo) He said: 'There are major implications of this , including privacy and it is going to cause some worries for people.

"If you are wanting to explore a city, get to a meeting in a hurry, visit a friend, or just get home after a night of cocktails, there is nothing better than a good taxi service to make it happen. Ever since motorised travel first came into use in the 19th century people with  knowledge of the roads and attractions have charged willing passengers for their services. Despite all the different types of transportation, be it a cab, tup tup, jeepney or jitney, we are all bound and aided by a common service: the humble taxi. As of March 14, 2014, in New York City, there are 51,398 men and women licensed to drive yellow taxicabs . With the first taxi carriage services starting to emerge in 1897, transportation was often rickety, slow and motorless, with both driver and passenger unsure of the correct fare price. The boom of industry in the 19th century resulted in motorised methods replacing animal taxis, although this is still common in areas of the world where vehicles would be impractical. These include husky-propelled sledges, camels in the Sahara or elephant rides in Asia. Even the prices vary dramatically, with haggling being common place in Peru, and taxi-sharing being popular in Nigeria. Fares can be calculated per mile, with some of the most expensive being London's hackney carriage cabs at £2.56, compared to £0.30 per mile in India's equivalent. The following infographic by The Taxi Centre unpacks all you need to know about all the different taxis around the globe, so getting a cab is the least stressful part of your holiday.","Whether it is a black cab in London, a gondola in Venice or a seaplane in the Maldives taxis are always on hand to get us from A to B .

"The sperm of a proto-facist Italian soldier and poet has been used to reconstruct his DNA, the first time this technique has been used. Scientists performed the reconstruction, which usually requires the exhumation of remains, by analysing a handkerchief belonging to soldier and poet Gabriele D’Annunzio 100 years ago. It had been given by D’Annunzio to his lover, Countess Olga Levi Brunner, in 1916 with semen residue on it. Italian Gabriele D’Annunzio's (shown right, with Mussolini on the left) sperm was use to reconstruct his DNA. Scientists analysed a handkerchief belonging to D’Annunzio 100 years ago. It had been given to his lover Countess Olga Levi Brunner with semen on it . The handkerchief was analysed by police in Cagliari, Sardinia, along with a letter written by the countess and an ivory toothbrush. They had been stored at the Vittoriale degli Italiani foundation in Lombardy, northern Italy. D’Annunzio, born 12 March 1863, moved into the building in 1922 until his death on 1 March 1938. It was later turned into a museum. Scientists believe that DNA evidence found at a crime scene could in the future be used to create mugshots of criminal suspects. This is one potential use to emerge from a new research paper - Modeling 3D Facial Shape From DNA - published on last year in Plos Genetics. In the article, a team of scientists explained how they were able to produce crude 3D models of faces simply from people's DNA samples. ‘We show that facial variation with regard to sex, ancestry, and genes can be systematically studied with our methods, allowing us to lay the foundation for predictive modeling of faces,’ the researchers wrote. Experts studied the artifacts using a crimescope light, which can observe objects in a variety of wavelengths. This revealed the hidden blotches on the handkerchief, the DNA results of which were then compared with Federico d’Annunzio, the right-wing revolutionary’s great grandson. Vittoriale degli Italiani foundation chief Giordano Bruno Guerri joked that the experiment might open the door to the future cloning of historical figures even if their remains have been lost. ‘Nobody wants to clone D’Annunzio, but nobody knows what changes will take place in science and society,’ he said. ‘It’s good the DNA has been collected.’ AFP news agency described D’Annunzio as a ‘proto-fasciast warmonger’, with many saying his ideals were a forerunner to Italian fascism. The Italian Carabinieri Forensic Department (shown) presented results of their research about an unpublished letter that Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938) wrote on 15 July 1935.

"A half ton shipment of radioactive sanitary products has been discovered by customs officials at a Lebanon airport. Around 30 crates of feminine hygiene products were seized Friday at Rafik Hariri International Airport in Beirut after electronic scanners detected radioactivity in the shipment. Tests revealed the shipment, which weighed 554 kilograms, had more than 35 times the safe levels of radioactivity. Around 30 crates of feminine hygiene products were seized Friday at Rafik Hariri International Airport in Beirut after electronic scanners detected radioactivity in the shipment . The sanitary pads had originated in China, and arrived at the airport Friday from Dubai, officials said. After  failing to pass the radioactivity scanner test at the airport, the shipment's contents were examined at the Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission . The Lebanon Minister for Finance, the department which is responsible for customs, told Al-Joumhouriya newspaper: 'As a result of the examination of a number of boxes that contained sanitary pads, it appeared that the rate of radioactivity inside them was 35 times more than is permitted.' A half ton shipment of radioactive sanitary products, which were more than 35 times the safe level of radiation, was discovered by customs officials at a Lebanon airport . The sanitary towels were manufactured by Anion which purports the health benefits of anions- groups of negatively charged ionized atoms. It is not known, but it may be possible the source of the radiation came from the production process. Ionization happens when atoms are given high-energy ionizing radiation, electrical voltage or high temperature. Atomic nuclei that have been completely ionized are called charged particles and are also radioactive. On the company website, Anions claim their pads and pantyliners contain an anion layer which 'emits intensive anion stream beneficial to human health in amount up to 5800 for cm3.' They go onto claims that anions are 'air vitamins' and 'significantly benefit to human health and daily routine' boosting the respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems. A specialized judiciary launched an investigation into the case. The discovery was the latest in a series of radioactive finds at Beirut's airport and sea port amid an ongoing crackdown on radioactive imports. Last month, the Khalil ordered the Customs Department at the same airport to send back a shipment of 98 mobile phone covers from China that were revealed to be radioactive.","Customs at Rafik Hariri International Airport found 30 crates of the contaminated maxi pads .

"A heavily pregnant woman has been hospitalised in France after being assaulted by two men in what her husband claims was an 'Islamophobic act'. One of the attackers hit 29-year-old Kedidja, who was wearing a headscarf, several times and threw her to the ground as she dropped her two children off at school in Toulouse, La Depeche  reports. Her husband Munir says they grabbed her hair and pulled at her veil while yelling 'none of that here' at the nine-months-pregnant woman who is due to give birth in mid-April. She is now recovering and her unborn baby is believed to be unharmed, but her husband revealed that she has not stopped crying since the attack on Tuesday morning. Brutal: Two men attacked heavily pregnant Kedidja (not pictured) in Toulouse, France in what her husband denounced as an 'Islamophobic act' He added: 'My wife had just put our two daughters to school, one in kindergarten and one in elementary school. 'Upon leaving, she met two young men. One of them grabbed her hair, pulled on her veil and insulted her. 'After the final few blows and a some more insults - including death threats - the two boys ran away, leaving her extremely shocked.' The assailant's friend reportedly stopped the attack from continuing before the pair shouted racist abuse and threatened to kill her. 33-year-old Munir described himself and his wife as 'French and Muslim' said the men took offence to the headscarf even though she was dressed conventionally in tracksuit bottoms and a jacket. Their local MP Christophe Borgel was outraged after hearing about the attack and claims that it was 'without a doubt' racially motivated. He told The Local: 'I was shocked to learn of this attack. This French woman of Muslim faith was attacked because she was wearing the traditional headscarf.' 'France does not tolerate any kind of racist attack, France will not tolerate any kind of aggression based on the religion of one of its citizens.

The woman tragically suffered a miscarriage but it remained unclear with she lost her baby directly because of the attack. Islamic clothing has been a divisive issue in France and the country banned full-face veils from all public areas in 2010 after outlawing headscarves from all state schools in 2004.

"The police officers who responded to the 911 from a woman in Colorado, who was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out have praised the woman's strength and bravery in the most trying of circumstances. Michelle Wilkins, 26, was seven months pregnant when she responded to a Craigslist posting for maternity clothes in Longmont, on Wednesday, only to be stabbed in the stomach by the stranger who posted the ad, with her baby forcibly removed from her womb. Local law enforcement officers Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski were first on the scene and describe finding Wilkins weak and in a state of shock. Victim: Michelle Wilkins, 26, was seven months pregnant when she was stabbed and had her baby removed by another woman in Longmont, Colorado, on Wednesday while answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes . Local law enforcement officers Billy Sawyer, right, and Phil Piotrowski, left, were first on the scene and describe finding Wilkins weak and in a state of shock . 'I started yelling and Michelle yelled back, very faintly, and it was muffled — ""Help me! Help me!""' Sawyer told KTLA. He describes finding her covered from head to toe in blood. 'So I put some gloves on and held her hand and went through where her injuries were … trying to figure out exactly what we had,' he said. Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, 'She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly.' But Sawyer's colleague Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who 'saved her own life.' 'She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,' he said. The situation was so bad that he had to leave the room for a moment to compose himself. Attacked: Michelle Wilkins had her first baby 'expertly cut from womb by Dynel Catrece Lane' after going to her house to answer Craigslist ad. Wilkins was so shocked when she arrived at Longmont United Hospital, Colorado, that she still thought she was pregnant, sources say . Michelle Wilkins' parents have spoken at-length for the first time about the unspeakable attack on their daughter, saying she is 'guardedly optimistic' but 'scarred beyond imagination'. The statement released from Watkins' family, via Longmont police, on Friday revealed the mom-to-be was expecting a daughter. 'Her attacker beat, cut, and strangled her, and according to initial reports, then removed her unborn daughter with an ordinary kitchen knife, leaving Michelle for dead,' the parents said in the statement. 'We cannot begin to fathom the depths of depravity and evil which drove her attacker, and trust that between law enforcement and our legal system; they will make sure justice is carried out. 'One life was ended and another scarred beyond imagination in this senseless act, with scores of others negatively affected.' The suspect, Dynel Lane, 34, was arrested presenting the abducted child as her own in hospital, and is facing charges of first-degree attempted murder, assault and child abuse. She been remanded in Boulder County Jail on $2 million bail. Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, (pictured with her husband, David Ridley) was facing murder charges in Colorado after she allegedly cut a baby from the womb of a seven months' pregnant woman who she lured to her home with a Craigslist ad for baby clothes . Lane, who has two daughters, was held on $2million bail during a hearing at Boulder County Jail, Colorado on Thursday (pictured in booking photo) On Friday, a member of staff at Longmont United Hospital today told Daily Mail Online how Wilkins did not realize she had lost her baby to a maniac and still believed she was carrying her child. Abby Johnson, 18, an intern at the hospital said the horrified woman, who had blood pouring from her stomach, pleaded for help and was concerned about the safety of the baby which had been due this Spring. Johnson, speaking through her friend Gary Brennan, said Michelle was in 'a terrible state with her guts hanging out. She had been bleeding really badly.' Her cousin told ABC11 that the baby was her first and would have been her parents' first grandchild. Wilkins' partner Dan - the couple are not married and his surname is not known - is at her bedside. 'Michelle's always been a person who is kind hearted, a free spirit, has a love for all mankind, and I can't imagine what she's going through at this time,' Tony Wilkins, her cousin,  told ABC11.com. 'It's almost like a horror movie. Who would think that something like this would actually occur in real life.' The baby died after  Lane took it to the hospital and told a staffer she had had a miscarriage, according to authorities. Johnson said Lane had arrived at the hospital around 20 minutes earlier with the baby's body, crying and saying: 'It's all my fault. I am so sorry.' The suspect told staff she had been pregnant, but had miscarried her child and repeatedly apologized to staff. Abby said the baby was 'completely clean and washed and still had the umbilical chord attached, but the woman was covered in blood'. She added: 'I was on my own and told her I could not be responsible for taking care of her and went to get help. 'She was covered in blood and kept saying she had miscarried.' The alleged attacker and victim did not meet a second time at the hospital as they were ferried to separate rooms. Police are investigating whether Lane knocked Wilkins her unconscious and then removed the fetus by cutting open her abdomen. Wilkins arrived at the home shortly before midday to buy baby clothes which had been advertised. She was also stabbed in the neck with a broken glass before being cut open. In Longmont this week, protesters took to the streets of the city, which has a population of 90,000, to pressure police into charging the suspect with murder. Court: Dynel Lane is seen exiting the courtroom area after her first appearance on Thursday, March 19, 2015, at the Boulder County Jail. Lane, accused of cutting open the belly of a pregnant woman and removing her unborn baby from her womb, had told her family she was expecting a baby boy . The demonstrator's held placards with messages such as 'Murder is murder' and 'Justice for Michelle'. Among then were several pregnant women who got together to join the demonstration through social media. Katelyn Dunn, 26, said: 'We feel so sorry for Michelle. She had carried her child for seven months and must have been so excited about the future as a mother. 'It is a very special thing to have a child and this is such an appalling thing to happen. We feel so much for her and want the attacker to be accused of murder and nothing less.' Murder charges against Lane now depend on whether the child was alive outside of the 26-year-old expectant mother's womb, the district attorney's office said on Thursday. Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L. Garnett said: 'The issue of whether or not murder charges are appropriate involving a case involving the death of a fetus or a late-term pregnancy is always a difficult issue. Protests: Naomi Garcia, 11, left to right, her grandmother Eileen Egger, and Jennifer Ansell demand murder charges be brought against Lane at an impromptu protest in Longmont last Wednesday . 'Under Colorado law, essentially, there's no way murder charges can be brought if it's not established that the fetus lived as a child outside the body of the mother for some period of time. 'I don't know the answer yet as to whether that can be established, what our facts are here.' Lane allegedly lured Wilkins to her Longmont home on Wednesday using the Craigslist ad. Wilkins arrived at the home shortly before midday. A knife with a 3-inch blade was found at the scene, according to CNN. Lane, who has two teenage daughters, made a brief appearance in court Thursday. A police report on Thursday read: 'The person who did the incision would have to have researched the subject of Cesarean Births to achieve the level of accuracy.' State records show Lane holds an expired nurse's aide license. The suspect's husband, David Ridley, told police he returned home to take his wife to a scheduled prenatal checkup, however she informed him she had miscarried and that the baby was in the bathtub. Treatment: Both women were taken to Longmont United Hospital. The victim remains critical but stable . Mr Ridley, who is not considered a suspect, said he found the baby in the tub, turned it over and rubbed its back. He told police he heard the child take a 'gasping breath'. Mr Ridley grabbed the baby and his wife and rushed both of them to hospital. Lane carried the infant's dead body into the hospital wrapped in a towel and told staff that she had suffered a miscarriage. Despite being covered in blood, she refused to be examined by staff and later admitted to police she had cut open another woman's womb. Meanwhile, Wilkins managed to call 911 while she lay bleeding heavily in the basement of the cul-de-sac home. During the desperate six-minute call, she faintly told the dispatcher: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.' The woman was able to give the dispatcher the address, adding that she was in the basement and had locked the door. She had multiple wounds, Wilkins said, and the attacker broke a glass and stabbed her in the neck as she was trying to leave.","First responders have praised Michelle Wilkins, 26, for her bravery after the seven months pregnant women was brutally attacked on Wednesday .

"The world's oldest mummies buried more than 7,000 years ago in the arid desert of northern Chile are being turned into black slime by climate change. Scientists have found that growing humidity can cause an explosion of bacteria living on the preserved skin of the Chinchorro mummies. The bacteria then feeds on the ancient skin, causing it to break down into a black slime. The preserved skin on the outside of Chinchorro mummies in Arica, northern Chile, have begun to rapidly degrade as bacteria and humid air is turning it into  black slime, as can be seen in the photograph above . Researchers say that rising humidity levels in Arica, Chile, is putting the 120 Chinchorro mummies at the University of Tarapacá's archaeological museum at risk. However, they warn that hundreds of other mummies buried just beneath the sandy surface in the valleys throughout the region are also under threat. While some of the earliest mummies found in the Atacama desert appear to have been the result of natural preservation in the extremely dry conditions, around 5,000 BC, the Chinchorro people began deliberately preserving their dead. Although the practice began 2,000 years before the Ancient Egptians began mummifying their own dead, the techniques used by the Chinchorro were often surprisingly sophisticated. They would often take the most care when preserving the remains of dead children and babies - suggesting the act had a deep significance with linking the living to the dead. First the Chinchorro would extract the brains and organs before then reconstructing the body with fibres. They would fill the empty skull with straw or ash. Reeds were then used to sew it back together and connect the jaw to the cranium. A stick was used to keep the spine straight and the skin was patched back together before being covered with a paste made from manganese, red ocher or mud. Professor Marcela Sepulveda, an archaeologist at the University of Tarapacá, said: 'In the last 10 years, the process has accelerated. 'It is very important to get more information about what’s causing this and to get the university and national government to do what’s necessary to preserve the Chinchorro mummies for the future.' The Chinchorro mummies are in some cases nearly 4,000 years older than those found preserved from ancient Egypt. The oldest mummy discovered in the Atacama desert dates to 7020BC while the oldest in Egypt dates to 3,000BC. However, the practice of preserving the dead with mummification became popular among the Chinchoro around 5,000 BC, with children and babies often being the most elaborately preserved. The Chinchorro were a prehistoric people who lived in scattered communities and used fishing to help them survive on the desert coast of Chile and Peru. It is thought they began preserving their dead though mummification as part of a religious act designed to bridge the world between the living and the dead. An estimated 282 mummies have now been recovered from the dry, sandy soil in the region, but scientists say there could be hundreds more buried there. Preserved corpses are often found as the shifting sand exposes their bodies. Arica and the surrounding Atacama Desert is one of the driest places in the world and the town receives less than 0.02 inches of rain a year. The skin on the head of this Chinchorro mummy at the San Miguel de Azapa Museum in Arica, Chile has begun to break down due to the damage being caused by bacteria growing as humidity in the area increases . The mummies were found buried in the arid desert valleys around Arica in northern Chile, shown on the map . It is this dry climate that has helped preserve the mummies for more than 7,000 years. However, the region has been growing slowly damper in recent years. Scientists at the University of Tarapacá museum first noticed black slimy patches appearing on the preserved skin of the Chinchorro mummies around ten years ago. As time has gone on they have degraded at 'an alarming rate' as the preserved skin has broken down into a black slime. Researchers at Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have now conducted a series of tests to find out what was causing the degradation. They found that bacteria normally found growing on the human skin appeared to become 'supercharged' when placed on mummy skin in high humidity. They found that mummies need to be kept at between 40 per cent and 60 per cent humidity to prevent degradation occurring. Some of the Chinchorro mummies, like the one above buried in a coffin made from reeds, show highly sophisticated preservation thousands of years before mummification began to be used in ancient Egypt . If humidity falls below this level, acidification could also damage the mummies. Museum staff are now fine tuning the temperature and humidity to help preserve the mummies in their extensive collection. Professor Ralph Mitchell, a biologist at Harvard who led the work, said: 'We knew the mummies were degrading but nobody understood why. 'This kind of degradation has never been studied before. 'With many diseases we encounter, the microbe is in our body to begin with, but when the environment changes it becomes an opportunist.' Professor Mitchell and his colleagues are now keen to find ways to help protect the mummies still preserved out in the desert.","Hundreds of mummies preserved and buried by ancient Chinchorro people have been found in the arid sand of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile .

"An Australian entrepreneur who runs a successful coffee shop is being deported - because she didn't earn enough before launching the venture. Australian-born Jacky Collyer, 27, moved to Britain in 2011 and married barista husband Andy Carter, of Swindon, Wiltshire, two years ago. They had just signed a five-year lease on a premises for their own coffee house when they received a bombshell letter from the Home Office. Australian-born Jacky Collyer (right) and her husband Andy Carter (left) set up a coffee shop in Swindon, Wiltshire - only to be told she must return to Melbourne within two weeks . Officials said she must be deported because the couple did not meet the minimum income threshold for sponsoring a non-EU spouse to stay in the country. At the time they submitted their income, Mr Carter was still studying philosophy at Sussex University so their combined salary fell below the £18,000 minimum. Jacky now has just 14 days to return to Melbourne, shattering their dream of running their own business. A number of her customers, and two local MPs, have now joined a campaign to stop her being deported. Her distraught husband said: 'Our whole world has been torn apart. Our family and friends are here. We have a business. We have a cat. 'If we have to go we might try setting something up somewhere else, probably in Europe, maybe in Germany.' Jacky Collyer moved to Britain in 2011 and married barista husband Andy Carter, of Swindon, Wiltshire, two years ago. They are pictured on their wedding day . Jacky moved to the UK in 2011 and met her husband  while she was working in a coffee shop in Brighton. They married two years later and returned to Mr Carter's home in Swindon, where they set up an artisan coffee business. But just days after the couple signed a five-year lease on Darkroom Espresso in July 2014, Jacky received the letter from the Home Office. They fell victim to a new law which came into affect in 2012 meaning someone in her position must have a household income of least £18,600 to stay in Britain. She said: 'We wanted to come to Swindon and set up a business like those in Brighton, and really contribute to the area. 'They seem to think that because we earn a little bit less than £18,000, we'll start claiming benefits. The pair had just signed a five-year lease for their own coffee house when they received a bombshell letter from the Home Office . 'We were told we couldn't possibly live on that much money, but we're perfectly happy with the money we have, we run our own business and still go out for nice meals. 'The weird thing is, my visa requirements say I can't claim state money anyway, so I couldn't even if I wanted to! 'I spent years supporting Andy while he was studying, and then we started our own business. So, of course we don't earn that much money right now.' They appealed the Home Office decision but last week received another letter telling her this had been rejected, and are now facing a lengthy separation and the folding of their business. The letter said she would be required to leave the country by next Thursday, but she has since started an appeal process. She said she had been 'overwhelmed' by the support she had received, but was determined to make sure more people knew about the strict immigration rules. She said: 'Even if I do have to leave, I want people to know about this law. So many people have no idea, and it's so unfair. 'We would have qualified under the old rules and so many people don't know they've changed.' The couple say they have been told that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to a private and family life - does not apply in their case. Mr Carter said he had been told that this was because his wife's immigration status was already seen as 'precarious'. Among the couple's supporters are North Wiltshire MP, James Gray, and Labour South Swindon parliamentary candidate, Anne Snelgrove. She said: 'This is a young couple who have set up a very successful business in the Railway Village which is an area which really needs more businesses like this. More than 2,000 people have signed an online petition in a bid to block Jacky Collyer's deportation . Jacky moved to the UK in 2011 and was working in a coffee shop in Brighton when she met her husband who was studying philosophy at Sussex University . 'I am shocked and dismayed to hear about how the have been treated. 'I will be talking to some of my friends who are MPs and will be trying to find out what can be done.' Darkroom Espresso's most loyal customers have started a Facebook campaign to help and more than 2,000 people have signed an online petition to keep Jacky in the UK. A Home Office spokesman said: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with immigration rules. In July 2012 the Home Office reformed the rules that apply for family immigrating to the Britain from non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries. It included the introduction of an £18,600 minimum income threshold for sponsoring a non-EEA spouse or partner to come to Britain or remain in the country. The Home Office said that it introduced the guidelines to prevent 'burdens on the taxpayer, promote integration and tackle abuse' and to ensure family migrants can 'stand on their own two feet financially'. It acted after receiving advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee and claiming it was a level at which 'we can be reasonably assured that the UK sponsor has sufficient means to support themselves and their foreign partner'. 'We welcome those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution. But family life must not be established here at the taxpayer's expense. 'That is why we implemented the recommendations of the Independent Migration Advisory Committee and established clear rules for British citizens looking to bring their non-EU spouse to this country, including a minimum income threshold.' The pair are now in discussions with an immigration lawyer and plan to appeal the latest decision, but they have also begun to consider other options.","Australian Jacky Collyer, 27, and husband set up a coffee shop in Swindon .

"Will Ferrell's new comedy Get Hard has been branded both racist and homophobic by critics as it deals with a rich white man who is sent to the terrifying San Quentin prison for 10 years. Ferrell's character approaches the only black man he knows, played by the comedian Kevin Hart, to help him prepare for life behind bars. The movie had its debut at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas and is directed by Etan Cohen. Scroll down for video . Critics have branded Get Hard starring Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart as racist and homophobic . Will Ferrell plays James King, a one-percenter who is facing a 10-year jail term in San Quentin prison . Ferrell approaches Kevin Hart's character for advice on how to get 'hard' in advance of his prison committal . Several of those who watched the movie were disgusted by what they saw. One man addressing a question-and-answer session following the screening reportedly told Mr Cohen, who also wrote the film: 'As a fellow Jew, I've got to say that this film seemed as racist as f***.' The movie is due for release on March 27 on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr Cohen responded that he had shown the film to a number of test audiences around the same time as black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by a police. Mr Cohen defended his movie claiming the racial humor in the work was  'a delicate balance to find... It was hard to modulate... how far to push it.' Ferrell plays James King, who is being jailed for ten years over dodgy financial dealings. Several critics blasted the movie over the stereotypical way it treated the various races behind bars . Others attacked the movie for the way it depicted gay sex and dealt with the issue of prison rape . King offers Hart's character Darnell Lewis cash to open a new car wash business if he can teach him how to be tough before entering the prison. The film pokes fun at so-called one-percenters as well as the stereotypes of black men, latinos and white supremacists who are all behind bars. Justin Chang of Variety blasted the movie claiming it had 'some of the ugliest gay-panic humour to befoul a studio release in recent memory'. In one scene, King tries to accost a gay man in a public toilet and offers to perform a sex act on him to prepare himself for life in prison. Drew McWeeny of Hitfix.com said the film was 'morally repellent' by playing 'into this idea that gay sex is somehow inherently more disgusting than regular sex'. Before the screening, Hart told people who enjoyed the movie to review it on Twitter afterwards, however, those who hated it should 'go in the middle of the street and kill yourself'. Ferrell said he did not use Twitter and asked people to send him 'handwritten notes ... on nice stationery'.","Will Ferrell plays a white financial guru who is jailed for 10 years for fraud .

"Some New York City residents publicly lashed out in frustration at Mayor Bill de Blasio after he arrived late for their St Patrick's Day march. The mayor was scheduled to be at the Rockaways parade when it started at 1 pm Saturday but ended up joining the marchers about a half-hour later and walking just half of the route. He said an education meeting at Gracie Mansion 'took a while' and he'd taken a police boat to arrive as soon as possible in the Queens neighborhood at the edge of New York's five boroughs. With: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio arrived thirty minutes late for a St Patrick's Day parade in eastern Queens and was heckled by participants . Without: Members of the mayor's marching party carried his banner without him after the march began shortly after it was scheduled . Some paradegoers, who started the march after waiting ten minutes past 1, called de Blasio's tardiness disrespectful. While some cheered the mayor's arrival, dozens jeered when he joined the march and shouted complaints about unrepaired homes damaged in Superstorm Sandy and last year's cancellation of the neighborhood's ferry service to city centers Brooklyn and Manhattan. 'Get that man a watch,' a heckler yelled at the mayor, according to the New York Daily News. Tricia McGee told Newsday that DeBlasio should have 'spring ahead an hour and a half' for Sunday morning's daylight savings time clock switch. 'Welcome to New York City. You know, people of our city have strong views on everything, and certainly that's true of the Rockaways as well,' the mayor said. Taunted: De Blasio was only able to walk about half of the parade route after his arrival. 'Welcome to New York City,' he said of the hecklers response to his lateness . The mayor's lateness was a sore spot in November, when he arrived about six minutes after a moment of silence commemorating victims of the 2001 American Airlines Flight 587 crash. It also was in the Rockaways. He said that fog delayed his police boat that day and that he'd had a 'rough night' of sleep. New York's largest St Patrick's Day parade, which goes down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, will not see De Blasio's attendance this year. He has said he is not planning to attend the March 17 event because the march does not allow enough members of the gay community to participate. De Blasio also boycotted the Fifth Avenue parade last year, the first time in 20 years the New York mayor did not attend the event. Parade organizers, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, has previously not allowed groups to march in the St Patrick's Day parade based on the Catholic Church teachings against homosexual acts. This year it has made one exception for broadcaster NBC's LGBT employee contingent. The mayor marched at the front of a snowy St Pat's Day For All parade in Queens last week, where gay groups were represented. Inclusive: The mayor, who was elected in 2013, has not attended the large Manhattan St Patrick's Day parade because of its exclusion of gay groups and instead has marched in a St Pat's Day For All event in Queens .","Rockaway march starts without Bill de Blasio, who arrived 30 minutes late .

"A woman broke one of the cardinal rules of flying when she lit up a cigarette on board a flight - much to the dismay of her fellow passengers. The woman, who appears to speak with an American accent has not been named, but was caught on camera smoking on an American Airlines flight from Nicaragua to Miami. And when fellow flyers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior she blamed someone else for smoking and went on a bizarre rant.

She shouted: 'The United States has declared war on Venezuela. Venezuela has been declared a national security threat.' 'You're a national security threat,' a passenger remarked off camera. 'She's gangster' another passenger said laughing. Flight attendants warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down, according to The Daily Dot. So she yelled louder. She ranted: 'Venezuela previously owned the oil in Venezuela. My great hero Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people with all of the oil...not Exon Mobil would go away!' Bizarrely, she shouted: 'The people own the oil.' Wasn't me: When fellow flyers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior she blamed someone else for smoking and went on a bizarre rant . Calm down: A flight attendant, right, warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down . According to an eyewitness, the woman added that U.S. President Barack Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays.' After another warning by a flight attendant the woman protested: 'I know already the [police are coming to take me off the aircraft.] But before I'm arrested I'm going to say my peace. 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up.

Her illegal deed was caught on camera by a flyer who then posted the video  to YouTube and website Reddit. The redditor, with the user name 'upside down dog,' alleged that he was on the same flight as the woman when he recorded her. He  wrote: 'While the plane was waiting on the tarmac for the police to arrive, she leans over to me and asks for a cigarette. 'She pulls one out of her bag and lights up. This is the point where I pull eject and run to the back of the cabin. The police arrive after 20 minutes and escort her off the plane. 'She only had a single drink on the plane (however, others told me she was pounding them back pretty hard in the terminal and she also was on prescription painkillers). 'The irony is that this sociology professor is focused mainly on women’s hysteria. Due to this, Customs was closed just long enough that me and most others on that flight missed our connection.

"Former NFL star Darren Sharper was sentenced to nine years in federal prison on Monday immediately after he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a woman in Arizona, marking the first change of plea of the day for the former safety accused of drugging and assaulting women in four states. Sharper on Monday admitted to charges of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault arising from the 2013 Arizona case. It is very unusual to sentence defendants immediately after a guilty plea, which normally takes weeks or months. Sharper, 39, appeared in the Phoenix courtroom by video-conferencing from Los Angeles. He has been jailed in LA since February 2014. Scroll down for video . Former NFL star Darren Sharper (left) and his attorney Leonard Levine (right) appear at an LA court on Monday. Sharper pleaded no contest on Monday to charges  of drugging four women and raping two of them, after receiving a nine-year prison sentence for a sexual assault case in Arizona . Sharper, right in an LA court on Monday, admitted to charges of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault arising from the 2013 Arizona case. He was sentenced immediately . He also is expected to change his plea in person in Los Angeles on similar allegations. Similar hearings will follow in Las Vegas this week and in New Orleans in the next month. The Arizona and California cases, combined with others in Nevada and Louisiana, are likely to lead to a long prison sentence. In each state, Sharper was accused of drugging and sexually assaulting women when they were unconscious or otherwise unable to resist or consent. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Warren Granville said Sharper will serve his time in federal custody and that the Louisiana case will be resolved through a federal court. In Arizona, Sharper admitted sexually assaulting one victim, though police say he drugged and sexually assaulted three women, at an apartment in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe in November. Authorities say a search of the Tempe apartment turned up a shot glass with a white residue that turned out to be zolpidem, and California investigators discovered that Sharper had a prescription for the drug. Last year, Sharper's attorneys said their client did not make the drinks that authorities say he used to drug the women. One of the women told police she hadn't had any alcohol that night until Sharper insisted she drink a shot. Another young woman said she had been drugged, then went to bed, locked her door and wasn't attacked. The next day, one of the women confronted Sharper, who denied wrongdoing, according to the reports. The reports said Sharper was in Arizona to visit a woman who lived at the apartment. The two had met about a year earlier in Las Vegas. Sharper won a Super Bowl title with the New Orleans Saints in 2010 and retired later that year. He played for the Saints, Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings during a standout 14-year NFL career. Darren Sharper, of the New Orleans Saints carries the NFC championship trophy around the stadium after the game against the Minnesota Vikings at the Louisiana Superdome on January 24, 2010 .","Sharper on Monday admitted to charges of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault arising from the 2013 Arizona case .

"The plans were agreed by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood (pictured) who was nicknamed Sir Cover-Up for preventing the Chilcot inquiry . Ministers were last night struggling to contain a spiralling row about highly contentious plans to bar 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists. Critics raised concerns about a quiet change to the civil service code, which they warned could ‘stifle whistleblowing’ and open government. The code has been amended to include a new provision making clear that officials could be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister. Downing Street was understood to have intervened in the row, forcing the Cabinet Office to offer a series of concessions. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude agreed to redraft guidance to ‘strengthen protection’ for those speaking out to blow the whistle on scandals or abuses of public money, and include a commitment to being ‘as open as possible’ with Parliament and the public. However, that is unlikely to appease critics, who have asked why such a change has been enforced just before the general election campaign. It appears to have been agreed by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, who has been nicknamed Sir Cover-Up for preventing the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War from seeing letters and records of phone calls between Tony Blair and George Bush. However, the impetus is understood to have come from ministers, who wanted to control the flow of information from departments to make clear that they, not civil servants, are ultimately in charge. A line has been added to the civil service code, which governs officials’ conduct, saying: ‘Ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media.’ Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, said the Cabinet Office was ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’. Margaret Hodge (pictured) said the Cabinet Office was ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’ ‘You don’t want to encourage briefing against ministers, or criticising people behind their backs,’ she said. ‘But the more openness, the more understanding people have of the way government works, the better.’ Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who has championed more openness in the health service, said it could stifle whistleblowing. ‘It makes sense that the Government wants to get its work done without a running commentary from inside the system, but I would like them to set out what they have in place to help people whistleblowing,’ she said. Ministers point that out civil servants can blow the whistle on a major scandal using legal protections afforded to them in the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1988. But Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union that represents civil servants, said it was absurd to enforce a ‘blanket ban’ on all 430,000 civil servants having unauthorised contacts with journalists. Mr Penman: ‘Civil servants will become worried about every contact they have with the media, and will be looking over their shoulder all the time when talking to the public – as that’s who they are talking to through the media – about the service they deliver.’ The Cabinet Office insist that the amendment will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media. They insist it simply ‘clarifies’ current practice. Mr Maude last night: ‘The Cabinet Secretary and I are both clear that no one should be exposed to personal and professional risk for doing what is in the public interest. ‘The amendments make no change to the rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation or our drive to increase Government transparency and openness. 'However, we will consult on strengthening the protections for whistleblowers.’","Critics say change to the civil service code could 'stifle whistleblowing'

"As thousands of young Australians look to buy their first home, it may be Generation Y that suffers the most as skyrocketing property prices preventing them from entering the market. A survey of real estate agents around the country revealed that 60% believe the Australian dream of owning your home is becoming less obtainable, and young Australians could be forced to rent long-term as residential property prices jumped an average of 6.8% in the last 12 months. One Gen Y couple who have been struggling to purchase their first property are Katherine Ross, 29, and her partner Hauaru Gilbert, who have been looking seriously for the past twelve months to buy a house in Sydney. Scroll down for video . Artemis Paniaras, a recruitment consultant and her fiancee William, a sales manager, are both in their mid-20s and recently purchased a house after facing significant challenges . The capital city saw a staggering price increase of 12.2% over the past twelve months, which Ms Ross said has been  the greatest barrier to buying their own home. 'The prices are really pushing us out of the market. The sellers market keeps going higher and even two bedroom apartments are a minimum of $700,000,' Ms Ross told Daily Mail Australia. According to a nationwide survey, conducted by real estate agent ranking and reviews platform OpenAgent, 75% of real estate agents believe that property prices are going to continue to increase over the next twelve months. The strongest growth in property price for 2015 is expected on the East coast with New South Wales only slightly ahead of Queensland, then followed by Victoria. Ms Ross and her partner both work in Sydney's Eastern suburbs, and would ideally like to live close to their jobs but have been unable to find anything in their budget. 'We may have to look further out, which makes it very frustrating when discussing where we want to live,' she said. Ms Paniaras said that she and her partner weren't taken seriously by estate agents when looking at properties . One of the elements of the process they found difficult was not having professional advice available to them . Sydney's Lord Mayor described the property market in Sydney as a 'housing crisis'. 'Many young people can no longer afford to buy into the housing market. There are people suffering housing stress,' Cr Moore said. 'For our future socio and economic prosperity we can no longer afford to shift the chronic housing issue to the too hard basket,' she said at Fixing Sydney's Housing Problems. National: $648,315 .

'The dream of owning your own home is still important for most Australians and we’re seeing that people are willing to forgo on the luxury of location to keep it alive,' said co-founder and co-CEO of OpenAgent, Zoe Pointon. Artemis Paniaras, a recruitment consultant and her fiancee William, a sales manager, are both in their mid-20s and faced different barriers when purchasing their first home. 'Real estate agents wouldn't take us seriously when we turned up to open house inspections,' Ms Paniaras said. 'They wouldn't talk to me or show any interest, even though we had enough for a deposit,' she said. Ms Paniaras and her fiancee were originally looking for a renovated property but soon realised that was out of their price range.

Ms Paniaras and her fiancee were originally looking for a renovated property but soon realised that was out of their price range, and decided to spend $25 renovating themselves . 'We ended up buying a property to renovate ourselves, and even then some of the properties were asking ridiculous sums,' Ms Paniaras said.

Both couples said that one of the elements of the process that they found difficult was not having any professional advice available to them when looking to buy a property. 'We want help from local agents to work out areas that are realistic for our budget,' said Ms Ross. 'That would be such a help and be a huge first step. We just aren't receiving any advice,' she said. Ms Pointon said that it is crucial for young Australians who are looking to buy a property that they look for an agent who is informed about the local area. 'Whether you’re purchasing or selling a property, it’s likely to be the biggest financial transaction you will make over the course of your life,' Ms Pointon said. 'With the predicted increase in prices, people can’t afford to be making blind choices about finding an agent to navigate the market for them. What’s critical here is that both buyers and sellers ensure they are working with an agent who really gets the local market,' she said. 'Whether you’re a first home buyer, an investor or someone who just needs to sell quickly, you need to make sure you are working with an agent who understands your priorities and has experience in that space.'","60% of estate agents believe owning a home is becoming less achievable .

"It was an exit done with a flourish. Having arrived in Plymouth by Royal Train, the Queen took a more direct route home and was picked up from the flight deck of HMS Ocean by a helicopter. Smiling broadly as she climbed into the aircraft, the Queen, who had just completed a tour of the enormous vessel, was waved out of sight by sailors. Her Majesty travelled down to the Devonshire port early this morning and arrived shortly after the eclipse. Scroll down for video . And she's off: The Queen boards her helicopter on the flight deck of HMS Ocean . Visit: Her Majesty had been touring the helicopter carrier of which she is Lady Sponsor . Taking off: The helicopter is used by all royals, most recently the Duchess of Cambridge in the Potteries . Lift off! The helicopter rises up above HMS Ocean which is currently moored in Devonport . Back to London: The Queen's flight banks before starting its journey north to London . Resplendent in a bright purple ensemble, the Queen was without the Duke of Edinburgh who had remained behind in London. Greeted by Sir Eric Dancer, the Lord-Lieutenant of Devon,  the Queen stopped to say hello to the waiting crowds before being driven to HMNB Devonport in her official state Bentley which had been driven down for the occasion. The Queen is the sponsor of HMS Ocean, a titanic helicopter carrier that came into service in 1998 and has seen service in the Gulf and the Mediterranean among others. Ocean, which glories in the nickname of 'The Mighty O' within the Royal Navy, was also deployed to Greenwich in 2012 to help provide security during the Olympics. Docked on a bend of the Thames, the gargantuan ship towered over river traffic and even managed to make the huge O2 arena look comparatively small. Looking around: The Queen is shown around the flight deck by Ocean's captain, Timothy Henry . All smiles: The Queen, who had lunch onboard the ship, appeared to enjoy her day . Rising up: The Queen has a go on the elevator used to lift aircraft to Ocean's deck . Impressive: The gargantuan HMS Ocean is shortly to become the Royal Navy's flagship . Taking an interest: The Queen has now visited HMS Ocean on four separate occasions . Involved: Her Majesty is kept updated about the progress of the ship and its activities . Royal visit: The Queen inspects her honour guard during a re-dedication ceremony for HMS Ocean . The Queen, who was making her fourth visit to the ship, was welcomed to Devonport, the Royal Navy's Plymouth base, where she was welcomed by Vice Admiral Philip Jones to the sound of a 21-gun royal salute. Joined by Devonport's commanding officer, Captain Ian Shipperley and Captain Timothy Henry of HMS Ocean, she then heard the National Anthem ahead of a re-dedication ceremony for the ship. Her Majesty, who was wearing the same cheerful ensemble worn for last year's Christmas Day service at Sandringham, then inspected a guard of honour drawn from the men and women serving on Ocean. She also was also shown around the helicopter carrier before being treated to lunch in Ocean's Wardroom. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'Every Royal Navy warship has a Lady Sponsor and Her Majesty The Queen holds this title with Ocean. 'The relationship continues throughout the life of the ship, each successive Captain keeping Her Majesty informed of the ship's activities and hosting visits. 'The rededication ceremony marks the ship's return to operational service following completion of her refit and subsequent work up. Big arrival: The Royal Train pulls into Plymouth Station after a three-hour journey from London . On duty: The Queen, who was wearing a cheerful purple ensemble, steps off the train at Plymouth . Warm welcome: The Queen was met by Sir Eric Dancer (centre) and the Lord Mayor of Plymouth, Mike Fox . Cheers: The Queen was met at the station by a flag-waving crowd and was presented with several posies . Cheerful: The Queen makes her way out of the station clutching a pretty posy of spring flowers . On her way: The Queen's official state Bentley had been driven down to meet her at the station . 'It provides an appropriate occasion for Her Majesty The Queen to reaffirm publicly her link to HMS Ocean and meet the new crew.' HMS Ocean is one of the most important ships in the Royal Navy and is used to deploy Royal Marines directly into war zones via helicopter or landing craft. As a result, the 380-strong ship's company includes the 9 Assault Squadron Royal Marines who operate the ship's four Mk5 landing craft. The ship, which saw service during the 2003 Iraq War and was also deployed to Libya, has also seen service closer to home, most notably when it was used to ferry aircraft passengers stranded in France by the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption back across the Channel. Although every Royal Navy warship has a Lady Sponsor, Ocean is the only one sponsored by the Queen, whose role includes being kept informed of its progress and making regular visits. Inspecting the troops: The Queen was welcomed to Devonport with a 21-gun royal salute . Main event: After a welcome from Vice Admiral Jones, the Queen presided over the re-dedication ceremony . Enjoying the sunshine: Her Majesty appeared to be enjoying the beautiful spring sunshine in Devon . What eclipse? The Queen arrived shortly after the partial solar eclipse took place . Sponsor: The Queen is Ocean's Lady Sponsor and is kept up-to-date with the ship's activities . Flagship: 2015 will see Ocean take on the duties of the Royal Navy's flagship, taking over from HMS Bullwark .

"Convicted terrorists will soon be banned from speaking and writing letters in Arabic during visits and phone calls at one of Australia's highest-security prisons. Under tough new restrictions, 13 prisoners, who are classified as 'Extreme High Risk Restricted' at SuperMax, the compound located within Goulburn jail in NSW, will only be allowed to speak English. State Attorney General Brad Hazzard has called on the laws to take place in a bid to stop radicalisation of Muslim inmates from converting other prisoners, The Sunday Telegraph reports. The law pledges to have prison officers strictly monitor conversations between inmates and visitors as well as refuse or terminate visits if Arabic or any other languages are used. Convicted terrorists will soon be banned from speaking  Arabic during visits and phone calls at SuperMax . It comes after the Australian Federal Police revealed the terror alert for police had been raised to 'high' in the wake of terror plotting attacks and anti-terrorism raids across the country. Last September, it was revealed that inmates were able to plot acts of terror from behind bars because they were allowed to write letters, make phone calls and have visits. 'One of the issues that came out of that process was that some of these people, these high-risk ­inmates, were conducting their ­discussions in Arabic, or at least not English,' Mr Hazzard said. But in rare cases, Mr Hazzard said inmates will be allowed to speak another language when their 90-year-old grandmother visits for instance but an immediate translator must be supplied. 'We don't want to create a situation where they feel there's no sense of humanity, because there will be,' Mr Hazzard said. 'But they have to understand the people they're visiting have put our community at risk. There has to be some clear boundaries and rules.' Pictured left to right: Mohammad Kiad, Omar Al-Kutoki and Bassam Hamzy who will face the language ban . Omarjan Azari was arrested at his Sydney home in mid-September during the biggest counter-terrorism operation in Australia's history . Among the 13 prisoners facing the ban will include Omarjan Azari, 22 who allegedly planned a plot to kill a random member of the public in the streets of Sydney. Mohammad Kiad, 25, and Omar al-Kutobi, 24, are also behind bars at SuperMaz after they were both charged with terrorism offences. The initiative was prompted when prison officers started noticing a rise of inmates converting to Islam, after switching their diet preferences from Western meals to halal, Sunday Telegraph reports. Meanwhile, four 'young, white males' have lodged an application to have their diets changed at the Long Bay Correctional Complex at Malabar in Sydney on Monday. The law pledges to have prison officers monitor conversations strictly between inmates and visitors . Last September, it was revealed that inmates were able to plot acts of terror from behind bars because they were allowed to write letters, make phone calls and have visits . It's reported that Bassam Hamzy, who was sentenced to life in jail for a 2002 murder and ran the 'Brothers 4 Life' gang, is the first to be banned from speaking Arabic. The strict laws follows as prison authorities have banned Islamic prayer meetings in some of Sydney's jails after intelligence found some key jihadist figures were operating from behind bars. But Mr Hazzard added that he has called on the department to recruit imams to lead prayer sessions with 'moderation and decency' as it reveals prayer sessions will now be held in English.","Inmates will soon be banned from speaking and writing letters in Arabic .

"A man who admitted tricking his girlfriend into having a msicarrage by giving her a smoothie laced with abortion pills says he feels like a 'sh*tbag' for his actions. The 26-year-old from Trondheim in central Norway pleaded guilty to inflicting serious bodily harm and also to terminating a pregnancy without the mother's consent after appearing in court. The man says he gave his former partner, with whom he already had a child, the drugs after he found out she was pregnant after they had a one-night stand at a mutual friend's party. The man told Trondheim court, pictured, that he felt like a sh*tbag after giving his ex-girlfriend the smoothie laced with the drugs . He told the court in Trondheim that after she refused to have an abortion, he gave her pills that were meant to induce a miscarriage after buying them online and telling her they were painkillers. But when they went for the first scan, and the midwife told them that the baby was healthy, he admitted being devastated. The man then bought more of the pills online and made a smoothie out of them for the woman, aged 20, who was immediately hit by stomach pains. She then visited her GP, who confirmed that she had suffered a miscarriage brought about by a high dosage of abortion pills. The man told the court: 'I had a bad conscience and felt remorse, but thought that it was the only way out. 'I read online that pills could cause deformities if they did not work. The man had bought the pills online and first gave them to the woman, telling her that they were painkiller (file picture) 'After the first attempt didn't work, I thought that if it was my fault that the child was born with major malformations, I would not be able to live with that. So I decided to try again. 'I felt like a total sh*tbag when it dawned on me what I had done.' State prosecutor Kaja Strandford is calling for the man to be sentenced to the maximum of seven years in jail. She told the Adresseavisen newspaper: 'He imported these substances. All of it was precisely and cynically planned. The defendant will return to court for sentencing next week.","The 26-year-old man admitted tricking his ex-partner into miscarrying .

"When Debbie McCarthy's chihuahua puppy was run over and killed by a park keeper, she expected a heartfelt apology at the very least. Instead, the man offered her a black bin bag to throw six-month-old Peanut's body away. The distraught dog lover said the council worker, who had been driving a buggy, showed no remorse. Choking back tears, Miss McCarthy said: 'The man just stood there saying, 'He is dead, he is dead'. Tragic: Peanut the adorable six-month-old chihuahua was killed after being run over by a council buggy driver in a park in Essex . 'He was just standing there with no emotion and then he turned to me and said, 'Do you want me to put him in this bag?' 'I couldn't believe what was happening. I was hysterical.' Her partner Fred Ralph, 33, added: 'You don't stuff a pet dog in a bin bag and chuck it on a skip. 'The drivers are supposed to drive the buggies at walking pace but our dog landed three metres away on the grass.' Nursery worker Miss McCarthy, 47, was at Raphael Park in Romford, Essex, with Peanut, her other dog Missy – an 11-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier – and a friend's pet, on March 12. The puppy was playing with a bulldog near a cafe and a children's playground as the owner chatted to another dog walker. Miss McCarthy heard shouts from the driver, who had been travelling down a path in the buggy with council livery, and raced over. 'I was screaming – poor Peanut was just lying there,' said the mother of two from Hornchurch. 'His eyes were open … but blood was coming out of his ear and mouth. Peanut didn't stand a chance. The man didn't even apologise.' The dog has now been cremated and his ashes placed in an urn. Devastated: Debbie McCarthy, pictured with her other dog Missy at the spot where her puppy was run over, said she screamed in horror after seeing Peanut stricken on the ground . Taxi driver Mr Ralph added: 'We've been asking for answers from the council about what happened but we've just met a brick wall. They don't seem to care. They have not apologised. 'It is disgraceful. One of their workers told me there is a sign which says, 'keep dogs on leads' which simply is not true. 'There are signs which say 'keep dogs under control', but Peanut was under control … He was just playing when he was struck.' The electric buggy has a top speed of 15mph but is supposed to be driven at 'walking speed' in parks. The couple say staff are still charging around the park at speed. Since Peanut's untimely death, Ms McCarthy has spoken with other dog walkers at the park who claim to have regularly seen the buggies being driven at speed. And only days ago, she 'screamed' at a different park keeper in a buggy to slow down, saying 'have you not learnt your lesson?'. The worker then waved to apologise before slowing his buggy down. Ms McCarthy has also seen the park keeper who struck Peanut but he would not make eye contact with her or talk to her about what happened. Mr Ralph has since bought his partner another chihuahua puppy which they have called Teddy. He said: 'It won't bring Peanut back but I just needed to help Ms McCarthy fill the void that was left when Peanut died.' Sources last night suggested the Havering Council worker was not facing disciplinary action. Councillor Melvin Wallace said an investigation was underway, but asked owners to ensure 'all dogs are kept under control so incidents like this can never happen again'.","Debbie McCarthy, 47, of Essex, screamed in horror after buggy hit Peanut .

"An Army volunteer who contracted Ebola has been successfully treated with an experimental drug, but credits the humble strawberry with saving her life. Corporal Anna Cross was the first person in the world to be treated with MIL 77, after choosing to do so following 'careful consideration'. But when asked what helped her pull through, she said: 'Strawberries. I reckon I've had ten punnets.' Cpl Cross joined the Army Reserves in 2013 as a staff nurse and volunteered to help care for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, arriving there last month. But she was evacuated back to the UK in an RAF plane on March 12 after becoming the third Briton to test positive for the virus. Scroll down for video . Corporal Anna Cross has been successfully treated with an experimental Ebola drug, it emerged today . Today, she told a press conference at London's Royal Free Hospital that she had been treated by an 'absolutely incredible bunch of clinicians'. Cpl Cross, from Cambridge, praised both the Army and the NHS, which she works for as an intensive care nurse. 'If it wasn't for both of those institutions I wouldn't be here today,' she said. 'It's thanks to them I'm alive.' The 25-year-old said she cried when she found out she was free of the virus and attributed eating strawberries to help her through it. She said it will still take a 'long time' before she is fully fit and would 'love' to continue volunteering with the military - although she suspected she would not be able to return to Sierra Leone. MIL 77 is a close relative of the medicine ZMapp – the drug given to British nurse William Pooley when he too was treated for Ebola at the Royal Free. ZMapp is a blend of three laboratory-made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Michael Jacobs said he was 'absolutely thrilled' to announce that Cpl Cross was Ebola-free. Cpl Cross, from Cambridge, praised both the Army and the NHS, which she works for as an intensive care nurse. She was the first person in the world to be treated with MIL 77, after choosing to do so following 'careful consideration' The 25-year-old joined the Army Reserves in 2013 as a staff nurse and volunteered to help care for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. But shortly after arriving, she became the third Briton to contact Ebola . He said it was impossible to say on the basis of treating one patient whether MIL 77 would work as well with others. 'But what I can tell you is that the treatment went very well,' he told reporters. 'It caused no side effects that we were able to illicit and we were very happy with its use.' It was produced by a company in China which 'very kindly' provided the drug and there was a 'limited supply' left that they could treat future potential patients with. Cpl Cross said today she had no idea how she contracted the virus. An investigation was carried out at the treatment centre where she worked but no conclusions were drawn. She told the press conference that one day she was treating patients there, and the next she was being cared for there herself. At a press conference at the Royal Free Hospital in London today, infectious diseases specialist Dr Michael Jacobs (right) said he was 'absolutely thrilled' to announce that Cpl Cross was Ebola-free . He explained MIL 77 is a close relative of the medicine ZMapp – the drug given to British nurse William Pooley when he too was treated for Ebola at the Royal Free . 'I had treated a patient that was in the facility, and then the next day I was sat with them,' she said. 'It was weird.' 'It was nice in a sense because I felt like we were having the same experience and we were both being treated to the same standard. 'It was odd because I had seen patients who got really sick and had died but he was doing really well, which was encouraging for me.' Cpl Cross went on to praise the professionalism of her colleagues who cared for her. There have been a total of 24, 907 cases of the Ebola reported since this outbreak began. Of this, 10, 326 people have died from the virus - including one death in the US and six in Mali - according to the latest World Health Organisation figures. In West Africa, to date there have been 4,301 deaths in Liberia, 3,747 in Sierra Leone, 2,263 in Guinea and 8 in Nigeria. The WHO has declared the outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal officially over, as there have been no new cases reported since 5 September. However a total of 79 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported last week, 45 from Guinea, 33 from Sierra Leone and one case from Liberia. So far six British workers have been flown home to the UK after suspected contact with the deadly Ebola virus. Anna Cross was the third British citizen to test positive for Ebola, following two others, nurses Will Pooley and Pauline Cafferkey, who made full recoveries after being treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. 'They were totally dedicated to getting me home, to getting my health optimised, to get me on the flight, which they did within less than 24 hours of me being diagnosed. 'A fantastic RAF team brought me home.' And she described the team at the Royal Free as the 'best in the world' at treating the disease. She said that after being diagnosed it 'was hard for a few hours and then something in my mind just kicked in as it does in difficult situations and it said 'I have a job to do', which is to get myself back well, and I started to really focus on the people around me.' She said this reassured her and she was confident she would get the best possible treatment. She added that she couldn't even remember feeling, 'just tired'. During her illness she lost 10kg (1.5 stone), but credited her high levels of fitness for her speedy recovery. She now plans to do 'normal things' such as eating food and watching TV - and joked she was grateful for the long career of David Attenborough, whose documentaries she has been watching while in hospital. She added that her family were 'thrilled' at her recovery. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said today: 'People that volunteer in Sierra Leone show remarkable courage and it is fantastic to hear Corporal Cross has made a full recovery from Ebola. 'I am incredibly proud of the staff at the Royal Free Hospital for their tireless work in helping Corporal Cross return home.' Minister for the Armed Forces Mark Francois said: 'I am delighted that Corporal Cross has made a full recovery and has now been discharged from the Royal Free Hospital. 'I sincerely thank the military medics from 22 Field Hospital who initially treated her in country, the RAF team who got her back to the UK so swiftly and of course, the staff at the Royal Free who treated her so skilfully back to health. 'Corporal Cross was providing vital support to help combat the spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone, and her 300 other colleagues in country who continue that great effort - we are proud of them all.' Sierra Leone is being completely shut down for three days in a bid to stop a surge in cases of Ebola. The country's president Ernest Koroma has ordered everybody to stay at home between now and Sunday in an effort to halt the spread of the killer disease. Sierra Leone had a previous nationwide curfew in September at the height of the epidemic. According to the World Health Organisation, there were 33 confirmed new cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone in the week of March 22. The WHO said that that one-third of these cases were in the capital Freetown. Confirmed Ebola cases in Sierra Leone, pictured, seemed to be clustered near the country's west coast . As healthcare workers on the ground battle against the spread of the disease, two experimental vaccines against Ebola are now undergoing clinical trials in Liberia. A total of 600 people are being inoculated against the disease. The country's six million population have been told that the curfew could eliminate the disease from the country. The Christian Examiner reported President Koroma's remarks, urging his people to work together. He said: 'The future of our country and the aspirations of our children are at stake, . 'I call on every Sierra Leonean in every community to pull together. The economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of Ebola in Sierra Leone.'","Corporal Anna Cross, 25, is an Army reservist and nurse from Cambridge .

"An Iraqi man who fled to America to escape the horrors of the Islamic State was shot dead as he took pictures of the first snowfall he had ever seen. Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, and his new wife moved from Iraq to Dallas, Texas, 20 days ago to be near relatives and start married life in a 'safer place'. But on Wednesday night, at 11.30pm, a group of men armed with rifles appeared outside the couple's apartment and opened fire, striking Al-Jumaili in the chest, police said. Authorities are investigating the possibility Al-Jumaili was the victim of a hate crime. Scroll down for video . Al-Jumaili: Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, was fatally shot outside of his Texas apartment while taking pictures of his first snowfall . Wife: Al-Jumaili, his wife, Zahara (photographed), and Al-Jumaili's brother went outside of his Dallas apartment to take pictures of the snow around 11.30pm when tragedy struck . In a detailed account of the incident posted on Facebook by Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in the Dallas and Fort Worth area, described the attack. Salem writes that Ahmed took cover behind a pickup truck when a group of five or six young African Americans opened fire. A bullet pierced through the truck and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest, Salem said. 'There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots,' Salem wrote. 'Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.' Residents reported seeing two to four men entering the Walnut Blend Apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate prior to the shooting, CNN reports.

Zahara relocated to Texas to be with family and Al-Jumaili stayed behind in Baghdad to save enough money to follow his wife. After a year of separation, the two reunited three weeks ago, ready to begin a new chapter in their lives, away from the horrors of ISIS and other terrorist groups, only to experience tragedy in America. Salem wrote on Facebook that only Al-Jumaili's stepfather, who lives in Dallas, is working and Al-Jumaili's death has left Zahara with not only an emotional burden, but a financial one as well. The fundraiser has raised more than $9,000 toward Al-Jumaili's memorial and family fund. Truck: Ahmed took cover behind a pickup truck when shots rang out, but a bullet pierced straight through the truck (photographed) and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest . Police say they have very little to go on in the investigation and are enlisting the help of the public to solve the crime. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to an arrest or indictment. The attack has some Muslim activists shaken up, the Los Angeles Times reports, with some pointing to the recent murder of three Muslim students in North Carolina. The neighborhood where Al-Jumaili was killed has a large immigration population, according to the Times, and northern Dallas is home to a large number of Iraqi refugees.","Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, was shot dead outside his Texas apartment while taking pictures of his first snowfall on Wednesday night .

"While there are many threats to the endangered Australian mammals, startling photographs have emerged of a feral cat killing and eating a four-kilogram marsupial. The photographic evidence, which was published on the Australian Mammalogy, captured a rare moment of the predator preying on an adult female Tasmanian pademelon. Pademelons or rufous wallaby species, which are small marsupials with a relatively short tale and legs, are found in thick scrubland across Tasmania. But the furry creatures are at an alarmingly high rate of extinction in Australia as it continues to be wiped out because of its’ perfectly ‘meal-size’ portion for their predators. A camera survey has captured a rare moment between a feral cat (right) preying on a pademelon (left) One of Australia’s leading researchers, scientist Bronwyn Fancourt found compelling evidence of predation risk after conducting a camera survey in the Woodvine Nature Reserve in south-east of Tasmania. The camera captured a pademelon scouring through grassland but four minutes later, a feral cat leapt into the frame as it pounced on its victim about 7.50pm on October 23. Biting the pademelon around its neck, the cat then dragged the carcass out of the frame as it devoured most of the abdominal organs. The Pademelon was seen scouring through grassland before the cat pounced on top and attacked it to death . The cat is seen biting into the pademelon's neck and throat, killing the marsupial instantly . The cat eventually dragged the carcass back into view almost eight hours later. The pademelon’s head and body were left intact, along with her feet, arms, pouch and tail. The predator pulls the carcass out of the screen again but returns into the frame a minute later to clean its paw and face after consuming its meal before running away. Fancourt, from the University of Tasmania said her observation provides direct evidence that feral cats are competent of killing their prey at up to four kilograms in body mass. The abdominal cavity rips open and the cat continues devouring through the abdominal organs . The sex of the species also demonstrates that medium-sized pedemelons such as adult females and juveniles are at high risk of being eaten than the larger adult male marsupials. The research found not only do feral cats hunt and kill their prey but they tend to scavenge on carcasses after it had been killed by another predator such as foxes or dingoes. Despite the photo evidence, Fancourt said a single observation does not prove feral cats are entirely responsible for the extinct species, adding foxes may have been the ‘primary causes of population decline’.","Photo evidence could indicate feral cats are behind alarming extinctions .

"A man who allegedly made bombs for a terrorist group responsible for a string of attacks in New York more than 40-years ago has been revealed to be living in leafy suburbia as a high school teacher. Ronald Fliegelman is said to have built explosives for the far-left group Weather Underground who ran a terrifying campaign across the country during the 1970s. But according to a new book seen byThe New York Post, after avoiding prison on a technicality he managed to build a successful, 25-year career in the classroom after the group disbanded - and still hasn't served a day in prison. Ronald Fliegelman built explosives for the far-left group Weather Underground who ran a terrifying campaign across the country during the 1970s . Firefighters work at extinguishing the fire at a residence in Greenwich Village on March 6, 1970. Three members of the Weather Underground were killed when a bomb went off prematurely . Bryan Burrough's book, Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence, states Fliegelman is now living a quiet life in Park Slope in Brooklyn after retiring. But the author, who also penned the books Public Enemies about America's crime wave in the 1930s and 40s, say's the culprit is not sorry for what he has done. Burroughs told The Post: 'Ron is proud of what he did.' The Weathermen, as they were popularly known, was set up in 1969 and run by the co-founder Bill Ayers. He went on to become a University of Chicago professor and his friendship with Barack Obama was questioned during the 2008 race for the White House. The Weathermen, as they were popularly known, was set up in 1969 and run by the co-founder Bill Ayers (pictured in 2013) The group was  mostly of white and middle class and advocated the overthrow of the US government. Their name was based on the Bob Dylan lyric: 'You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.' In 1970 they waged they issued a 'Declaration of a State of War' against the United States. The same year a bomb exploded inside a Greenwich Village, New York, residence prematurely, killing three members. They also staged attacks on the Capitol Building in Washington D.C after the invasion of Laos in 1971, and targeted the New York Department of Corrections building in Albany after 29 inmates died during the Attica prison riot the same year. According to The Post one of the Weathermen told Burroughs: 'We believed Third World countries would rise up and cause crises that would bring down the industrialized West, and we believed it was going to happen tomorrow, or maybe the day after tomorrow.' Former group member Howie Machtinger added: 'The myth, and this is always Bill Ayers’ line, is that Weather never set out to kill people, and it’s not true — we did. 'You know, policemen were fair game.' The New York Post approached Fliegelman in leafy Park Slope and asked him about his past. 'What happened 40 years ago is different from what’s going on today. War was a big thing. It was on TV every night. You don’t know that with the Iraqi war, the Afghanistan war. There was the draft, as well,' said Fliegelman. When it was put to the 70-year-old that he was a not a freedom fighter but a terrorist, he reportedly disagreed. 'Did you ever notice how many people were hurt by our bombs? People were not hurt by our bombs,' said Fliegelman.

"The Ministry of Defence was last year forced to pay out more than £1million a month in compensation claims for bureaucrats injured at work, new figures reveal. In the last year alone the MoD paid out £13.5million in compensation to civilian staff – which amounts to almost a third of the £45million given to serving soldiers. It means that for every £3,000 paid  to injured soldiers the government handed £1,000 to MoD bureaucrats for office falls, according to the figures released under freedom of information rules. While soldiers in Afghanistan have risked their lives fighting the Taliban, MoD staff stationed in the UK are constantly being carted off to hospital for trips, falls, crashes and bizarre health and safety incidents. Soldiers, pictured attending the annual Irish Guards St Patrick's Day Parade in Aldershot this week, have received £45million in compensation last year - but another £13.5million was paid to bureaucrats . The details of the catalogue of mishaps to befall military personnel in the UK were revealed by safety officers who have had to record all serious incidents for the Health and Safety Executive. Although there were parachuting, roping and other training course injuries sustained by military personnel last year there were also a host of more mundane office based accidents. In one, a man rushed back into his office to answer the phone on his desk only to trip over a hidden vacuum cleaner. The person smashed into a rubbish bin and their office chair and needed a week off work to recover from the injuries. Another person was walking out of a meeting when they were distracted by a colleague and ended up walking into a wall and breaking their wrist. One person hurt their back when the legs on the right side of their chair snapped off sending the person toppling onto the floor. In a similar incident a roller came off one of the legs of a moveable office chair sending the person who was sitting in it crashing to the floor. A member of the public who was visiting a recreation of a World War I trench ended up in hospital with a gash to their head when they stood on a crate to get a view over the top and toppled back over. In a separate case a group of cadets were injured when the camping gas canister they were using to cook a meal exploded, leaving one girl with bad burns. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was last year forced to pay out more than £1million a month in compensation claims for bureaucrats injured at work, new figures reveal . Another MOD worker was off work for more than a month after they injured their bladder in a slip on the newly cleaned floor of the office toilets, while a dog handler suffered bad cuts after trying to separate a fight between two military dogs. All the incidents were recorded on RIDDOR forms which the Health and Safety Executive make organisations fill out when there has been a serious injury in the workplace or a dangerous incident that could have led to an accident. An MOD spokesperson said: 'MOD has a duty of care to all its employees whether military or civilian personnel. 'Claims brought for civil damages are considered on the basis of complex legal liability and where liability is proved compensation is paid but we robustly resist spurious claims. 'The amount of compensation is determined by common law principles and payments are often made to those who have suffered the most severe injuries in the course of their work.'","In the last year the MoD paid out £13.5m in compensation to civilian staff .

"A 17-year-old girl who was forced to undergo chemotherapy testified Monday at a closed door hearing where she and her mother are seeking her release from state custody. Cassandra Fortin testified by teleconference in Juvenile Court, according to attorneys. The teen learned recently that her cancer is in remission and she is no longer fighting the treatment. But she and her mother are asking to end her custody by the Department of Children and Families (DCF) so she can go home now instead of waiting until the chemotherapy is complete next month. Cassandra Fortin was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to undergo cancer treatment . Ms Fortin, left, said the hospital tried to prevent her mother, Jackie, right, from visiting her room . Mrs Fortin, pictured, said she was behind her daguter's decision to not undergo cancer treatment. Michael Taylor, an attorney for the teen's mother, Jackie Fortin, said if the judge will not lift the temporary custody order, they would like for the teen at least to be able to visit with her mother at the hospital. Ms Fortinh said DCF has prohibited her from having contact with her mother. 'We'd like to end the whole thing,' Taylor said, according to The Hartford Courant, during a break in the hearing, 'but if we can't, we want to do as much as we can for her. She wants to be with her mother.' Ms Fortin remains confined at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. She will be free to make her own medical decisions when she turns 18 in September. After Ms Fortin was diagnosed with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma in September, she and her mother missed several appointments, prompting doctors to notify the DCF, court documents say. Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells . Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever). It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. A trial court in November granted DCF temporary custody of Ms Fortin. Lawyers for Cassandra and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but failed. The case went to the state Supreme Court, which ruled in January that the state wasn't violating Ms Fortin's rights by forcing her to undergo chemotherapy. The case centered on the mature minor doctrine recognised by several other states — whether 16- and 17-year-olds are mature enough to make their own medical decisions. Ms Fortin told People.com that she did not want to undergo chemotherapy and that when she was taken into care the state tried to prevent her mother from paying a visit. She said the hospital even posted a guard outside her door because they feared that she would try to escape. On the day before her chemotherapy, hospital staff were forced to restrain her before they could administer an anaesthetic. She said: 'When a nurse came in and I told myself just to fight. When she started to put an IV in me, I wouldn’t let her.' Ms Fortin spent two hours arguing with a doctor trying to convince them to suspend her treatment. 'Security had to pick me up, pin me to the bed and strap me down by my wrists and ankles, When I woke up, I looked down and there was a port in my chest. I thought, 'I cannot believe they did this to me.' 'I felt violated. I felt like I was being treated like an animal. I thought, ""How can you force a person, regardless of how old they are, to do something they haven’t given consent to?'""' In a statement to ABC News, Connecticut's DCF said:  'When experts -- such as the several physicians involved in this case -- tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent, then the Department has a responsibility to take action. Even if the decision might result in criticism, we have an obligation to protect the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts that action is required. 'Much of the improvements in Connecticut's child welfare system have come from working with families voluntarily to realise solutions to family challenges. 'Unfortunately that can't happen in every situation, especially when the life of a child is at stake.'

"It is the battle for your face. Facebook and Google have been involved in an algorithm war to come up with the perfect facial detection system. Now Google has claimed the latest victory, saying its new FaceNet system is practically perfect - getting the right person 99.96% of the time. Google's new FaceNet system is practically perfect - getting the right person 99.96% of the time - here, it shows the variety of lighting condition it can overcome . Google researchers call their system the most-accurate technology available for recognizing human faces. In the paper, titled 'FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering', Google claims the system achieved nearly 100-percent accuracy rate on the facial recognition dataset Labeled Faces in the Wild. The dataset uses more than 13,000 face images from the Internet to measure how accurate the algorithms are at verifying whether two images are of the same individual . 'Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches,' the researchers say. 'To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. 'The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128-bytes per face. 'On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63%. 'On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result by 30% on both datasets. FaceNet was trained on an enormous 260-million-image dataset and performed at an 86 percent and higher accuracy rate. Last year, a team of Chinese researchers claimed to have achieved better than 99 percent accuracy. In the June 2014 paper, Facebook researchers said that humans analyzing images in the Labeled Faces dataset are only able to achieve 97.5 percent accuracy. However, Google researchers went beyond simply verifying whether two faces are identical by also attaching a name to a face. Google's system first clusters photos into a collection of similar faces . Taking a classic facial recognition approach, the researchers went as far as organizing the images into groups of faces that look the most similar or the most distinct. When Google's FaceNet and Facebook's 'DeepFace' are eventually integrated into their company's web platforms, it is believed they will automate the process of tagging photos and searching for people and will also make it easier for web companies to analyze their users' social networks and to assess global trends. FaceNet was trained on an enormous 260-million-image dataset and performed at an 86 percent and higher accuracy rate. These were the only images it did NOT get right. Facebook's technology - called DeepFace - was first showcased last March, but the site has now started rolling out the automatic tagging tool to select users. DeepFace uses technology designed by an Israeli startup called face.com. Facebook bought the startup in 2013 and developed the facial recognition tool with support from face.com's Yaniv Taigman at its Artificial Intelligence lab. The researchers used the software to build a 3D model of a face from a photo that can be rotated into the best position for an algorithm to begin searching for a match. After creating a model, the team used a neural network that had been trained on a database of faces to try and match the face with one in a test database of more than 4 million images, containing more than 4,000 separate identities, each one labelled by humans. Its creators said DeepFace finds a match with 97.25 per cent accuracy. Facebook's DeepFace technology uses a 3D model to virtually rotate faces so that are facing the camera.

The tagging option has now started appearing in the privacy settings of accounts globally - although in many cases it says the feature is 'unavailable' -  but a number of users have reportedly been given the tool. Taylor Hatmaker at The Daily Dot, for example, said that she recently tested the feature using an album of 15 photos. None of the images had been shared previously, and Facebook identified and automatically tagged faces in eight of the photos. Only one tag was incorrect, and the images it didn't offer suggestions for were 'taken in dark rooms' or were blurry. A test using real people recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site achieved 97.5 per cent accuracy. Security researcher Lee Munson said: 'The social network plans to use the system to identify its users in new photos as they are uploaded.

Tagging photos in this way is restricted in the EU following a report by Ireland's Data Protection Authority (DPA) that advised removing it in 2012. This means it is not available in Europe. Elsewhere, people who do have the feature but want to disable it can go to their Facebook Settings menu and open the Privacy menu. Under 'How can I manage tags people add and tagging suggestions there will be an option labelled Who sees tag suggestions when photos that look like you are uploaded?', change the option to 'No One.'

"PC Adam Rushton is accused of having sex with vulnerable women while he was on duty and asking one of them to send him 'some filth' by text . A police officer who had sex with women while he was on duty asked one of them to 'send some filth' in a text message, a court heard. Staffordshire Police officer Adam Rushton is accused of having sex with four women while he was on duty, including one dalliance at a police station where a woman is said to have put handcuffs on him. One of the women who Rushton is accused of seducing said they had sex around five times and he also asked her to send dirty pictures in a text messages. He first met the woman, then 21, after she reported a burglary in July 2006, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman said she kept in touch with Rushton after the incident - informing him of her new address every time she moved as well as her contact details. She said she kept in touch with him in case she needed anything or to be protected. In November 2011, Rushton sent the woman a text, which read: 'Still waiting, send some filth'. She told the jury: 'By 2011, I had known Adam for quite a while. Contact could go on for a month and then he would not hear from me for a while. 'He may have asked for pictures from me, some intimate pictures maybe but I replied telling him ""no, I am not sending naughty pics to your work phone.""' The woman described Rushton as a 'nice police officer' and said on one occasion they had sex after he turned up in his police uniform. She added: 'Adam was the only person to give a damn. If I had said ""Adam, no I am not going to send anything,"" he would have stopped. There was no pressure. 'I think at the time I used Adam but only when I needed somebody. 'There might have been other texts but I cannot remember. 'We never met anywhere sordid. We had sex four or five times. He was wearing his uniform on one occasion when he came round so I presume he must have driven in his police car.' Rushton denies ten counts of misconduct in public office and two counts of obtaining personal data without permission. The officer was suspended after the allegations came to light in 2013. Prosecutors have accused him of using his position to engineer relationships with seven  women during a six year spell from 2006. Rushton was suspended from Staffordshire Police (headquarters pictured) when the allegations came to light . Rushton has been accused of sending  a woman explicit selfies of himself while wearing his uniform, as well as picking another woman up in a patrol car before taking her back to Longton Police station in Stoke-on-Trent where they had sex in an office. Prosecutor Duncan Bould said: 'He picked her up in a marked car, in uniform, and she had to wait in the car while he checked the coast was clear.' Mr Bould said the only purpose for taking the woman into the station was 'sexual activity,' But he said as she put his handcuffs on him and things started to go further they were disturbed and had to leave. On another occasion, the court heard Rushton persuaded a woman to show him her private parts after he turned up at her home. Rushton is accused of committing a 'serious breach of trust' by having sex with the women while on duty as a police officer. The trial continues.

"Tragic mom: Lindsey Combs, 32, was crushed to death inside her car when a truck laden with gravel flipped over in her Martinez, California, driveway . A pregnant hairstylist from California was killed Monday afternoon when a big rig carrying gravel flipped over onto her car, crushing her to death in front of her young daughter. Lindsey Combs, 32, from Martinez, was moving her car at the request of a construction crew working near the corner of Shell Avenue and Pine Street when the gravel on the truck shifted, causing its dump trailer to flip over. Combs was two months pregnant with her second child and engaged to be married. According to family members, the woman's 4-year-old daughter ran out of the house and saw her mother's car crushed by gravel. Combs' fiance, Anderson Pamilton, was also in the house at the time. The devastating incident took place at 1pm outside 820 Shell Avenue when a truck operated by city-contracted JJR construction was bringing a load of gravel to rebuild sidewalks along Shell Avenue. According to police, one of the workers approached Lindsey Combs in her driveway and asked her to repark her car to make room for a purple truck owned by Gregory Trucking. The woman complied and was in the process of moving her car when the massive vehicle laden with 20 tons of gravel tipped over and smashed her car. Scroll down for video . Freak accident: Combs was moving her car near the corner of Shell Avenue and Pine Street when the gravel on the truck shifted, causing its dump trailer to flip over . City project: The truck operated by JJR construction was bringing a load of gravel to rebuild sidewalks along Shell Avenue . Eyewitness Travis Hagerty told ABC 7 News he and two construction workers rushed to Combs' aid and attempted to dig her out by hand, but it was too late. ‘A guy with a backhoe came around and ripped the door off the car with the backhoe after he picked the trailer up. That's when I looked in the car and saw she was smashed and dead,’ Hagerty said. Cal/OSHA has launched an investigation into the cause of the fatal accident. According to the state agency, the San Mateo-based construction company was cited for a minor violation in 2010, its only citation in five years. Anderson Pamilton, Lindsey Combs' fiance, said her death 'was totally avoidable.' He added the expectant mother was scheduled to have her very first ultrasound scan for this week, reportedSF Gate. Friends, family and neighbors described her as a happy, bubbly woman who was excited about becoming a mother for a second time.

Record: The San Mateo-based construction company was cited for a minor violation in 2010, its only citation in five years . Back to work: the crew returned to Shell Avenue and resume work on the sidewalks less than 24 hours after Combs' death . Combs worked as a stylist at Sport Clips Hair Salon, where her colleagues were reeling Tuesday from the news of her unexpected passing. ‘It's like a family member being tragically taken away from us,’ owner Ben Mangels told the paper. On Tuesday, residents along Shell Avenue were outraged to see construction resume less than 24 hours after Combs' death. Workers were back at the site just hours after all of the spilled gravel had been removed. Full of life: Friends and family said Combs, a hairstylist, (pictured left and right) was excited about her pregnancy. She is survived by her 4-year-old daughter (pictured) ‘We are, as a block, as a community, as a city, mourning this young mother. It's like there's no respect for the fact that she died,’ Amy Dubinsky told San Jose Mercury News. Combs’ brother, Robert, has launched a GoFundMe campaign hoping to raise $5,000 that will be used to bring the woman’s father and uncle from Montana for her funeral.","Lindsey Combs, 32, was crushed to death in her Martinez, California, driveway .

"The Liberal Democrats are to unveil a rival Budget tomorrow in an unprecedented statement to Parliament which will signal the end of the Coalition. Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will hold up a yellow budget box - mimicking the red leather case used by the Chancellor - before setting out what his party's tax and spending priorities after the election. He will promise to make tax dodging as unacceptable as drink-driving, increase the personal tax allowance to £12,500 and targeting the wealthy instead of cutting spending. Danny Alexander will hold his yellow Budget box aloft tomorrow before delivering an unprecedented statement to the Commons . It is understood the unique statement from the Despatch Box had to be agreed with Commons Speaker John Bercow, and is likely to infuriate Labour for using government time to make a highly political speech. Nick Clegg has described the Budget as the 'last act of significant decision-making by this coalition Government'. Chancellor George Osborne is using his Budget statement today to set out the official coalition government position for the last time before the election. But he has made clear that in a Conservative government he would eradicate the deficit through spending cuts alone, without tax rises. This would include £12billion of cuts from the welfare budget, including a ban on under-25s claiming housing benefit, restricting child benefit to three children and cutting the amount families can claim in handouts from £26,000 to £23,000. But all the changes to benefits have been blocked by the Lib Dems, and are instead expected to be included in the Tory election manifesto when it is unveiled next month. On Saturday Mr Alexander unveiled his bizarre yellow leather briefcase which he held aloft in an echo of the Chancellor on the steps of Number 11. It was later auctioned off to a Lib Dem activist for £1,500. It is expected to make another appearance tomorrow, before Mr Alexander gives his statement to the Commons. The yellow box is designed to echo the red leather case used by George Osborne before travelling to the Commons to deliver his Budget today . Mr Alexander will rule out any extra increases to VAT, income tax or national insurance, but demand tax rises on the wealthy. He will use official Treasury figures to back up his call for the deficit to be eradicated through 70 per cent spending cuts and 30 per cent tax rises. A senior Lib Dem source said: We are going to set out what our spending plans will be for the next Parliament. 'There are big chunks that the Chancellor will say today which will be very much what the Tories' plans will be.' In a speech at the Lib Dem conference, Mr Alexander set out some of the measures which would be in a Lib Dem budget. He promised a crackdown on tax dodgers, saying it should become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving. In the wake of the HSBC scandal he said: 'As recent weeks have shown yet again, nothing upsets law-abiding taxpayers more than people who think they can evade paying the tax they owe. 'Paying the tax you owe isn't an optional extra - it's a legal requirement. Quite rightly, benefit fiddling is a crime and a social taboo. For too long, tax evasion has been seen by the rich and privileged more like a sport than the crime it is. 'So in our future vision, there'll be even more measures to crack down hard on the tax dodgers.' He continued: 'I want to see those who aid, abet, facilitate or encourage tax evasion hit as hard with criminal and financial penalties as the tax evaders themselves. That will be in our manifesto too.' Mr Alexander joined Mr Osborne and other Tory Treasury ministers outside Number 11 this morning . A Lib Dem budget would include the party's flagship policy of raising the income tax personal allowance to £12,500 and would involve 'balancing the books fairly, not on the backs of the working people on low pay'. He accused the Tories of wanting to 'cut for cut's sake even after the books are balanced'. 'A Conservative Party with no heart, but two minds. One to stay in Europe, the other to leave,' he said. 'A Conservative Party that wants to balance the books solely on the backs of the most vulnerable in our society. 'The prospect of a Britain under a majority Conservative government is grim indeed. And haven't we all groaned when they use their soulless mantra - long-term economic plan. The truth is their long-term economic plan means long-term economic pain for millions of families.'","Chief Secretary to the Treasury to make unprecedented statement to MPs .

"Dermot O'Leary is being lined up to take over the controls of a new prime time BBC 1 motoring show – just days after he quit as host of ITV's The X Factor. O'Leary, who ended his eight-year stint as the talent show host on Friday, is believed to be in talks to take over the controls of The Getaway Car, a new road show in which members of the public compete in a series of driving challenges. The star, who already has a show on BBC Radio 2, could, according to a well-placed source, co-host the programme with The Stig, the stunt driver from the latest Top Gear series, whose identity is a secret. BBC bosses stressed last night that the new show was not a replacement for the Corporation's embattled Top Gear. Dermot O'Leary (pictured) is being lined up to take over the controls of a new BBC 1 motoring show . The future of that programme remains in doubt after the BBC decided not to renew presenter Jeremy Clarkson's contract following his attack on producer Oisin Tymon. The BBC is planning a pilot edition of The Getaway Car and has issued a casting call for potential contestants, who take part as a pair. The publicity states: 'Anything goes as long as you know each other pretty well and think you would make great TV.' The pilot, which will not be transmitted, will be filmed later this year in what has been described as a 'very glamorous' overseas location. A spokesman for O'Leary confirmed the star was in talks with the BBC but declined to comment further. She said: 'Dermot has spoken to the BBC about a project but I can't say more than that.' O'Leary may also be co-hosting the show with the Stig (pictured), whose identity is a secret . A spokesman for the BBC confirmed it was making a pilot for The Getaway Car but said no presenters were yet attached to the project. She said: 'This non-transmittable game show pilot is still in development and there are no presenters currently attached to it. We will not comment on speculation as to who they may be.' Meanwhile, the exact circumstances of O'Leary's departure from The X Factor appeared to be in some dispute last night. There was speculation that X Factor boss Simon Cowell had decided to drop O'Leary, 41, because of his interest in the rival BBC job and that he wanted to sack the presenter to avoid giving the impression that he was walking out on the ITV show. But senior X Factor sources played down that idea. One source on the show said: 'That is not a scenario I recognise.' A spokesman then added that it had been O'Leary's decision to leave the programme. ITV is expected to announce that Caroline Flack, 35, who was crowned winner of last year's Strictly Come Dancing TV show, will replace O'Leary and co-present The X Factor with singer Olly Murs, 30. A spokesman for ITV last night paid tribute to O'Leary's time on The X Factor. He said: 'We'd like to thank Dermot for eight brilliant years at the helm. He has been a fantastic host. We will miss him and his dance moves and wish him all the best for the future. An announcement on the host for the new series will be made in due course.'","Dermot O'Leary is being lined up to host new prime time motoring show .

"An Australian mother and her adult son were among those who died when a plane operated by the budget carrier of Germany's Lufthansa crashed in the French Alps. The pair from Victoria were among the 150 passengers who lost their lives when Germanwings Flight 9525 ploughed into a French Alpine mountainside at more than 400mph on Tuesday. Rescue helicopters arrived at the remote crash site to find wreckage from the obliterated plane scattered across hundreds of metres, with no pieces of debris larger than a small car. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says the government is seeking to confirm whether any other Australians or dual citizens were on board. Scroll down for video . An Australian mother and her adult son were among those who died when a plane operated by the budget carrier of Germany's Lufthansa crashed in the French Alps . 'I don't think it gets any easier announcing the death of Australian citizens in a tragedy overseas,' Ms Bishop said. 'It would not be appropriate to disclose further details of our citizens at this stage due to the privacy considerations of the family. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this shocking tragedy. We extend our condolences to the governments of Germany, France and Spain and their people who appear to have borne the brunt of this tragedy.' A black box has been found at the crash site of Germanwings flight and will be examined immediately. Images of the crash site emerged as confusion reigned over the final minutes of the doomed Airbus A320 after air traffic controllers claimed they received no SOS despite the jet nosediving 32,000ft in just eight minutes. The plane was travelling from  Barcelona in Spain to the German city of Duesseldorf when it went down in the Alps in southern France. The pair from Victoria were among the 150 passengers who lost their lives when Germanwings Flight 9525 ploughed into a French Alpine mountainside at more than 400mph . A black box has been found at the crash site of Germanwings flight and will be examined immediately . 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the two Australians who have lost their lives,' Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Wednesday. The family of the Australian victims has been contacted. The airliner was carrying 144 passengers - including two babies - and six crew members. Sixteen German school students from the same class were also on board. French officials say there were 'no survivors' following the loss of the plane operated by Germanwings - a low-cost subsidiary of Lufthansa. Germanwings chief executive Thomas Winkelmann said the aircraft began descending at 10.45am, a minute after reaching cruising height of 38,000ft. This descent lasted eight minutes, he told reporters in Cologne. Radar and air traffic control contact broke off at 10.53am when it is understood to have crashed at more than 400mph. The last routine maintenance check of the aircraft took place on Monday by Lufthansa technicians. The last major overhaul was in mid-2013. German reports suggest the aircraft had been grounded just 24 hours before it departed Barcelona for Dusseldorf. The plane had suffered technical issues, including a landing gear problem. French emergency services workers and members of the French gendarmerie gather in Seyne, south-eastern France near the site where a Germanwings Airbus A320 crashed in the French Alps . Rescue teams based in the south eastern French town of Seyene prepare to takeoff to continue the search for bodies of those killed in plane crash . Sixteen German school students from the English-speaking Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium in Haltern-am-See, near Dusseldorf were also on board the doomed flight . Mr Winkelmann said the captain on board was experienced and been with the airline and with Germanwings' parent company Lufthansa for more than 10 years and had clocked up 6,000 flying hours on this particular Airbus model. 2015 .

He added that teams from Germanwings were in Dusseldorf with the families of those on board and that Lufthansa and Germanwings' technical staff were on their way to the crash site to assist with the investigation. Debris from the jet, operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline, has been found scattered over a wide area near Barcelonnette in an inhospitable region of the Alps. About 150 firefighters and high mountain police were deployed to the scene, but officials have warned it could take days to retrieve any bodies. Grieving families, including those of the 16 schoolchildren killed in the crash, have been gathering at Dusseldorf airport in Germany, where the jet was due to land, to await news of the rescue and recovery operation. Australia's ambassador to France Stephen Brady is in contact with local authorities to discuss the retrieval arrangements. Australian consular officials are travelling to the town of Gap where they will liaise with French authorities on the recovery effort. Ms Bishop said it would be premature to speculate about the cause of the crash but said German airline Lufthansa, which owns the budget carrier Germanwings, was working on the assumption it was an accident.

"A crocodile was resting in the sun when it was suddenly pounced upon by three feisty lions. A spell-binding video documented the epic struggle between some of nature's toughest wildlife - but who will win? The tussle was filmed at the Samburu National Reserve in Kenya, home to hundreds of different species of birds and animals. Clash: A crocodile engages in an epic fight with three lions at the Samburu National Reserve in Kenya . The short film shows an intrepid lions gradually approaching the crocodile, which is resting in shallow water. As the lion gets closer the crocodile opens his jaw, ready to fight. But as it looks like the crocodile is ready to pounce, two more lions rush over to join in the scuffle. All three lunge at the reptile, which thrashes around in a bid to escape the big cats' teeth from sinking into its scales. After a few seconds the crocodile is back on the offensive, despite being outnumbered, sending splashes of water into the air as it faces up to the trio of attackers. Attack: Two lions joined in the fight as one of the big cats starts fighting with the crocodile . Sprint: The pair of big cats gain speed as the crocodile thrashes in the water and opens his jaw at their friend .

They clash again, this time the bravest of the trio attempting to put his paw on the reptile's head, clearly angering the creature. The trio dive on the crocodile, who thrashes around, jaw wide open, defending itself and its territory. It seems like it's time might be up, as the beasts circle it from all side, one leaping on its tail to pin it down. Take two: The fiesty crocodile bats back the attack from the trio, who fail to make the fatal contact . But the group fail to make the critical, final plunge, hesitating just enough to give the crocodile time for a counter-attack. Instead, it looks like the big cats want to keep their prey alive, so they can play with it some more. In the end they trot off and the crocodile is left alone to lounge in the sun - and all live to fight another day.

"A Household Cavalry lance corporal, who escorted Prince William and Kate Middleton during the Royal wedding, tried to smother his girlfriend after a row about cold toast. Tank commander Daniel Ridge, 31, pinned Johanna Cade, his girlfriend of two years, to their bed and vowed to leave the nurse and part-time model in a pool of blood, a court heard. Ridge, of Combermere Barracks, Windsor, then squirted shower gel over the 27-year-old's clothes and put a £300 pair of her boots in a pan of boiling water. He was convicted at Wimbledon Magistrates Court of assaulting Miss Cade at her flat in south west London, on October 5, last year, and causing criminal damage to her clothing. Tank commander Daniel Ridge (pictured left) tried to smotherJohanna Cade (right) after a row about toast . Magistrates sentenced him to 12 months' probation, including 100 hours community service work yesterday. He was also ordered to pay Miss Cade £300 in compensation for the assault, £370 for damage, £620 in court costs and an £80 victim surcharge. Ridge, who has served in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and his mount Vengeful escorted the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as well as the Queen, from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace after their wedding on April 29 in 2011. Speaking before the wedding, he had said: 'My mum has set the video and she and my grandparents will be able to follow it all on telly and hopefully recognise me.' But yesterday, the court heard how he threw eggs and glass tumblers at her after becoming angry when she had remarked that the toast he had made was cold. Nurse and part-time model Miss Cade (pictured) said the attack left her feeling 'petrified' and 'vulnerable' Miss Cade told the court: 'I went to the kitchen and he was making breakfast. I said: 'The toast is cold' and his response was: 'Fine, don't have it. I'll make my own, not yours. 'He picked an egg up and threw it at me. I dodged that one and he threw another one at me and I dodged that one. He was quite angry and intense and I was disgusted and frightened. 'He raised a glass tumbler up in the air and threw that at me. I moved and it hit the floor behind me then he raised up a second one and threw it at me and again I moved.' She added that he then smeared avocado on her coat before wrapping her in the duvet, leaving her unable to breathe as he throttled her neck. The defendant told the court that he had playfully 'lobbed' two eggs towards Miss Cade to lighten the mood and she deliberately placed the two glasses on the floor before the police arrived. He added that Miss Cade had attacked him, leaving scratches on his neck as well as a cut and he wrapped her in the duvet to restrict her 'flailing' arms. 'She grabbed me and pulled me around the kitchen a bit and started hitting me on the back of the head in a pawing cat-like motion,' he said. 'I got punched in the face and wanted to stop getting hurt and grabbed the duvet to use as a barrier between me and her.' Ridge, who has served in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, claimed he playfully 'lobbed' eggs at Miss Cade . Ridge and his mount Vengeful escorted the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace after their wedding day (pictured) on April 29 in 2011 . He also claimed that Miss Cade had used one of his trainers to wipe the smashed egg off the floor and told police that in a moment of 'childish retaliation' he decided to damage her clothes. But Miss Cade insisted she was 'petrified' as Ridge launched the attack. 'I was petrified, stunned, frozen and started to cry and he went into my bedroom, got the duvet that was on my bed, and threw it over my head and body,' she said. 'I said: 'Get off, I can't breathe.' He had hold of me by the arms and then I was dragged into the bedroom with the duvet over me and pinned to the bed, with hands I think it was, around my neck. 'I couldn't see anything and at first I was very frightened and tried moving, wriggling out and became quite panicked and I managed to get my arm out. 'I reached up and I think I grabbed his ear. I hit the side of his face and made a scratch. I was frightened, I knew I had to get out from being suffocated and held by the throat.' Miss Cade added: 'I remember feeling the blood drain from my body. I could feel myself shutting off and not being able to breathe at all. I felt very, very dizzy.' Ridge eventually left when she threatened to call the police, and Miss Cade added: 'I was sweating, so, so frightened. I've never felt so vulnerable and fearful for my life.' She later photographed herself, revealing a bruise to her right elbow, a red mark on her left arm, a red mark to her lower back and a red mark to the right side of her chest. And she was forced to throw out much of the stained clothing, including a £70 coat and said added she had a £550 quote to re-decorate her bedroom. The court also heard her recall previous incidents when Ridge had lost his temper, including smashing her phone in a fit of anger. 'He once locked me out of his house in Devon at 3am while in my underwear and in the rain and has repeatedly dumped me on roadsides and driven off,' she said. 'Last August, I was very ill with what turned out to be meningitis and Daniel refused to take me to hospital. I begged him to take me to hospital.' She disagreed with a defence claim that Ridge was a 'gentleman' throughout their relationship and recalled how he had let her down during follow-up treatment. 'He drove off and shouted out the window of his car: 'Get the bus to hospital.' He was sentenced to 12 months' probation and 100 hours of community service at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court (pictured) Ridge told the court: 'It was a childish matter that shouldn't really have happened. My clothes were ruined as well, but I didn't think it was right to press charges. 'At no point did I throw any glasses. I did not use any aggression and I did not raise my hands to her.' His lawyer, Mr. David Allman told the court yesterday: 'He's been a professional member of the armed services since the age of eighteen and he's currently intending to continue that career for at least nine years. 'He is seeking promotion and that would have happened fairly soon had this court case not occurred. His promotion is now on hold. 'I am asking you to take into account the background of his service career, his duty for his country.' Magistrate Fiona Abbott, making an indefinite restraining order prohibiting Ridge from contacting Miss Cade, said he had subjected her to 'gratuitous degradation' and 'mental anguish'. Ms Abbot said: 'It happened in the victim's home and there was gratuitous degradation in the way you spoke to the victim, . 'The compensation is for the bruising and mental anguish caused by this assault.' She added: 'You denied your actions and minimised your part in them and the effect on your victim.'","Tank commander Daniel Ridge, 31, pinned Johanna Cade, 27, to their bed .

"Double-yellow lines in a Scottish village immortalised in the classic novel Sunset Song are to be painted a pale shade of primrose so as not to detract from its historic charms. Councillors voted that the new 'no parking' traffic markings in Auchenblae, Kincardineshire should be light yellow 'in sympathy' with its conservation status. But residents branded the idea 'mad' and voiced fears that the new lines would be ignored because people wouldn't know what they mean. Double-yellow lines in Auchenblae, Kincardineshire, are to be painted a pale shade of primrose so as not to detract from its historic charms . Ian Mollison, Liberal Democrat member for North Kincardine, said: 'As a driver, when you see double yellow lines you know what they mean. 'If you see primrose or cream lines, well I am sure it's very tasteful but you don't have a clue what they mean. 'You might think a local resident has been at it with a tin of Dulux.' Liz McDonald, 50, said: 'I think it is a bit mad. If the double yellow lines are primrose, will people just ignore them?' Residents branded the idea 'mad' and voiced fears that the new lines would be ignored because people wouldn't know what they mean . This will be the first time double yellow lines have been introduced in the village as residents have objected to them in the past, given its picture-postcard appeal. The Scottish village was immortalised in Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s (pictured) classic novel Sunset Song . Joiner Alexander Adams, 60, said: 'If it is a conservation area, there should be no double-yellow lines at all if they want to keep it the way it was. The issue was discussed at Aberdeenshire Council's Kincardine and The Mearns Area Committee as a new traffic management plan for Auchenblae was approved. Officials say the village has become busier, with restrictions needed to stop illegal parking and increase the safety of pedestrians and other road users. Stuart McFarlane, Aberdeenshire Council's roads manager for Kincardine and Mearns, said: 'The colour will be a lighter yellow and less harsh to tie in with the conservation area. 'No-one should have any misunderstanding that they are double yellow lines.' The village was granted conservation status last autumn and is said to have important historic interest as an early mill town of the late 18th Century. It was immortalised in Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s 1932 novel, Sunset Song, which was named the 'Best Scottish Book of All Time' at the Edinburgh International Book Festival in 2005. Auchenblae has 75 listed buildings with the conservation status protecting buildings on the village's Inverurie Street, High Street and Market Square, as well as the school and parish church.","Double yellow lines in Scottish village to be painted pale shade of primrose .

"Many parents are afflicted by 'weight-blindness', unable to recognise their child is overweight unless they are extremely obese, new research has found. The research discovered that just under a third (31 per cent) of the parents underestimated where their child's body mass index (BMI) was on obesity scale. The scale  classifies children as very overweight (or obese), overweight, a healthy weight, or underweight. Many parents are afflicted by 'weight blindness', and are unable to recognise their child is overweight unless they are extremely obese, according to new research (file picture) Just four parents described their child as being very overweight despite 369 children being officially identified as such (1 per cent) and fewer than 1 per cent overestimated their child's weight status. According to official guidelines, children are classified as overweight at the 85th centile and very overweight (or obese) at the 95th centile. The team estimated that for a child with a BMI at the 98th centile there was an 80 per cent chance that the parent would classify their child as a healthy weight. Tam Fry, spokesperson for the National Obesity Forum and chair of the Child Growth Forum said: ‘Because there are so many overweight and obese children around, the parents are in denial. 'They say “my Jonny is no fatter than the child down the road”. 'My advice would be that if any parent is concerned about their child’s weight, they should take the child to the doctor or chemist. ‘Think of an excuse to go down. Have the doctor or chemist take the BMI. 'When they have the result they can reassure the parent, or give them advice on whether the child’s weight is too high. ‘BMI is a very good measure, but it needs input from a health professional who can look at the child holistically and judge whether there is a problem or not. ‘Parents will not be able to measure their child accurately as they won't have the correct measurements for height and for weight bathroom scales are notoriously inaccurate. ‘They need to be properly measured by a professional who can make a proper judgement and give proper advice. ‘You cannot tell if a child is overweight or obese on one measure. 'You need to look at the child’s BMI and ideally plot this against their BMI three months ago.' However, they recognised that parents became more likely to classify their child as overweight when the child had a BMI above the 99.7th centile. The study found that parents were more likely to underestimate their child's weight if they were black or south Asian, from more deprived backgrounds, or if the child was male. Researchers suggested that if parents cannot identify when their child is overweight, this throws into question the effectiveness of public health campaigns aiming to address obesity in the home. Recent research found that a third of children in England are now classed as overweight or obese. Parents might underestimate their children's weight due to be fear of being judged, unwillingness to label a child as overweight, and shifting perceptions of normal weight because of increases in body weight in general. They said evidence suggests that parents who recognise their child's weight on the BMI chart are more likely to perceive potential health risks. The study was led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and UCL Institute of Child Health. It involved questioning the parents of 2,976 children in five primary care trusts: Redbridge, Islington, West Essex, Bath and North East Somerset, and Sandwell. The team said the research could help evaluate how effective public health interventions for obesity in children are likely to be in different groups of the population. Senior author Dr Sanjay Kinra, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: 'If parents are unable to accurately classify their own child's weight, they may not be willing or motivated to enact the changes to the child's environment that promote healthy weight maintenance.' Co-author Professor Russell Viner, of the UCL institute of Child Health, said: 'Measures that decrease the gap between parental perceptions of child weight status and obesity scales used by medical professionals may now be needed in order to help parents better understand the health risks associated with overweight and increase uptake of healthier lifestyles.' Graph, from the US' Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, shows how an a 10 year old boy would be considered healthy, underweight, healthy, overweight or obese depending on which percentile they are in on the BMI chart. A 10 year old with a BMI of 23 would be in the obese category (95th percentile or greater) The study was published in the British Journal of General Practice. Amanda McLean, director of the World Cancer Research Fund, said: ‘By encouraging children to eat healthily, maintain a healthy weight, and be regularly physically active, parents can help children develop healthy habits and protect against health problems later in life. ‘We know that obesity is linked to a range of health risks later in life – including increased cancer risk – so it’s vital that parents are aware of their child’s Body Mass Index (BMI), and can spot if their youngster is starting to become overweight. ‘But we also need to acknowledge that more can, and should, be done to encourage healthy eating and greater physical activity in our society. We need targeted policies that help people lead healthy lives – from clearer nutritional labelling to a focus on health education in schools. ‘By encouraging good habits we can help future generations lead happy, healthy, lives.’ World Cancer Research Fund’s Great Grub Club has plenty of advice and tools for parents to help their children get healthy in fun, easy ways. Parents who are able to recognise whether their child is overweight are more likely to perceive potential health risks and change their lifestyles, researchers said .","A third of parents underestimated their child's body mass index (BMI)

"Seven members of Congress including two U.S. senators have been caught following an X-rated account on Twitter, but those whose spokespersons responded to requests for comment say their staff made innocent mistakes. The account, calling itself 'F*** Box Radio,' went dormant in 2013 but promised 'the best orgasm, porn and sex sounds ever! We will post sex pics too!' The sex-themed account uses a sexually graphic photo as its header image. Its official Twitter handle, however, is the innocuous-sounding '@jukeboxradio2.' Lawmakers whose official social media accounts followed 'F*** Box' include Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott; Democratic Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Diana DeGette of Colorado and Loretta Sanchez of California; and Republican Reps. Darrell Issa of California and Ann Wagner of Missouri. OOPS: Seven members of Congress followed a Twitter account calling itself 'F*** Box,' and two of them were still doing it – including California Democrat Loretta Sanchez – as of THursday at noon . BIPARTISAN: California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa also followed the account, but his social media staff unfollowed after Daily Mail Online asked about it . Rep. Issa's office unfollowed the account minutes after Daily Mail Online asked for comment on Thursday. His spokesman, Ben Carnes, said in an email that the account had 'tweeted on newsworthy items a couple of years ago. Since then, they have clearly changed their focus.' 'Any Twitter follower can make a similar change at any time,' Carnes pointed out, and it is impossible for Congressman Issa to constantly review tens of thousands of Twitter followers for any changes they might make to their profiles.' 'As soon as the Twitter handle's addition of coarse language was brought to the office's attention, the account was unfollowed.' Separately, a legislative communications aide who declined to be identified said during a phone interview that a 'mortified' boss wasn't happy. 'It's not the kind of thing you like to find out,' the aide said. 'Not now, not ever.' NO COMMENT: Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar's office didn't respond to questions about why she had followed a pornographic Twitter account . Alex Macfarlane, a spokesman for Rep. Cicilline, explained that his boss was at one time in the habit of uncritically following Twitter accounts that followed his. 'Years ago we had a follow/follow back policy for the Twitter account,' Macfarlane said in an email, 'but have since revised that policy and have started vetting followers more closely.' 'We’ve un-followed the account in question.' Christian Morgan, chief of staff to Rep. Wagner, issued a denial to a question about how it was possible that her official Twitter account had followed a porn-oriented user. 'No idea, and its not,' Morgan said in an email. But a report just a day ago in Roll Call includes a graphic showing Wagner was indeed following the account. In a follow-up, he said he had learned that 'the person who does our social media now in the office unfollowed upon seeing the [Roll Call] story.' EMBARRASSING: Colorado Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette is still following the 'F*** Box' Twitter account . Other lawmakers' offices did not respond to requests for comment at all. By Thursday at noon, only DeGette and Sanchez were still following the salacious account. Roll Call reported Wednesday that its initial purpose seemed to be harvesting followers for Internet radio projects, and then complaining about government regulations that stood in the way of a 10-year-old Philadelphia girl, Sarah Murnaghan, getting a lung transplant. At the time, then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius refused to grant the terminally ill cystic fibrosis patient an exemption to a policy that gave priority to children over age 12. Ultimately a federal court intervened and Murnaghan got two double-lung transplants, and according to ABC News could breathe 12 hours per day without a ventilator. The 'F***box Radio' account owner's temporary interest in health advocacy could explain how seven federal lawmakers were among its fewer than 200 followers.","Seven Republicans and Democrats followed 'F*** Box Radio' on Twitter .

"These jaw-dropping holiday snaps taken by a group of daredevil tourists in Norway may be some of the most dangerous ever taken. The series of photos shows the friends taking turns as they stand on top of a boulder that is wedged between a mountain crevice in Norway, with a direct drop of nearly 800ft. The incredible experience provides impressive views for those who are brave enough to step foot on the boulder, but those who are afraid of heights would become weak at the knees and think better of it. Scroll down for video . Ronny Randen, 39, took the photos while he was travelling with five friends to climb Preikestolen, also known as Pulpit Rock . Kjeragbolten – the official name for the boulder – is located on the edge of the Kjerag mountain in Rogaland, Norway. It is situated more than 3,500ft above sea level and is a popular photo spot for thrill-seekers who are willing to risk their lives for a memorable holiday photo. Despite the rain making its surface slippery the group of visitors in these photos ventured onto the boulder and posed with their arms in the air or a thumb extended as other tourists waited their turn. Software developer Ronny Randen, 39, took the photos while he was travelling with five friends to climb Preikestolen, also known as Pulpit Rock. Kjeragbolten – the official name for the boulder – is located on the edge of the Kjerag mountain in Rogaland, Norway . He said: ‘During our visit if was a rainy, and the boulder was actually a bit slippery. There's a little path on the left side where you can jump onto the rock. ‘It's hard to describe the feeling of standing on the boulder. After walking up the mountains your legs are a bit tired, and the idea of jumping onto, and balancing on, a slippery boulder hanging above a fjord seems like a really bad idea. ‘But, to be honest, it's not hard getting out there, and it is well worth it.’ Mr Randen, dressed in blue, can be seen posing on the boulder with his hands in the air and in one photo, taken from a distance, shows the stunning view and terrifying drop. Despite the rain making its surface slippery the group of visitors in these photos ventured onto the boulder for some memorable snaps . Mr Randen, who lives just outside Oslo, said the hike up to Kjeragbolten is demanding as it involves three steep climbs. He added: ‘Most of the time you walk on smooth rock and boulders and because it was rainy and foggy it was a bit slippery. ‘There are metal chains along the steepest climbs of the trail. When we finally arrived at the boulder it was rather foggy but after a while it started to clear up and we were rewarded with a stunning view of the Lysefjord. ‘The whole experience was so breathtaking and just looking at the images now really takes me back there. ‘It's not a place you go very often as it's a bit remote, but it's such an amazing piece of art from nature that it is definitely worth going.’","The amazing photos were taken by a group of tourists at the Kjeragbolten boulder in southern Norway .

"As noises go, it isn't the most pleasant sound in the world. But this baby is horrified when he hears his mother unwrapping a roll of sticky tape. Nic Taylor, 32, a photographer from St Helens, Merseyside, filmed Lucas's reaction as Gemma rips off strips of sellotape while wrapping Mother's Day gifts. Five-month-old Lucas is relaxed until he hears the loud noise of his mother unwrapping a roll of sellotape . The footage shows the five-month-old boy perched in an interactive baby walker wearing in a onesie with the television on in the background. Although the child is surrounded by an array of toys, he remains uninterested and motionless, until his mother begins noisily unwrapping the tape. At the first loud rip, Lucas jumps and his face is a picture of shock as he stares at his mother, mouth wide open, with a horrified expression on his face. He looks alarmed for a while and then relaxes momentarily, gazing back at the television. Upon hearing the loud rip, he looks visibly panicked and looks at his mother with a worried expression . What on earth is that? Catching Lucas' hilariously panicked reactions, his mother laughs and apologies to him . As his mother loudly pulls off another strip of sellotape, the baby boy jolts again, rattling his toys from his shock, with a look of sheer panic on his face. His mother is unable to hide her amusement as she chuckles and apolgises, saying: 'I'm sorry sweetheart!.' Nic Taylor posted the home video on YouTube with the aptly-named caption, 'Cute Baby Gets a Shock (funny)'.

"Twenty UberX taxi drivers are facing prosecution for using their own cars to pick-up regular passengers. The drivers are facing fines of up to $110,000 each per offence for breaching the Passenger Transport Act. Despite being served with 77 court attendance notices, the popular app service, which is used by thousands of Australians, has told drivers who are fined that it will cover their penalties. Scroll down for video . Twenty UberX taxi drivers are facing prosecution for using their own cars to pick-up regular passengers . NSW law states that the taxi service is required to be run through a licensed operator, meaning it is prohibited for the drivers to use their personal cars for the service. 'We don't believe anyone should be penalised for providing safe, reliable rides in their cities and, as always, we stand by our partners fully,' an Uber spokeswoman told Fairfax media on Monday. The app-based car service recently called on the NSW government to implement the 'illegal' ride-sharing platform in a bid to make it a permanent transportation option. It pledged to create thousands of jobs for drivers, and customers who use their ride-sharing service.. The submission by the company to the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal review said it's services provide a 'safe, reliable and affordable choices for consumers' as well as offering job opportunities to areas of high unemployment rates in Sydney. The drivers are facing fines of up to $110,000 each per offence for breaching the Passenger Transport Act . 'When comparing the areas Uber partners live and the unemployment rate in certain regions, it is clear they come from those areas where unemployment and under-employment are high,' the company said. 'Uber is helping to provide flexible economic opportunities for people who have previously not had access. 'In New South Wales Uber does not accept any partner that has any Australian criminal history recorded with CrimTrac or who has had their license suspended or has any record of a drink or drug driving record in NSW.' But a Transport for NSW spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that it is illegal for drivers in NSW to participate in 'ride-sharing' activities like UberX. 'While Uber Pty Ltd does not breach the Passenger Transport Act 1990 by offering the service, drivers transporting passengers for a fare do,' the Transport for NSW spokesperson said. NSW law states that the taxi service is required to be run through a licensed operator, meaning it is prohibited for the drivers to use their personal cars for the service . 'Any driver operating in these circumstances are potentially committing a number of offences, including driving without authority and offering a service without accreditation. A submission, which was made in January, said NSW Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian had refused to meet with representatives of Uber. An Uber spokeswoman has confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that the company is in 'constructive dialogue' with the government and 'have now met with Minister Berejiklian' but could not comment further on the matter. Uber's director of public policy Oceania Brad Kitschke wrote in the submission that '100 percent of partner drivers who passed Uber's background checks were subsequently able to obtain government authority from the Roads and Maritime Service'.","Uber has come under fire yet again after being served with 77 court notices .

"An unemployed grandmother  is being dubbed the next White Dee after hiring an agent months before the programme is due to begin. Grandmother-of-six Dot Taylor, 48, who has given up trying to find a job after 20 years out of work, has hired the same agent used by the original Benefits Street star used in the hope of finding fame. Barry Tomes who takes care of Dee (real name Deirdre Kelly) told the Mirror that he believes that Dorothy, from Stockton-on-Tees, has a lucrative career ahead of her. Scroll down for video . Dorothy Taylor  has taken on the same agent that helped White Dee rise to fame months before the second series is due to start . He said: 'I'm advising Dot and I'm advising her that there is money to be made for her. 'She is going to be one of the stars of the show. She's a big personality and can make some cash.' Tomes added that there were several characters worth looking out for in the new series who he believes could be equally successful. 'There are a few others who will be the main focus of the show too and I advise them to get some representation. 'It doesn't have to be but if they get looked after in the right way then they will be able to make some money. They only have to look at what I have done with Dee.' Barry Tomes made White Dee famous after helping her on to Celebrity Big Brother where she reportedly accepted a £100,000 fee. Dot says that she has a softer side to her than the outspoken White Dee (real name Deirdre Kelly: right) which she believes will be the secret to fame . At just 4ft 11 Dot says she should be called 'little Dee' Now Dot - who is a diminutive 4ft 11in - wants to be the new matriarch of the TV series and hopes it could bring her fame and fortune. The mother-of-five said: 'I would be 'Little Dee' - I'm fun, me - because of my size. I'm only little, I'm only 4ft 11. 'I don't  took my age, people think I'm younger, I act like a kid. It doesn't bother me.' Dot says that she has a softer side than her Birmingham counterpart and believes this could be the secret to her success. 'I wouldn't mind being the next White Dee. I'm not horrible, I'm nice to people. I could become famous.' TV crews started filming in Kingston Road, Stockton, in August last year and images released from filming revealed a broad set of characters. One resident was even seen leading a horse into the garden of one of the terraced houses in the road. Homes in the street - which stand in the shadow of Holme House Prison - cost an average £50,000 and one in five residents is on benefits. Dot and her husband have lived in a council house on adjacent Cowper Road for more than 20 years. Barry Tomes who represents both White Dee and Dorothy Taylor says that several other characters from the second series should seek representation as he believes they could make a lot of money . Although Dot refused to reveal how much they get in benefits, she admitted neither had worked for more than 20 years. She and her husband have four sons - aged 30, 28, 27 and 22 - and one daughter, 17, as well as six grandchildren all under the age of seven. There's also another one  on the way. Dot said she had 'all sorts of jobs' in the past, including stints in a crisp factory and a nursing home, but had now 'given up' looking for a job. The grandmother puts her lack of job interest down to her devotion to her children. She said: 'I stopped working for the kids really.' 'Most of them [jobs adverts] they say you have to have loads of qualifications, but most people who even have the qualifications can't get a job anyway. Filming for the second series of Benefits Street began last August which saw one resident leading a horse into the garden of his inner-city terraced home . 'They just end up giving up. What's the point in having all these GCSEs and A-levels when you still can't get a job. 'There's no jobs but I think that's all over, not just the area.' Asked if she was worried the area would be portrayed in a bad light, she said: 'No I'm not worried. It shouldn't happen. What you get from this area is the truth. There is nowt bad. 'You know when people condemn the area and say ""I wouldn't live there""? You get that anywhere but this is where I have been brought up. 'There are lots of characters on my street. I can always have a laugh with them and things, people are always nattering and that.'","Dorothy Taylor, 48, stars in the new Benefits Street, starting later this year .

"Kim Kardashian and Rita Ora have been making headlines for rocking latex this year but they're not the first - and the won't be the last - to show off the risque look. Once the sartorial statement of choice in sex clubs, latex, PVC and wet-look leather has been treated to a high fashion makeover but can real women pull off the skin-tight look? Or do you need the body - and the confidence - of an A-lister to wear it? FEMAIL called on the designer behind Kim and Rita's famous looks to custom design a latex dress from scratch for one of our writers - who says she's never felt more confident. Scroll down for video . Can ANYONE pull off latex like Kim Kardashian? MailOnline writer Hanna Flint had a dress custom-made by the star's favourite designer, Atsuko Kudo, and she felt 'amazing' in her showstopping outfit . Kim Kardashian wore her Kudo latex dress in September and Hanna had her own version custom made to prove that you don't have to be a megastar to rock the risque fabric . From Kate Moss to Dita Von Teese, Atsuko Kudo has designed latex outfits for a who's who of showbiz and Kim just can't get enough of the skin-tight looks. Plus, judging by the catwalks at fashion week, it will be filling our wardrobes in months to come, so Hanna Flint, our 26-year-old writer, was in safe hands. Hanna, who is a size 12, visited Atsuko's studio in Islington, north London, for a fitting - as while her designs can be bought off the rack (something Rita Ora does), Atsuko recommends that she fits all of her clients either in person or online. After being measured, Hanna tried on a variety of colours - from peach to black - and differing styles, to see which she felt most comfortable in. 'It's a really personal experience,' explains the brand's managing director, Simon Hoare. 'Latex is perfect for a special moment and it's all about feeling and looking great in it. You have to commit to putting in the time to get a fitting so that the final outfit looks like it's painted on.' Hanna and the team decided the black suited her skin tone and hair colour so she had one made from scratch and had to use lubricant to slip into the dress for the final shoot . Hanna said that maybe with a strategically placed blouse or jacket, she could reduce the focus of her top half for a night out on the town . Hanna and the team decided the black suited her skin tone and hair colour so she had one made from scratch. The process involves gluing the latex together to the customer's precise measurements and requirements. Explaining the experience, Hanna said: 'At the fitting, Atsuko and the team brought out a few options for me to try, but at first they didn’t take my measurements rather took a look at me and gauged which size would fit. 'Clearly they have a good eye for it as the dresses actually fitted very well on the body, though they had to make my bust size and cup bigger (just like Kim!). 'I definitely needed a hand putting on the dress, and the stylist put talc on the inside of the dress so it could slip on better. I say slip, but that wasn’t the case as there was a lot of pulling and squeezing to make sure the seams were lined up and there wasn’t any ridges in the latex. 'Once I stepped out and saw myself I had to admit, it was a pretty ""wow"" moment. I do have some lumps and bumps but the dress really streamlined it and I really get why Kim is such a fan. I actually really liked the black dress with the plunging neckline, because as a woman with a bust, it’s hard to wear that sort of cut without accidentally suffering a nipple slip! Thanks to the tight latex there was no danger of that. 'It’s amazing how 15 minutes in the dress can become rather hot work and after trying on three, I did feel thoroughly flushed. Hats off to Ella Eyre who rocked an Atsuko Kudo latex dress for her energetic concert recently!'. Atsuko Kudo takes Hanna's measurements in her Islington boutique . Is that Kim Kardashian? Writer Hanna is proof that you don't have to be a reality star or celebrity to look sensational - and super stylish - in skintight latex . And a few days later, Hanna received her bespoke design. 'Finally putting on the custom-made dress was amazing,' said Hanna, of the final shoot. 'It fitted perfectly to my shape and bust size but I would probably need a hand to get it on in the first place - and maybe when I visit the ladies' room. 'The great thing about the latex is that once it's in position, it does streamline your figure. 'Kim probably has more confidence to wear such a cleavage-enhancing dress on the town than me, but maybe with a strategically placed blouse or jacket I could reduce the focus of my top half for a night out. 'I probably wouldn't wear it to go dancing in. It does get a little hot under the latex and I doubt Kim would be seen with a sweat on.' While Hanna opted for a copy Kim look, Atsuko emphasises that you don't necessarily have to wear head-to-toe latex. She said: 'I make accessories, millinery, shorts and skirts so  you can mix and match.' Atsuko first discovered the fabric when she was at fashion college in Japan 20 years ago. She was tasked with finding a quirky material on the high street and ventured into  a sex shop and from that day made it her mission  to create clothes using latex. Hanna, 26, tries out a skintight latex cocktail dress with cap sleeves and plunging V-neck in Atsuko's shop . Hanna is measured for her bespoke, strappy, cleavage-enhancing latex dress, which is just like Kim's . After moving to London, she started brand her eponymous brand in 2000 and was credited with being the first designer to offer a feminine take on latex. Her work quickly got picked up by Dita Von Teese and iconic photographer Steven Meisel used four pages of Eva Mendes wearing the fabric in Italian Vogue in 2007. 'That was such a moment,' recalled Simon. 'It looked so great and sexy on her; that was the real turning point.' Other stars were quickly recognising the brand and Atsuko was dressing Lady Gaga non-stop from 2008. Atsuko dressed her when she was supporting The Pussy Cat Dolls on tour, as well as for most of her music videos, including Telephone with Beyonce, who she also dressed. Kim Kardashian and Rita Ora showed up to a party earlier this year in near-identical latex dresses by Atsuko Kudo...and they're just two of the stars jumping on the bandwagon . Hanna tried on Rita and Kim's favourite blush-coloured latex shade too at the shop before finally settling on the black option, which better suited her skin tone and hair colour . Another major moment came when for the brand when Lady Gaga asked Atsuko to dress her for her meeting with the Queen, who the designer cites as her 'dream client'. 'I would love to dress the queen in a latex suit, a colourful one - with a hat.' On a standard week day, Kate Moss and Rita Ora may 'rock up' at the brand's shop in Islington, and Kim may well be unveiling more looks in the coming months. Simon said: 'She tends to save her latex looks for special moments. It divides opinion but, overall, because Kim is so curvy, it has made a lot of curvier women think ""if she is wearing it, then I am going to give it a go"". 'She is the first iconic figure for some time in fashion who has had real curves. And Kanye certainly likes her in it.' Kim has long championed the material and made headlines when she wore a  look by same the designer back in November for a fragrance launch in Australia, left, and to watch husband Kanye perform, right . Mrs Kanye West isn't the only celebrity to wear Atsko Kudo designs: the elaborate red dress Lady Gaga wore to meet Queen Elizabeth in 2009 was created by the designer .

"Model, TV presenter and homeware designer... is there anything that Holly Willoughby can't do? The national sweetheart, who wakes up the nation on This Morning, has added another string to her bow by designing a range of vintage-inspired clothes for babies. Speaking to FEMAIL about her latest project with BHS, Holly, 34, said: 'It’s something I have been passionate about for quite some time; this project has been about 18 months in the making. 'I have a style that I have tried to bring into this range, which I hope feels fresh and blends the modern with vintage.' Holly Willoughby, 34, has extended her homeware range with BHS and has now ventured into designing a range of baby clothes inspired by vintage pieces and her own childhood memories . The range, which lands in stores next week, has a strong vintage feel running throughout and each piece has an element that is reminiscent of a bygone era, from delicate frills to smart pinstripes. The mother-of-three, who created Pinterest boards to garner inspiration, said she worked extremely  hard to ensure her range was full of great pieces that accounted for the practical needs of a mother and baby. To ensure the very best quality and comfort, Holly used only natural fibres to create breathable garments that she says will keep little ones cool throughout the summer months. 'My main desire was for the collection to conjure up nostalgic memories from childhood such as swimming in the sea or trying ice cream for the very first time,' she said. Holly, who says a good night's sleep is her fail-safe beauty tip, shows off her new homeware range . The range, which lands in stores next week, has a strong vintage feel running throughout and each piece has an element that is reminiscent of a bygone era, from delicate frills to smart pinstripes. Holly says she loves the ditsy dresses, which cost £10, and would dress her daughter in one if she were younger . Holly, who is mother to Harry, Belle and Chester, certainly has experience when it comes to dressing little ones - and said she designed her new range with her own offspring in mind. 'I love the vintage florals, the soft tones and the fresh cotton dresses,' she said. 'I definitely like that look of soft colours, nothing too fussy or busy. My favourite pieces for girls are the ditsy floral dress and the grey woven romper; if Belle was a bit younger I would love to see her in those. 'I am very excited to see Chester in the boy's pieces, I have ordered the whole range!'. If that wasn't keeping her busy enough, the presenter managed to find time to extend her home range with Sir Philip Green's high street store, too. Speaking about the additions to her homeware range, which has a similar vintage theme to her baby range, Holly said: 'We have added quite a few things! We have thought about accent things for each room that you can layer in and build on your own look. 'There are some incredible statement lights that you could pop into any room. It’s not about chucking everything out and creating a brand new look in your house, I don’t think that is practical or right. A home is what you build over years and years. 'I like collecting things along the way and making them work within what I already have; I guess that is why I have chosen such a mix of pieces but I think that they do all sit well together.' Holly says she is very excited to see her little son Chester in the boy's pieces . As well as designing a baby range, the presenter managed to find time to extend her home range with Sir Philip Green's high street store, too . Holly says she has thought about accent things for each room that you can layer in and build on your own look . The range has a vintage theme - much like her baby range - and Holly says decorating her bedroom to help her feel calm and relaxed is essential . Holly, who says her bedroom is her 'favourite place' in the house, added: 'My sleep is very precious to me so I do treat it like it is a sanctuary. I simply swear by trying to get a good night’s sleep every night... not that it's always easy when you have a young family! 'Candles are very important, it just instantly makes a room nice so you feel calm and relaxed.' The  new mother may have been keeping busy with her BHS projects but she's not putting her feet up just yet. 'There is lots more I want to do,' revealed the ambitious Celebrity Juice presenter. 'Both of these projects have been a long-standing passion and I would love to keep building on this. I have lots and lots of ideas that I keep as Pinterest boards and I have stacks of magazines I love to look through for inspiration. 'I just feel so lucky I got this chance to see ideas come to life and be able to finally buy the things I have had trouble finding in the past. I just hope that everyone else likes it too and I can’t wait to see it in store.' Holly Willoughby for the Home in stores now. Available in BHS Stores nationwide & at BHS.co.uk.

"A Burmese python 13 and a half feet long moved into a Florida zoo yesterday. The Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens newest exhibit featured some of the nation's largest living snakes to celebrate it's new 48 foot, life-sized replica of the prehistoric Titanoboa snake - the heaviest and longest snake ever discovered. Though it might have looked tiny next to its ancestor, the zoo's Burmese python was no small thing, clocking in at 112 pounds. The currently unnamed female python is on loan to the zoo until September. A Burmese python 13 and a half feet long made an appearance at the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens newest exhibit yesterday that featured some of the nation's largest living snakes . Guests could take pictures and touch the 112 pound reptile. The Burmese python can reach more than 17 feet and weigh 400 pounds . Dan Maloney, the zoo's deputy director of animal care and conservation, told Daily Mail Online that the snake was 'pretty large' for a Burmese python but that she had a 'great temperament'. 'She's a nice snake and she's gorgeous and a pretty thing as can be,' he said, adding that her relaxed mood will make her great for school visits. Maloney said the python is fed frozen rabbits that are thawed out. The zoo's snakes are never fed live food in order to protect their safety. 'Its much easier for quality control,' he said. 'And live food, even rabbits, can severely bite the face of a snake. They're also trying to avoid being dinner.' A rock python, an anaconda and an eastern diamondback rattlesnake, the largest rattlesnake and the heaviest venomous snake in the Americas, have also moved into the exhibit. The Burmese python is well-known in the state, where its hardly been harmless. A recent U.S. Geological Survey and National Park Service study found that there are 150,000 pythons in the Everglades National Park, according to the Washington Post. According to Maloney, the leading theory is that the Burmese python first came to the Everglades in 1992, after Hurricane Andrew blew through the state - and a pet breeding center. The exhibit was celebrating the zoo's new 48 ft long, life-sized replica of the prehistoric Titanoboa snake - the heaviest and longest snake ever discovered . 'Its believed either people couldn't take care of them anymore, released them, or the hurricane destroyed the facilities and liberated the animals,' Maloney said. The Burmese python has become what is known as an invasive species,  wreaking havoc on the environment's native species as they continue to spread. Native to Southeast Asia, the python has quickly spread throughout the Everglades as females can lay up to 100 eggs. The non-venomous snakes, who kill and eat their prey by constriction, have decimated the park's mammal population, consuming more than 99 percent of raccoons and 88 percent of bobcats, according to the Washington Post. Although pythons can reach more than 17 feet in length and weigh up to 400 pounds, they are not a major threat to humans. Instead they'd rather feast on small mammals and birds, but are known to eat deers and alligators as well. An eastern diamondback rattlesnake featured in the Titanoboa exhibit, the largest rattlesnake. Unlike the Burmese python, which kills its prey by constriction, this rattlesnake is venomous . More than 2,000 pythons have been removed from the Everglades since 2002, according to the U.S. National Park Service. Pythons captured in the park are typically euthanized. Maloney said the zoo, which carries a rock python that was caught in the Everglades, tries to provide homes for wild snakes if they can - but there often isn't the space to house such large animals. And the snakes aren't easy to find. The National Park Service said trapping methods are often ineffective, meaning the reptiles must be detected and removed by search and hand. The state even hosted the 'Florida Python Challenge', offering a reward to the team who captured and killed the most pythons in the month-long event. Only 50 were captured. But for now, Maloney said the zoo wants to celebrate snakes and their history. 'We think of snakes as being positive members of the animal kingdom,' he said. 'We’re celebrating snakes by showcasing not only the big snakes living on the planet today but the biggest snake that ever existed.' A worker at the Florida zoo adds the eastern diamondback rattlesnake to the exhibit .","The currently unnamed female python will be at the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens until September .

"A jilted husband has been jailed for almost a year and given a restraining order after rampaging through his former marital home with a chainsaw to reduce its value. These photographs show how Andrew Brooks, 43, destroyed large parts of the property after the £150,000 Lake District cottage was put in the name of his estranged wife Bridget. He took the chainsaw to the majority of external and internal doors, reminiscent of terrifying scenes from Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining where star Jack Nicholson hacks through them with an axe. The former soldier had sawn through the property's doors to enter his former home in Marton, near Barrow-in-Furness after a dispute over ownership of the property when his wife left him because he was abusive. Although she was not in the home at the time, Brooks' rampage left Mrs Brooks suffering panic attacks and on prescribed medication because she has been so anxious he might turn up again. On the rampage: Andrew Brooks, 43, has been jailed after he destroyed large parts of a  £150,000 Lake District cottage with a chainsaw after his wife Bridget left him . Kitchen: Brooks began slicing at everything he could see with the aim of reducing the value of the house after it was handed to his wife . Lounge: The father-of-two hacked at two log burners in the house in his trail of destruction last year, which has left him in prison . Revenge: Despite being to blame for the breakdown of their marriage Brooks decided to continue to abuse his wife by destroying their home when it was put in her name . After the house was put in his wife's name he went berserk and chopped it up with a chainsaw. The father-of-two had been desperate for revenge and wanted to knock thousands off the value of the rural property after the collapse of the couple's 14-year marriage. During his £9,000 rampage, Brooks damaged the front and rear external doors to the property, three internal doors and an internal beam, two woodburning stoves, several cupboards and a fireplace. At Preston Crown Court, Brooks, now of Eccles, Greater Manchester pleaded guilty to criminal damage and was jailed for 46 weeks. These pictures of the aftermath of the rampage were shown to Judge Jacqueline Beech, who sent him to prison. She told him: 'This was an act of revenge or retribution against your former wife who had the courage to leave the abusive relationship she was in with you'. During the course of that relationship you were physically and emotionally abusive to her and you made her life a misery. Entry: After his ex-wife changed the locks Brooks cut his way in to the cottage through this door by slashing a hole in its bottom panel . Deliberate act: The former soldier had slashed through the majority of the house's doors before the police arrived after neighbours saw him wandering around with a chainsaw . Abuse: Brooks also drove the chainsaw through several cupboards in the house as part of a revenge attack on his ex-wife Bridget . The judge said: 'You were aggrieved about the separation and the sale of the house and equity. You wanted to reduce the value and prospective of a sale by causing damage to it. She has suffered anxiety, panic attacks since the separation from you and has been prescribed medication and has anxiety because by the uncertainty of when you might turn up.' She said reports alleged Brooks had shown 'no remorse' and that he 'continued to blame his wife for the current circumstances'. She added: 'This was a pre-planned offence involving you taking a chainsaw to your former matrimonial home to wreak revenge upon your wife. It was part of the continuing course of conduct whilst there was a restraining order. 'The circumstances of this offence and value of damage caused, means an immediate prison sentence is inevitable. Your conduct was towards the mother of your children.' Earlier the court heard the couple split up in September 2011 and in May 2014 at the matrimonial court, an order was made transferring ownership of the property to Mrs Brooks' name. But Mrs Brooks was said to have had concerns that her former husband would take steps to reduce the value of the property, which was at the time vacant, in revenge for her being awarded the house. As a result the locks on the door were changed and the keys were deposited at the police station so that entry could only be gained by going to the station. The house insurance was also increased by Mrs Brooks. Days later Brooks was seen by a neighbour at the rear of his former address walking around the garden with the chainsaw. He was seen taking the chainsaw in order to remove the panel of the PVC door. He was to say that he had lost his keys and did not want to change the locks before using the chainsaw to gain access into the property. Attack: Brooks damaged the front and rear external doors to the property, pictured, three internal doors, two woodburning stoves, several cupboards and a fireplace . Flagrant: Brooks even took his chainsaw to the the beams of the pretty Lake District cottage after becoming bitter about the break-up . Indiscriminate: The former soldier took the chainsaw to the majority of external and internal doors, reminiscent of terrifying scenes from Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining where star Jack Nicholson hacks through them with an axe. Brooks had been previously handed a restraining order in September 2012 following two offences of harassment and then two further charges of harassment where he received a community order. The court was told that he had been residing in Manchester with his new partner and his eldest son who he was tutoring in the run up to his GCSEs. It is believed his younger son lives with his mother. In mitigation, Mr Alexander Langhorn asked for his sentence to be suspended and for him to be credited for his early plea. He said that upon leaving school at 16 Brooks had worked in a number of fields including mechanics before joining the Armed Forces serving with a distinction in a number of areas throughout the world. But upon the birth of his second son he left and had worked as a landscape gardener. He added that his client had been 'a positive role model'. Mr Langhorn said: 'He had been very much part of his children's lives and wanted to do the best for them. He knows he has put them at risk. He has been tutoring his son throughout the year, he knows that anything he does now, any sentence he faces, the impact is not only on him but also on his family. It places a double weight.' He added that he was 'a hard worker and provider' and that he had been involved in the community based Dalton Carnival. 'He is a man who goes out of his way to help others.' Brooks must also pay a victim surcharge of £100. The restraining order will run until further notice.","Andrew Brooks, 43, has been jailed for 46 weeks and given a restraining order for attack on £150,000 cottage .

"The year was 1902 and the rich of London lived in peace and prosperity in a city which was the financial centre of the world. But just yards from where the upper classes of the capital resided in opulence, the poor scratched an existence in chronic misery in East End slums. Disguised as a stranded sailor, American journalist Jack London took to the streets of Whitechapel to document the struggles of London's destitute, in what is believed to be the earliest contemporary account of life on the city’s streets. He wrote The People of the Abyss (1903) based on his first-hand account of living in the East End for several months the previous year, sometimes staying in workhouses or sleeping on the streets. In eighty-six days he gathered an enormous amount of material, read hundreds of books and thousands of pamphlets, newpapers, and Parliamentary reports, composed his book, typed it all out, took two-thirds of the photographs with his own camera. The conditions he experienced and wrote about were the same as those endured by an estimated 500,000 of the contemporary London poor. Now the seminal work has been republished as handbound box set.

"Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, has been compared to Jimmy Savile by a senior BBC manager in advance of a probe into the latest Top Gear incident . The BBC launched an astonishing attack on Jeremy Clarkson yesterday, comparing him to sex offender Jimmy Savile and urging him to check into rehab. Blaming the now notorious ‘fracas’ with a Top Gear producer on ‘personal issues’, one of the most senior Corporation executives said Clarkson was ‘self-destructing’ and needed help. Most controversially, the TV chief, who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident, likened Clarkson’s supporters – including the Prime Minister – to those who turned a blind eye to Savile’s appalling crimes. Last night, friends of the 54-year-old presenter expressed disbelief that the BBC should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy has even begun. ‘I am in total shock that someone at the BBC would attack their own talent and deliberately smear Jeremy,’ said Perry McCarthy, who was Top Gear’s mysterious test driver The Stig. The broadside came as further details of the alleged assault on producer Oisin Tymon emerged. One report claimed Clarkson split Tymon’s lip with a punch, leaving him needing hospital treatment. Other sources told this newspaper that Clarkson had not been drinking – and that the row was not entirely about the lack of a hot meal at the end of a day’s filming. But the most astonishing development came during a wide-ranging official briefing given to The Mail on Sunday by a senior BBC figure. The executive likened 36-year-old Tymon’s position to that of Savile’s victims, who feared they would not be believed while he was alive. ‘The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,’ he said, adding that Clarkson’s support from high-level politicians recalled the way Savile was once defended. ‘If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile’s a real talent, Maria Miller saying Savile will be Savile.’ The comparison will inevitably anger Savile’s victims. Conservative MP Conor Burns, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said that ‘it is not just patently absurd, it’s also deeply offensive to Jeremy Clarkson and those innocent people who were horribly abused by Savile’. The BBC executive also said that attempts to suggest the ‘fracas’ was part of a wider battle between Clarkson and Danny Cohen, the BBC’s powerful director of television, were misleading. Clarkson is said to have a difficult relationship with Cohen, who told him that he was on a final warning after a string of controversies. ‘People keep saying that this is a case of Danny Cohen v Jeremy Clarkson. It is not,’ said the executive. ‘This is Jeremy Clarkson v Jeremy Clarkson… . ‘Jeremy is self-destructing. Danny is not the person who is driving this, it is Jeremy.’ Referring to the Top Gear host’s much-publicised split from his wife Frances after 21 years, the BBC chief added: ‘It is common knowledge he has personal issues; we have all read about them. ‘If I was advising him I would take one of two options. Do what he is doing now and continue to try to play it down – or I would go into rehab and show the world I am trying to change. ‘The BBC has stood by him before when he has been in hot water… But this is more serious.’ BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen, pictured, is said to have a difficult relationship with Jeremy Clarkson . The BBC producer involved in the 'fracas' with Jeremy Clarkson is privately terrified he is going to lose his job, sources claimed. Oisin Tymon has been working on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005 and has also been an assistant producer on BBC One’s The One Show. But the 36-year-old has been in hiding all week, when it emerged he had been punched by the presenter. One insider close to his legal team at Slater and Gordon described Tymon as ‘mortified’. 'He is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years. All he wants to do is to get back to work,' they told the Sunday Mirror. 'He is mortified by the whole thing.' BBC sources have claimed that Top Gear would survive without Clarkson as other shows – including Have I Got News For You and Strictly Come Dancing – have coped with the loss of a much-loved presenter. They added about Tymon: 'We would hope he will continue to be employed by the BBC after this matter is resolved.' Clarkson is being represented by law firm Olswang, which refused to comment. As the row intensified, sources in the Clarkson camp gave The Mail on Sunday what they say is the most definitive account yet of the events leading to the hotel incident. Contrary to what has been widely reported, they insisted the presenter had not been drinking beforehand – although co-presenter James May downed a bottle of white wine. Neither did Clarkson explode with anger at the hotel just because he couldn’t have an expensive steak. ‘Yes, it is true that there was no supper but he was angry because they didn’t have enough producers during the day and it made filming extremely difficult,’ said one source. Others close to the star – who has been suspended by the BBC – accurately predicted the Corporation would cast him as a man careering ‘off the rails’. Even so, the depth of the attack, and the personal nature of the comments, will surprise many – especially as, until now, the Corporation has been careful to limit its comments ahead of the inquiry. The executive’s comments drew a furious reaction from Clarkson supporters. Perry McCarthy added: ‘This will be a nightmare for Jeremy and he will feel deeply concerned that someone at the Corporation has spoken his name in the same sentence as that disgusting creature Jimmy Savile. ‘It is ill-conceived, as was the decision to suspend him and take Top Gear off the air. Jeremy is a brilliant broadcaster and a fantastic guy. ‘It’s atrocious that these idiots at the BBC are paid so much money but run it about as well as a three-year-old child.’ Clarkson is accused of punching TV producer Oisin Tymon, pictured, after a day's filming in Yorkshire . Clarkson, May and Richard Hammond had been filming in Surrey all day before the incident. They left at just after 6pm for a two-and-half-hour helicopter flight to the luxury Simonstone Hall hotel in the Yorkshire Dales. On board, May drank a bottle of wine, but Clarkson drank nothing as he had to work on a script later that evening. A senior BBC source has reportedly told people that Clarkson's much publicised split from his wife Frances, left, could be behind his melt-down . Filming had been fraught because of the shortage of producers and Clarkson was tired, annoyed and hungry, having had nothing to eat all day, the sources say. And it was against this background, that they arrived at the hotel to be told there was no hot supper. What happened next will have to be established by the BBC’s inquiry. It is not thought that Clarkson will dispute ranting at Tymon. But he is already said to deny calling him a ‘lazy Irish ****’. One account will claim the presenter went nose-to-nose with Tymon and said: ‘You’ll be on the dole tomorrow. ‘I’m going to make sure you will not have a job.’ The executive who briefed The Mail on Sunday said: ‘ [Tymon] could be in hospital because of this. ‘He is watching it all play out. Jeremy is a bit more used to it. I don’t think Jeremy has got the most to lose. ‘He has got the money to see him out through his days if he needs to. The other guy [Tymon] is just a jobbing producer.’ Insiders say the BBC – which holds the rights to the lucrative Top Gear format – is prepared to continue making the show even if it means getting a new presenter or presenters. They say other shows, such as Have I Got News For You, survived the departure of a host and there was no reason Top Gear could not do the same. Sources said the BBC remained the best place for a fearless motoring programme, because it was not beholden to advertisers. Yesterday Clarkson looked downcast as he left his West London apartment. He declined to comment but told journalists: ‘You must be freezing.’ The BBC claims that Top Gear will survive if Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, is no longer involved in the show . The BBC disciplinary panel will be led by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland, who carried out the investigation into Newsnight’s false exposé of Lord McAlpine. Clarkson started the disciplinary process himself when he told his bosses at the BBC about the row. Meanwhile, a petition to reinstate Clarkson has gathered more than 920,000 signatures. The Prime Minister appeared to lend his support when he described Clarkson as a ‘friend’ and ‘huge talent’, adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved so his children would not be left ‘heartbroken’. Clarkson is scheduled to appear alongside May and Hammond at four live shows in Norway later this month. All three presenters’ contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs. The last three episodes of the series have been put on hold. Tonight’s show has been replaced with a documentary about the Red Arrows.","A senior BBC TV executive has launched an attack on Jeremy Clarkson .

"Jigsaw enthusiasts  each have their own method of tackling a tricky puzzle - some start with the edges while others work sections of the image at a time. But the latest design will test even the most methodical puzzler. Each of the 1,000 pieces in the '1000 Colours' puzzle is a completely different colour to the next and they have to be placed according to the CMYK system. '1000 Colours'  (show) was designed by illustrator Clemens Habicht. Each of its 1,000 pieces are a different colour on the CMYK system. CMYK refers to cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) inks used in printing . CMYK refers to the four inks typically used in colour printing - cyan, magenta, yellow, and key or black. The puzzle was designed by Paris-based graphic artist Clemens Habicht. Mr Habicht said: 'The idea came from enjoying the subtle differences in the blue of a sky in a particularly brutal jigsaw puzzle. 'I found that without the presence of image detail to help locate a piece, I was relying only on an intuitive sense of colour.

'Unlike ordinary puzzles where you are in effect redrawing a specific picture from a reference, you have a sense of where every piece belongs compared to every other piece,' Mr Habicht said . 'And this was much more satisfying to do than the areas with image details.' And despite being touted as the world's most difficult puzzle, Mr Habicht said it is easier than it first appear. 'What is strange is that unlike ordinary puzzles where you are in effect redrawing a specific picture from a reference, you have a sense of where every piece belongs compared to every other piece,' he said. The completed puzzle measures 19 inches (50cm) by 27 inches (70cm) and it costs $70 AUD (£36). Limited numbers of the jigsaw are available from Australian company Lamington Drive . The current run of 1000 Colour (pieces pictured) is the second edition of the puzzle. It first went on sale last year, and the firm said it is working on producing a third . It had previously been thought the human eye couldn't see infrared light. However, researchers have revealed that under certain conditions, the retina can sense infrared light after all. An international team of researchers used cells from the retinas of mice and people. By firing powerful lasers that emit pulses of infrared light, the researchers found that  light-sensing cells in the retina sometimes get a double hit of infrared energy. When that happens, the eye is able to detect light that falls outside the visible spectrum. 'There is a real logic in doing that. It is weirdly soothing and therapeutic. 'As each piece clicks perfectly into place, just so, it's a little win - like a little pat on the back.' The completed puzzle measures 19 inches (50cm) by 27 inches (70cm).

Attorney Jerryl Christmas told reporters on Monday that he met with Williams for two hours but police wouldn't allow him to take pictures . In a mugshot of Williams released on Sunday his face and neck appeared to have several cuts and bruises, although Christmas didn't make clear if those were the injuries he was referencing. Williams had appeared briefly in court on Monday morning . without counsel and did not enter a plea. He is charged with two . counts of first-degree assault, a class A felony that calls for . 10-30 years, or up to life in prison. The shooting was the latest violent incident in months of . demonstrations in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, after a white . police officer fatally shot unarmed black teen Michael Brown . during a confrontation in August. In announcing Williams's arrest on Sunday, St. Louis County . Prosecutor Robert McCulloch told reporters Williams had admitted . firing the shots that wounded the officers early on Thursday and . told authorities he was not shooting at police. 'With regard to the allegations that Jeffrey Williams was . 'beaten' by police, the St. Louis County Police Department calls . these allegations completely false,' spokesman Brian Schellman . said in a statement. Schellman said Williams was taken immediately to St. Louis County Police headquarters after his arrest, interviewed by detectives on video and audio, booked and evaluated by a nurse as every inmate is, to determine if he is fit to be confined. Shooting: Police take cover after two officers were shot while standing guard in front of the Ferguson Police Station last Thursday . Christmas said Williams was taken into custody on a . probation warrant and did not know he was being arrested until . he was taken for questioning. No one responded Monday at the Williams address listed in . court records, a one-story blue house that had trash strewn on . the lawn. Neighbors declined to comment. Police had called the shooting an 'ambush' of the officers, . who were standing side by side, by a gunman embedded with . protesters, but McCulloch said on Sunday that Williams may have . been shooting at someone else. Several long-time activists have said they did not recognize . or know Williams as a protester. 'Clearly this was not a police ambush and police were never . the target,' Christmas said, adding: 'It could have easily been . the protesters who got shot instead of the police.' The shooting of the officers followed a flurry of resignations and protests in the week after the U.S. JusticeDepartment released a damning report accusing Ferguson of racially biased policing. Wounded: In the shooting early on Thursday, a 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound. Another officer, 32, suffered a facial wound. Above, one of the officers  is seen being taken away by EMT . In announcing Williams's arrest on Sunday, St. Louis CountyProsecutor Robert McCulloch told reporters Williams had admittedfiring the shots that wounded the officers early on Thursday andtold authorities he was not shooting at police . The Justice Department, which launched an investigation . after Brown's shooting, found pervasive racial bias in . Ferguson's policing and municipal court practices. Its police . force is mostly white while two-thirds of residents are black. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, its city manager and . its municipal court judge have resigned. Williams, who had been on probation for possession of stolen . property, is accused of firing shots from a car just as a rally . after Jackson's resignation was breaking up. Demonstrations erupted into arson and looting after Brown's . shooting in August and again in November when a grand jury . declined to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson. Police drew criticism for mass arrests and use of gas . canisters, rubber bullets and armored vehicles in the days after . Brown's shooting, a response officials said was needed to quell . the unrest. A U.S. District judge on Monday allowed a federal civil . rights lawsuit filed by people arrested in August to continue. The lawsuit names Ferguson, St. Louis County, the chiefs of both . departments and other officers as defendants. St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said he believed the 20-year-old suspect attended last week's protest before the shooting happened. Activists said Williams was not a consistent fixture in their tight-knit group. 'We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,' McCulloch said of Williams' contention that he did not fire at the officers. Williams is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action. He made a brief court appearance Monday, and the case was scheduled for a later date. Court officials said he did not yet have an attorney. Williams' arrest came as anti-police protesters (pictured) have resumed demonstrations outside Ferguson police station . McCulloch said there may have been other people in the vehicle with Williams and that the investigation is ongoing. Williams used a handgun that matches the shell casings at the scene, McCulloch said. He also said tips from the public led to the arrest. Williams is being held on $300,000 bond. Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest leader with the group Millennial Activists United, had just left a meeting with other leaders Sunday when word of the arrest circulated. She said no one in the group knew Williams, and they checked with other frequent protesters, who also had not heard of him. Ferrell suspected McCulloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement. 'This is a fear tactic,' she said. 'We are very tight-knit. We know each other by face if not by name, and we've never seen this person before.' John Gaskin, a St. Louis NAACP leader, said of Williams, 'I don't know him. I've never seen him.'","Attorney Jerryl Christmas said his client was beaten when he was taken into custody, an allegation police called 'completely false'

"After decades in the doldrums, eggs appear to have a cracking future. Consumption rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014, which equates to an extra 700,000 that are boiled, scrambled and fried every day of the week. It is a remarkable resurgence for the egg, which has suffered from a series of health scares and changes in food fashion since the 1950s when the nation was happy to ‘Go to work on an egg’. The revival is being attributed to the fact they form a central part of protein-rich diets such at Atkins and Paleo, which promise weight loss and even a longer life. Consumption of eggs rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014, the equivalent of 700,000 extra a day. Experts are crediting the revival with the rise of protein-rich diets including Atkins and Paleo . As a result, egg sales are now finally back to the levels seen in the 1980s when the former Tory health minister Edwina Currie infamously labelled them a health threat because of salmonella contamination. That attack fuelled existing concerns about eggs, which were also being demonised by doctors for containing high levels of cholesterol, which was wrongly assumed to fur up the arteries. However, the egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens, with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g, which is a third of the recommended daily limit. At the same time, Vitamin D, which is vital for healthy bones, is up by 64 per cent compared to a decade ago. The net result is that eggs are now being actively promoted as a health food given they are also full of the protein, vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids that are vital to a healthy body. Until 2009, Britons were warned against eating more than three eggs a week because of the worries about cholesterol – but this warning has now been junked. Research by experts at University of Surrey found overweight people given two eggs a day as part of a reduced calorie diet lost weight and saw no increase in blood cholesterol levels. If you are looking for a loan, serving your bank manager breakfast might just do the trick. A compound found in eggs makes people much more generous, new research suggests. Scientists say that tryptophan, an amino acid found in some foods, can change our behaviour. In experiments they found that consuming a small portion of tryptophan - the equivalent of that found in three eggs - doubled the sum volunteers gave to charity. Eggs and other foods such as fish and milk are rich in tryptophan, an amino acid that is converted in the body into the feel-good chemical serotonin. And the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has recently recommended that limitations on consumption of cholesterol found in eggs should be removed from official health guidelines. It stated: ‘Cholesterol is not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.’ A spokesman for the British Egg Information Service said: ‘Health professionals’ recognition of their health benefits, and the end of the confusion over their effect on cholesterol, mean eggs are now being widely recommended as part of a healthy diet. ‘They are also included in all major slimming plans, from established groups such as Weight Watchers and Slimming World, to more recent trends such as the Atkins and Paleo diets.’ Egg consumption has also been boosted by the trend to eat breakfast at dinner under the rise of the ‘Brinner’ – a trend that has been imported from America. In total, 32 million eggs were eaten every day in the UK in 2014, equivalent to 11.7 billion throughout the whole year. ‘Consumption from retail purchases exceeded six billion for the first time in 2014, having grown 16 per cent in the past five years,’ said the spokesman, adding that consumption had returned to levels last seen before the salmonella crisis of the late 1980s. The details were reported by Farmers Weekly, which said sales have also been helped by supermarket promotions and price cuts. Data obtained from retail analyst Kantar Worldpanel shows that, in the 52 weeks to the end of February, the GB retail market for eggs was up 2.4 per cent in volume terms. The egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens, with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g, which is a third of the recommended daily limit . However, the supermarket price cuts meant the actual value of these sales fell by a significant 4.8 per cent to £768m. Andrew Joret, chairman of the British Egg Industry Council, said he anticipated another year of rising consumption in 2015, pointing to the sector’s first TV advertising in 10 years, as well as a new Main Meals in Minutes recipe campaign fronted by fitness entrepreneur and celebrity Lucy Mecklenburgh. A fan of the Brinner trend, she said: ‘I’ll often eat eggs for dinner when I get home from a work out in the evening. They are quick, nutritious and not to mention tasty.’ The British Lion eggs TV advertising campaign featured commercials by Oscar winning Tom Hooper, director of The King’s Speech. It was launched alongside the eggrecipes.co.uk website, which offers advice on everything from how to boil an egg to get a soft runny centre to more exotic soufflé frittatas, flamenco eggs and desserts.","Consumption rose by 2.4% in 2014, the equivalent of an extra 700,000 a day .

"A 13-year-old from France is believed to be the youngest to die fighting for Islamic State in Syria. Abu Bakr al-Faransi, originally from Strasbourg, was killed when Government forces attacked a border post he was guarding, it has been reported. According to David Thomson, a French journalist and author of Les Français jihadistes (The French Jihadists), al-Faransi died two months ago. Scroll down for video . Young jihadi: Abu Bakr al-Faransi is believed to be the youngest French child to die fighting for ISIS in Syria . Islamic State: It is believed Abu Bakr al-Faransi arrived in Syria with his family and died two months ago while guarding a border post in the western city of Homs . Mr Thomson said he arrived in Syria with his family and two of his brothers have been killed in fighting. Several sources said the boy was killed while guarding a border post in  the western city of Homs when it was attacked by the Syrian Army, Mr Thomson posted on Twitter. Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said: 'The 'al Faransi' moniker shows that like 'al Britanni', IS want to rub it in for all of us in Europe that our young people continue to be drawn to them, as martyrs from the IS viewpoint, or like rabbits to car headlights from ours. 'This chap got killed, that's the bottom line. What an appalling waste of a young life. 'The government's riposte should be that if IS have to rely on young kids to fight for them, they're really beginning to scrape the bottom of the barrel. 'It also shows that young Muslims are targets of IS recruitment, whether from Bethnal Green or from a French banlieu.' Syrian army: Several sources said the boy was killed while guarding a border post in Homs when it was attacked by the Syrian Army . Schoolgirls: Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum left the UK for Turkey to make their way to Syria to join ISIS . Mr Glees added: 'We undoubtedly need to work together with our European allies to reverse this deeply worrying trend; the first step is to recognise that it exists. The second is to ensure that those who are helping IS are told to stop it.' It's believed that three missing British schoolgirls who fled to Syria to join ISIS are in a house in the city of Raqqa. Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase went missing two weeks ago after boarding a flight from Gatwick to Istanbul. The girls are believed to have crossed from Turkey to Syria through the town of Arai. At the weekend, Sky News reporter Stuart Ramsay said: ‘We are told by very good sources in Raqqa that they are there and that they are under the control of Islamic State.’ He also revealed that they were staying with a British girl – thought to be a pupil from their school who went missing in December and is believed to have joined IS. The 15-year-old student, the first to disappear from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, has not been identified by the authorities. At least 22 young women are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months.","Abu Bakr al-Faransi believed to be youngest to die fighting for ISIS in Syria .

"Around 200 mysterious stone structures have mystified experts since they were discovered in the Gobi Desert in 2003. Known as the ‘strange stone circles’ by locals in Turpan, the formations vary in size and shape with one intricate example resembling the sun. And now an expert has suggested they could have been used by primitive nomads to worship the sun, and may have even been a site where sacrifices were made - although the types of sacrifices is not known. Scroll down for video . Around 200 mysterious stone circles have mystified experts since they were discovered in the Gobi Desert in 2003. The largest structure in this image is known as the sun circle. An expert has suggested they could have been used by nomads to worship the sun, and may have even been a site where sacrifices were made . There are similarities between the Chinese stones and Stonehenge in Wiltshire. This includes the formations being linked with sun worshippers, the shape of the structures including so-called 'exits', and the fact the stones were transported to the site from outside the region. The circles are located in the Flaming Mountain in Turpan, north west China and cover more than two-and-a-half square miles (6.6 square km). They have been filmed from above using a drone by a local tourism association, in an attempt to further understand the structures and their origins, People’s Daily Online reported. Experts said that the stone circles are in line with local historical traditions but very little is known about them, including their age. Some people had assumed that they were burial sites and attempted to dig them up. The mysterious collection of circles and squares have been filmed from above using a drone by a local tourism association, in an attempt to further understand the structures and their origins. A aerial shot is shown. If they were used as sacrificial sites, the type of sacrifices is not known . The circles are located in the Flaming Mountain in Turpan, north west China, a matter of miles from Lianmuqin town (marked) and cover more than two-and-a-half square miles (6.6 square km) Similar formations were found in Burkhan Khaldun mountain in north Mongolia and archaeologists have even suggested these Mongolian rocks could help pinpoint the location of Genghis Khan's tomb. This view is shared by Dr Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Bristol. He told MailOnline: 'First of all, they are man-made; there is no doubt about it. 'I have seen similar features in neighbouring Mongolia where they are well known too [and] they are regarded as ritual features. One particular stone circle is known as the ‘Sun Circle’ (pictured) and is formed by four concentric circles, the largest of which measures 26 ft (eight metres) in diameter, with the smallest inner ring destroyed . The stone structures are built on high points of the land and some are square, with ‘exits’ to combine certain shapes (pictured). A lack of evidence of bodies at the sites has led one expert to rule out that the formations are burial sites, instead claiming they were sacrificial worship sites for ancient nomadic people . No-one is sure what the mysterious stone 'walls' were used for. Some people thought they may be ancient burial sites, but no bodies have been found nearby and the soil beneath the circles and squares is said to be undisturbed. The largest of the shapes, which features four concentric circles may have been the focus of sacrifices to a sun god. Dr Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Bristol said its likely the structures are burial sites. But a local unnamed expert believes they were used for making sacrifices to the sun god thousands of years ago. There is no precise date for the structure, but Dr Heyd added the first of these Gobi stone structures might date back as early as the Bronze Age. Although the more complex formations are likely 'younger and could have been constructed until the Medieval period.' 'Some might have served as surface marking of burial places. At least in Mongolia, excavations have occasionally found graves in the centre of such features. 'Others, if not the majority might denote holy places in the landscape, or places with special spiritual properties, or ritual offering/meeting places.' He continued that the first of these Gobi stone structures might date back as early as the Bronze Age. This could make them up to 4,500 years old. Although the more complex formations are likely 'younger and could have been constructed until the Medieval period.' However, a local specialist told Yahoo this is unlikely because the soil beneath them is undisturbed. The stone formations are built on high points of the land and some are square, with ‘exits’. One particular stone circle is known as the ‘Sun Circle’ and is formed by four concentric circles - the largest of which measures 26 ft (eight metres) in diameter, with the smallest inner ring destroyed. On the southeast of the Sun Circle there are a multiple circles of different sizes. Because of the shape of this particular circle, and a lack of evidence of bodies at the sites, the unnamed local expert told Yahoo the circles were likely to have been sacrificial worship sites for ancient nomadic people - although he didn’t elaborate on what may have been sacrificed. The stone circles have been compared to Stonehenge in Wiltshire (pictured), whose origins and purpose remains largely a mystery, with some experts suggesting it too was used to worship the sun . The rocks used in the structures in China (pictured) are not from the desert where the circles are located, suggesting that they were brought from afar, much like Stonehenge’s famous bluestones . 'Across central Asia these circles are usually sacrificial sites,’ he said. ‘We can image that this was a site for worshipping the god of the sun.' He explained that the circles are all located on higher ground, which fits the selection conditions for ancient worship ceremonies. The stone circles may be compared to Stonehenge in Wiltshire, whose origins and purpose remains largely a mystery, with some experts suggesting it too was used to worship the sun. Scattered across Jordan are 12 giant circular structures that can only be fully seen using aerial and satellite images. Known collectively as the Big Circles, the vast rings - which range from between 720ft and 1,490ft (220 metres to 455 metres) in diameter - were first spotted from the air in the 1920s, and surveys in 1930, 1953 and 2002 have since revealed more details about their size, shape and locations. Archaeologists from Western Australia have documented 12 of them to try and learn more about their purpose. A total of eight big circles have been recorded in west central Jordan, between the Wadi el-Hasa and the edge of the Shara escarpment. There is also a second group, made of four Big Circles, just north of Azraq Oasis. Pictured is circle J1, known locally as Qasr Abu el-Inaya. It is located 2.4 miles (4km) west of the Hedjaz Railway and Desert Highway . There are eight Big Circles in west central Jordan, a second group, made of four Big Circles just north of Azraq Oasis. Plus, a more recent Big Circle spotted in 2002 near Homs in Syria. Like the mysterious structures in China, their construction is simple and typically consists of low walls of uncut boulders. However, they are incredibly precise and because they are so large, would have involved teams of workers. Professor David Kennedy from the university, said an ‘architect’ would have plotted the circles using rope tied to a post in the centre . ‘Some show signs of greater care with stones at least roughly shaped and laid in courses’ he added. Dating is also said to be problematic, but there is often material in or around the circles that originated in the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age (between 2,000 to 4,500BC). A number of the circles contain later material, typically dating to the Roman period between 1st and 7th century BC. In another parallel, the rocks at the site in China are not from the desert where the circles are located, suggesting that they were brought from afar, just like Stonehenge’s famous bluestones. The sun circle itself is made from over 200 of these mysterious stones. Although not identical, due to their much more complex design, geoglyphs in Peru have equally baffled experts about the practices of ancient groups. More commonly known as the Nazca Lines, they were first spotted in 1939 when a pilot flew over the Nasca planes of the Peruvian coastal highlands. They were designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1994 and the area stretches more than 50 miles (80km) between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, about 400 km south of Lima. Experts have said that the stone circles (pictured) are in line with local historical traditions, but very little is known about them, including their age . The circles and squares (pictured) are all located on higher ground, which fits the selection conditions for ancient worship ceremonies . Contrary to the popular belief that the figures can only be seen from the air, they are actually visible from the surrounding foothills. Paul Kosok, from Long Island University, is credited as the first scholar to seriously study the Nazca Lines. He discovered that the lines converged at the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. Along with Maria Reiche, a German mathematician and archaeologist, Kosok proposed the figures were markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other celestial bodies rose.

"A tiny puppy who was found covered in 2kg of matted, petrol-coated fur after being abandoned has found a loving new home. Bentley, a white Shih Tzu, was so timid when first taken into vets' care he flinched whenever a human tried to touch him. A team of vets spent five hours shaving off the thick matted fur from his coat after he was dumped at the West Yorkshire Dog Rescue by an owner who 'couldn't bear to touch him.' Scroll down for video . Bentle was found covered in 2kg of matted, petrol-coated fur after being heartlessly abandoned by his former owner . But the neglected pet surprised rescue centre staff after a new family were able to turn him from terrified terrier to a bouncy fun-loving puppy. It was love at first sight for Matthew and Catherine Stroh, from Skipton, North Yorkshire who have now taken Bentley home - weeks before rescue centre staff believed the dog would be re-homed. Rescuer Kathy Trout said: 'He was flinching from the human hand - he suddenly seems to have brought himself round into trusting people again. The Shih Tzu is completely unrecognisable after vets shaved off his matted fur and his found happiness with a new family . Bentley has been rehomed after being abandoned and covered in 2kg of petrol covered matted fur, by the Stroh family from Long Preston, North Yorkshire: (L-R) Harvey (13) -  mother Catherine - father Matt and  Oliver, 10 with their other little dogs  Dexter (Lhasa Apso) and Daisy (Cavapoo) Vets had to sedate the dog to be able to shave off the mass of smelly, petrol-coated fur he arrived with . 'The surprising thing is that Bentley was so incredibly affectionate with the family, especially Matthew. When I took him on a few weeks ago he was so frightened and biting me - it was fear aggression. The neglected dog, pictured with Catherine Stroh, has been given a new lease of life with his new family . 'But he seems to adore these people and their children. He's gone from a mess of a dog and a shell of himself to a really confident, bouncy thing.' Accountant Matthew, 43, said Bentley settled right in with the family and even sits at the front window waiting to welcome new people to the house. 'He's a little daddy's boy. He seemed to take to us straight away. He was all over me. 'I'm thrilled we could give him a new home, especially after what he had been through. He's very happy a settled with us. 'He still seems very puppy like. The children love playing ball with him - he just wants attention and to be loved.' Matthew and wife Catherine, 45, have sons Harvey, 13, and 10-year-old Oliver, as well as three-year-old Lhasa Apso Dexter and Cavapoo Daisy, also three. Matthew added: 'He even sits at the window waiting for people to come to the door. 'He's come so far out of his shell - he's nothing like the dog in those horrible pictures of him all matted and covered in petrol.' Vets had spent hours shaving off the matted, petrol-coated fur when Bentley first arrived to the rescue centre. He then had to be sedated to allow them to put a jacket over his tiny body to keep him warm. Bentley the Shih Tzu arrived at a dog rescue centre in Meltham, West Yorkshire, with fur so matted vets spent five hours shaving two kilograms of it off . Bentley's condition was so dire when he arrived at the centre, owner Kathy Trout was reduced to tears . Rescuer Kathy Trout said she had been reduced to tears by his condition. 'His coat was so covered in petrol, she said, a drink of water may have poisoned him if any fur had got in his mouth,' she said. 'He came into our rescue from a member of the public. His fur was very, very long and matted like felt and all his legs were like tree trunks with chemical smelling fur. 'It looked like he was thick with oil, fuel or petrol. He really, really stank. When Bentley arrived at the centre, his previous owner could not touch him, said Mrs Trout. Petrol and oil that was staining his coat meant the dog, who had never been groomed, gave off a strong stench . After spending time recovering at the centre, Bentley has overcome his fear of interaction with humans, and plays happily with the other dogs in its care . 'Cases like this keep me awake at night and in tears - we are not trained to handle the emotional strain of taking in rescue dogs.' His owner, who arrived in a 'shiny 4x4' could not even bear to pick him up, she added. 'She handed him over on a lead because she wouldn't even touch him. It is clear he has never been groomed.' 'It's wonderful to see him so happy again,' she added. The dog would not allow any carers to remove a fleece jacket for weeks after they had put it on to keep him warm . Bentley has now fully recovered thanks to his loving new owner Catherine Stroh and her family, from North Yorkshire . Kathy Trout said caring for abandoned and abused dogs was a difficult job for which nothing can prepare you .","Bentley the Shih Tzu could not be touched when first brought to vets .

"Twenty-one children between four and seven were crowded into a house piled high with garbage and human waste, forced to stand in line for hours for measly scraps that were their only food and were slapped or had their hands sticky-taped together if they tried to get more. When authorities discovered the house in suburban Adelaide in 2008 the children were so malnourished their brains had shrunk, they had open sores and were suffering from scabies. The six adults at the centre of the horrific scene  were convicted of abuse, but one woman never went to prison because a court ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial. Trudy Quinlivan, now 35, was freed under orders that she be closely supervised in the community. But she is now wanted by police for allegedly failing to live up to the conditions of her release, and disappearing. Scroll down for video . A warrant has been issued for the arrest of a woman involved in an Adelaide house of horrors child abuse case where 21 children were found to be living among swarms of cockroaches, flies and maggots and faeces on the floor in 2008 . The South Australian Housing Trust home was uncovered by authorities in 2008 after one of the young boys was taken to the Lyell McEwan Hospital after fainting from malnutrition and hypothermia . Quinlivan was found unfit to stand trial due to mental incompetence in 2011 after she was found to have seriously abused five children living in the Adelaide house seven years ago. She was released into the community on a nine-year supervision order, but the Supreme Court was told on Friday she had breached some of its conditions and was missing. Lucy Boord, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, said Quinlivan had failed to obey the directions of her corrections officer, had twice tested positive to drugs and was not at the address where she was required to live. Her mental health team have not been able to locate her. Justice Ann Vanstone agreed to issue the warrant, requiring her to be brought before the court for a review of her release licence. Quinlivan was one of six people charged over the abuse of the children, aged between four and seven, who were starved to the point of malnutrition and forced to stand in a line for days on end. The five siblings were among 21 children living in the Adelaide house and were fed only scraps of food over a four-month period.

Quinlivan was one of six people charged over the abuse of the children, aged between four and seven, who were starved to the point of malnutrition and forced to stand in a line for days on end . The children, who were underweight, had open sores on their legs, ulcers on their feet and were infected with scabies. Examinations showed their brains had shrunk from the deprivation to basic nutrients, according to The Advertiser. They were forced to stand in line with their hands on their heads and were fed enough to keep them alive, risking being slapped and choked if they tried to move. Their hands were also tied with sticky tape at night to prevent them from obtaining more to eat. Photos of the squalid conditions were released by police and detailed the shocking living environment the children were forced to live in.

Five years after the discovery of the house, the South Australian government released a response to the recommendations made by Child Death and Serious Injury Committee .

Human waste was found amid the piles of clothes, garbage and other refuse in the house where the children were living in shocking conditions . It was alleged by one of the victims of the abuse that a welfare worker from Families SA was aware that the children were living in the squalid conditions, failed to alert authorities. A child protection worker, who is now engaged to a relative of one of the men charged in the case, reportedly visited the house on many occasions, but would not enter and instead sat outside. The welfare worker was not under any legal obligations to report the conditions as she was not officially assigned to any cases involving the property. 'The first couple of times she visited ... she was friends of the adults ... she had been inside the house,' the woman said. 'Other times she came, she would only sit out the front of the house.' Five years after the discovery of the house, the South Australian government released a response to the recommendations made by Child Death and Serious Injury Committee. There was allegedly 'almost no information known about the children to state authorities' until the boy was taken to hospital, according to Committee chairwoman Deej Eszenyi. Different agencies including Families SA had records of the children and Ms Eszenyi said that if the different bodies had shared information more might been done sooner. 'There was a possibility that the house might have been entered before the crimes against these children occurred,' she said.

"Today, the government will release the information that will affect our spending over the next 365 days, leaving Brits tightening their belts accordingly. But for the super rich, the only way their belts are going is super-wide. New research has shown that men and women at the top end of the pay scale will be splashing the cash on clothes and accessories over the next 12 months. New research has shown that men and women at the top end of the pay scale will be splashing the cash in 2015 . British women will spend 43 per cent more on dresses this year than they did in 2014, but the average amount of on a dress by the wealthy has increased from £172 to £245 in the past 12 months. They will also be spending an extra £50 on their favourite pairs of jeans - denim doesn't come cheap and a pair of trousers from brands like Frame Denim and J Brand can now cost £140 a pair. Well-off men aren't immune to the grooming bug either - they are now spending more than women on their favourite pairs of shoes. Britain's wealthy men are spending upwards of £312 on a pair of designer trainers from brands like Balenciaga and Guiseppe Zanotti in 2015, whereas women in the same pay bracket will spend £245 on a pair of luxury heels. The research was compiled by shopping website Lyst, who cater for three million high end customers with more than 9,000 brands like Balenciaga, Alexander Wang and Burberry on their books. With the recession now just a far distant memory for Britain's rich, they have now returned to their favourite designers with gusto. Britain's wealthy women are now spending an average of £248.96 on a designer handbag . And since 2008, new brands have now started to dominate the luxury market like Michael Kors, whose handbags and watches are now a go-to for semi-affordable luxury. The introduction of brands like this has pushed up the average price of a handbag among Britain's wealthy shoppers. The average value spent on a handbag by these shoppers currently sits at £248.96, with US brands Michael Kors, Tory Burch and Marc by Marc Jacobs inspiring most purchases. Coat budgets are also rocketing thanks to the trend for 'statement coats' in the last few years. While most of us would face a dilemma over whether to spend £70 on a new piece of outerwear from Topshop, the moneyed classes spent £250 on average on a new coat last year. This is predicted to increase by 27 per cent this autumn, with shoppers spending £286 on their next winter coat. Now recession is a distant memory, spending on clothes has risen fast (picture posed by model) The summer doesn't bring much relief either, with the expected spend on a new bikini rising to £205. Kalpana Fitzpatrick, founder of MummyMoneyMatters.com said: 'When it comes to spending money, women may well be splashing the cash on designer or high end fashion brands, but women are also better at saving. 'Time and time again, studies have found that women hold the purse strings when it comes to managing the money at home and they are also better at saving and budgeting than their partners.” 'However, although the recession may be a distant memory, many households are still struggling with finances and have not yet achieved a level of comfort they were in pre-recession – so it’s important that people continue to save and budget wisely.'","Now recession is a distant memory, spending on clothes has risen fast .

"Democrats' support is . softening for Hillary Clinton, their party's presumed 2016 . presidential front-runner, with nearly half now in favor of an independent . review of the private email account she used exclusively when she was America's top diplomat. And most Americans now say they don't want to see political retreads running for president. Support for Clinton's candidacy has dropped about 15 . percentage points since mid-February in her own party, with as . few as 45 percent saying they would support her in the last . week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll. Democrats likely to vote in the party primaries, however, backed off their support for her in slightly smaller numbers. Reuters also found that 46 percent of Democrats believe there should be an independent probe of all of Clinton's emails to ensure she turned over . everything work-related when she left the Obama administration. NOT SO FAST: New polls show Hillary Clinton's star is fading and both Democrats and Republicans don't want past presidential candidates to have another bite at the apple . FRESH FACES: Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (left) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (right) are both politically to Hillary's left but have never run for the White House before . There was sizable support among Democrats – 41 per cent – for a congressional effort, backed by Republcians, to force Clinton to testify about the emails. 'Bottom line is if she didn't do anything wrong, she's . fine,' North Carolina resident Renetia Lowery, 48, told Reuters. Lowery is a . Democrat who participated in the poll. Separately, a new Rasmussen Reports poll released Thursday found that 54 per cent of likely U.S. voters from both major parties want to see fresh faces running in the 2016 presidential contet. Among Democrats, just 22 per cent would be satisfied with a candidate who has run before. Fifty-seven per cent disagreed. That could spell trouble for Clinton, a 2008 also-ran who took the silver medal when Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination on his way to the White House. It also bodes ill for other former big political names whose names have been floated as Hillary's star wanes, including former Vice President Al Gore, current Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry. Kerry and Gore were the unsuccessful Democratic nominees in 2004 and 2000, losing to George W. Bush in the general elections. NOT AGAIN? Hillary Clinton came in second among Democratic candidates in 2008, losing the nomination to then-Senator Barack Obama . The scandal that Washington wags have Christened 'email-gate' could ultimately be Clinton's undoing. Even Democrats who said they were not personally swayed one . way or another by the data-security flap told Reuters pollsters that it could lower Clinton's prospects next year. The Reuters online poll sampled opinions of 2,128 adults from March 10 to March 17. Clinton has tried to tamp down accusations that she used her . personal email account to keep her records from public review, . which would support an old political narrative that Clinton and . her husband, former President Bill Clinton, are secretive and . seek to play by a different set of rules. Democratic strategist Ben LaBolt, a former spokesman for . President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, said the email . controversy would help Democrats in the long run by urging Clinton to get serious about running. It's become a 'galvanizing call for the Clinton . campaign-in-waiting to build an organization,' by hiring top . political communicators who can defend her record, LaBolt told Reuters. Clinton is expected . to announce as early as April that she plans to seek the White . House in the November 2016 election. She is expected also to announce a communicatiosn team that includes former congressional and Justice Department spokesman Brian . Fallon, White House aide Jennifer Palmieri and Jesse Ferguson, . who has handled press for Democratic congressional campaigns. Palmieri already has one foot out of the White House. Her replacement, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, will move to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue next month. RETREADS: Al Gore (right) ran in 2000 and lost to Geroge W. Bush after eight years as vice president, and Secretary of State John Kerry (left, with running mate John Edwards)followed suit in 2004 . Clinton told a packed room of reporters this month that she . used her personal email for official business for the sake of . convenience, because it was easier to carry only one device. Clinton's office said she has since turned over paper copies . of more than 30,000 work emails last year at the State . Department's request, but did not hand over about 32,000 that . were private or personal records. Among the emails turned over were 300 related to a 2012 . attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi that led to the death of . a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, which were . subsequently handed over to a Republican-led congressional . committee investigating the incident. The panel has subpoenaed Clinton's remaining emails and said . they would like her to testify on the matter before April. About half of Democrats said they thought Clinton was . composed during the March 10 news conference, but 14 percent . found her evasive and 17 percent said she avoided answering . questions directly. Survey respondent Tom Trevathan, 74, a retired math . professor from Arkansas, said he was 'less than happy' with . Clinton's performance at the news conference. 'It reminds me of a history she has had not responding . thoroughly to inquiries,' Trevathan said. 'If she would be more . open about the situation, and show more leadership in saying . what she did and why, I think it would be better.'","Dems' support for Clinton's 2016 candidacy has dropped 15 percentage points since mid-February, a Reuters poll found .

"A decision over whether to open Britain’s first ‘new’ grammar school in 50 years has been shelved until after the election, it emerged last night. The proposal for an ‘annexe’ to an existing grammar school in Sevenoaks, Kent, is currently being considered by the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. She is awaiting legal advice and was expected to rule on the matter before the election. But last night a Downing Street source said: ‘I do not think there’s going to be a decision on it this side of the election.’ Last month, the Prime Minister said he strongly supported the right of 'good' schools – including grammars – to grow . And if Labour is elected in May then the scheme would almost certainly fail to get the go-ahead. The Tories would probably need an overall majority rather than a Coalition to give the plan a chance of being rubber-stamped. The delay will cause dismay among Tory backbenchers and last night threatened to overshadow an announcement the Prime Minister is due to make today about the Government’s flagship free schools programme. Mr Cameron will announce that the Tories will continue opening free schools – which are independent of local authority control. They hope to set up 500 new free schools over the next Parliament and 270,000 new school places if re-elected. Mr Cameron will go on to say that 49 free schools will open in September, adding: ‘If you vote Conservative, you will see the continuation of the free schools programme at the rate you’ve seen in the last three years.’ The proposal for a grammar school annexe comes from Weald of Kent Grammar School in Tonbridge which wants to open a campus nine miles away in Sevenoaks. In 2013 the plans were rejected by the Department for Education on legal grounds. New grammar schools are banned, but there is backing in the Cabinet for expanding existing schools. And last month Mr Cameron spoke of his enthusiasm for allowing good grammar schools ‘to expand’, in what was seen as an indication that he backed the new plan. However the issue is seen as hugely divisive, so it is believed that election chiefs want to avoid it coming up during the campaign. The Education Secretary Nicky Morgan was preparing to give the go ahead to the new school for girls in Sevenoaks, Kent . The party was previously convulsed by a row over grammars in 2007. At the time, Mr Cameron called them an ‘albatross’, insisting there was a ‘hopelessness’ about calling for new grammars. The party’s Europe spokesman Graham Brady ended up resigning over the row. Last night Mr Brady said: ‘This annexe is clearly wanted by local parents and by Kent County Council. 'The bid has been with the department for months and there is no reason why it cannot be dealt with immediately.’ Free schools raise standards at poorly performing local schools, research has shown. According to think-tank Policy Exchange, the increased competition improves results across communities. George Osborne is considering a pre-election tax cut for 27million voters in the Budget. It would increase the amount workers can earn before they begin paying income tax by at least £200. The income tax personal allowance of £10,000 is to rise to £10,600 in April. But the new increase would take thousands more people out of tax altogether and make the allowance almost £11,000. Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said: ‘George Osborne raised VAT and cut tax credits for working people, while giving millionaires a huge tax cut. This Chancellor gives with one hand but takes much more with the other.’ Next week’s Budget will also give details of a crackdown on loopholes used by multinationals to avoid tax. It could force firms such as Google and Amazon to reveal all overseas earnings.","Nicky Morgan was preparing to give go ahead to new school in  Kent .

"Jailed: Dennis Scott, pictured outside Hull Crown Court on Friday, falsely claimed more than £23,000 . A 65-year-old man who claimed almost £24,000 in benefits despite having £88,000 in the bank has been jailed. Dennis Scott received thousands in pension credits between 2009 and 2014 by falsely claiming that he had less than £4,000 in capital. But a recent house sale meant the grandfather had significantly more money - making him ineligible for the credits, which are intended to guarantee pensioners a minimum income. He claimed the money had been destined for his grandchildren, saying he had wanted to give them a 'better start in life'. Scott, from Barnsholme, East Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to dishonestly making a false statement to the Department of Work and Pensions. He was jailed for eight months at Hull Crown Court on Friday. The court heard the £23,776.16 he falsely claimed had been repaid in full by July last year. Defending, Antony Farrell told the court that Scott was a family man who had wanted to give his grandchildren a better start in life than the one he had been given. Jailing him, Judge Richardson QC said Scott had behaved in a 'shameful fashion'. He said: 'It must be made very clear to you and to anyone like you who is tempted to defraud the state in respect of social security benefits that a prison sentence is likely to follow such conduct. 'Your flagrantly breached that system by your shameful conduct. For a man of your years you ought to know better.' He also noted that Scott had not pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.

"A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have minor ailments including sore throats, athlete's foot and headlice, according to an analysis. It calculates that more than four million visits a year are unnecessary and cost the NHS £290million annually. In the worst cases, doctors have reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients are finding it increasingly difficult to see their GP, particularly out of hours. A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have minor ailments including sore throats, athlete's foot and headlice, a study has found (file picture) Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours. Even Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has admitted taking his children to casualty at the weekend rather than making an appointment with a GP. But the unnecessary visits are adding to the pressures of busy departments and diverting staff from treating patients who are very seriously ill. It all came to a head in January when 13 hospitals declared major internal incidents in a two-day period as they were unable to cope with the numbers coming through the door. An analysis of data from 15 A&E units by the consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of admissions were for what are known as self-treatable conditions. These include coughs, colds, muscle sprains, athlete's foot, headlice or babies with colic. The data covers one in 10 of the A&E units across England so, if the trends are the same, an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has admitted taking his children to casualty at the weekend rather than making an appointment with a GP . Experts are urging patients to keep their medicine cabinets well stocked and to make better use of their pharmacists, where they can be seen and offered advice and treatment. Matthew Speers, chief executive of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain , which represents the manufacturers of over the counter medicines and commissioned the research said: ‘It is vital that the NHS raises awareness of the range of different services available to people and when to access them appropriately. ‘Pharmacists are well placed to provide advice to people with minor conditions, who don’t need to visit the GP or A&E, thereby ensuring they receive the support they need, without diverting NHS resources from people who really need them.’ He added that the NHS was facing a ‘crisis’ because staffing levels and finances were unable to cope with the needs of the steadily rising and aging population. ‘This cannot continue and that’s why we are calling for immediate action.’ But Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, said attempts to divert patients did not work. Dr Mann, an A&E consultant at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, Dorset, added that the ‘A&E brand is well-known and trusted’ so ‘patients will continue to attend’. He said the only solution was to install GP clinics at A&E units so patients with minor ailments could be sent there, leaving staff to deal with the more serious cases. Figures show that 21.7million patients attended A&E in 2013/14, a rise of more than a third in a decade. And the NHS has missed its target for ensuring 95 per cent of patients are dealt with within four hours every week for the last six months. In November, Jeremy Hunt admitted in the Commons he had taken his own children to A&E ‘precisely because I didn’t want to wait until later on to take them to a GP’. ‘If parents have an unwell child who needs medical attention A&E provides a trusted service.’","A fifth of A&E patients have self-treatable conditions such as athlete's foot .

"Alex Salmond yesterday issued a chilling demand for state control of the BBC in Scotland to further the nationalist cause. The former SNP leader, who is standing for Parliament in the election, was accused of a naked attempt to interfere with the Corporation’s independence after saying it had a ‘metropolitan bias’ that works against his party’s cause. In a clear threat, he said broadcasting should be placed ‘under the remit of our democratically-elected parliament in Scotland’. Scroll down for video . Protest: Nationalists wave a 'Sack Nick Robinson' banner in Glasgow in September last year . Mr Salmond, addressing the party’s Spring conference in Glasgow, also said the SNP would form a left-wing alliance with Labour at Westminster to raise the top rate of income tax to 50p. But it was his intemperate attack on the national broadcaster that raised eyebrows. During last year’s independence referendum campaign, hundreds of nationalist ‘Yes’ supporters held a protest outside BBC Scotland in Glasgow with a banner referring to the Corporation’s political editor that said: ‘Sack Nick “The Liar” Robinson.’ Mr Salmond said: ‘What surprised me was the degree to which the BBC allowed themselves to be influenced by headlines in a biased press. I had no surprise about the written press but I was surprised and disappointed by the way [the BBC] allowed themselves to be… by that agenda.’ He added: ‘I don’t think the broadcasting issue...will be properly resolved until we have broadcasting under the remit of our democratically-elected parliament in Scotland.’ A labour peer has hit back at David Cameron for calling the party’s leadership ‘sneering, hopeless’ Hampstead Lefties. Veteran broadcaster Joan Bakewell yesterday rounded on the Prime Minister for criticising ‘champagne socialists’ from the fashionable London borough where she lives. Mr Cameron used the Tory spring conference on Saturday to accuse Mr Miliband and his supporters of displaying the ‘same old condescending, bossy, interfering, we-know-best attitude of the Hampstead socialist down the ages’. Baroness Bakewell told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘He’s had a go at me and many like me: “Spare us from Ed’s sneering, hopeless Hampstead lefties.” Why? Why should we be excluded like this? We’ve got votes, we’ve got interests, we’ve got consciences, we care about the poor and the dispossessed, we are willing to pay our taxes. ‘Clearly Cameron is panicking. It’s just abusive, personal attacks. It’s not about policies – he just doesn’t like us.’ Mr Salmond also boasted about how closely he could work with Ed Miliband as the SNP unveiled its support for tax hikes.Scotland’s former first minister said that the party had experience in ‘upsetting the apple cart’, which it would deploy at Westminster. The SNP will back Ed Balls’s controversial scheme to balance the country’s books by increasing the income tax rate from 45p to 50p for those earning over £150,000. Mr Miliband has claimed that he would not go into a formal coalition with the SNP, but the nationalists yesterday backed a string of Labour policies in the latest sign of how the parties could work together to push through a left-wing agenda . SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said: ‘In the next Parliament, SNP MPs will support the re-introduction of the 50p tax rate for the very wealthiest.’ He said he hoped the party would have a ‘huge group’ of MPs after May 7 that would also vote with Labour to abolish the so-called bedroom tax. Mr Salmond yesterday said the Tories’ attempts to portray Mr Miliband as in his pocket were ‘fundamentally stupid’. He added: ‘In terms of skulduggery and upsetting the apple cart and various parliamentary techniques, there’s a wee bit of experience might be there in the group we have.’ SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon yesterday confirmed the party would demand an MP on each Commons committee, including for devolved issues such as health and education, if it does well in the election. Labour introduced the higher rate tax band, paid by those earning more than £150,000, in 2010. The Coalition then cut it to 45p in 2012, prompting Labour to accuse them of giving a ‘tax cut to millionaires’. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (left) hugs former First Minister Alex Salmond, as she closes the SNP conference at the SECC in Glasgow today . But official figures show Britain’s richest have paid more income tax since it was abolished. Tory MP Iain Stewart said yesterday: ‘This is another example of Labour-SNP collusion. Nicola Sturgeon has made it absolutely clear she would prop up a minority Labour government.’ Labour shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran said: ‘This is a naked attempt by Alex Salmond to interfere in an institution that no political party would attempt to control. The BBC is independent of Government and it should stay that way.’ A BBC Scotland spokesman said: ‘Our coverage of the referendum was fair and balanced.’","Salmond accused of naked attempt to interfere with BBC's independence .

"A host of the biggest names in the music industry have joined forces to launch Tidal, a streaming service being billed as the first artist-owned platform for music and video. Rihanna, Madonna, Beyonce, Usher, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire, Jack White and Kanye West joined a host of other stars as they were revealed as co-owners of the subscription service, which is the brainchild of Jay Z. Unlike rivals Spotify, the service will not have a free tier - meaning the musicians stand to make more money from it. Scroll down for video . Celebrity backing: Jason Aldean, Jack White, Daft Punk, Beyonce, Regine Chassagne, Win Butler, and Alicia Keys onstage at the Tidal launch event on Monday . Selling the product: Quoting Jimmy Hendrix and Nietzsche, Alicia Keys did her best to sell Tidal to fans . The membership-based service - similar to subscription service Spotify - will provide music and exclusive video content that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline. Unlike Spotify there isn't a free service. It is being offered to U.S. users at two price points: about $9.95 for standard sound quality and $19.99 for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality.' Tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of Spotify, which offers lower levels for free users. Alicia Keys said the artists hope Tidal will 'forever change the course of music history' and ensure the viability of the industry at Monday's launch event in New York City. The celebrities - which also included Nicki Minaj, Jason Aldean, Usher, Arcade Fire and deadmau5 - stood in a line, and in solidarity by mostly wearing black onstage as Keys spoke to the audience at Skylight at Moynihan Station in Manhattan. Keys called the event 'a graduation.' 'So we come together before you on this day, March 30th, 2015, with one voice in unity in the hopes that today will be another one of those moments in time, a moment that will forever change the course of music history. 'For today we announce of Tidal, the first ever artist-owned, global music and entertainment platform,' Keys said. However, details about the streaming service were vague.

In the United Kingdom the premium service will set users back £20. Tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of Spotify, which offers lower levels for free users. Earlier claims were made that Tidal offers artists double the streaming rates of its rival. However, the firm has confirmed if this is still the case. Signing on: Madonna climbs on the table as she signs a document as one of the high profile co-owners of the new service . The difference means that Tidal offers higher sound quality for audiophiles with advanced sound systems - but that casual listeners using simple laptops or smartphones may face slower connections. The venue for the event was transformed to display a walkway paying tribute to the different decades in music, starting with the 1950s. Coldplay's Chris Martin and Calvin Harris, who both appeared via video, are also co-owners. 'Our mission goes beyond commerce, it goes beyond technology. 'Our intent is to preserve music's importance in our lives,' Keys said. 'Music is the language of love, of laughter, of heartbreak, of mystery. It's the world's true, true, without question, universal language.' Each of the owners signed documents at the event as the audience screamed when they walked to a table in the center of the stage.

Laquan started his fashion career at the tender age of 19, working with esteemed legends in the industry like stylist Elizabeth Sulcer and Andre Leon Talley.

Offering curated playlists and 'editorial', Tidal already has deals in place with all the major record labels. It will also work when offline, with users able to 'listen on the subway'. The artists hope the service can compete with platforms including Spotify and Apple's soon-to-be revamped music service involving Beats Music. Streaming - which allows users to play unlimited on-demand music online - has quickly shaken up the industry, narrowly edging out CD sales in revenues last year in the United States. Industry leader Spotify says it has 60 million users with 15 million of them paying - generally $10 a month. Spotify already has a range of rivals including US-based Rhapsody and Google Play. Paris-based Deezer is the second larger service with 6 million customers. It is strong in Europe and last year entered the United States as a high-end-only service. The most recent numbers for Tidal are at 540,000, according to the company. Like Tidal, Deezer's elite service uses FLAC files which are larger than MP3s, which are most common for music. All onboard: Rihanna, Nicki Minaj and Madonna hope to profit from the new service . Apple - which pioneered digital music through iTunes in 2001 - is reportedly also looking to launch a new streaming service as the market shifts away from permanent downloads. Apple earlier made a bid for streaming customers by buying Beats Electronics, run by another rap mogul, Dr. Dre. Along with the United States, Tidal runs in major markets including Britain and France and plans to launch later this year in Australia and Germany. Alicia asked the crowd to: 'think about how many times music has personally picked you up and reminded you that you can do it again.' 'Music speaks to all of us,' she said. 'Music brings us together, it connects us all. 'Music is so powerful - that is what Tidal will be. A place for connection between artists and fans. The launch of the event in New York City brought together artists from across the musicial spectrum . The brains: Jay Z purchased Swedish tech company Aspiro for $56 million earlier this year to take control of Tidal and fellow streaming service WiMP; he has convinced his fellow stars to join him in the venture . Happy to be part of it: Kanye West could hardly contain his excitement at the launch of the new streaming service which aims to compete against the likes of Spotify and provide more money for the artists . 'The place to discover the music that will become the soundtrack for the rest of our lives.' The launch came after a huge social media push, in which the stars devoted their Twitter and Facebook pages to promoting Tidal. The mastermind behind the new system, Jay Z purchased Swedish tech company Aspiro for $56 million earlier this year to take control of Tidal. Before the purchase in February he reportedly hosted a meeting of the music world's biggest stars at which he lamented 'crass commercialization'. Daft Punk's two members were key figures in deciding on a strategy during the meeting days before the Grammy Awards at The Fig House event space in a remote part of Pasadena, Los Angeles. And it appears Jay Z's business mind convinced them to open their pockets, and sign on as 'co-owners'. Business men: Kanye West and Jay Z clap Alicia Keys after her passionate speech; the new system is subscription only and will cost users $20 a month, or $10 for a lower quality service . Everyone has signed up: From Madonna to Deadmau5, Kanye West, and JAY-Z, the scheme has attracted the cream of the music industry, with stars of country, pop and R & B all signing up . Norwegian business daily Dagens Naeringsliv reported in January that Jay Z's company was particularly interested in Wimp's high-fidelity Tidal streaming service which is being launched on the U.S. market. 'The Wimp/Tidal service has the potential for greatness, given that it has high-end audio capabilities,' music specialist Simon Dyson at corporate analytics firm Ovum told AFP in an email, adding that the $56-million price tag was 'not excessive'. Jay-Z is one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 100 million records. Forbes estimated last year that his net worth was $520 million. Spotify was a pioneer in the streaming music business. The unlisted company boasted 15 million paying subscribers in mid-January and is available in 58 countries.

"Vladimir Putin has appeared on television for the first time in a week amid health fears and suggestions that he is being subject to a coup, while rumours persist that his 31-year-old 'girlfriend' is about to give birth. Putin, 62, had cancelled several planned meetings during the week leading to speculation over his health and even claims that he was fighting to retain his position. Channel NTV showed footage of Putin meeting with supreme court president Vyacheslav Lebedev, which it claims was shot on Friday. Scroll down for video . Vladimir Putin, left, met with the supreme court president Vyacheslav Lebedev, right,  earlier today . According to Putin's staff, he was discussing judicial reform and the likely increase in the number of bankruptcies as as result of Russia's economic collapse. Putin is due to meet with the president of Kyrgyzstan in St Petersburg on Monday according to the Kremlin. The Russian president was last seen in public on March 5. For the past week, the Russian government has been reluctantly answering questions about Putin's health and suggestions that his unofficial girlfriend Alina Kabayeva had checked into a Swiss maternity clinic. Rumours about 31-year-old Alina Kabayeva surfaced with reports in Switzerland, Italy and Russia suggesting the gymnast had either given birth or was about to do so. It comes amid increased speculation over what has happened to Putin with the Russian leader not having been seen for a week. Alluring: Many Russians consider Alina Kabayeva the country's undeclared First Lady . The claims focused on an elite clinic in Lugano, in the Italian region of the neutral country, with some accounts saying she had a new daughter. Putin's spokesman - who has never confirmed a relationship between the 62 year old strongman and the Olympic gold-medal winner - insisted: 'Information about the birth of Vladimir Putin's child does not correspond to reality.' The Russian embassy in Kiev refused to comment on a report on the speculation in newspaper Blick. Russian Tatler yesterday repeated gossip that Kabayeva has two children already by Putin but adds there is no official confirmation. Kabayeva has been largely out of sight since quitting as an MP in Putin's United Russia party last September, when she took over as head of a major media conglomerate. Meanwhile, the Kremlin today issued a new picture showing Putin meeting the chairman of the Supreme Court Vyacheslav Lebedev at his out-of-Moscow residence Novo-Ogaryovo. The image was meant to scotch suggestions that Putin was not at work amid speculation over a coup or illness. However, there were immediate claims the picture and TV footage was old, and that it was further evidence of his mystery absence. Current rumours in Moscow include Putin suffering a stroke, or an unfolding palace coup, following his sudden cancellation of a scheduled trip to Kazakhstan. With Moscow in febrile mood, a former senior aide to the strongman claimed another ex-KGB spy is being urgently lined up to take over from him. The theory suggests the Kremlin's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov - a former defence minister - will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre Dmitry Medvedev. After this switch, dubbed a 'conspiracy of generals', Putin - currently the subject of swirling rumours over his health after not being seen in public for more than a week - would be swiftly ousted. Under the Russian constitution, in the event of a president leaving office, the prime minister replaces him in an acting role pending elections. This latest forecast of an imminent sea change in Russian politics came from Andrei Illarionov, Putin's former chief economics aide, who last year predicted Putin's land grab against Ukraine three weeks before it happened. While the Kremlin insists Putin is healthy and in full control of his government, Illarionov claimed: 'In the next few days we should expect the resignation of prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, and Sergei Ivanov being appointed in his place.' After this, 'the public is likely to be informed that the national leader (Putin) needs a well deserved rest'. Putin hands flowers to Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Alina Kabayeva after awarding her with an Order of Friendship at an award ceremony in the Kremlin in 2001 . It has been claimed Russia's former defence minister Sergei Ivanov (pictured) will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre Dmitry Medvedev . Observers note that in recent days, Ivanov - who retained the military rank of colonel general and whose eldest son was killed in a mysterious drowning accident in Dubai last November - has been little seen in public. And Medvedev, who served as president for four years to 2012, is also out of the limelight. Some Kremlin-watchers say that Western sanctions have created huge tensions inside Putin's fractious entourage in recent weeks, with cash streams closed off. The murder of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov - branded a 'provocation' by Putin - has only intensified the infighting with blame for his slaying blamed on the president's close allies in Chechnya. Illarionov, a senior follow at the Cato Institute in Washington, earlier alleged a cover-up by the Russian authorities over Nemtsov's shooting yards from the Kremlin. Putin is said by his spokesman Dmitry Peskov to be 'exhaustively' working on documents but has - most unusually - not been seen publicly since 5 March, more than a week. Miss Kabayeva performs her routines during two events in Kiev, Ukraine, in 2000 (left) and 1999 (right). The former gymnast is rumoured to be the president's girlfriend . The Kremlin insists he is healthy, but this has done nothing to end speculation from Russians who for years were lied to over the health of geriatric Soviet leaders, and also Putin's predecessor Boris Yeltsin. 'Peskov's assertion that Putin is in good health, however, could also mean recent developments in Russian politics required Putin's presence in Moscow,' stated The Moscow Times today. 'A heightening of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the murder of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, the investigation into whose death was reportedly accompanied by signs of an increased power struggle within the Russian administration, could have kept Putin busy behind closed doors.' In December, Putin brushed aside claims he could be overthrown. 'I can assure you that we don't have palaces, so a palace coup isn't really possible. The official presidential residence is the Kremlin. It is well protected,' he said. Ivanov, at 62 the same age as Putin, was a career KGB who studied English in Ealing during the Cold War. He is wooden in his public appearances and lacks Putin's common touch with ordinary Russians.","Vladimir Putin held his first public meeting in more than a week today .

"Australian soap Neighbours celebrates it's 30th anniversary this year and there's one woman who has been glued to every minute. From Scott and Charlene's wedding to Kate Ramsay being shot, Kerry Sturgeon, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, has seen it all. She's watched every single episode for 30 years - and loves the soap so much she has never had a holiday for fear of missing one. Soap superfan Kerry from Wakefield, West Yorkshire has watched more than 7,000 episodes of Neighbours . The 42-year-old has watched more than 7,000 episodes - totalling more than 3,500 hours in front of the TV - a whopping 145 days of her life. The mother-of-three didn't even let giving birth stop her from tuning into the drama of Ramsay Street. She said: 'Going into labour never stopped me because it was always videoed. I remember having to set a timer on the video player. I would set it for half past one until half past two so I didn't miss it. 'I knew if I set it for a whole hour I would definitely have it all recorded.' Kerry said she began watching Neighbours - which first aired in 1985 - when she was in school and fell in love with the happy-go-lucky characters. She said: 'I've never missed an episode. Not a single one. I started watching it in school. We would come home and have our tea and watch Neighbours. 'My favourite character of all time was Cheryl Stark. I absolutely loved her. She was so funny and she was never sad. She was my favourite. She was just happy, loud and outrageous. 'When she first came into the show she had won the lottery and she was buying these big boats that were in Ramsay Street.' Kerry and husband Mark, 52, have been together for 27 years and have three sons. But despite their busy home life, Kerry always makes time for the show and Mark is now a Neighbours fan too. Kerry has been watching Neigbours since it first aired in 1985, pictured are the original cast including Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan . The mother-of-three even recorded her favourite soap when she was giving birth so she wouldn't miss a thing . Kerry said: 'My husband and I have been together for 27 years and we have always watched it together. I got him hooked on it when we met and now he can't miss an episode either. 'Neighbours makes me laugh so much. I love the relationship between Karl and Susan Kennedy. 'Karl and Susan have divorced so many times. I don't like to see them apart. I adore that couple. I don't like it when they split. 'I like to see them as me and my husband, so I hate it when they break up. I end up in floods because I don't want to imagine it happening to us. Karl only has eyes for Susan really.' Kerry loved watching Kylie aka Charlene tie the knot with Jason aka Scott in 1988 . The school catering assistant, who has three sons - Andrew, 25, Matthew, 20, and Casey, 18 - said she has never been on holiday in her life and would prefer being at home watching Aussie soap. She said: 'I absolutely adore it. It's just so happy. I watch Eastenders as well and it can get quite depressing. 'I have never been on holiday. Never, ever. They freak me out because I'm such a home bird. I would much prefer to get tea ready and watch Neighbours. I'm a creature of habit. 'I would love to meet the cast and see all of my favourite characters in real life. They would have to come to me because I would never be able to go all the way to Australia and miss the show. 'My sons don't watch it religiously like me and my husband. All three boys know what's going on. They wouldn't make sure they were home in time for it.' Kerry said she has watched the soap for so long that she feels like she knows the characters and at times the storylines have mirrored her own life. She said: 'There was a recent storyline with Jason Donovan's dad who has become ill and my dad has gone the same way. That's been hard to watch. 'I have watched Toadie since he was a child. I've seen him grow up. 'Paul Robinson was in the beginning. I love Paul because he has got a heart of gold but he plays nasty so well. Now Harold is back and even Madge is back. 'I love it. It's so feel good. I always remember all the characters. I feel like I know all the characters.' The superfan also fell in love with Scott and Charlene who entered the Aussie soap in 1986. The wedding of Scott and Charlene Robinson - played by Jason Donovan and pop princess Kylie Minogue - was watched by some 20 million people in the UK when it was broadcast in November 1988. Every night Kerry and her husband have their tea on their laps and catch up on the latest episode of the soap . Kerry said: 'I loved Scott and Charlene. I so wanted to be Charlene. I loved her. She was a tomboy but then she would look so lovely when her hair was done. 'I remember watching their relationship grow and they were just the best sweethearts ever.' The mother-of-three has used video players to record her beloved soap over the years but says her digital box has revolutionised her viewing. She added: 'I would be lost without series link. It's revolutionised everything. I never watch it on first look though; I just watch that day's episode. 'My husband is a driver so he gets home in time and likes to have a shower first while I get the tea ready. We have our tea on our lap and Neighbours on.' Neighbours began in 1985 and 30 years on the soap is still going strong and is broadcast to more than 50 countries around the world.","Kerry Sturgeon from Wakefield has watched over seven thousand episodes .

"A convicted child molester claimed he abducted a young boy who looked like Etan Patz the same day in 1979 that the 6-year-old went missing, a former federal prosecutor told a jury Monday at the trial of another man accused of murder. Key defense witness Stuart GraBois recounted how, once ruling out family members as suspects, he located Jose Ramos in prison in the late 1980s after learning the Ramos had ties to a woman who was once used by the family to walk Etan home from school during a bus driver strike. The former assistant to then-US Attorney Rudy Giuliani described soothing Ramos with small talk before suddenly asking him, 'How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz?' Scroll down for video . Confessions of a child predator: Convicted child molester Jose Ramos, 71 (left), allegedly told a prosecutor in 1988 that on the day of Etan Patz's disappearance, he brought the 6-year-old to his apartment with the intention of having sex with him . Site: Hernandez was working in 1979 at this corner convenience store, near where Etan was last seen where the man said he threw the boy's body into trash . 'He froze and got tearful, and said, ""I want to tell you all about it. I want to get it off my chest,""' GraBois testified. Ramos claimed that he had encountered Patz in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village May 25, 1979, before luring the boy to his apartment to try to have sex with him, GraBois said. The suspect, having seen Patz's photo on television and on missing posters, was '90 per cent sure' it was the same boy, he said. After the boy resisted his sexual advances, Ramos claimed he put him on a subway train so he could go to his aunt's home in Washington Heights. GraBois said he considered that a lie, telling Ramos, 'I don't believe you.' GraBois launched an investigation that resulted in an unrelated sex abuse conviction against Ramos in Pennsylvania. But the prosecutor failed to make a case against him in Etan's disappearance after Ramos refused to ever speak again with authorities about the boy, whose body was never found. The imprisoned Ramos, now 71, was scratched as a potential defense witness in the trial of Pedro Hernandez after he threatened to invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination if called to the stand. Prime suspect: Pedro Hernandez, 54, pictured here in 2012, is on trial on murder and kidnapping charges after he admitted to killing Etan . Still missing: Hernandez told police he bagged Etan's body and dumped it a few blocks away. The boy's remains were never recovered . Molester: Ramos served 27 years in Pennsylvania for rape and molestation of three young boys in the 1980s . But with testimony about Ramos' alleged confession and by highlighting his history of molesting children, the defense has sought to portray him as a more plausible suspect than the 54-year-old Hernandez. Earlier, jurors watched a videotaped interview of Ramos, following his arrest in 1982 after two young boys reported that he tried to lure them into a drainpipe in a Bronx park, where he was living at the time. In the video, Ramos says his girlfriend used to take care of Patz but that he never met him. Ramos served 27 years in a Pennsylvania prison for the rape and molestation of three young boys in the 1980s. Shortly after his release in 2012, he was rearrested for breaking sex offender registration laws, and returned to prison. The Patz family sued Ramos in civil court, where he was found to have been responsible for the boy's death in 2004. Etan's parents were awarded $2million, which they never attempted to collect. Etan vanished on May 25, 1979, after leaving his family's SoHo townhouse to walk to the bus. The disappearance helped galvanize the modern-day missing children's movement, with his picture one of the first to appear on a milk carton. Stan Patz (center), father of Etan Patz, leaves a court in New York on January 30, 2015 after attending Hernandez's trial . Stan and Julie Patz (left and right) sued Ramos in civil court, where he was found to have been responsible for the boy's death in 2004 . After police received a fresh tip in 2012, Hernandez confessed that he choked Etan in the basement of a New York City convenience store where he worked after luring the boy there with the promise of a soda. He said he bagged the body and dumped it a few blocks away. Defense attorneys are trying to show that the defendant is mentally ill and that his lengthy videotaped confession is a delusion. Prosecutors argued that Hernandez's admissions are sound.","Key defense witness Stuart GraBois, a former prosecutor, testified Jose Ramos told him in 1988 he lured Etan Patz to his home May 25, 1979 .

"A seven-year-old boy was killed when a heavy goods vehicle collided with the car he was travelling in. The youngster was sitting in a silver Toyota which was driving on an A-road in Buckinghamshire when it collided with a blue DAF lorry. Paramedics and an air ambulance crew raced to the scene but the youngster was declared dead at the scene. The seven-year-old boy died following the collision on the Stoke Hammond by-pass in Buckinghamshire . Three people were taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford with serious injuries and the road was closed for several hours while investigators gathered evidence. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'At 2.17pm yesterday on the A4146 Stoke Hammond bypass near the junction with the B4032 Leighton Road a silver Toyota RAV 4 was involved in a collision with a blue DAF lorry. The collision occurred on the south bound dual carriageway. 'Sadly a 7-year-old boy, who was a passenger in the car, died at the scene.' A fire service spokesman said that seven appliances had attended the incident, where firefighters used hydraulic rescue equipment to release three injured women from the vehicles. A man, thought to be the lorry driver, escaped from his vehicle uninjured before fire crews arrived. Police constable Sandra Terry said: 'This is a very sad case where a young boy has lost his life. 'We are in the process of investigating the circumstances which led to these tragic consequences and so would urge anyone who was in the area before this time and saw the incident itself or who had seen either vehicle prior to the collision to please contact us as a matter of urgency.' A 33-year-old man from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and bailed while the investigation continues.

"A suicidal Navy veteran who was allegedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder was shot dead by four police officers last night after warning a crisis hotline that an encounter with the law 'would not end well'. William Poole, 52, was killed by officers from the Gaston County Police department outside his home in Gastonia, North Carolina, Monday night. Police say they found him sitting on a lawnmower with a handgun, and that he opened fire after they approached him. Shot dead: Officers from Gaston County Police in North Carolina killed William Poole, 52, on Monday night. Police are pictured above on the scene . The officers then shot back, killing him. They had been sent to his home by concerned workers at the National Veterans Helpline. The crisis service had taken a call from him in which he said was going to kill himself - and not to send anybody to his house because it would 'not end well'. 'Excessive': Robert Hinson, Powell's son-in-law, spoke out after the shooting . None of the officers was harmed. Robert Hinson, Poole's son-in-law, told news channel WSOCTV he was on the phone with him moments before the death. Hinson, who lives on the same street as Poole, said he had only just hung up when he heard shots ring out. He said: 'Next thing I knew I'm hearing boom, boom, boom - sounded like the Fourth of July went off.' Hinson said that Poole had PTSD, but that 'he never tried to hurt anybody'. He told local news station WBTV that Poole had served with the Navy in Beirut. He characterized the police response as 'excessive'. Hinson said: 'I ran out the door and I see four county officers with their guns drawn and my father-in-law laying on the ground.' At a press conference Monday night, Gaston County police chief James Buie said: 'This is an unfortunate situation and our thoughts and prayers go out to all that's involved'. The four officers have been put on administrative leave. They have not been named. The shooting is being investigated by state authorities and Gaston County Police's professional standards unit. Suicide call: Police were sent to Poole's home after he phoned a veterans' crisis line and said he was suicidal.

"'Brainwashed': Amer Deghayes was exploited by radical Islamists before he went to fight with jihadists in Syria, according to his mother . The mother of three teenagers who ran away to Syria to wage jihad says her sons were 'brainwashed' by YouTube videos and their extremist friends. Inas Abulsayen was left heartbroken when her sons left their home in Sussex and travelled to fight with a branch of Al Qaeda against the Assad regime. Her two younger sons Abdullah and Jaffar Deghayes have now been killed in the war-torn country, and she has launched a public appeal for their older brother Amer to come home. Amer, 20, left the family home in Saltdean, near Brighton, in October 2013 and joined the Al Nusra Front, and two months later his brothers joined him in Syria. In April last year, 18-year-old Abdullah was killed in a battle which also left Amer injured, and in October Jaffar died while fighting against Assad's troops in December. Despite his brothers' deaths, Amer is determined to remain in the Middle East, and has ignored his family's demands for him to return to Britain. Mrs Abulsayen said her sons were influenced by radical videos which they watched online, and insisted that she and her husband Abubaker were opposed to extremism. 'My sons went to serve, to sacrifice, and now two of them are dead,' she said. 'They were victims. They felt England was a part of their lives, but everybody has a secret life. 'We have our religion, but there is lots of brainwashing on YouTube, in the mosques, through friends. 'My sons are Muslim, and they believe everyone should be free as part of humanity. I taught them about the uprising, but not about fighting, maybe they thought they are men and maybe they were brainwashed.' Scroll down for video . Killed: Abdullah, left, and Jaffar, right, both died fighting in Syria for the Al Nusra Front, a branch of Al Qaeda . Home: The three brothers abandoned the family house in Saltdean, Sussex to fight in Syria . The mother of six said that her sons' friend Ibrahim Kamara, 19, influenced them with his radical views when he was staying with them after falling out with his own family. Mrs Abulsayen said: 'I had lots of arguments with him because he talked about Osama Bin Laden, jihad - and I didn't want my sons in this position. He had a bad view on Islam. 'I heard Ibrahim say to Jaffar, ""You are not young now, Jaffar. You are old enough, you can look after yourself.""' Kamara died in a US air strike in Aleppo last year after travelling to Syria with Jaffar. Mrs Abulsayen added that her sons told her they wanted to carry out humanitarian missions but instead turned to jihad once they arrived in Syria. 'Amer was the first one to leave in October 2013,' she said. 'He said to me, ""Mummy, there is a community that has English people who want to help refugees. This is my chance. Let me make that trip. It's not that dangerous."" 'He said to me, ""Mummy, I feel guilty. I have food, I have everything here - don't be upset with me. This is the best opportunity for me. People are hungry and children are crying."" 'He is very calm, like all my sons, and he gave me a promise he would be back. He said it was just a trip to help refugees. ''If I die, you will be upset if I am martyred', he said to me. I said of course - you know my opinion on going to Syria - I disagree with it.' Father: Abubaker Deghayes outside his home in October, announcing that Jaffar had been killed . Uncle: Omar Deghayes spent five years as a detainee in Guantanamo Bay before being released . Three months later, her two other sons left without telling their family where they were going, she said. 'Abdullah, the first one to die, I didn't even get to give him a hug before he left,' she continued. He didn't say goodbye to me. Abdullah left and gave his sister a hug before saying, ""I'm going to meet my mate."" 'Two weeks before he left, Jaffar told me he would never leave me, so I don't know who brainwashed him. Maybe he thought he could get his brothers back, I don't know.' The boys' uncle, Omar Deghayes, was a detainee at Guantanamo Bay for five years after being arrested in Pakistan, but was eventually released without charge. In a film shot last year, Amer insisted he would not return home, saying: 'My work here is not done. I came here to give victory to the people and make sure that they receive justice, and we still haven't reached the goal yet.' He added: 'The Muslim nation is like one body. If one part complains, the other parts react, so I don't see it as a Syrian conflict. I see it as an Islamic conflict.' If he did return to Britain, Amer could face legal action, because the Al Nusra Front is classified as a banned terrorist organisation by the Government.","Inas Abulsayen has seen her sons Amer, Abdullah and Jaffar Deghayes travel to Syria and join Al Nusra Front .

"We think it provides them with a warm and cosy sanctuary – but apparently horses hate being saddled with stables. The beasts find them a miserable and stressful experience, research reveals. As a herd animal, horses prefer to be in groups and stables prevent them interacting with their neighbours, according to a study by Nottingham Trent University. Stable condition: Scientists found the animals’ stress levels - measured by the hormone corticosterone - rose and they became difficult to manage as they became increasingly isolated . Scientists found animals that were isolated had higher levels of stress hormones and became difficult to manage. The findings, published in the journal Physiology and Behaviour, showed that horses are at their happiest in a paddock. Scientists found the animals’ stress levels - measured by the hormone corticosterone - rose and they became difficult to manage as they became increasingly isolated. These stress levels could also lead to sickness and disease, the study published in the journal Physiology and Behaviour found. Research: The study by Nottingham Trent University (above) found that as a herd animal, horses prefer to be in groups and stables prevent them interacting with their neighbours . Equine welfare expert Kelly Yarnell told the Daily Telegraph: ‘To the human eye, the stable appears safe and inviting and is based on the belief of what the horse finds comfortable. ‘However, for a social animal that spends most of its time in close contact with other horses, the isolation brought about by single housing could activate an equine stress response.’ She said equine welfare would be improved by shared housing. In the wild, horses live in herds that move over up to 30 sq miles while domestic horses often spend most of the day inside. Lee Hackett, director of equine policy at The British Horse Society, said the study should change the way we keep horses. He said: ‘It is fairly obvious that keeping any animal in a domestic setting could potentially compromise it, whether that be a hamster in a cage or a lion in a zoo.'","Stables prevent horses interacting with their neighbours, scientists say .

"A mother has described how she heard a doctor asking her husband about switching off her life-support as she lay in a medically-induced coma after collapsing from a rare condition. Jenny Bone, who was feared to have catastrophic brain damage after going into cardiac arrest, lay listening to the life-or-death conversation but was paralysed and unable to intervene. She recalls her husband John ruling out ending her life – despite a previous conversation when she said she wanted to die if incapacitated permanently. The 40-year-old later recovered and now says she is relieved he went against her wishes. Near death: Jenny Bone, 40, pictured, was in a coma in hospital but heard doctors discuss ending her life only for her husband to refuse to switch off her life support machine . Much-loved: Mrs Bone, pictured with her son David and husband John, had said she would want her life support switched off, but Mr Bone refused to give up on her . ‘I was aware of conversations around me,’ she said. ‘The most frequent one was being turned in the bed. A familiar “ready, steady, turn” would come from the nurses. ‘The most alarming was between a doctor and my husband enquiring as to my wishes surrounding being kept alive on a ventilator and that they were unsure whether my mental ability had been impaired due to lack of oxygen while they were attempting to restart my heart. Starting again: A year on from her near-death experience Mrs Bone is back at work and also took part in a charity run, pictured . ‘There was an agreement that I should continue to be kept on the ventilator to give a chance for an MRI scan to be done to see if I had any brain function. ‘I was not even responding to a basic reflex test, which is why the doctor thought I was not going to have a chance of recovery. I am very pleased my husband gave me that extra time.’ Mrs Bone, a government building surveyor, felt pins and needles in her legs on March 14 last year but still went to work. She was alone in a tower block in central London when she collapsed as the pain moved up her legs. She managed to catch a train home to Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, and went to her GP who immediately sent her to Luton and Dunstable Hospital with a letter saying she might have Guillain-Barre syndrome. The condition involves the immune system attacking the peripheral nervous system – the network of nerves outside the central nervous system – leaving the brain unable to control muscles. She and her husband claim the letter was handed over but not acted upon and she was initially told she had a chest complaint. Hours later she stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest. She was given a tracheotomy to help her breathe and was placed in a light medically-induced coma. She was on a respirator in an intensive care unit when a doctor raised the subject of ending her life a few days later. Mr Bone, 58, who is also a surveyor, explained: ‘He said they didn’t know how long she was deprived of oxygen and there could be a range of deficits and it could be time to turn the machine off. I said it was far too early. ‘He said, “We have got to be realistic about what might happen,” but again I said it was too early.’ New life: Mrs Bone, pictured left and right during her recovery, had been minutes from death before she was diagnosed with rare autoimmune disease of the nervous system Guillain-Barre Syndrome . While in intensive care Mrs Bone was finally diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Doctors realised she had a chance of surviving if kept in the coma to allow her body to repair itself. She was given intravenous immunoglobulin and had a plasma exchange. Shortly after returning home she began taking her five-year-old son, David, to school with the aid of a walking frame. Now, one year on, she is back at work and has completed a 5km charity run, negotiating the course while leaning on a walking stick. The couple have made a formal complaint to the hospital about the GP’s letter being ignored. A hospital spokesman said: ‘We are glad that Mrs Bone is recovering from her illness. However, we are sorry she did not have a positive patient experience. We are investigating the concerns raised.’ Renowned neurosurgeon Munchi Choksey said: ‘Sometimes the sedation wears off a bit, so she might have been hearing some of the conversations around her. ‘But some of the drugs like opiates [she may have been prescribed] can in some cases induce hallucinations. So it could be she was in a dream-like state and imagined what was happening.’","Jenny Bone has recovered after husband John refused to end her life .

"David Cameron's children cheered him on today as he demolished Labour's newest election attack by vowing not to increase VAT after the general election. At the final Prime Minister's Questions before Parliament is dissolved, Mr Cameron stunned Ed Miliband by immediately agreeing that the shopping levy will not rise under the Tory government. The Tory leader's wife Samantha and children Nancy and Elwen were in the public gallery cheering on what could be his final Commons appearance as Prime Minister. They looked delighted as Mr Cameron tore into his opponent, branding him 'Alex Salmond's poodle' and mocking him over his fraught Labour leadership battle with David Miliband. David Cameron today demolished Labour's newest election attack by vowing not to increase VAT after the general election . Delighted Tory MPs cheered Mr Cameron's final appearance at the Despatch Box before the general election on May 7 . Labour yesterday unveiled a new poster warning of Tory VAT hikes after the election.  The headline rate of VAT stands at 20 per cent after George Osborne increased it from 17.5 per cent in his emergency Budget in 2010. Labour yesterday vowed not to increase the duty, but Mr Osborne refused to follow suit. Mr Miliband directly challenged the Prime Minister on the issue today, expecting the Tory to dodge the question. But Mr Cameron hit back: 'Straight answers deserve straight questions and the answer's yes.' He then challenged Labour to rule out an increase in National Insurance which Mr Miliband refused to commit to. But hours after the leader's disastrous Commons outing, Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced he would commit in the election manifesto not to hike National Insurance. Labour's shadow chancellor unveiled a new poster warning 'the Tories will raise VAT' to help balance the books . With a major Labour attack shredded to raucous cheers from the Tory benches, Mr Miliband tried to salvage the situation by claiming: 'Nobody is going to believe him because of his extreme spending plans.' In response the Prime Minister responded by repeatedly challenging Mr Miliband to rule out a rise in national insurance under a Labour government - which he declined to do. Mr Cameron declared: 'Straight answer from me, straight question to him - I have ruled out VAT, will he rule out national insurance contributions, yes or no?' Mr Miliband sought to deflect the question, saying: 'He'll have plenty of time to ask questions after May 7.' Mr Cameron appeared to be enjoying his time at the Despatch Box, with wife Samantha and children Nancy and Elwen looking on from the public gallery . ON SNP'S ALEX SALMOND . 'Alex Salmond has taken the entire Labour Party hostage and today we have got the ransom note. It says higher borrowing, uncontrolled immigration, unfettered welfare, higher taxes and weaker defence.' ON BEING A LAME DUCK PM . 'I'll tell you what is a lame duck and that is trying to get into Downing Street on the back of Alex Salmond's coat-tails.' ON ED MILIBAND . 'Never mind talk of ducks, I'm looking at Alex Salmond's poodle.' ON RICHARD III AND LABOUR'S BORTHERS AT WAR . 'The last time someone did in one of their relatives to get the top job and country ended in chaos.' ...AND ONE GAFFE . To Labour MP Michael Connarty: 'First of all can I pay tribute to the honourable gentleman who is standing down at the election.' Connarty: ""I'm not!"" Mr Cameron went on: ""Sorry, let me rephrase that. I've got to say. I want to defend the [briefing] team. This is my 146th appearance at the Despatch Box during Prime Minister's Questions and they normally get these things right.' Mr Cameron boosted Tory morale with a a series of personal attacks on the Labour leader. After being called a chicken for avoiding TV debates and a lame duck for announcing plans to quit by 2020, Mr Cameron shouted backed: 'Never mind talk of ducks I'm looking at Alex Salmond's poodle.' Delighted Tory MPs started shouting out 'woof woof' as the 30-minute session came close to descending into farce. Moments later he seized on the burial of Richard III this week to mock Mr Miliband for standing against his own brother for the Labour leadership. 'The last time someone did in one of their relatives to get the top job and country ended in chaos,' Mr Cameron said. Mr Cameron arrived in the Commons on the back foot, after his surprise announcement that he would not seek a third term as Prime Minister if he is elected again this year. Mr Miliband sought to mock the PM, saying he was pleased he had 'announced his retirement plans'. The Labour leader said: 'You said it was because you believed in giving straight answers to straight questions. After five years of Prime Minister's Questions, that was music to my ears. 'So here's a straight question: will you now rule out a rise in VAT?' Mr Cameron shot back: 'In 43 days I plan to arrange your retirement.' And  the astonishment of MPs on the Labour benches he categorically ruled out a VAT increase. He said: 'You are right, straight answers are deserved by straight questions. The answer is yes.' Labour MPs sat stony-faced as Tory MPs roared with laughter. Shouting over the noise, Mr Miliband ploughed on: 'Nobody is going to believe it. Nobody is going to believe it because of your extreme spending plans, because your numbers don't add up and because you promised it last time and you broke your promise.' Labour MPs sat stony-faced as Tory MPs roared with laughter when Mr Cameron ruled out a VAT increase . The noise eventually overwhelmed Mr Miliband and Commons Speaker John Bercow was forced to intervene and call for calm. Mr Miliband then tried to challenge Mr Cameron on the claim that spending cuts in the next three years 'will be greater even than anything seen in the last five?' But Mr Cameron insisted: 'You are wrong about that.' He then challenged Mr Miliband to answer a questions. 'Straight answer from me, straight question to you - I have ruled out VAT, will you rule out national insurance contributions? Yes or no?' Mr Miliband said: 'You will have plenty of time to ask questions after May 7 and I'm afraid to say your own Office for Budget Responsibility says a much sharper squeeze on real spending than anything seen over the past five years.'","Cameron shoots Miliband's fox  a day after Labour launched VAT poster .
