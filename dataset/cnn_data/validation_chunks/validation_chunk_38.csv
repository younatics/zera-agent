"Nicola Sturgeon today revealed how she dodges domestic chores at home while her husband stays up late cleaning. The Scottish First Minister invited the cameras into her spotless house near Glasgow, which interviewer Susanna Reid looked like a 'show home'. Ms Sturgeon credited her husband Peter, the SNP's chief executive, with staying up late to clean the house and admitted to being so bad in the kitchen she is on first name terms with her takeaway delivery driver. Scroll down for video . Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed how she irons her husband's shirts as a way of getting out of doing any other household chores . Posing in jeans, Ms Sturgeon admitted she has never been any good in the kitchen as she made a coffee . The SNP leader is poised to hold the balance of power if, as the polls predict, she oversees the wipeout of Labour north of the border. In a revealing personal interview, she discussed balancing family life with running Scotland, not having children and how she likes to unwind at weekends. The 44-year-old, who replaced Alex Salmond last year, admitted to finding ways to avoid helping out around the house. Despite her husband Peter Murrell running the SNP, she told ITV's Good Morning Britain that all she does is irons his shirts. 'I've developed this thing that if I iron Peter's shirts on a Sunday night then that kind of gets me off the hook of any other domestic tasks because in my head that's me I've pulled my weight in the house, of the domestic chores.' The interview was carried out at the couple's home in Uddingston just outside Glasgow. Good Morning Britain's Susanna Reid told Ms Sturgeon that he immaculate house looked like a 'show home' Ms Sturgeon invited the cameras into her home near Glasgow as part of a series ahead of polling day on May 7 . The cameras showed Ms Sturgeon opening the door to Reid, making coffee and sitting in a conservatory to answer questions. Reid told her: 'We are in your lovely home now. It's like a show home. It's immaculate.' Ms Sturgeon replied: 'That's because I had my husband up most of last night cleaning it. It's not always this tidy.' In one recent interview David Cameron was seen preparing dinner, but the best Ms Sturgeon could do was make a coffee. 'I've never been very good in the kitchen,' she admitted. Nicola Sturgeon married Peter Murrell, the SNP's chief executive, in 2010 . 'I like Indian takeaway,' she said, before joking: 'The fact we are on first names terms with the person who delivers it on a Friday night shouldn't allow you to read anything into my lifestyle.' Reid also asked her about whether she had made a decision not to have children. Ms Sturgeon said: 'People have started asking me, 'was it a conscious decision?' It hasn't been, it's just you know life takes certain directions and it doesn't take other directions and that's about as complicated as it gets.' The former solicitor married Mr Murrell in 2010. Together with Alex Salmond and spin doctor Kevin Pringle, they were the four party chieftains who guided the party from multiple election defeats to the brink of breaking up the United Kingdom. Ms Sturgeon has been a member of the Scottish Parliament since 1999. She put her name forward to become SNP leader in 2004, but stood aside when Mr Salmond threw his hat into the ring. She stood as his running mate and became deputy leader for a decade until Mr Salmond quit in the wake of the No vote in September's independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon admitted that during her time in politics she had gained a reputation for being 'scary' with a tough persona. She said: 'Politics is a very male dominated, male driven profession. I was, not just a woman, but a young woman and I suppose you end up trying to behave in a way that you think is expected of you.' 'I am quite driven, I know what I think and I know what I want to achieve but I also hope that people who are asked to describe me, would describe me as pretty down-to-earth, loyal, friendly. The more experience I have got in politics I think the more I have allowed me to shine through.' She refused to speculate how many seats the SNP will win on May 7, but suggested her party would perform better in a coalition than the Lib Dems. 'I'm not going to put a number on it, opinion polls don't win elections, hard work, persuasion, having the best policies and the best ideas for the country wins elections, so we'll try and win as many votes as we can and hope that translates into as many seats as possible. 'The Liberals in my view have got themselves into the position they are in just now which is facing political annihilation in a few weeks time, not because they went into coalition but because they went into coalition and immediately abandoned all of their principals.'","First Minister invites the cameras into her spotless home near Glasgow .

"Vanuatu faces imminent food shortages as accounts emerged of huge damage days after one of the fiercest cyclones on record hit landfall. Communications between many of Vanuatu's 80 islands, most only accessible by boat, were still down after Cyclone Pam swept through the region, and Prime Minister Joe Natuman said it would be at least a week before authorities had a better sense of the destruction. It comes as the parents of an 18-year-old Adelaide girl, who was volunteering on the island of Pentecost, revealed she is yet to make contact with them four days after the deadly cyclone hit. Scroll down for video . The family of  Ally Trueman, 18, who was volunteering on the island of Pentecost, revealed she is yet to make contact with them four days after the deadly cyclone hit . People grieve as they transport the body of 20 year-old Eddy Willy in the back of a vehicle to his burial in the island of Tanna . Children look on from outside their ruined home on the island of Tanna . Ally Trueman, who had taken a gap year to teach on the island, last made contact with her parents on Friday when she sent a text message to say she was seeking shelter from the cyclone. With 24 people so far confirmed dead, the scale of the disaster became clearer with the first teams of aid workers reaching Tanna island, home to 30,000 people. It is some 200 kilometres (124 miles) south of the capital Port Vila, itself badly damaged. Heartbroken families have started returning from evacuation centres across the mainland to find their homes flattened and their belongings strewn across the street. Aid and rescue efforts have been thrown into chaos with communication lines down across the mainland. However, Ally's mother Leanne Trueman is not giving up hope. 'We know the communications are down, and they have to get those up first, but it is really hard,' Leanne Trueman told The Advertiser.

Members of the Yaohnanen tribe on Tanna, Vanuatu, hold photos portraying their revered 'god' Prince Philip . 'Every day after something like that it just gets worse; they run out of water, they run out of food. Ally's village has just one generator.' The United Nations said there were at least 3,300 people sheltering in 37 evacuation centres around the country. UNICEF has estimated that 60,000 children have been affected by the cyclone and virtually all schools were closed. Former Channel 10 television director Adam Boland, who lives in Vanuatu with his partner Kenny Ang, said it was possible there could be more scenarios like Ally's because the country was so widespread. 'I'm now standing on main street of Port Vila and phones are dropping out every few minutes. I can't imagine how hard it is to find out what's happening in remote islands,' Mr Boland told Daily Mail Australia. 'I think the crucial thing to remember is Vanuatu is a country of 80-plus islands. We're in Port Vila where bridges have been washed away and there's villages that have been totally flattened. 'Concrete homes have basically evaporated and a lot of these people have been left with nothing. A father and son stand in the ruins of their home in Port Vila, Vanuatu, after the cyclone hit . Aid and rescue efforts have been thrown into chaos with communication lines down across the mainland and its outer islands due to the cylone that's already claimed 24 lives . 'Some of the stories from the other islands are horrific. It's a developing country, so it wasn't in a position to deal with something this big in the first place.' The Australian couple were forced to seek shelter with Mr Boland's mother near Port Vila last week and haven't been allowed back to their island home as it is still deemed unsafe. 'Our island is completely cut off. People who are there say there's broken glass everywhere from the windows being broken and there's no power or water,' he said. 'We know some of the smaller islands were hit harder and they have fewer resources. It would have been very hard to endure.' About 2,000 people are living in evacuation centres in Port Vila where around 90 per cent of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, according to UNICEF. About 2,000 people are living in evacuation centres in Port Vila where around 90 per cent of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, according to UNICEF .

Samuel and his father Phillip were pictured sifting through the ruins of their family home on Monday several days after the category five cyclone hit . 'A lot of people didn't realise the cyclone would make a direct hit because we told it would (divert),' Mr Boland said. 'The storm itself was terrifying - the power went off really earlier. Everyone bunkered down for eight hours and by the time we got up and walked outside, it was mind boggling. 'I'm looking right now at an outer island - it's normally so lush like a scene out of Jurrasic Park. But now it looks like the Australian outback... there's no leaves on the trees.' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is trying to verify reports a South Australian woman is missing in cyclone-ravaged Vanuatu. Ms Bishop said she was aware of the unconfirmed reports and the government was desperately trying to work out whether they were true. 'The challenge for us is that communications have been down,' she told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday, adding a better assessment was likely with more Australian personnel now on the ground.

"A woman who gained 120lbs as a side effect of her polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder, started shedding the weight after running her first half marathon - and has since lost 135lbs. Michelle Stiglitz, from Staten Island, New York, struggled with her weight her entire life before she was diagnosed with PCOS in 2000. Six years later she managed to slim down by following a grueling diet and exercise plan - but her restricting regimen wasn't sustainable and she soon began piling the pounds back on, gaining 120lbs. In 2013 however, she underwent lap band surgery to help control her weight, and was soon inspired to start running. 'I was always drawn to that finish-line feeling, but I never thought running was possible for me,' she told Woman's Day. Shocking transformation: Michelle Stiglitz, from Staten Island, New York, lost 135lbs after having lap band surgery in 2013 . Starting out: Before she lost the weight (L), Michelle joined a running team and began training for her first half marathon. She finished her second New York City Half Marathon this month (R) 'It was difficult and painful when I was heavier,' she recalled. 'But I was so motivated by my friend's story of how exciting her race was. I knew I wanted to try it.' Michelle completed both the 2014 and 2015 New York City Half Marathons, and now she is training to run a whopping 26.2 miles during the New York City Marathon this November. Her training plan, which includes spin classes, bootcamp classes and weight lifting, as well as running, has helped her lose 135lbs. And now that she has slimmed down, Michelle is slowly but surely gaining her confidence back. New woman: Michelle put on 120lbs as a side effect of her polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder that causes weight gain (L).  After her weight loss surgery, she learned how to control her portions (R) Not easy: Even though Michelle struggled to run when she was heavier, she stuck with it . 'I used to hate dating and think I'd have to settle for just anybody, but I don't feel that way anymore,' she said. 'The most important change is I accept myself.' Michelle noted that although she still has excess skin on her arms and legs, she is finally happy with herself. But getting to this point was far from easy for Michelle, who had tried almost everything to control her weight. Before she was diagnosed with PCOS in her senior year of high school, Michelle had rapidly put on pounds and was starting to lose her hair. Big smile: Michelle can be seen snapping an action selfie during her most recent race . More confident: Michelle said she has gained her confidence back after her weightloss transformation . PCOS made her insulin-resistant, so it was nearly impossible for her to lose weight. She was given various medications and shots - including prescription diet pills - but nothing worked. Michelle eventually hired a personal trainer and followed a strict diet plan that was created for her by a nutritionist. She managed to lose 120lbs over the course of a year, but working out two hours per day and living on a diet of only vegetables and protein left her with little to no social life. When the weight slowly crept back onto her frame, she finally considered lap band surgery, which is intended to reduce the quantity of food consumed. The procedure involves an inflatable device being placed around the top portion of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch, essentially shrinking stomach capacity. Amazing fete: Michelle posed in a black dress (L) before she lost 115lbs and 42.5 inches off her frame (R) Personal win: Michelle can be seen holding the medal she received after she completed the New York City Half Marathon . Michelle noted that she didn't want people to think she had 'taken the easy way out', but she quickly learned it was a 'tool, not a miracle'. She still had to learn how to control her portions and make healthy choices, while maintaining a regular workout schedule. Michelle proudly showed her fifth grade students her completion medal after she completed her first half marathon. And when one of her students congratulated her for winning the race, Michelle didn't correct her, explaining that, in a way, she felt like she had won after overcoming such adversity in order to achieve her goals.","Michelle Stiglitz, from Staten Island, New York, was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in 2000 .

"It has been a bittersweet week for Kristin Scott Thomas. On Thursday the acclaimed actress was at Buckingham Palace to receive her Damehood from the Queen, a reward for a lifetime of achievement – and almost a dress rehearsal for her new West End role playing the Monarch in The Audience. But her delight at the presentation must have involved a moment of quiet reflection, too. For last week was also the anniversary of the death of her father, taken from her in a dramatic fighter plane accident almost half a century ago on March 17, 1966. She was just five. Dame Kristin, 54 – nominated for an Oscar for her mesmerising role in The English Patient – has said little about the loss in public, but recalled that ‘Mummy was pregnant at the time and I can remember when she told us. In one breath it was, “Daddy has had an accident and won’t be coming home and I’m going to have a baby.” So it sort of took the sting out of it’. The exact details of his crash, however, have remained shrouded in secrecy – like so much else associated with the Cold War – until now, thanks to the release of a recently declassified air investigation report. Heartbreaking: Dame Kristin Scott Thomas was only five when her father was killed in a dramatic fighter plane accident . It reveals that Lieutenant Commander Simon Thomas was flying a Sea Vixen jet when it exploded after crashing into the sea off the Dorset coast. He was taking part in a training exercise for a type of mission that has since been described as ‘perhaps the most stupid, and potentially suicidal attacks ever invented’. The Sea Vixen was in the vanguard of a new generation of high-speed jets that relied on swept wings and two Rolls-Royce engines to achieve near-supersonic speed. They were designed for aircraft carriers for night-time flying and one of their tasks would be to attack Soviet ships in the event of a war. Astonishingly, of the 145 Sea Vixens built, 54 were lost in accidents and 55 crew members killed during the 13 years of frontline service with the Fleet Air Arm from 1959 to 1972. This was a worse rate of attrition than the notorious F-104 Starfighter, which became known as the ‘Widowmaker’ in Cold War West Germany because 30 per cent were lost to accidents. Lieut Cmdr Thomas, the report reveals, was the designated leader when he and three other Sea Vixen pilots lined up on the runway on the night of March 17. They were tasked with taking off from air base HMS Heron, in Yeovilton, Somerset, and attacking a target being pulled by a frigate, HMS Zulu, off Portland in Dorset. Horrific: Lieutenant Commander Simon Thomas was killed during a dangerous night-time training mission . With classic military understatement the report states that they faced ‘unpleasant conditions’, which included poor visibility, fog patches and a pitch black night. Furthermore, it was believed to have been Thomas’s first attempt at firing Glow Worm flares since he had returned to frontline duties after working as a Vixen flying instructor. The notorious flares were designed to illuminate the target prior to attack but had already been involved in a succession of accidents. As the leader, Thomas was expected to fire off the flares above the frigate so that they would illuminate the target in silhouette. The following three Sea Vixens were then tasked with attacking the dummy ship in quick succession before the leader himself would launch the final attack. All four were supposed to roll into a dive before firing off their rockets at the target at a pre-ordained angle and altitude. However, the training mission was dogged with bad luck from the outset, with one of the Sea Vixens failing to make it off the runway. The three others took off and assumed the attack formation, with Thomas in the lead, to a point 20 miles south of HMS Zulu. But then Vixen No 2 lost his radar and, after trying to maintain his position, was instructed by Thomas to return to base. This meant that No 3 assumed the No 2 position and the two remaining Vixens turned to prepare for the attack. On their first run, Thomas failed to fire the flares. Both planes turned round for a second run, but the new No 2 struggled to maintain position. By the time they were in position for a second strike, the crew of No 2 suddenly realised that HMS Zulu had changed its orientation and was now directly behind the target as they approached it. Worried their missiles could hit the frigate instead of the target it was towing, they aborted the attack for safety reasons. The report adds that the crew of No 2 heard Thomas call ‘turning in’ in preparation for his attack and ‘some five to ten seconds [later] the pilot noticed a flash’. Zulu’s crew also saw an explosion, which turned out to be Lieut Cmdr Thomas’s aircraft hitting the water and exploding. Thomas was killed instantly and his co-pilot, Lieutenant John Harvey, was listed as missing. Dame Kristin, born in Cornwall in 1960, later said that after the news of her father’s death ‘we went down to school and everybody had to be nice to us and we didn’t really understand why. Kids are so resilient. It’s only later that you realise what a terrible shock it was. I can still remember him. It’s like having a little film playing in your head. I can still remember his smell, it’s really weird. The thing that breaks my heart is the smell of engine oil’. Indeed, she has been doubly unfortunate. Kristin’s widowed mother went on to marry another Fleet Air Arm pilot, Simon Idiens, who died in another air accident in 1972. Lieutenant Commander Thomas was flying a Sea Vixen jet (pictured) when it exploded after crashing into the sea off the Dorset coast . Author Tony Buttler, in his book about the Sea Vixen, branded the Glow Worm manoeuvre, for which Lieut Cmdr Thomas was practising, ‘perhaps the most stupid, and potentially suicidal attack ever invented. Once the leader had fired the flares he had to bank left hard, climb to 4,000ft, come up behind the fourth Sea Vixen, a complex manoeuvre complicated further by the fact he had to switch on his weapons panel, which meant switching hands on the control stick, while turning his head to locate the weapons switch’. All of this was happening while the jet was maintaining a steep bank climb and the pilot was subjected to considerable G-forces. It was a recipe for disorientation and disaster. The conclusion to the MoD report offers little solace, indirectly blaming HMS Zulu and the exercise. Sir Mark Thomson, a former Sea Vixen pilot, said: ‘When you are flying at night there is no horizon. You have disorientation in relation to the ground or surface, where the ship is. You have the disorientation in relation to where the other planes are as you look in and out of the cockpit. ‘You are also looking for the weapons switch on your right side and if you are flying with your right hand you either switch hands or reach over with your left hand. ‘I can see Simon now. He was absolutely magical, the most wonderful and enchanting guy. There was no better-looking couple and while I can see Deborah in Kristin, Kristin also looks just like her father. ‘She has that classic English look with those high cheekbones. Simon and Deborah had star quality. Life can be so cruel, especially to Deborah. She even had a boyfriend between the two Simons and he was also killed in a flying accident.’","Kristin Scott Thomas's father died in a dramatic fighter plane accident .

"Fans: The Queen and Prince Philip using a Defender in 1968 . Jaguar Land Rover yesterday breathed new life into its iconic Defender – a favourite of the Queen. It confirmed that it will create a new version of the 4x4 and also said the existing model will continue to roll off the production line. But amid announcements of the firm's £600million investment in the UK it said neither model would be made in Britain. There had been rumours that a factory would be created in Coventry, possibly to build the revamped Defender. Manufacture of the current version of the all-terrain vehicle, first made in 1948 and one of the first cars owned by the Queen after she came to the throne in 1952, is due to end in December after a series of special editions roll off the production line. But it is understood that the new model will be built abroad. A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover, owned by Indian industrial giant Tata, said: 'We will create a new version of the Defender but no decision has been made on where it will be built or when.' Commenting on the future of the existing model, the spokesman added: 'We are investigating the possibility of maintaining production of the current Defender at an overseas production facility for sale outside of the EU, after we cease building in the UK.' This could mean it being built at Jaguar Land Rover's factories in Brazil or China. Three-quarters of the two million Defenders built since launch are still in regular use. A prototype of the new generation 4x4 was unveiled in 2011, and yesterday's announcement brings it a step closer. But at the heart of Jaguar Land Rover's current plans are a £400million revamp of its Castle Bromwich site in the West Midlands, including a £320million body shop to manufacture the XF, the new all-aluminium sports saloon. The remodelled car was launched earlier this week with a dramatic stunt – being driven on wires over water in London's Docklands. Jaguar Land Rover also said it was doubling the size of its advanced design and engineering centre in Whitley, Coventry, at a cost of £50million, 'to support the company's creation of high-technology, ultra-low emission vehicles'. The plans are expected to create thousands more jobs on top of the 32,300 people the firm already employs in the UK. Jaguar Land Rover is also funding a £150million research complex – the National Automotive Innovation Centre – in partnership with Warwick University. Chief executive Dr Ralf Speth said the venture demonstrated its 'unwavering support to the British automotive industry'. He added: 'This investment, made here in the heart of our UK business operations, signals the confidence we have in this region to support the creation, engineering and manufacture of ultra low-emission, premium British products.'

"A man who has not been in Italy is always conscious of an inferiority, from not having seen what it is expected a man should see.

Suitable, that is, if you were living in the 18th Century, when the rich and titled minority wafted around Florence and Rome as part of their Grand Tour, allowing travel to broaden their minds before bringing back new ideas to influence our architecture, landscape and gardening. The cities they visited overflowed with statues and art, some of which they bought on the cheap, or pinched when the Italians were looking the other way. Though Tuscany can sometimes seem overcrowded, it’s still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories (pictured: San Gimignano and its towers) Johnson would be surprised to see how popular Italian cities have become nowadays: visitors are well advised to arrive outside the summer peak when sightseeing can be hard (and sometimes positively dangerous given the rise of the selfie-stick – the ultimate stupidity of modern- day tourism). E. M. Forster took a wry look at the early days of mass tourism to Italy at the end of the 19th Century in A Room With A View. When the young heroine Lucy Honeychurch finds herself in the church of Santa Croce without her Baedeker guidebook, Forster is expressing the horror of the intellectual at the worrying rise of the ‘uneducated’ tourist. He went so far as to wonder whether there ought to be some sort of intelligence test imposed at Dover to weed out the truly stupid traveller. But today’s tourists don’t come to Tuscany so much to learn as to ‘experience’. The treasures of the Uffizi or an up-close sight of David in Florence’s Accademia Gallery are stirring in their own right – you don’t really need to know their place in the history of Renaissance art in order to enjoy them. Chianciano Terme was called Fontes Clusinae by the Romans, and they made use of its thermal springs . In Florence you can assimilate the art and savour it, just as you might imbibe a glass of fine Italian wine. The problem is that at busy times, it’s hard to find the space to enjoy either the art or the wine. But though Tuscany can sometimes seem overcrowded, it’s still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories. Mine are of a pleasant three-star hotel in a place named Chianciano Terme, about 50 miles south-east of Siena, which was our base. The Romans called it Fontes Clusinae, and made use of its thermal springs, as visitors still do. I have good memories, too, of the Tuscan landscape, with its well-tended fields and vineyards, its olive groves and cypress trees. I like being in a countryside that has not been neglected, or turned into a theme park for townies. In this regard, Tuscany is rewarding. The ‘Chianti Classico’ area, which lies between Florence and Siena, still looks much as it was when it was painted by the great Renaissance artists who assumed that the Holy Land must have looked a lot like Tuscany – so this is what you see in the background of various scenes of holy birth and crucifixion. As you pass through this land, you enjoy divine views across glorious sprawling vineyards; a view occasionally interrupted by stunningly picturesque castles. Writer John Carter's tour leader called Tuscany's Sam Gimignano 'a medieval Manhattan' Of course, other countries have beautiful landscapes, but few can match Tuscany for its sublime, gentle sweetness. Leonardo was born in the small town of Vinci which lies in this magnificent scenery – a final confirmation that the area is touched by genius. We ate well, naturally, and drank moderately well, too. Some of my fellow travellers discovered a red wine named Nobile di Montepulciano, which they found most acceptable. Our base was just five miles or so from Montepulciano, so supplies were guaranteed. We went to San Gimignano, which our tour leader called ‘a medieval Manhattan’ – and it wasn’t the first time I’d heard it described that way, unfortunately. Its towers are most impressive, though it seems to take a greater pride in its ice cream. We liked San Gimignano, mainly because there weren’t so many people, but also because we were left to our own devices and could make up our own minds about the place without being told all sorts of stuff by a local guide. I’m in two minds about local guides. They do tell you lots of useful things, but have a tendency to tell you too much, so everything blurs. Travelsphere (travelsphere.co.uk, 0800 987 5110) offers and eight-day Treasures Of Tuscany tour with prices starting from £604. This includes return flights from Gatwick, transfers, half-board, accommodation, transport and some excursions. Florence provided a good example of this. The guide there told us about artists and sculptors and architects and the ruling families of medieval times. She gave the names of the buildings and their histories. And dates; masses of dates. At the end of it all, I was most confused. But the guide never mentioned the Florence that might have made English visitors prick up their ears. Indeed, she had never even heard of Florence Nightingale who was born in that city and was given its name. The Nightingale family had a penchant for strange first names: Florence’s elder sister Parthenope was called after an ancient name for Naples, where the family was living at the time of her birth. I suppose that both girls were glad that at the time of their births, the family had not been living in Croydon… .","It’s possible to return from overcrowded Tuscany with treasured memories .

"Fined: Akthar Khan was handed a £4,000 fine and ordered to pay £21,869 in costs after one of his workers lost his fingers while working in his Birmingham supermarket . A food shop owner who was back using a food mincer less than an hour after it had sliced off the fingers of a part-time employee has been ordered to pay out more than £25,000. Akthar Khan - who used Fairy Liquid and hot water to clean the machine - was also handed an eight month suspended sentence after earlier admitting a single breach of health and safety regulations. Judge James Burbidge QC described Khan's management as 'woeful', and said: 'It is beyond belief the machine was still being used even after a man lost his fingers.' Birmingham Magistrates Court had previously heard Aston's Ash Food Fare's meat slicer had lost its safety guard a month before Mr Iqbal lost his fingers in October 2012. Staff had been using a plunger to insert meat since the breakage, the city's magistrates' court heard. Fellow workers heard Mr Iqbal screaming  as he placed his right hand inside the machine, which continued to operate as an ambulance crew rushed to the shop. A paramedic only recovered three of Mr Iqbal's fingers after the machine was dismantled. But an hour later a police officer arrived to find the machine was back in use and one of the employees said washing liquid had been used to clean it. Khan, 57, then admitted he had used Fairy Liquid. Barry Berlin, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Abdul (the manager) said he used Fairy Liquid and hot water to clean it, which was fairly inadequate. 'He then passed vegetables through it before using it. There was no safe system of work here at all. 'We have looked and we can't find any steps he (Khan) took to protect his staff from the unguarded mincer.' Simon Morgan, defending, maintained Khan, of Witton, Birmingham, knew nothing of the missing hand guard - but said he fully accepted responsibility and 'bitterly regrets the injury caused'. 'He is 57 years of age, has no previous convictions, he is very highly regarded,' Mr Morgan said. 'He has worked extremely hard all his life.' Mr Morgan said Khan had also carried out good work for the benefit of the community spanning two decades. Suspended: Khan, 57, was a 'woeful' manager, according to Judge James Burbidge QC . Judge Burbidge said: 'You should have been more proactive and should be well attuned, given your position in the community, to follow basic safety procedures. 'If you had been, Mr Iqbal would not have suffered that traumatic amputation.' Khan was ordered to pay a £4,000 fine and £21,869 in costs.","Ash Food Fair owner Akhtar Khan admitted safety breach after accident .

"Mystery continues to surround the disappearance of a young Kansas City woman who left her home one night in February and was found dead eight days later in a well behind a locked gate in a remote part of a city park. New surveillance footage has now emerged of her the night after her disappearance. Janina Vasquez, 27, known to loved ones as Nina, left the home she shares with her mother, Jennie Cochran, and stepfather in Overland Park, Missouri, on the night of February 11. At 10 p.m. that night she texted her stepfather and told him that she was going to stay the night with 'Allen and Nicole' and would be back the next day. The first mystery is the identity of Allen and Nicole – Vasquez’s mother had not heard of them before. Surveillance footage released by the Kansas City Police Department shows Janina Vasquez at the Isle of Capri Casino on February 12. She left the casino at 7:40 p.m. in a red car with an unknown driver . Vasquez left home on the night of February 11 and texted her stepfather telling him that she was going to stay the night with 'Allen and Nicole' and would be back the next day . The following day Vasquez was seen on the new surveillance footage leaving the Isle of Capri Casino at approximately 7:40 p.m. Detectives say she got into a red car driven by an unknown person, and they want to speak with that driver or anyone who saw her get into the car. No one saw or heard from Vasquez again until the discovery of her body in a 25 feet deep flood control well at Richard Berkley Riverfront Park  on February 19. Scroll down for video . The park is immediately next to the casino on the banks of the Missouri River and a heritage trail links the two. She was found wearing the gray Victoria Secret sweatsuit she was last seen in, but the jacket was tied around her waist despite the weather being so cold during the eight days she was missing. Her cell phone was in one of her burgundy boots and her ID was found in the other, but her bra, underwear and socks, and the burgundy North Face backpack she was carrying are all missing. The park itself is one mile from where her cell phone last pinged a signal tower, on February 12 – at the intersection of Third and Cherry streets, approximately a mile and a half from the casino. Vasquez was found dead in a flood control well behind a locked gate in a city park. She was wearing the gray sweatsuit she is seen wearing in surveillance footage, but with no underwear and the top tied around her waist . The well where Vasquez's body was found is in a remote part of the Richard Berkley Riverfront Park on the Missouri River a short walk from the casino . Vasquez was found with a severe injury to the back of her head that would have killed her almost instantly. Both of her wrists were also fractured. Added to the mystery is that Vasquez suffered from seizures and post-traumatic stress disorder and took several pain and anxiety medications at the time of her death. She therefore does not drive and could not have walked to the park. Someone had to have picked her up. It also would have been close to impossible for Vasquez to get inside the security fence that surrounds the well, let alone lift the heavy grate on top of it. Vasquez is described as creative, a hippie-type that named her dog Ziggy Marley, and who would paint to help relieve her health issues. ‘It’s been a nightmare; just that area and knowing that she was cold and frozen and alone,’ Cochran told Fox 4. ‘Obviously she got mixed up [with] somebody, something happened.’ ‘Who was she with between February 11 and February 19 and why was she in that park? Who took her to the park? We’re not getting these answers,’ said Cochran. Anyone with information can call the KCPD Homicide Unit at (816) 234-5043 or the TIPS Hotline at (816) 474-TIPS.

"An Ohio kindergarten teacher who  resigned in December following felony drug possession charges is accused of secretly recording his  students in the bathroom. Elliot Gornall, 32, a former teacher at  R.F. McMullen Elementary School, is found to have allegedly used a tiny spy camera hung inside a plastic hook on the wall of his classroom's bathroom, according to prosecutors. He had dozens of videos featuring 25 separate students on his personal computer which were taken by authorities during a drug raid at his home in November. Gornall faces 25 felony charges including 23 counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, as well as two counts of attempting the same crime. If convicted, he could face up to 184 years in prison, according to the Mansfield News Journal. Scroll down for video . Elliot Gornall, 32, a former kindergartner teacher at R.F. McMullen Elementary School, was found to have allegedly used a tiny spy camera hung inside a plastic hook on the wall of his classroom's bathroom, according to prosecutors (above a November 2014 photo of the teacher) He faces 25 felony charges including 23 counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, and two counts of attempting the same crime. Gornall resigned from teaching in December after being arrested for felony drug possession (above Gornall talks to his attorney Andrew Hyde during his arraignment hearing in Ohio on December 23, 2014) He had worked in the district for four years following clean background checks and had been moved to the kindergarten classroom in 2014, according to officials. Gornall was arrested on Friday and is being held in the Ashland County Jail, according to The Columbus Dispatch. 'The thought that a previously trusted kindergarten teacher would take advantage of young children in this way is horrifying,' said Ashland County Prosecutor Chris Tunnell in a statement announcing the charges on Saturday. The former teacher was found to have not only filmed students in his homeroom but also kindergartners who came into his classroom for end-of-day activities, said district spokesman Matt Dole. 'He was well-liked by students, staff and parents,' said Annette Gorrell, principal at R.F. McMullen Elementary School. 'The betrayal is huge.' Gornall taught both second and third-grade students before moving to the kindergarten classroom, and there is no indication that anything happened with his previous students, who he had taught before August, said Annette Gorrell, principal at the school. Parents of the students learned of the incident on Saturday said they felt both betrayed and angry. 'First, it's anger. Then, you're upset. And then you just feel betrayed,' said John Carroll, a member of the school board and also a parent of a child who was videotaped. 'We feel so hurt that our child was violated in this way.' Gornall's computer was examined by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and videos were found dating back to around August 20 to mid-November (above an Gornall pictured in an undated photo) Gornall resigned from teaching last year after being arrested for felony drug possession. He was charged related to prescription-drug abuse and marijuana in December, along with a misdemeanor count of receiving stolen property when authorities said they discovered children's underwear while raiding his home in relation to the drug charges. He pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. Investigators then confiscated his home computer and contacted the school. Gornall's computer was examined by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and videos were found dating back to around August 20 to mid-November, said Tunnell. 'We are responsible for every teacher and staff member who works here and when one of them breaks the law, we take it very seriously,' she said. Investigators said none of the videos were uploaded online or shared in any way, and there is no indication any students were physically abused or touched inappropriately (above file photo of RF McMullen Elementary School) Investigators said none of the videos were uploaded online or shared in any way, and there is no indication any students were physically abused or touched inappropriately. School officials said they do not plan to address their students about the allegations but will have counselors available, and a letter will go out to the district on Monday. 'The kindergartners are innocent,' said Gorrell. 'We are hoping that they don't have to hear about this.' Gornall was taken into custody on Friday and is expected in court on Monday.","Elliot Gornall, 32, was former teacher at RF McMullen Elementary School where he resigned from teaching last year following felony drug charges .

"A 13-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to murdering a builder after a row outside a block of flats, making him one of Britain's youngest killers. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted stabbing 53-year-old Christopher John Barry to death in Edmonton, north London, in December last year. Mr Barry was said to have been involved in a row with a group of youths trying to get into a party at another address in the block of flats where he lived. A 13-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to murdering builder Christopher John Barry after a row outside a block of flats, making the teenager one of Britain's youngest killers . Mr Barry was said to have been involved in a row with a group of youths trying to get into a party at the block of flats in Edmonton, north London . The attack happened as he returned home with his girlfriend, council worker Sabrina Finn. He was followed into the building by two of the boys before being stabbed in the chest, police said. Ambulance crews attended but he was pronounced dead on the doorstep of his own home. The defendant's parents as well as relatives of Mr Barry, who was known as Jack and was originally from Cobh, Ireland, all attended the Old Bailey for the five-minute hearing. After being brought into the dock from custody, the boy spoke to his father briefly before the charge was put to him by the court clerk. When asked to confirm his name, the boy replied: 'Erm ... yes.' The attack happened as Mr Barry (left) returned home with his girlfriend, council worker Sabrina Finn (right) His guilty plea to a single count of murder was almost inaudible. Dressed in a light blue shirt and grey school trousers, he was remanded into youth custody by judge Anthony Morris. The judge ordered a pre-sentence report ahead of sentencing on April 10, where the teenager will face a minimum of 12 years in prison. Detective Chief Inspector Neale Baldock, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, who is leading the investigation, said at the time of the murder: 'The victim and this group were not known to each other - what started as a minor verbal altercation has escalated into a shocking act of violence.' Residents of the block of flats described seeing 'blood everywhere' on the landing outside Mr Barry's home on the night he was killed. Shifal Kemal, 38, a neighbour of Mr Barry, described him as a 'nice man' who always smiled when he greeted people. Mr Barry was said to have been involved in a row with a group of youths trying to get into a party at another address in the block of flats when he was stabbed . The NHS worker said: 'I cried quite a lot when I heard. I knew Jack slightly to smile and say hello to, but I know his girlfriend Sabrina more, and she is a lovely, lovely girl. 'We've been living here for nearly eight years and I think they must have been living here for around the same time. 'He was such a nice man. Every time we saw him he would always be really polite, smile, and say hello. 'They both worked and would leave early in the morning and come back late in the evening, so we didn't know too much about them. But they are both lovely people, who kept themselves to themselves.' Another neighbour Steven Gregory, 42, said Miss Finn had complained about homeless people getting into the block of homes. He said: 'They would leave beer cans, and cigarettes everywhere. We've always had troubles with people trying to get into the block, this times it looks like it was kids.' Miss Kemal added: 'It's terrible and quite scary. 'We've always had trouble in this block with homeless people getting in and causing a nuisance on the stairwell or landings, and leaving lots of rubbish behind. 'We've also had problems with kids getting into the building, and knocking on doors.'","Boy, 13, admits stabbing a builder outside a block of flats in north London .

"It's good while it lasts. Adoring crowds, glittering black-tie events and lucrative opportunities to spin turntables in nightclubs, open supermarkets or turn on Christmas tree lights. However, when the showbiz spotlight dims, what happens to those faces who once graced our television screens on a regular basis can seem relatively cruel... they have to get a proper job. Pictures emerged this week of Daniella Westbrook, once the darling of the Queen Vic pub in EastEnders, pulling pints to make ends meet in a real-life London boozer. Star of the bar: Former Eastenders actress Daniella Westbrook has been doing shifts at The Bill Nicholson pub in Tottenham, North London. Daniella tweeted that the pub work made her feel 'useful' Life imitating art: Daniella (left) played Peggy Mitchell's daughter Sam in the hit soap from the age of 16. The actress, 41, pictured earlier this year (right), has since fallen on harder times . Daniella, 41, has been putting in shifts behind the bar at The Bill Nicholson in Tottenham. Describing her new vocation on Twitter, the out-of-work actress said: 'I help my mate at her pub @thebillnicn17 it makes me feel useful and I laugh all day.' Daniella, who was cast as Peggy Mitchell's daughter Sam in EastEnders when she was just 16, famously battled a cocaine addiction which forced her septum, the bridge under the nose, to collapse. In recent years, the actress has appeared on reality television and even had a stint in Los Angeles, but is now keeping herself busy in the footballing pub, a stone's throw from the Spurs ground. Daniella isn't the only famous face forced to roll up her sleeves and get a real job though. Westlife hearthrob Mark Feehily, who once toured the globe as part of Irish supergroup Westlife, has been spotted brewing up coffees and selling crepes in his foodie van, which parks up at festivals. Although the singer is about to embark on a solo singing career, Mark - now preferring to be called Markus, is proud of his tea-making skills.

From Platt to that: Sean Wilson, who trod the cobbles of Weatherfield as Martin Platt (pictured with onscreen wife Gail, left) for 21 years has turned his hand to cheese-making with the Saddlesworth Cheese Company . He told the Mirror: 'It's my business and I love it, anything I get involved in I get involved 110%. 'A couple of Irish people came up and were like ""Wait a minute, what are you doing in a van?"" 'I love festivals, so why not?' He's not the only one serving up culinary delights. Former actor Sean Wilson, who played Martin Platt in Coronation Street for 21 years, is now making cheese for a living. Sean swapped the cobbles of Weatherfield for a role in the Saddlesworth Cheese Company based in Lancashire. Eighties' television heroes who turned to alternative careers when the work dried up have included Tom Watt, who graced the screens as asthmatic Lofty in EastEnders, and is now a football writer and Zammo from Grange Hill, who keeps people secure with a locksmith and key-cutting shop in Surrey. A long way from the classrooms of Grange Hill: Lee McDonald aka Zammo, star of the hit 'Just Say No' teen drugs campaign in the Eighties, now runs a locksmith and key-cutting shop in Surrey .

Former Holby City star Jeremy Edwards, 44, also admitted that he's not afraid to get his hands dirty when the fickle finger of fame isn't pointing in his direction. Back in 2011, Jeremy was spotted hauling bricks into a skip in London in a bid to fill in the gaps between working. He said at the time: 'I really don't see the shame in manual labour. I don't know any actors who work consistently without other work. He added: 'There's a lucky few, but not many, I had a good ten-year run!' One-time Emmerdale starlet Adele Silva might have been on the receiving end of fashion freebies at the height of her soap career. A failed attempt to make it across the pond in Hollywood saw the actress forced to resort to a plan B...working as an assistant at a Ted Baker store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. She said at the time: 'I'm a jobbing actress and in this climate you can either sell your soul or do an honest day's work.' Adele, 34, is now back in the UK and expecting her first child.","Ex-EastEnder Daniella, 41, has been working at The Bill Nicholson pub in Tottenham .

"Rona Fairhead was under further pressure to resign as head of the BBC Trust last night following an intervention from a predecessor. Michael Lyons said she should consider whether the public still trusted her in light of her involvement with HSBC when the bank allegedly helped wealthy clients evade tax. Mrs Fairhead, who received more than £500,000 in fees and benefits from HSBC last year, has been asked to resign by MPs who accused her of either being naive or incompetent. The 53-year-old businesswoman, who is paid £110,000 a year as BBC chairman, insists she knew nothing about any wrongdoing at HSBC. Scroll down for video . Scolded: BBC chairman Rona Fairhead (pictured) was grilled by a group of MPs and her predecessor who called for her to stand down from her post . But Sir Michael, who chaired the BBC's governing body from 2007 to 2011, said her reputation had been damaged. 'She has to ask herself whether, in the substance and process of what she has been through, it has damaged her ability to speak on behalf of the licence fee payer,' he said. 'Is Rona confident she can command public support? If she has any hesitation about that, she can't do the job.' Some MPs took an even tougher line yesterday, lambasting Mrs Fairhead's ability to hold the BBC to account, and calling on her to step down. 'I don't trust her to be right sort of person to do that job,' said John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley. 'She just swallows what she's told and doesn't challenge anything. She's not doing her job. She was not at all convincing. 'One of the problems with cover-ups is that senior directors don't ask questions. The BBC has its own cover-ups and [the HSBC scandal] raises questions about whether Rona is the right person to examine them.' Labour MP Helen Goodman said Mrs Fairhead would have to take action to restore her credibility: 'She needs to give a much better explanation than she did [on Monday] to the public accounts committee and needs to show that her own financial interests will not in any way influence editorial policy.' Conflict of interests: Mrs Fairhead received more than £500,000 from HSBC last year and is currently paid £110,000 a year for her role at the BBC . Mrs Goodman added: 'She should consider whether she should be a director at HSBC. She needs to choose between them. How many jobs does a woman need?' Mrs Fairhead has been a director of HSBC since 2004 – longer than the decade recommended as a maximum tenure for good corporate governance – and remains on its board. She was also head of its audit committee for three years, between 2007 and 2010. Her pay last year included a £334,000 fee as non-executive director of HSBC North America Holdings. She earns a further £130,000 as a non-executive director of PepsiCo. She was one of a panel of HSBC bosses hauled in front of the Commons public accounts committee and who spent the session trying to blame others for the tax evasion scandal at its division in Switzerland. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, told Mrs Fairhead she was not fit for her BBC post.","BBC Trust head Rona Fairhead received over £500,000 from HSBC last year .

"Last week she was unveiling her new clothing collection for Dorothy Perkins in Newcastle and today she's modelling her summer range, so is Amy Childs Essex's most successful export? It would appear so. The beautician-turned-designer, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, became a millionaire thanks to her burgeoning brand - and there's just no stopping her. Speaking to FEMAIL about her chic new range of springtime skater dresses, peplums, strappy tops, and feminine blouses, Amy, 23, said: 'I’ve really branched out for SS15. 'I wanted to give more options for all the girls out there who are going on holiday, going out, going to a lovely spring wedding - all of those things.' Scroll down for video . Amy Childs has unveiled her new springtime collection of shape-enhancing dresses that she designed for a holiday romance . She continued: 'I wanted to give the lovely ladies something to dress up in that updated their wardrobe but also flatters. I always sit down and think about what everyone wants in a collection, I look on twitter, ask my friends and my mum and look at trends. It’s a long process but I love it.' Amy has certainly been shaking things up in the wardrobe department and says while she believes people sometimes see her as one dimensional, she says that behind closed doors she'd love to go wild with her style. 'I’d love to be a style chameleon,' she said. 'I’m always looking in magazines at celebrity style and campaign shots. I style my friends sometimes and they style me; I love trying new things.' Amy says that she wanted to give the 'lovely ladies' something to dress up in that updated their wardrobe but also flatters and admits she's been thinking long and hard about her new designs . While her former TOWIE co-stars do support her fashion career, Amy has her sights set on Hollywood and would love to dress Khloe Kardashian and Dakota Johnson in her designs . Despite her successes, Amy still believes that, like Victoria Beckham, it's difficult to be taken seriously as a designer after finding fame in another industry. 'I’ve tried hard to break out of that TOWIE box and I think I’ve done that,' she said. 'I was only on there for two seasons but people instantly pigeon hole you as ""Essex"", but that’s not what I’m about and my collection is for everyone; I don’t just design for TOWIE fans.' While her former co-stars do support her fashion career, Amy has her sights set on Hollywood. 'I’d love to dress Dakota Johnson,' she admitted. 'She’s so stunning. She has such striking features that she can really have fun with her fashion and still look elegant. Khloe Kardashian is another one - she has such amazing curves and is so stunning. I would love to have her in one of my dresses; she would look amazing.' Amy believes that, like Victoria Beckham, it's difficult to be taken seriously as a designer after finding fame in another industry . Amy  loves looking at celebrity style and campaign shots for design inspiration and loves to style her friends . For now, Amy will be donning her own designs as she jets off on holiday with friends for some 'sun, sea and sangria'. 'I’m really looking forward to relaxing somewhere sunny with friends – I spend most of the year being businesswoman Amy so it’ll be nice to kick back and just be fun Amy,' she said. 'I go on holiday with my best friend usually; I would love to share it with someone special though, maybe in the future?,' she teased. She does, however, admit that men 'definitely' struggle to approach her because of who she is. She said: 'Some of my guy friends say they’ve heard that guys have not come and said ""hi"" to me as they were intimidated. I don’t get it though.' So what kind of relationship is Amy looking for? 'One like the Beckhams',' she said. 'They have their own businesses and things going on yet they still make time for each other to be a family. That’s the perfect relationship: still doing what you love and having that person to come home to.' Amy will be donning her own designs as she jets off on holiday with friends for some 'sun, sea and sangria'","Amy, 23, models vibrant new range of chic dresses .

"While die-hard One Direction fans are in mourning after Zayn Malik's after his shock exit from the band, others are taking to social media to mock the news - and it's hilarious. Trav Roebuck, the producer of Hamish and Andy's radio show, has tweeted a screen grab of his comical search on SEEK looking for listings for a new band member for One Direction. 'Dear SEEK jobs - I feel there's a potential viral marketing opportunity here. Love Trav,' his tweet read along with an image of his search for 'One Direction band member.' The cheeky Seek ad follows Zayn Malik's shock exit from the pop group . Trav Roebuck tweeted SEEK after a failed search for advertisements to be One Direction's next band member . SEEK's humorous response read 'Dear Trav, we only allow quality jobs on site.. we've got 'Styles', you see ;)' Perhaps the most hilarious part was SEEK's punny Twitter response. 'Dear Trav, we only allow quality jobs on site... we've got 'Styles', you see ;) Love SEEK,' the job-search site responded. 'I legitimately hoped someone on SEEK had that idea and had posted an ad, which is why I searched in the first place,' Trav told Daily Mail Australia. 'I tweeted them hoping they'd have a sense of humour and tweet back - but I definitely didn't expect that!' SEEK did not bow out of the Twitter war and continued to post comical One Direction puns to Trav . '@seekjobs was hoping you'd 'Malik' an exception ;)' one of Trav's responses to SEEK read . The job-search site used lyrics from the One Direction song 'Up All Night' to continue the pun war . Radio producer Trav Roebuck (right) was impressed with SEEK's social media department's sense of humour . This response launched an amusing pun war with many of Trav's followers and SEEK itself. 'These puns are becoming a real Payne,' read one of the tweets. Surprisingly, SEEK was not done and were keen to still be part of the fun. 'We're going to be kept 'up all night' with this One Direction infection...' SEEK added. 'Was hoping you'd Malik an exception,' Trav responded. The 2Day FM producer questioned SEEK's 1D knowledge and believed there was some Googling going on . Queensland Police have also had their share of comedic genius after posting that the wet roads in the morning could have been due to One Direction fans crying . The job-search company have not been the first to make a humorous comment relating to Zayn Malik's exit from One Direction. The Queensland Police Service Facebook page posted a comment on Thursday morning, warning commuters to watch out for the slippery roads. 'Take it easy on the wet roads this morning. Possibly being added to from the tears of One Direction and Top Gear fans,' it read. The lighthearted post also hash-tagged '1D,' and has nearly 40,000 likes. Trav admits he loved the positivity that the job-search site extended. 'I love companies with a great social media department, especially a company you wouldn't expect,' he said. 'Although, I do suspect there was a bit of googling members/ song titles going on between tweets!' On Wednesday, Zayn Malik announced that he wanted out of the pop group, who had found fame in 2010 on the UK X Factor. Crazed fans have gone into meltdown, some even taking to self harm in a bid for the star to return to the group.","Radio producer Trav Roebuck tweeted SEEK a screen grab of his search looking for advertisements for a new One Direction band member .

"A funeral had to be delayed after the body of an overweight hospital patient froze solid and got stuck inside the mortuary freezer. A report said that due to the way the body had frozen hospital staff were unable to remove it from its compartment in time to make the deadline for the funeral service. Eventually the freezer had to be turned off to allow time for the body to thaw out so that it could be removed and a funeral was held later. Shocking revelation: A funeral had to be delayed after the body of an overweight hospital patient froze solid and got stuck inside the mortuary freezer at King's College Hospital last year . A King's College Hospital spokesperson said: 'It is vital that deceased patients are treated with dignity and respect when under our care. 'We informed the patient's family when we became aware of this incident, and apologised for any distress caused. We have introduced new procedures to prevent this from happening again, and are undertaking a review of our mortuary facilities.' The incident at Kings College Hospital, in London, was one of 87 incidents last year recorded by the Human Tissue Authority where there was a mishap with a dead body. In gruesome blunder uncovered at Warwick Hospital a body was found to contain the brain from another patient which had been put inside the body by mistake after a post mortem examination. A bewildered funeral director spotted the error as he realised his body's brain had not been removed so the extra organ had to belong to another person. Eventually the mix-up was sorted out and the brain was put back in the body it had been taken from. At Southampton General Hospital there was an incident where all the spaces in the deep freeze were taken up so a body was put in a body bag and placed in a fridge. Gruesome mishap: At Warwick Hospital, above, a body was found to contain the brain from another patient which had been put inside the body by mistake after a post mortem examination . However, staff monitoring the body became concerned as it started to smell and show signs of decomposition. The report also lists seven occasions last year where the wrong body was released to funeral directors. Fortunately in all the cases the error was eventually spotted and the body returned. At Eastbourne Hospital, in Sussex, a body was damaged when it fell off a trolley after not having been loaded properly and at West Suffolk Hospital a body released to the funeral directors was found to have two rings missing from it. There were also reports of problems with mortuary fridges and freezers including one case where the door was accidentally left open which raised the temperature and others where the machines broke down.","Staff at King's College Hospital unable to remove body from compartment .

"Two elephants saved the day Tuesday after an 18-wheeler in which they were being hauled from New Orleans to Texas nearly tipped over were it not for their help. They were two of three Asian elephants in the truck being transported from Florida to a circus in Dallas when the driver pulled over on I-49 in Natchitoches Parish around 7am. When mud caused the long-haul truck to begin to tip onto its side, a trainer had the bright idea of enlisting the pachyderms for help. Strange sight: Two circus elephants helped keep the trailer that'd been traveling in from tipping over along a Louisiana highway Tuesday morning . Video reveals him coaxing one of the beasts out of the truck as the other is already standing with its head anchoring the truck's trailer. When members of the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's department arrived, 'they were astounded to find two elephants keeping the eighteen wheeler from overturning,' reads the department's official statement. A local wrecker was soon enlisted to pull out the 2000 Kenworth eighteen wheeler and no citations were issued, according to WDSU. The elephants, presumably, went on their way. Whoops: The truck was en route to a circus in Texas when the driver pulled over and a muddy shoulder caused the 18 wheeler to tip . Video reveals a trainer coaxing one of the beasts out of the truck as the other is already standing with its head anchoring the truck's trailer. But where they were headed doesn't sit well for many. In fact, the nation's largest circus, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, is ending its iconic elephant acts due to growing public concern about how the endangered creatures are treated. The circus’ parent company, Feld Entertainment, told The Associated Press exclusively that the acts will be phased out by 2018. The circus plans to phase out elephant acts by 2018. Feld’s 43 elephants will live at the company’s 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida. Twenty-nine animals are already there, and the other 14 will arrive as they are phased out from the circus. Elephant acts have been showcased by Ringling for more than a century and have often been featured in its posters.

"President Barack Obama wasted little time Monday night in blasting Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker for a new state law that bans requiring the payment of union dues as a condition of employment, saying it 'will weaken, rather than strengthen workers.' Walker signed the bill into law on Monday, making the Badger State the 25th with such a 'Right To Work' law. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed the measure into law Monday. Walker is expected to run as a Republican candidate for president in 2016. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed his state's right-to-work bill into law on Monday, making Wisconsin the 25th state with such a law . The Republican presidential front-runner said before his signing eremony that the law will send 'a powerful message across the country and around the world.' Hours later, he leveraged the issue in a fundraising email. 'The Big Government Labor Bosses will never forgive me for taking away their power but we are doing the right thing,' he wrote, asking for donations ranging from $10 to $1,000. By 9:00 at night, the White House was circulating a statement from Obama claimign that Walker had notched a 'victory over working Americans.' If the Wisconsin governor were interested in protecting workers, the president said, be would be 'taking meaningful action to raise their wages and offer them the security of paid leave. That’s how you give hardworking middle-class families a fair shot in the new economy.' The nod to wages was a subtle jab at Wisconsin for not embracing a White House-led push to raise the minimum wage nationwide. The new Wisconsin law, Obama claimed, is part of 'a sustained, coordinated assault on unions, led by powerful interests and their allies in government.' Wisconsin is the first to enact a right-to-work law since Michigan and Indiana did it in 2012. The president issued this statement shortly after 9:00 p.m. on Monday: . 'It’s no coincidence that the rise of the middle class in America coincided in large part with the rise of unions – workers who organized together for higher wages, better working conditions, and the benefits and protections that most workers take for granted today. So it’s inexcusable that, over the past several years, just when middle-class families and workers need that kind of security the most, there’s been a sustained, coordinated assault on unions, led by powerful interests and their allies in government. 'So I’m deeply disappointed that a new anti-worker law in Wisconsin will weaken, rather than strengthen workers in the new economy. Wisconsin is a state built by labor, with a proud pro-worker past. So even as its governor claims victory over working Americans, I’d encourage him to try and score a victory for working Americans – by taking meaningful action to raise their wages and offer them the security of paid leave. That’s how you give hardworking middle-class families a fair shot in the new economy – not by stripping their rights in the workplace, but by offering them all the tools they need to get ahead.' Opponents of the measure complain that the law will give companies the upper hand and drive down wages. Proponents say laws that de-fang powerful unions can bring renewed business investment into a state, creating more jobs. Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Committee, said the Wisconsin law could bring a new wave of imitators in the American Midwest – historically strong industrialized regions with robust labor unions. 'Every worker deserves freedom of choice when it comes to union membership and dues payment, Mix said in a statement, 'and if states like Michigan and Wisconsin can pass Right to Work then Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio can too.' Not all WIsconsin residents are behind Walker, most notably labor union bosses and much of their rank-and-file. As legislators passed the new bill on Feb. 28,  thousands of opponents braved sub-freezing temperatures to rally outside the state capitol in Madison, chanting union slogans and listening to speeches. It was a far cry from larger protests that engulfed the capital city in 2011 when he endorsed a plan to cut $1.5 billion of state spending by requiring unionized government workers to fund some of their own health benefits. The proposal, which he later signed into law, also gave school districts the power to hire and fire without regard for seniority, something opposed by teachers unions. Getting that legislation to Walker's desk proved problematic, however: At one point 14 Democratic legislators fled the state to nearby Chicago, Illinois, denying Republicans the quorum they needed to hold a vote. He later survived a recall campaign led by unions, collecting more votes than he had during his election to office. HALFWAY THERE? WIth WIsconsin's new right-to-work law, it's now illegal in half of America's 50 states to require the payment of union dues as a condition of employment . About 5,000 union supporters marched against 'right to work' legislation on Feb. 28 in Madison, Wisconsin, a fraction of the estimated 100,000 who had massed near the state capitol four years earlier in another anti-Scott Walker protest . Walker is now fine-tuning campaign messages in advance of what is expected to be a bruising Republican presidential primary season – and many of those talking points have Obama in their crosshairs. Ten days ago at the Conservative Political Action Conference, he lambasted Obama for what he said was a weak performance fighting the ISIS terror army overseas. America needs a leader who 'realizes that radical Islamic terrorism is a threat to our way of life and to all freedom-loving people,' he said . 'If I can do that with 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,' Walker later claimed, bringing howls for the comparison of his critics to violent Islamists. 'He is even less qualified to be president than I thought,' a Democratic Party spokesman said in response. The super PAC supporting Walker, called Our American Revival, defended the right-to-work law on Tuesday. 'Workforce participation is up in Wisconsin because Scott Walker is a leader who tackled the tough economic problems left by his predecessor,' the PAC's spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said in a statement. 'Right to Work is happening because Wisconsin supports it but also because it's pro-growth, pro-freedom and pro-work.'","Wisconsin Gov.

"Under-fire BBC chief Rona Fairhead personally blocked the release of redacted information about a long-delayed investigation into Jimmy Savile, prompting fresh cover-up accusations. The controversial BBC Trust chairman approved a decision to keep secret details from a cache of potentially damaging letters between leading figures at the Corporation and the team carrying out a review of Savile’s activities. Her decision last night deepened concerns about the Savile review being carried out by judge Dame Janet Smith, which has cost at least £5 million and taken more than two years so far. BBC Trust chairman, Rona Fairhead, pictured, personally approved a decision to keep Jimmy Savile letters secret, preventing their release to a team conducting a review into the prolific paedophile's activities . The elements of correspondence Mrs Fairhead has kept hidden were thought to shed light on whether Corporation executives were trying to delay publication of the Savile report for fear that it would further damage the BBC’s reputation. The BBC insists no such pressure was applied to delay the report. Last night critics said the censorship row showed Mrs Fairhead was not properly representing the licence fee-payer, as her £110,000 part-time role as chairman of the BBC Trust requires. The businesswoman, 53, has already come under fire from MPs over her £10,000-a-day second job at HSBC. Allegations of her possible role in covering up evidence involving Savile – the biggest scandal in BBC history – will put further pressure on her to quit. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has written to the BBC about the sexual abuse review, said: ‘The delay and the non-publication of the correspondence is not good for the licence fee-payer but it is probably good for the BBC in the run-up to its Charter review. It’s all very convenient. ‘I think that Rona Fairhead is compromised. As far as protecting licence fee-payers, she has gone native. She can’t hold the BBC to account and what she said about the review only confirms my suspicion.’ Mrs Fairhead’s decision came at the end of a five-month battle by a transparency campaigner who used Freedom of Information Act requests to try to find out if BBC bosses had put pressure on Dame Janet to delay her report. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, left, said Ms Fairhead, right, is 'compromised' and has 'gone native' As chairman of the BBC governing body, Mrs Fairhead acts as the ‘qualified person’ to decide whether or not FoI requests should be refused on public interest grounds. In a three-page letter dated last December, she ruled that sensitive messages over delays to the Savile review should not be released. It is the only time so far she has acted in this capacity. She wrote: ‘In my view, the public interest in demonstrating that the review is acting independently of the BBC and that the BBC is not putting unwarranted pressure on the review to delay delivery of the report has largely been served by the information already made available to the requestor.’ The BBC has refused to answer questions about the review’s ongoing costs. The most recent statement on the review website states it is ‘not expected to be finalised until early 2015’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We can confirm the correspondence shows no BBC member of staff has exerted any pressure on members of the review team to delay publication of the report.’","Rona Fairhead is accused of blocking access to letters on Jimmy Savile .

"Anorexia nervosa sufferers - and those who have recovered from the eating disorder - are being asked to donate their blood so scientists can investigate the condition's hereditary links and why there is a spike in cases when women are going through puberty and menopause. The world's largest and most rigorous investigation into anorexia, led by international researchers, hopes to identify and better understand the disorder's causes and ultimately help lead to a treatment or cure that could help the estimated 53,000 Australians suffering from it. Amongst those who plan to roll up their sleeve in Sydney on Tuesday is 27-year-old founder of website lazylaw.com and blogger Kate Horman, who suffered from anorexia for ten years before she turned her life around. Scroll down for video . Amongst those who plan to give blood for research into Anorexia nervosa next Tuesday is lawyer and blogger Kate Horman, who suffered from anorexia for ten years before she turned her life around . At 17, Ms Horman began to eliminate food groups from her diet, consuming up to 20 laxatives a day and eventually began to starve herself until she weighed only a tiny 30kg. 'My hair started falling out, I was cold and tired all the time, aching all the time. I was incredibly skinny, I had no energy, was very anxious, very depressed at times and I slept a lot. I basically just shut myself out of the world. I was very sick,' Ms Horman told Daily Mail Australia. 'My mum is the only reason I am alive today - I was too sick to fight to stay alive myself. The number of times I would collapse - I lost count - and mum was just waiting for the day that I'd collapse and not get back up - that was her greatest fear. She didn't have a life outside of looking after me, she had to work, but there was no time for anything else, and it caused her a huge amount of stress and anxiety. It's not only the person with anorexia suffering, but families as well.' World-leading anorexia nervosa researcher, Professor Cynthia Bulik told Daily Mail Australia that new research has revealed that people living with anorexia nervosa had four-times the number of relatives with anorexia nervosa than those who have never had the illness. Pictured with her mother (left) who she says is 'the only reason I am alive today', Ms Horman said she was 17 when she began to eliminate food groups from her diet and consuming up to 20 laxatives a day. Eventually she starved herself until she weighed only a tiny 30kg . Pictured as a toddler, the now 27-year-old said he grandmothers comments have always stayed with her: 'At about 15... there was a photo taken of me in my bikini during the summer holidays and a few weeks later she sent a letter in the mail saying she would no longer include me in the family photo album because the pictures were no longer a true reflection of me. I was utterly gutted, ashamed and heartbroken' 'We still don't have effective treatments or medication that target anorexia nervosa and we really need to start looking at this illness through a new lens.' She said research has shown that anorexia nervosa is astonishingly six times more common in mothers, four times more common in siblings and five times more common in the children of people living with the illness. But World-leading anorexia nervosa researcher, Professor Cynthia Bulik said around 60 per cent of the reason for an individual succumbing to the eating disorder is genetic: Kate Horman (pictured), who once weighed 30kg at the height of her illness, now estimates she weighs a healthy 55kg . 'We have been doing family and twin studies so we know anorexia runs in families and we know it is inheritable. The next logical step is to find out who is predisposed to the illness by identifying those genetic markers.' Prof Bulik said a significant number of middle aged women are presenting with the disorder which she believes could be linked to menopause. 'We know puberty is a risk factor and menopause is basically the biological bookend of puberty so there needs to be more research around that risk factor.' Ms Horman believes that a number of contributing factors led her own condition to develop, including her father abandoning her when she was 11-years-old, a level of abuse she experienced as a child and her own 'high achiever' attitude. 'There were comments that were made by my grandmother which I took to heart that made me feel ashamed about my image,' she said. 'There was a point where I had started to go through puberty at about 15 - and I think all girls go through this puffy fat stage - I was never overweight, but there was a photo taken of me in my bikini during the summer holidays and a few weeks later she [my grandmother] sent a letter in the mail saying she would no longer include me in the family photo album because the pictures were no longer a true reflection of me. I was utterly gutted, ashamed and heartbroken. Professor Builk (centre) is leading a study which is investigating the condition's hereditary links and why there is a spike in cases when women are going through puberty and menopause . 'I really just wanted to fit in and be liked and be accepted. When the anorexia started to develop I was at a prestigious girls private school. It was when I started to lose some weight that I became more accepted and more popular and it spiralled out of control from there.' But Prof Bulik said the underlying causes of anorexia has been misunderstood for such a long time because so many people out there still believe the root cause of the issue is linked to sociocultural factors. Standing alone, neither genetics or environmental factors are wholly responsible for an individual succumbing to the eating disorder anorexia. Professor Builk said it is important to understand they both contribute with around 60 per cent of the reason being hereditary and 40 per cent being related to environmental factors. 'I try to get people to think about it like this- genes are the loaded gun but environment is the one pulling the trigger. The research hopes to identify and better understand the disorder's causes and ultimately help lead to a treatment or cure that could help the estimated 53,000 Australians suffering from it (stock image) 'So, if someone who is predisposed to anorexia nervosa goes on a diet because of sociocultural reasons, that could then unlock the predisposition to the disease resulting in an eating disorder,' she added. If they can get a large enough sample Prof Bulik hopes to develop a 'biological profile' by looking at genetics and environmental factors that will help will identify what constitutes a high risk individual. This could lead to massive breakthroughs in early detection and intervention, while also explaining the biological pathways that send such different messages about food. Prof Bulik explained there's a 'fundamental difference' in how people with anorexia nervosa react to hunger. 'We still don't have effective treatments or medication that target anorexia nervosa and we really need to start looking at this illness through a new lens,' Professor Bulik said . 'While some people may feel angry, nervous or stressed when they are hungry, people with the predisposition to anorexia feel like that at meal time instead and find that starvation actually calms them.' It is now up to researchers to find a treatment that can help 'calm sufferers' in a different and healthier way. While 1,100 Australians have already rolled up their sleeves and donated to the the study Professor Bulik is hoping to recruit at least 2,200 blood donors within the next two years, in Australia alone. Ms Horman said she turned her life around by changing everything about her life - quitting her job, breaking up with her boyfriend of eight years, moving out of her home and going overseas on her own . She said there were a lot of people getting involved because they felt it may help them in the future but most of the time it's because the community who have been affected by this devastating disease would give anything to make sure someone else doesn't have to go through the same tramatic experience. Ms Horman has encouraged anorexia sufferers and those who beat the illness to take part in the study . Ms Horman, who said she turned her life around by changing everything about her life - quitting her job, breaking up with her boyfriend of eight years, moving out of her home and going overseas on her own - is imploring others to take part in the research. 'There was really nothing out there for me in terms of help except my mum and my GP, that's why this study is so important to me, because there's a real lack of funding for anorexia. A medical study will lend weight to the severity of the illness,' she said. 'Anyone who has suffered or who is suffering or an eating disorder I would absolutely encourage them to give blood because without them this study is not going to be able to move forward.The more people we have the better the scientists and doctors will be able to map the genetic profile and the more accurate the study will be. 'Most importantly, eating disorder sufferers need to believe that, as hard as it might seem, it is possible to beat it. I never thought I'd get over the anorexia and recover, but I have freed myself from this illness.' Professor Bulik will be visiting Sydney next Tuesday to recruit for the ground breaking research study.","New research into anorexia nervosa has linked illness to genetics .

I think now when I look back I wouldn't have been without it because now I really know I'm strong, I know what I want, I know what I can accept, what I can't accept.'

Don't come up to me and stroke me. I'm not a child. I'm going to be fine'. 'I was trying in the match but I wasn't there. I have to be happy to play. I have to be excited. At the time it was like a funeral for me.' Wozniacki has since returned to form, reaching her first grand slam final since 2009 at the US Open in September and going back up to number five in the world.

"Businesses will be forced to let workers share the fruits of recovery with the biggest real-terms increase in the minimum wage since the financial crisis. The standard rate will rise from October to £6.70 an hour, benefiting 1.4million, while the rate for apprentices will go up by a fifth – the largest increase on record. The changes follow the Prime Minister's insistence that businesses should give their workers a pay rise. Scroll down for video . The standard rate of the National Minimum Wage will rise from October to £6.70 an hour, benefiting 1.4million workers . Firms' costs are falling thanks to the strongest economic growth for seven years and the lowest inflation for more than a decade. London Mayor Boris Johnson – a frontrunner to succeed David Cameron – has called for boosting wages even further to be the 'guiding Conservative economic mission' in the next Parliament. Chancellor George Osborne and Business Minister Matthew Hancock have also been pushing the independent commission which recommends the minimum wage rate for above-inflation rises. Today, Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say the standard rate is to increase by 3 per cent – the largest real-terms rise since 2008. The Low Pay Commission had recommended that the minimum wage for apprentices should rise by 2.6 per cent, to £2.80 an hour. Prime Minister David Cameron is set to announce that the minimum wage will rise by 3 per cent to £6.70 in October . However, the Government has decided it should be increased much further, by 20 per cent, to £3.30. There will also be a 3 per cent increase in the rate for 18 to 20-year-olds, to £5.30 per hour. The minimum wage for 16 to 17-year-olds will go up by 2 per cent, to £3.87 per hour. Mr Cameron said: 'At the heart of our long-term economic plan for Britain is a simple idea ... that hard work is really rewarded, that the benefits of recovery are truly national . ‘That’s what today’s announcement is all about – saying to hardworking taxpayers, this is a Government that is on your side. It will mean more financial security for Britain’s families; and a better future for our country.’ Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg said: ‘This is just one of the many ways in which we’ve created a fairer society whilst building a stronger economy. If you work hard, this government is behind you all the way. Whether you’re on low pay or starting your dream career through an apprenticeship, you will get more support to help you go further and faster.’ Senior Tories are calling on the Chancellor to go further, and consider tax breaks for firms who pay the ‘living wage’, set above the national minimum wage. The living wage is currently set at £7.85 an hour outside London and £9.15 in the capital. Ed Miliband has said he wants to increase the minimum wage to £8 an hour by 2019. Mr Osborne has proposed a legal minimum of £7 far sooner. The number of people on the national minimum wage has doubled since it was introduced 15 years ago and is now the pay rate for one in 20 workers, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. Around 1.2 million employees earn the legal minimum wage compared with just over 600,000 in 1999. A further 1.3m workers are clustered close to the minimum wage - earning within 50p of the minimum level. A series of below-inflation increases over recent years had meant the real-terms value of the wage had stalled. John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said: ‘It’s disappointing that the Government has rejected the Low Pay Commission’s recommendation on the apprentice rate. ‘The national minimum wage has been one of the most successful policies of recent years thanks to the independence of the commission – its politicisation is worrying.’ Chuka Umunna, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said: ‘This 20p rise falls far short of the £7 minimum wage which George Osborne promised over a year ago. Ministers have misled working families who have been left worse off. Where under David Cameron we’ve seen the value of the minimum wage eroded, we need a recovery for working people. ‘Only Labour has set a more ambitious target for the minimum wage which would see a rise to £8 by 2020, restoring the link between hard work and pay. We would also act to ensure the national minimum wage is properly enforced where a Tory-led government has failed to get to grips with non-payment. 'Currently 15 per cent of apprentices are not being paid the legal minimum, rising to almost a quarter for 16- to 18-year-olds.’","David Cameron set to announce that the minimum wage will rise to £6.70 .

"A schoolgirl who suffers from a rare condition which means she could die at any time has written a heart-breaking bucket list. Harlee-Jae Procter, from Bacup, Lancashire, told her mother Sasha she wants to ride an elephant, ice-skate with her favourite Frozen character and be a zoo keeper. The four-year-old has spent much of her short life in hospital due to a rare condition which means that part of a chromosome has been lost or deleted. Brave: Harlee-Jae Procter, who has a condition which means she could die at any moment, has come up with a bucket list of things she would love to do . As a result the tot has been diagnosed with biliary atresia which causes inflammation of the bile ducts, polycystic kidneys and nephrocalcinosis, a build up of calcium in the kidneys which can lead to fatal renal failure. 'Harlee-Jae is such a character and people who meet her don't think there is anything wrong with her,' said the mother-of-two. 'After we were told that she could have renal failure at any time, we decided to come up with a list of things she wants to do. 'And I think she realised she could take advantage of it a bit - so there are things on her list that are possible and some things that will never happen. 'It's really scary thinking that the worst could happen to her at any minute so we just want to make as many memories as we can. But I don't let her conditions define her or how she is treated.' And the youngster - who still wears age 12-months clothes because her growth has been stunted - has already started to tick items off. Pilot Procter: Harlee-Jae Procter (left) and sister Codiee-Lee (right) has already started to tick things off her bucket list like being a pilot . List: Harlee-Jae Procter (right) who has a serious healt condition, pictured with sister Codiee-Lee. The pair spent a day as police officers as part of the four-year-old's bucket list . She has already flown in an airplane cockpit, met Elmo, and spent the day as a police officer at Rossendale police station where they organised for her to go on a police car ride, a tour of the police station, and take part in fingerprinting and handcuffing. Sasha said: 'She came up with the bucket list after we were taken to PortAventura in Spain in August by the Make a Wish Foundation to meet Elmo from Sesame Street. 'She had a great time and even got to go in the cockpit of the plane on the flight over. 'Her list is full of things - some are achievable but some will never happen. She wants to ride an elephant, ice skate with Elsa from Frozen, be a zoo keeper and meet Danny Ings.

She has extremely rare diagnosis of microdeletion 17 q12 syndrome which means that genetic information has been lost or deleted . 'It's about making memories. I don't want to just sit here crying and let her condition define our lives.' The brave youngster was diagnosed with biliary atresia at just four-weeks-old after she was born severely jaundice. She was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary for a Kasai procedure which drains bile from the liver to the gut. The operation improved her liver function but Harlee will still need a liver transplant before she reaches adulthood. Frozen: One of Harlee-Jae Procter's wishes is to ice-skate with her favourite Disney character Princess Elsa . Fun loving: Harlee-Jae Procter, four, doesn't let her potentially fatal condition stop her from doing what she wants. She has come up with a bucket list of things she would like to do . The reception pupil was then diagnosed with polycystic kidneys at six-months, followed by an extremely rare diagnosis of microdeletion 17 q12 syndrome which means that genetic information has been lost or deleted. And more recently Harlee-Jae was found to have nephrocalcinosis which has to be monitored at monthly hospital visits, and could prove fatal. The brave girl has to take 15 different types of medication every day - and her condition has also made it difficult to potty train leaving her embarrassed at school. Sasha, who is also mother to six-year-old Codiee-Lee, said: 'All of this has been going on since she was born and Harlee deals with it really well. 'She doesn't think there is anything wrong with her and thinks I am lying when I tell her - she tells people the scar from her op is from falling off her bike.'","'Riding an elephant' and 'ice-skating with Elsa from Frozen' on tragic list .

"Cheryl Burke, the former Dancing with the Stars professional, is set to choreograph the man who became a global internet sensation after being mocked for his dance moves, Daily Mail Online can reveal. Burke will teach the man, identified only as Sean from London, some dance moves ahead of a 'party of a lifetime' which has been planned in his honor following an online campaign to track him down. The epic party will be thrown at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which has a capacity of 93,000 people, later this year. The list of superstar performers who have offered their services keeps getting bigger. Pharrell Williams, Moby, Ellie Goulding, Andrew W.K., DJ Tommie Sunshine and dance duo Knife Party have all lent their support to Sean known affectionately as Dancing Man. Professional dancer Burke, who competed on ABC's Dancing with the Stars for 18 seasons, tweeted: '@DancingManFound heard ur amazing story! Would love to dance w/u & give dance tips.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Expertise: Cheryl Burke, with Antonio Sabàto Jr, in her last series on Dancing with the Stars. She has offered to help with Sean's choreography . Star power: Ellie Goulding says she wants to take party in the party for Sean from London, the Dancing Man . Superstars: Some of the biggest names in music including Pharrell Williams (left) and Moby (right) have Tweeted to say they will perform at the event . The star, who announced her departure from the prime time dance show in December last year, will make sure Sean can wow the crowds when he takes center stage at the event, which is expected to attract thousands of revelers. Cassandra Fairbanks, who spearheaded the #finddancingman campaign and is organizing the party, told Daily Mail Online that Sean is 'very excited'. 'We have some big surprises for Sean, we're gonna make sure he has the time of his life,' she said. 'He will definitely be making an appearance on stage and Cheryl from Dancing with the Stars has reached out and offered to choreograph him which will be amazing. 'There's also a lot of big names who have offered to perform, the thing is out of control, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.' Fairbanks' campaign began when she saw Sean pictured in a photo on the 4chan site looking down in the dumps after apparently being made fun of. An anonymous poster wrote: 'Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing.' The post was republished on photo site imgur and quickly picked up more than 2000 comments of support for the mystery man's moves. A GoFundMe account — intended to track down Sean and offer to fly him to L.A. - is at $38,000 and climbing. Organizers of that page say any money that doesn't go do the dance party will go to an anti-bullying campaign. Fairbanks said the original fat-shaming taunts about Sean were 'disgusting bullying', but she said he is now basking in internet love. 'There have been thousands and thousands of messages – it's just been an outpouring of support and love and kindness. 'Sean has been been amazing. He says he's been smiling and laughing all day and reading everybody's messages.' Fairbanks, 29, who is originally from Boston, Massachusetts, says she herself has been 'overwhelmed' by the flood of attention and isn't sure how many people will attend the party. Outraged: The post was later screenshot and posted on Imgur , where it attracted the attention of thousands of social media users, including Cassandra Fairbanks (above), who said she was 'horrified' by its 'cruel' nature . Offer: Cheryl Burke will help the party atmosphere by tutoring Sean in his moves . Success! After launching a Twitter campaign, The Free Thought Project activist manage to locate Sean within hours. Above, Sean posted a photo of himself holding up a sign reading: 'Hi Cass & Twitter (as requested!)' Formal invite: On Thursday night, the hashtag #finddancingman went viral. Ms Fairbanks's group even issued a formal, blue-colored invitation to the dance party to Sean. Part of it read: 'We want to see you dance freely' It's him! At around the same time, Ms Fairbanks received a photo of a man who looked like the Dancing Man - and was wearing the same wristband - posing next to the team mascot of London soccer club Arsenal . 'It's been a whirlwind, I'm having trouble keeping up,' she said. 'It's gone a little bit crazy, there's a lot of people who want to get involved. 'It's really hard to say how many people are coming because I feel really swamped. 'Right now I have over 15,000 messages that I haven't been able to respond to. My email inbox is full, on Twitter I've been getting mentions every second from people saying they want to come to the party, so it's really hard to gauge. 'My Facebook has also gone insane and people have even been emailing my boss, it's a little overwhelming.' Fairbanks says the organizers at the LA Coliseum – a sports stadium with a huge 93,000 capacity – reached out to offer the space for Sean's party. And it's thanks to their 'amazing' support that things are beginning to come together, she said. 'I was so overwhelmed and stressed out until they got involved and they have been so wonderful,' Fairbanks said. 'We also went to Moby's house today (Monday) and met with him, and he's been really helpful too, there's a lot of people who have come together and have been beyond kind.' But Fairbanks says it's still not clear exactly how many people will come to the party. She had originally envisaged a VIP ladies only party and expected to invite around 2,000 guests. Searching: Other members of the group  joined in with efforts to identify Sean. Casey Horan wrote: 'We want to throw him a huge dance party with tons of beautiful babes.' Another said: 'Help me and my 2,000 girlfriends' Star support: Both Pharrell and Moby told Dancing Man not to be ashamed to dance as they posted their support for Sean on Twitter . But the idea has since exploded and the numbers are more likely to hit the tens of thousands with both men and women now allowed. 'This thing has grown beyond our simple gesture into something global and there's just so many people who are touched and moved that I don't want to exclude anyone,' Fairbanks said. 'Especially as there is so many people who have reached out expressing their interest in coming to dance.' Despite the outpouring of support, Fairbanks fears some people contacting her are wanting to get involved for the 'wrong reasons'. 'I just wanted to make somebody smile, I didn't think it would turn in to this whole production,' she said. 'But it's beautiful that it's happening, I am so thankful to everybody and I'm so thankful that people around the world are reaching out.' Fairbanks said she spoke to Sean yesterday and said he's 'so thankful' for the support. 'Sean and I really want to do something for a charity that deserves it, that way this thing will be much bigger than Sean and help a lot more people,' she said. Fairbanks, who is a human rights activist at The Free Thought Project, says there's a lot of 'really great charities' they are considering working with, but they haven't made a decision yet. As for celebrity backers, there's plenty of them. Fairbanks said Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon reached out to her to offer support. Pop singer Ellie Goulding tweeted: 'I want to dance with #dancingman and play at the party.' Andrew W.K. wrote: 'Of course! This guy is totally a dance party master and I'm backing him all the way.' And Moby posted: 'i offer my dj services for free for #DancingMan #DancingManFound #FindDancingMan . no one should ever be ashamed about dancing.'","Dancing professional will tutor man who became internet sensation after his dance moves were mocked in a posting on a web site .

"Passover matzos have rolled out of a century-old bakery on Manhattan's Lower East Side for the last time. The Streit's factory is the oldest in the nation still churning out the unleavened flatbread that's essential for Jewish holidays - about 2.5 million pounds of matzos were baked for April's Passover holiday and distributed worldwide. But Streit's is planning to shut down its nine-decade-old ovens by the year's end to move into a 21st-century computerized plant located in a different part of the New York area. The contract has yet to be signed. Scroll down for video . Leonides Negron loads up racks with fresh baked matzos at the Streit's matzo factory in New York's Lower East Side in early March . Worker Michael Adramov adjusts a machine that rolls the dough at the factory on Rivington Street that will close its doors by the year's end and open a new 21st-century computerized plant . Matzos straight from the oven are loaded onto racks at the century-old factory. About 2.5 million pounds of matzos were baked for April's Passover holiday and distributed worldwide . Packages of matzos roll off the assembly line at the factory. The factory has annual sales topping $20million as Streit's matzos are sold around the country and worldwide . 'For decades, immigrant Jews and their descendants have made pilgrimages back to the Lower East Side, the Jewish Plymouth Rock, to reconnect with their history and, of course, delight in the shopping and eating that gives the neighborhood its flavor,' said Annie Polland, a historian at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. 'With the Streit's closure, you have a significant chapter of Jewish Lower East Side history closing.' Tradition is quickly disappearing in the neighborhood that was home to Jewish immigrants for much of the 20th century. Property values have skyrocketed, with galleries, boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements. The Streit's property, up for sale, is worth tens of millions of dollars. In the neighborhood, the factory will leave behind places like Katz's Delicatessen, Russ and Daughters and Yonah Schimmel among the remnants of the traditional Lower East Side, according to the New York Times. The pressure of gentrification, however, is not what has caused the closing of the factor, said Alan M. Adler, a great-grandson of Aron Streit, who started the business after emigrating from Austria. 'The reality is that operating a modern factory in four old buildings has finally caught up with us,' Adler told the New York Times in January. Worker Aharon Yakov loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine at Streit's matzo factory . This early 1960s photo shows the storefront of the matzo factory at the corner of Rivington St. and Suffolk St. in New York's Lower East Side . Another photo from the early 1960s shows a rabbi, center, supervising the Passover matzo production at the factory, and pictured right is Aron Gross, the great-great grandson of the company founder Aron Streit . For many workers like Adramov, the Streit's factory has provided a steady job for 25 years, in fact, his only job since coming to America from Uzbekistan . The bakery first opened during World War I, serving struggling Jewish immigrants. By 1925, the business moved to Rivington Street, where the original assembly line winds through four six-story buildings — once overcrowded tenements with narrow, rickety stairs that are still used. However, the 48,000-square-foot factory does not live off nostalgia, as it is a smartly run family business with annual sales topping $20million on about 5million pounds of matzos sold around the country and worldwide. The other mass U.S. manufacturer of matzos is Manischewitz, with Israeli imports and traditional round handmade crackers also filling store shelves. Demand is growing for matzos even among non-Jews who enjoy them as a healthy snack baked with no fat or artificial additives. The old factory simply cannot keep up with demand, said Aaron Gross, head of sales and marketing at Streit's and one of three cousins running the day-to-day operations. 'I'm fifth generation, and if we want this to last another five generations, we need to make sure that we strengthen the company to remain relevant in a very competitive market,' said Gross, the great-great grandson of Streit. 'The name Streit's conjures up so many happy memories of not only my childhood but of the decades since,' says Karen Kriendler Nelson, whose relatives organized a pre-Passover family reunion at the factory. The current Streit's production line dates back to the 1930s and the baking process is strictly timed. It may take no more than 18 minutes from the moment the flour and water are mixed to when matzos emerge from a gas-fired, tunnel-like oven to cool in metal baskets that hang off rusty tracks, inching slowly to the packaging operation. Workers from the Lower East Side factory have already been offered jobs at the new location (above a pallet of matzos sits in the factory) Operations on Rivington Street will continue until the new plant is up and running (above Caballeros loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine) Beyond the 18 minutes, the dough rises, forbidden for this food that symbolizes the biblical flight of the Jews from Egypt, who were so rushed they had no time to finish baking their 'bread of affliction.' 'Nothing changes at Streit's,' declared Rabbi Mayer Kirshner, who oversees the factory's kosher certification. Some of the nearly 60 workers represent a wave of immigrants from former Soviet republics, like machine operator Michael Abramov, who was born in Uzbekistan. He has been at Streit's for 25 years — the only job he has ever had in America. 'I'm not bored. I love this work. This is important. It's our religion, it's the history of the Jews,' said the 61-year-old Queens resident. Operations on Rivington Street will proceed until the new plant is running with state-of-the-art equipment that will speed up production. These are not your great-grandmother's matzos, kneaded and shaped by hand. Mass-produced and machine-packaged, they are a modern effort to preserve tradition. The employees are all being offered jobs at the new location, where Streit's will preserve its motto — 'the taste of a memory.' In the neighborhood, property values have skyrocketed, with galleries, boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements (above the iconic Katz's Deli in New York shares the same neighborhood as Streit's factory) As the factory closes its doors, it leaves behind places like Russ and Daughters (above) and Yonah Schimmel among the remnants of the traditional Lower East Side .","Streit's matzos factory in Manhattan is shutting down its nine-decade-old ovens by year's end to move to 21st century computerized plant in another part of the New York area .

"Labour last night became embroiled in a major row with its biggest union donor after the woman at the centre of a vote-rigging scandal was blocked from standing in a key marginal seat. Senior figures in Unite threatened to retaliate only weeks before the general election after Karie Murphy, a close friend of the union’s leader, Len McCluskey, was excluded from a list of candidates in Halifax. Miss Murphy was suspended by Labour in 2013 and reported to police after allegations that the union had tried to manipulate the selection process in Falkirk in her favour. Karie Murphy, a close friend of Unite union leader Len McCluskey, who was excluded from a list of Labour candidates for the key marginal seat of Halifax . She was later cleared and had her membership reinstated, but she quit as Labour candidate in the Scottish seat for the sake of ‘reconciliation and unity’. Unite was accused of recruiting members to ‘pack’ the local party before the selection vote. It has always denied any wrongdoing. Unite had hoped to use its power within the party to parachute Miss Murphy in as the candidate in Halifax, where the current Labour MP, Linda Riordan, has announced that she is stepping down. Labour selection committee headed by Harriet Harman, pictured, did not include Miss Murphy on the candidacy list . But yesterday it was revealed that a selection panel, made up of three members of Labour’s National Executive Committee and led by the party’s deputy leader Harriet Harman, had not included Miss Murphy on a six-strong ‘long list’ to be the candidate in the West Yorkshire seat. The dispute risks reopening the wounds of the bitter Falkirk row. Ed Miliband had been warned that his party risked losing the seat if Miss Murphy was selected, but the union could now stop bankrolling the party’s election campaign. Following the decision, a Unite source warned that Miss Harman will ‘have to answer for her actions in due course’. A union spokesman refused to comment on what sanctions it could take. Unite has given Labour more than £14million since Mr Miliband became Labour leader. Nearly 130 of the candidates picked to stand for the party in May have links to the union. Mrs Riordan, a Unite member, yesterday accused the party of ‘underhand and anti-democratic manipulation’ of the selection. It is understood figures in the party had been frantically working behind the scenes to try to stop Miss Murphy. Tony Blair helped broker a secret £1million donation in a bid to weaken union influence, it was reported at the weekend. Ed Miliband had been warned that his party risked losing the seat if Miss Murphy was selected, but the union could now stop bankrolling the party’s election campaign . At a dinner at the former prime minister’s home last week, Assem Allam, chairman of Hull City football club, promised £500,000 in extra funding if Unite withholds money because of the selection row. Mrs Riordan, a member of the Socialist Campaign Group in Parliament, has a majority of only 1,472 in Halifax, which is number 18 on the Tories’ target list. A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Labour has a well-established process for selections. The NEC will decide on the shortlist for Halifax and will assess the suitability of the candidates, the wishes of the local party and the best interests of the party.’","Karie Murphy has been blocked from standing for Labour in seat of Halifax .

"It has sold more than 20 million copies since it was written two centuries ago and has had generations of schoolgirls swooning over the ultimate romantic hero. But the great unspoken background of Jane Austen's world is that both Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley in Pride and Prejudice got rich from the slave trade, says author Joanna Trollope. The novelist, speaking at the Festival of Literature in Dubai, dispelled the myth about Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley being the perfect men and described the 'very dark underbelly' to Austen's books. She said: 'Why does Mr Bingley in Pride and Prejudice have all this leisure to sort of drift between Netherfield and London? The great unspoken background of Jane Austen's world is that both Mr Darcy (pictured, Colin Firth) and Mr Bingley in Pride and Prejudice got rich from the slave trade, says author Joanna Trollope . 'He is a young man with means because of the slave trade. The slave trade is lightly touched upon in several of the novels but not very heavily. 'What built Pemberley? Pemberley was built, one imagines, on proceeds of the coal mines in Derbyshire. What was the life of an 18th century miner like? Not much fun.' Trollope, 71, decided to shatter the illusion surrounding Austen's heroes after being approached by publishers Harper Collins to write an updated version of Sense and Sensibility for the Austen Project in 2013. The series marked the 200-year anniversary of the author's most popular work, Pride and Prejudice. Pride and Prejudice describes how Mr Darcy earned £10,000 a year - more than £200,000 in modern money - while Mr Bingley inherited £100,000, the equivalent of £2 million today, and raked in another £5,000 a year, or £100,000 in modern money. But in her adaptation, Ms Trollope, whose reinvented characters say things like 'totes amazeballs', had to make one crucial change - she gave her protagonists jobs. 'The only huge change I had to make was people had to work,' she said at the festival. (on Saturday). 'In her novels, nobody works because the unspoken backdrop was the great commodity of the late 18th and early 19th century was sugar, which is not a million miles away from slavery. 'There is a very dark underbelly to these stories, which is why I still get so irritated when people insist on treating Jane Austen as if it was like the lid of a Quality Street tin, all sprig muslin and 'oh la sir'. 'There is none of that. It's tough stuff and clever women were doomed to a sort of infantilism because there was no career except marriage, which is why the women in her novels sabotage each other so disgracefully.' Despite her reservations about how Austen's heroes made their money, Ms Trollope said she ended the project thinking the author was 'an absolute genius'. She said: 'There she was, the second daughter of a not very distinguished or noisy country parson in Hampshire, and she was writing for her own pleasure, her own satisfaction. 'How did she know, out of some unbelievable instinct, that romantic love, class and money were going to be the stuff of fiction forever?' Ms Trollope, who said she 'stuck like paint' to Austen's characters in her own adaptation, quickly realised the romantic novelist did not believe in happy ever after. The only characters Austen did not send up in Sense and Sensibility were Elinor Dashwood and Colonel Brandon, the two most steady figures in the book, said Ms Trollope. She added: 'There is no such thing as happily ever after. That is why you can see in Jane Austen novels she loses interest the moment the proposal is sorted and X is plainly going to marry Y. 'I you read the final paragraphs of her six published novels, you will see she just says: 'Less of that and get on with it, not interested any more.' The adventure's over.' She also blamed Andrew Davies' BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice for sparking an obsession with Mr Darcy with the infamous scene by the lake, which did not exist in the book. The real Mr Darcy was 'stiff-necked and painfully shy' with 'not much humour', said Ms Trollope.","Joanna Trollope says it is the reason his job is never mentioned in novel .

"A Turkish man in jail for murder has slit his wife's throat with a fruit knife during a prison conjugal visit. Metin Avci, 33, and his wife Leyla Avci, 29, were given a bowl of fruit with a knife for their private meeting at the prison in the city of Sivas, Turkey. But Avci used the knife to cut her throat, before using it to try and take his own life, it was reported. Leyla Avci was killed by her husband at a prison in the city of Sivas (pictured) during a conjugal visit . Prison officials allowed the couple, as is customary in Turkey, a several hours-long private meeting in the conjugal room. After failing to take his own life, he was found alive and was immediately hospitalised, the Dogan news agency reported. Already part way through a 15-year sentence for murder, he now faces another murder charge. The pair were meeting under controversial conjugal visit legislation, enacted in 2010, that allows private visits from anywhere up to 24 hours, AsiaOne reported. Turkish authorities have admitted the country is grappling with the issue of femicide - a hate crime generally considered to mean the killing of women because they are female. The issue rose to prominence in recent weeks after the body of Ozgecan Aslan, 20, was found burned near woodland in Tarsus. It's alleged she was killed after trying to stop a man from raping her - triggering protests across Turkey that were attended by thousands. Her death caused outrage particularly because women are frequently killed at the hands of violent men and are seen as having a lower status. This perception was recently inflamed by comments made by the Turkish president who said women were not equal to men.","Metin Avci, 33, killed his wife during a conjugal visit in the city of Sivas .

"ARCA driver Will Kimmel was uninjured after flying over a concrete retaining wall, flipping into a parking lot and striking at least one parked car at Mobile International Speedway. The 26-year-old nephew of ARCA veteran Frank Kimmel posted on his Facebook page that he was 'doing good' following the bizarre crash early in the Mobile 200 on Saturday.

Survival: Will Kimmel (right) is seen posing with the man whose trailer hitch he struck, Jonny Charles Jr. Because there are no outside walls around the slightly banked track, there was nothing to stop Kimmel's car as it drove off the half-mile track. Kimmel's car rolled at least once before finding the parking lot. The car struck the trailer hitch of a pickup truck before coming to a stop. Kimmel posted a photograph he took with the truck driver to Facebook. Kimmel said in an post-crash interview with Popular Speed's Matt Weaver 'Unfortunately for us the throttle hung, something we always check for, so it was just a freak accident.' Kimmel told Weaver 'I wish they would have [outside] walls here. Personally, just so I would have had to put a clip on it instead of junking a race car that I only had 12 laps on. I don't know. I'm frustrated.' Because there are no outside walls around the slightly banked track, there was nothing to stop Kimmel's car as it drove off the half-mile track .

This photo shows the trailer hitch Kimmel  struck . Asked if he was alright, Kimmel said in the interview 'Yeah. I'm sore. I mean, I don't know who's not gonna be after that, but I don't have a headache or anything like that.' Ron Drager, the president of ARCA Racing Series, told Popular Speed 'One of the things we do on a regular basis is understand the characteristics of a particular race track because you can’t apply what works at the Illinois State dirt Fairgrounds and apply it to Daytona or even Mobile. 'So understanding the nature of a facility with no concrete walls and understanding where the barriers are, we are certainly going to do a review of that.' Drager told the website that the organization was happy both the driver safety compartment and Kimmel were unharmed. Debris: Kimmel's car was left totaled after the race .

She said: 'All men want to see is a body that pleases their eyes, especially in my case because I come from the Playboy world and and they don't want to see my body doing something other than pleasing them. 'My body used to be to please men, but my body is for me now and it is to please me, now I feel like I have 100 per cent control over who I am.' She continued: 'If guys don't like my body now that's actually a good thing, that means I'm shedding the Playboy image. 'When I see guys saying oh you're fat, I'm like ""yes! I'm glad I don't turn you on any more because I don't want to do that any more!""' Kendra (left) with fellow playmates Bridget Marquardt (second left) and Holly Madison (right, with Hugh Hefner (second right) at a Playboy Mansion party in 2005 . The reality star, who last year came sixth on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, is now so far removed from her old glamour girl persona that she is planning on having her breast implants removed. She said: 'I'm going through a phase right now where I don't fit my boobs anymore - I'm thinking about a reduction because that was a phase and now I am out of it. 'After my daughter was born, when I was breastfeeding it became hard not to look at my boobs now and see them as milk and fat. 'The person I feel like today isn't a person with big boobs - I feel like I'm trapped in this body right now.' Kendra with her son Hank Baskett IV (left), husband Hank and daughter Alijah Mary . But while she may be having second thoughts about her chest, the star reveals she has never been happier with her figure since becoming a mother. She said: 'Before having my kids I was a free spirit. I had no filters and I could run around naked and feel free as I felt like I had no flaws. 'But then again, there were only certain jeans I could fit into because I was a size zero (UK size 4), while at the Playboy Mansion - I had no butt and no hips. 'After two kids, I have hips, a butt and curves. 'I actually love my body even more now because I remember being that thin and wishing I could fit into high-waisted jeans and sophisticated dresses but they just looked frumpy on me.' While Kendra was in the Playboy Mansion, she was a tiny size zero  (UK size 4) According to Kendra, her husband Hank Baskett, who she married at the Playboy Mansion in June 2009 is equally impressed by his wife's new curves. She said: 'I think he sees my confidence over everything and that's what he loves the most. 'He loves my body, I have some wear and tear right now with my stomach but he talks to me about it all of the time. 'He says if we don't have sex one day it feels like a beautiful Ferrari that's in the garage that he can't drive every day.' But while she is now more confident than ever with her body, Kendra didn't feel this way until recently. During her first pregnancy with Hank Baskett IV, the star admits that she piled on the weight because she took the phrase 'eating for two' literally, like many women. She said: 'Because I was so skinny beforehand, I just ate and ate, then did no exercise. 'I put on 65lbs in my first pregnancy and it took me so long to get rid of it. 'I tried for about a year and nothing was working.' Kendra and Hank at the 'Dead Rising: Watchtower' film premiere in LA last week . Kendra with her children last autumn . What made it worse was that, like many women, Kendra started to compare her progress with celebrities in magazines. She said: 'Kourtney Kardashian was pregnant with her first child at the same time that I was pregnant with mine - we gave birth about two days apart. 'The afterwards, her weight just dropped off. 'I saw a picture of her looking all tiny and I just burst into tears. 'I was thinking to myself, ""I'm going to the gym twice a day, I'm getting these special meals delivered to my house, why can't I look like that?"" 'We do this to ourselves as women, but we shouldn't - it takes some a lot longer than others to lose the weight.' Before she became pregnant a second time, with her daughter Alijah Mary Baskett, who was born last May, Kendra was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. After meeting with an endocrinologist, she overhauled her lifestyle, focusing on exercise and healthy eating. Kendra pregnant with her daughter while out and about with her son last April in LA . She said: 'In my second pregnancy, I was so much more active and ate really healthy food - my cravings the second time around were oranges and mangoes. 'It made such a huge difference, because even though I put on about 55lbs, which is around 10lbs less than last time, I knew that it was good fat that was coming from a healthy place. 'Then straight after I gave birth, about 20lbs just melted away. I was walking around the neighbourhood just three days later and I felt great, even though I'd just had a C-section. 'I still had another 20lbs or so to lose, but I didn't rush myself and it came off a lot easier than the last time. 'Although when I went in the jungle for I'm A Celebrity, that was brilliant, the last bit just came straight off!' This point she is keen to stress - that she gave herself time to lose the weight. Kendra poses at the ""The Girls Next Door"" DVD signing in LA in 2006 . Kendra being evicted from I'm A Celebrity last December . Like most other women, she too looks at some of the celebrities who show off six-packs just a few weeks after giving birth and is flabbergasted. She said: 'That's the time that your body should be recovering, when you should be spending time with your baby and letting yourself heal. 'It's such a taboo. 'You can see how it happens though, because the camera adds weight, so people who are on TV think that they need to lose weight so they will look slimmer on camera. 'Then they end up looking to skinny in photos. 'But I have to be realistic with myself. 'For me, I take my own selfies and see how I look through that, because I try not to go off the scale, just by how the way I fit in clothes and the way I look in selfies.'

"A collection of treasures from one of Britain's grandest country houses is to be sold for more than £10million to help pay for the upkeep of the property – which is famed for its starring role in hit TV show Brideshead Revisited. The items, which range from a £3.5million painting of Venice's Grand Canal by Bernardo Bellotto to a £1.2million portrait of Henry VIII, are from a private collection of Castle Howard in North Yorkshire. Set in the rolling Howardian hills, the 18th Century country house is owned by the Howard family, having been passed down from its original owner – the 3rd Early of Carlisle – who lived at the property in 1699. Scroll down for video . Treasured items from Castle Howard in North Yorkshire, which featured in TV drama Brideshead Revisited and is currently occupied by Simon Howard and his wife Rebecca (pictured), are to be auctioned off for more than £10million to help secure the future of the grand country estate . Set in the rolling Howardian hills in North Yorkshire, the 18th Century country house is owned by the Howard family, having been passed down from its original owner – the 3rd Early of Carlisle – who lived at the property in 1699. Brothers Simon and Nicholas currently reside in the house . The items are to be auctioned for more than £10million, including a £3.5million artwork of Venice's Grand Canal by Bernardo Bellotto (above). It was painted by Bellotto when he was just 16-years-old, at a time when he was working in the studio of his uncle - Italian painter Canaletto . The treasures have been collected over the last 300 years but will now be auctioned in the summer to help the current owners of Castle Howard – brothers Nicholas and Simon Howard – secure the house's financial future. The collection has been hailed as 'one of the finest' in private hands anywhere in the world, but the Howards have insisted selling the items will not damage the integrity of the overall collection at the estate. As well as paintings and portraits, the collection of 10 items also includes 17th-century Italian furniture and Roman antiquities. However, the most expensive piece is the artwork of Venice's Grand Canal by Bernardo Bellotto, who was the pupil and nephew of Canaletto, which has an estimated value of £3.5million. Another sought-after item is the portrait of Henry VIII from the studio of acclaimed court painter Hans Holbein, which shows the monarch standing in a rich red coat and carrying his gold sceptre. Other lots in the upmarket collection include Ferdinand Bol's Portrait of a Boy, which has an estimate of between £2million and £3million, and a Roman Egyptian vase which has a guide price of up to £600,000. It also includes a pair of extremely rare Italian pietre dure inlaid cabinets made in Rome in the 17th Century, which are expected to sell for up to £1million. The sale comes just months after the Howard family announced changes at the distinct country home. The house, which gained notoriety after being used as the backdrop to TV dramas Brideshead Revisited and Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, is under financial pressure. It has been occupied for the last 32 years by Simon, who volunteered to take on the ownership after graduating from Eton in 1983. Nearly 20 years later, he married his second wife Rebecca – dubbed 'The Woman Who Set Out To Marry A House' by Vanity Fair magazine – and she soon gave birth to twins, Merlin and Octavia. They threw themselves into the huge task of upkeeping the property and its 10,000 acre estate. However, in recent years Simon was diagnosed with throat cancer, and his older brother Nicholas – who had been working as a photographer in London – decided to move into the property with his wife Victoria, a former chief executive of HarperCollins. Other items to be sold at auction include a 1542 portrait of Henry VIII from the studio of Hans Holbein, which is expected to fetch up to £1.2million (right). A pair of Italian pietrre dure and ormolu-mounted cabinets from the early 17th Century (left) are to sell for up to £1million . A 17th Century Dutch painting - Ferdinand Bol’s Portrait of a Boy (pictured) - will also be auctioned by the Howard family for up to £3million . A white marble bust of Anne of Austria, Wife of Louis XIII, from France in the mid-17th Century has a guide price of between £50,000 to £70,000 . Simon Howard has lived in the grand house for 32 years and moved his second wife Rebecca (pictured left) in just over 10 years ago. His older brother Nicholas has now also moved into the property with his wife Victoria, a former chief executive of HarperCollins (together right) Castle Howard, which was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and built between 1699 and 1712, has been home to 10 generations of the Howard family. Spreading out over 145 rooms, the house is considered one of Vanbrugh's greatest achievements. Its magnificent art collection includes ancient sculptures, Old Masters and works by Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. The house comes complete with temples, follies, peacocks, 100 staff and 10,000 rolling acres — as well as 250,000 paying visitors a year. The  estate is owned by a private limited company, and is occupied by brothers Simon and Nicholas Howard and their respective families. Both families now contribute to the day-to-day running of the house, and the plan to auction off treasured items comes after they looked into options to reduce the home's annual upkeep costs. As well as selling off treasured keeps, another money-saving plan includes fitting an environmentally-friendly heating system to halve the house's annual fuel bill – but the outlay cost is £160,000 alone. Nicholas said the aim of the auction, which will be conducted with Sotheby's in London, was to help move the house into the next century. He said: 'I am privileged to be able to say that Castle Howard is my family's heritage and has been since it was built over 300 years ago. 'With that privilege comes the responsibility of ownership, and the Trustees' unanimous decision to hold this sale is the exercise of that responsibility. 'If the sale helps to secure that heritage as the house moves into its fourth century then it will have achieved its goal. 'To this end, we have selected for sale at Sotheby's a small number of works which, while of great intrinsic interest, have been carefully chosen so as not to detract from the overall integrity of the collection.' His brother Simon added: 'Running Castle Howard for the last 30 years has been an immense privilege. 'Now, as a new chapter in its history opens, the sales that we are planning at Sotheby's will make an important contribution to the long-term future of the Castle Howard estate and collections.' Nicholas Howard said the aim of the auction, which will be conducted with Sotheby's in London in July, was to help move the house forward . The stunning Yorkshire country estate was used for filming of TV drama Brideshead Revisited, which featured Jeremy Irons in the 1980s . The house gained notoriety after being used as the backdrop to TV dramas Brideshead Revisited and Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon . The Howards recently announced plans to fit an environmentally-friendly heating system as part of an attempt to halve the house's annual bills . The treasures to be auctioned have been part of Castle Howard for the last 300 years and have an estimated total guide price of £10million . Henry Wyndham, chairman of Sotheby's Europe said the collection 'ranks among the finest private art collections in the world'. She said: 'The collections at Castle Howard chart two millennia of history and 300 years of collecting. 'The carefully selected group of works to be auctioned this summer is testament to the taste of a series of enlightened art patrons, starting with the visionary 3rd Earl of Carlisle, and continuing through his Romanophile son, Henry, collector of antiquities and Venetian vedute, to his diplomat grandson Frederick, 5th Earl of Carlisle, who is thought by many to have been the most refined English collector of the period around 1800.' The collection will be auctioned, with a combined estimate in excess of £10million, at the Sotheby's London Old Masters and Treasures sale on July 8.","Treasured items collected over last 300 years to be sold by Castle Howard with total estimated value of £10million .

"Hollywood star Johnny Depp is renowned for not wasting his beer, but it was a spill of a very different kind that saw him flying back to the US. The actor is rumoured to have broken his right wrist go-karting on a private track at five-time MotoGP world champion Mick Doohan’s luxurious Coomera property last weekend. Depp has been based at the sprawling waterfront compound since he arrived on the Gold Coast last month, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. Scroll down for video .

"A four-year-old girl grabbed her purple raincoat, slipped out of her house alone and hopped on a Philadelphia bus in search of a snack. The only problem was, it was 3am. Bus driver, Harlan Jenifer, says the girl swung her legs in a seat as she chanted: 'All I want is a slushie!'

"OJ Simpson is marked for death. The 67-year-old disgraced gridiron great was recently threatened by a fellow inmate who is a member of the Aryan Nation, a white supremacist group in the Nevada prison, and vowed that OJ will never leave the prison alive. OJ, 67, and the tattooed-racist thug, who is 6 feet tall and over 250 pounds, got into a heated argument last week while waiting in line to get their medications. OJ, who is housed in the minimum security tier - or section - of the prison has to stand in line with all of the other inmates for medications and meals from minimum to maximum security. The inmate, Travis Waugh, 51, known as 'Blu' in the yard, is housed in the maximum security tier of the prison because of his violent history.He was convicted in 2005 for attempted sexual assault with substantial bodily harm. Travis was sentenced to a maximum of  240 months and is currently in maximum security tier at the Lovelock Correctional Center. He was turned down for parole in 2013. 'This guy was standing in line waiting for his medications when OJ comes along and cuts in line — like he always does,' an eyewitness tells Daily Mail Online.  'But this dude was not having it and told OJ to take his ugly black a** to back of the line and wait like everybody else. The gloves are off: OJ's altercation with white supremacist prisoner Travis 'Blu' Waugh began after Simpson cut into the line to get his medicines first. Blu wasn't having it and pushed OJ against the wall . 'OJ jumped in his face and yelled, ""F*** you man. I'm gonna stay right here and your a** ain't gonna do nothing about it."" 'The guy pushed OJ and yelled back: ""Get in line a**hole and wait your turn. I'm not gonna tell ya again."" 'OJ fell against the wall and was able to catch himself before he fell to the floor but he was in a lot of pain because of his bad knee.' As reported exclusively on Daily Mai Online on March 3, OJ who is serving nine to 33 years for armed robbery and kidnapping, is struggling to walk and uses a cane because of his 11-year history of injuries while in the NFL. He desperately needs surgery on his left knee. OJ says he is afraid he will end up in a wheelchair without a specialized surgery but the prison officials refuse to let him leave. 'If it's not life-threatening no one is allowed to leave to get any medical treatment outside of the facility,' an insider revealed. After OJ fell, the eyewitness continued, 'He struggled to his feet and went right back to get into this guy's face and spit on him. 'The guy flipped out and went after OJ. OJ put up his fists to fight back and was yelling that he was going to teach this guy a lesson. But the other inmates jumped and tried to hold both of them back but they were both so furious it was almost a riot. Entitled:  OJ is causing so much trouble at the prison that they either want him to get parole or be transferred somewhere else, says the insider. 'OJ is still the same guy he was when he came here — feels like the world owes him something — and they are tired of it' Just one of the boys: OJ, who is housed in the minimum security tier - or section - of the prison has to stand in line with all of the other inmates for medications and meals from minimum to maximum security . 'Everybody was yelling and pushing and then the guards, the sharp shooters, cocked their rifles, it sounded like a huge door metal slammed, and everyone dropped to the floor all at once. The guards were pointing their rifles at OJ and the other guy and they froze where they were.' The guards came down on the tier and cuffed the prisoner who was later identified as Waugh and ordered OJ to just go back to his cell immediately. Says the eyewitness: 'While the guy was dragged away he looked back and screamed; 'I am going to make it my mission to kill you n****r a**. You will not leave here alive - do you hear me!'And then he made a symbol with his hands of shooting a gun at OJ. 'Of course, being arrogant OJ just laughed at him in his face but later asked his friendlier fellow inmates if they knew that guy and if he really had the juice to make something happen. 'They told him yeah, he's the real deal and if they were him they would be very afraid. They told OJ that guy had a reputation of being a very brutal, violent guy, who has a lot of connections inside and outside of the prison. That's why he was housed in the maximum security tier. They told OJ he should watch his back. 'OJ tried to pretend he wasn't worried but he kept quiet the rest of the night in his cell, which is unusual, so everyone knew he was rattled by the murder threats.' Now there are grumblings among the inmates that OJ gets special treatment and always has. They were angry because how can OJ spit in someone's face and not be put in isolation like the other dude. Painful: OJ's knee injuries are a result from his 11-year career as a running back in the NFL. He doesn't walk around the prison a lot like he used to but when he has to walk to get his meals in the commissary he walks with a new silver cane while grimacing in pain . On display: OJ's knee injuries had such an impact on his health, attorney Johnnie Cochran, used his disability in his trial for the murder of wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, to convince the jury that he was not physically capable of the killings. At one point Cochran instructed OJ to stand and raise his suit pant leg to show the jury his multiple scars on his left knee to prove he was severely handicapped . Spitting in someone's face is basically an assault and they were also saying he also should have been charged with inciting a riot . 'OJ has caused a lot of trouble for everybody,'  the eyewitness added, 'That's why the inmates were trying to stop them from fighting. Because when this happens all of the inmates are put on lockdown or stripped of their privileges. 'And the weather is just now starting to get nice and they were sent back to their cells and couldn't go outside. OJ has more than the racist guy to worry about these days.' Insiders say OJ was sent to the Lovelock Correctional Center because it was a low-level security facility and they were trying to send him somewhere he could serve his time quietly and to prevent publicity. But OJ has been more trouble than they anticipated because he is so arrogant — and a bully, says the prison insider. OJ is scheduled to be up for parole in 2017 and inside sources say the prison authorities are hoping OJ will be released because they are tired of his entitled attitude and want him gone. 'No one gives a crap about OJ but he's just causing so much trouble at the prison that they either want him to get parole or transferred someone else. OJ is still the same guy he was when he came here — feels like the world owes him something — and they are tired of it,' say the insider. 'And no one has seen Waugh since the incident so they think he got a couple of weeks in isolation but when he gets out he's going to be so pissed off,'  the eyewitness concluded. Calls to Lovelock Correctional Center were not returned to Daily Mail Online.","OJ's altercation with white supremacist prisoner 'Blu' began after Simpson cut into the line to get his medicines first .

"DJ Neil Fox has today been charged with a string of sex offences, including indecent assault on a girl under the age of 14. Police have charged the former Pop Idol judge, known as Doctor Fox, with nine offences involving six alleged victims, three of whom were allegedly aged under 16 at the time. Lawyers for the 53-year-old, from Fulham, south west London, today said he 'categorically denies' all the allegations. Scroll down for video . DJ Neil Fox (pictured outside his west London home today) has been charged with nine sex offences against six alleged victims, including three who were allegedly aged under 16 at the time . It comes following his arrest in September last year, then again in December and earlier this month. In a statement, Anthony Burton said: 'It is wholly inappropriate at this stage for Mr Fox to make any comment, save that he categorically denies each and every allegation that has been made against him.' The charges relating to the three girls are alleged to have taken place between 1991 and 1996. The other three women were allegedly attacked by Fox between 2003 and 2014. Mr Fox, who is currently suspended from his regular slot at Magic FM, was first arrested in connection with the inquiry at the radio studios in September last year, before being taken to a central London police station. Lawyers for the 53-year-old, from Fulham, south west London, said he 'categorically denies' the allegations . The DJ was arrested again in December over three alleged sexual assaults involving different women. Scotland Yard said he was arrested again earlier this month after voluntarily attending Charing Cross police station in London in connection with an alleged sexual assault against another victim. This offence is said to have happened in the early 1990s. Mr Fox has now been charged with one count of indecent assault on a female aged under 14 and two counts of indecent assault on females aged under 16. In relation to the more recent allegations, he is charged with four counts of indecent assault on a female over 16 and two counts of sexual assault on females. A Scotland Yard spokesman added that the charges had not been brought as part of Operation Yewtree - the high profile probe into alleged sexual offences sparked by the Jimmy Savile scandal. Police said Mr Fox will appear on bail at Westminster Magistrates' Court on April 16. Lawyers for DJ Neil Fox, a former Pop Idol judge from Fulham, south west London, today said he 'categorically denies each and every allegation that has been made against him' Mr Fox, who is known by nicknames 'Doctor Fox' and 'Foxy, started his career in local radio before moving the Radio Luxembourg and later Capital FM. There he presented in a number of slots, rising to fame as a DJ in the early 1990s. In 1993 he was given the job of hosting the Pepsi Network Chart on Sunday afternoon. The Top 40 show soared in popularity and at one time had a bigger audience than its Radio 1 rival. He was later rumoured to have been offered the coveted breakfast slot on Radio 1, following the departure of Chris Evans. Fox went on to present a Channel 5 TV show based around the Pepsi Top 40 Chart and has won numerous awards throughout his career. But he is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade. Two years later Fox took the breakfast show chair on 105.4 Magic FM and has remained there ever since.

"Her black leather handbag sold for a rather conservative £25,000 at auction four years ago. But collectors seem less willing to part with the same amount of money for Margaret Thatcher’s armoured 'battle bus', which is rusting in a dealer's yard because nobody will meet the asking price. The 1983-registered, 17.5-tonne vehicle - which has travelled less than 17,500 miles - was built in an armoured shell for the former prime minister in Northern Ireland, after the Brighton bombing. No buyers; The 1983-registered, 17.5-tonne vehicle - which has travelled less than 17,500 miles - was built in an armoured shell for Margaret Thatcher's use in Northern Ireland, following the Brighton bombing . Strength: The bus, powered by a 12-litre Rolls-Royce engine, can carry about 35 passengers and features a blast-proof floor and armour-plated glass throughout, as well as a bomb-proof armour-plated body . It is not clear exactly when Baroness Thatcher used the vehicle on her visits to Northern Ireland, although it was deemed safe to transport the politician and her ministers there during the Troubles. Her first visit to Northern Ireland as prime minister was to Belfast in August 1979, three months after taking office - and two years before the hunger strikes by republican prisoners in 1981. And a year after the Brighton bomb,  she signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, giving the Irish Republic a say in Northern Ireland's affairs for the first time - causing unrest among unionists. The bus, powered by a 12-litre Rolls-Royce engine, can carry about 35 passengers and features a blast-proof floor and armour-plated glass throughout, as well as a bomb-proof armour-plated body. But the vehicle has been sitting for a year in a lot in rural Northamptonshire owned by tanks and surplus military equipment dealer Nick Mead, after he paid £16,940 for it February 2013. The bus was almost sold last year to a foreign buyer in Iran for £17,000, but the deal fell through because of the huge shipping costs involved. Interior: The vehicle has been sitting for a year in a lot in rural Northamptonshire owned by tanks and surplus military equipment dealer Nick Mead, after he paid £16,940 for it February 2013 . Seating: Designed and built by Glover and Webb using Foden and Rolls Royce parts, the bus also has its own auxiliary generator and air supply in case of attack . Mr Mead said: ‘It has been on the market about a year. This is not something you can easily flog - (it) gives total protection to 36 people. It is not Ukraine or Afghanistan. ‘It might look as out of date as a Centurion tank, but it could save a lot of lives. You would not be saying it was out of date if someone was firing rocket powered grenades at you.’ The bulletproof glass is 2in thick, and the blast-proof floor is 2ft deep. Mr Mead said a rocket-propelled grenade would blow the wheels off, although the vehicle could take the hit. But he added. ‘It has blue windows and is about as streamlined as a brick with huge wheels on it. ‘It weighs 17.5 tonnes - double the normal weight of a bus - but can do 80mph because it is fitted with a V5 tank engine. It was designed to get her out of trouble. On the road: Baroness Thatcher on a campaign bus in south-east London with her husband Denis in 1987 -  a different vehicle to the one now up for sale in Northamptonshire . Three decades ago: Baroness Thatcher survived the Brighton bombing in 1984 in which the IRA's Patrick Magee attacked a hotel (above) where Conservative Party conference attendees were staying . Landmark moment: One year after the Brighton bomb, Baroness Thatcher (right) famously signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, giving the Republic of Ireland a say in Northern Ireland's affairs for the first time . ‘One guy from the SAS rang up and told us some of the windows looked funny because they had been blown out on the training exercise and replaced with a different tint. But we have fixed that.’ Designed and built by Glover and Webb using Foden and Rolls Royce parts, the bus also has its own auxiliary generator and air supply in case of attack. Baroness Thatcher, who died in 2013, survived the Brighton bombing in 1984 in which the IRA's Patrick Magee attacked a hotel where Conservative Party conference attendees were staying. For many years after she left Downing Street in 1990, the bus was used to ferry troops from Londonderry Airport to Belfast escorted by two Saracen armoured vehicles. After being sold off by the army, it went to a research laboratory who used it to protect onlookers watching explosions during weapons testing - and was then bought by Mr Mead’s Tanks a Lot.","1983-registered, 17.5-tonne vehicle  has travelled less than 17,500 miles .

"A disgraced podiatrist has sold his oceanfront mansion under the hammer as two of his patients chase multi-million dollar compensation payouts. Paul Bours and wife Helen are believed to have sold their four-bedroom home at Bronte in Sydney's east for several million dollars when it went to auction on February 20, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The exact price of the Hewlett Street home - which has private beach access, a heated pool and panoramic views of the ocean - has not been disclosed by real estate agents. Paul Bours and wife Helen are believed to have sold their four-bedroom home at Bronte in Sydney's east for several million dollars when it went to auction on February 20 . It comes as two patients chase million dollar compensation payouts after Dr Bours was found guilty of serious professional misconduct by the Health Care Complaints Commission in October. Dr Paul Bours was found guilty of serious professional misconduct by the Health Care Complaints Commission in October . Dr Bours is facing two lawsuits in the District and Supreme court from patients who visited him for routine procedures between 2009 and 2011. The complaints commission took Dr Bours to the NSW Civil & Administrative Tribunal over his care and treatment of four patients. One patient, a 65-year-old woman, was told she could wear high heels to her daughter's wedding two months after surgery to remove a minor bunion on her left big toe. But she still wasn't able to wear heels two years later due to severe swelling and pain. The commission was told the woman claimed she thought she was only having surgery to her big toe given their conversations about it being a minor surgery. Yet after suffering such severe pain, Dr Bours told the woman he had broken 20 bones in her foot to straighten her toes to give her the 'perfect foot'. The woman now has two different size feet, a badly distorted big toenail and she sees a psychiatrist every three months. A 24-year-old woman had a consultation with Dr Bours about toe fungus, but ended up agreeing to surgery to remove minor bunions. The commission heard Dr Bours showed the woman pictures of deformed feet as an indication of what could happen to her when she got older. She now has problems walking, can no longer run distances and can't wear high heels. The exact price of the Hewlett Street home - which has private beach access, a heated pool and panoramic views of the ocean - has not been disclosed by real estate agents . The Bronte property has panoramic ocean views and private access to a path leading directly to the beach . A man who worked as a gardener told the commission he had surgery on his toes to relieve pressure on his joints. His toe ended up being shorter as a result of the procedure - a fact he says he wasn't told prior to surgery. The man also reported pins used to fuse his joints started to come out of the bone and into flesh by about half a centimetre after surgery. The tribunal found Dr Bours failed to give a realistic view of risks and complications of surgeries to his patients. The property has a cutom builty kitchen and the living areas opens out to a lush garden with heated pool .

"Jailed: Carrie Russel, 26, was put in a Japanese prison for possessing Adderall - which is illegal in Japan . A teacher from Oregon has been freed from a Japanese jail after being locked up for three weeks for possessing the prescription drug Adderall. Carrie Russell, 26, was arrested on February 20 after admitting to police that she had been sent a stash of Adderall pills in the mail. The medicine, prescribed by her doctor back home, is common in the United States, but banned in Japan. She was let out of jail on Tuesday after U.S. government officials, including Caroline Kennedy, daughter of President Kennedy and the current ambassador to Japan, negotiated her release. Russell's mother, a doctor, posted the a three-month supply of the pills to an address in South Korea, from which Russell forwarded them to her home in Nagoya, Japan, according to The Oregonian. Police tracked her down to a restaurant and arrested her while she was dining with friends. She knew just four words of Japanese. Russell, who had a job in Nagoya teaching English, told the newspaper she was taken to a detention center with Japanese cellmates and given chores to do. She said the facility was 'not anything terrifying'. She said she was fed Bento box meals in women's prison, where guards tried to speak with her in English and she picked up more Japanese. Arrest: Police tracked Russell down to a restaurant after learning she had brought a three-month supply of Adderall pills into the country. She knew just four words of Japanese when she was arrested . In the meantime, members of Congress, the Japanese embassy, and even the White House were reportedly involved in intense negotiations to set her free - despite the Japan's harsh anti-amphetamine laws, which often carry lengthy jail sentences. The details of the negotiations are not clear, but Kennedy, who made the case a priority, managed to convince local prosecutors not to file charges, and to let her go. Russell's family wrote an apologetic letter to the Japanese government, saying she had never intended to break the law. In a statement announcing her release, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) proclaimed that 'common sense has won the day'. Negotiations: Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, helped secure Russell's release. She is pictured above with the governor of Tokyo in December 2014 . He continued: 'I want to thank Ambassador Kennedy and her staff for working closely with our office and their Japanese counterparts to get her released.' Russell's stepfather, attorney Loren Podwill, has flown to Japan to meet her and bring her back to Oregon. She added that she wants to come back, if she can find another job. She said: 'In spite of this, I love Japan'.

It was alleged the girl was attacked by four teenage boys aged between 14 and 16, The Courier Mail reported. A 15-year-old boy has been charged over the gang rape of a six-year-old girl on Mornington Island . She was reportedly taken from an Aboriginal community on the island to Townsville Hospital after the attack. A Queensland Police Service spokesman said the charges laid on Tuesday relate to that investigation. No other charges have yet been laid and it's understood investigations are continuing. Mornington Island is the largest of the North Wellesley Islands off the northern Queensland coast and has an indigenous population of more than 1000, primarily Lardil people. At the time of the incident, it was understood the group who were thought to be involved in the incident were taken from the island, with permission from the family. It was alleged the girl was attacked by four teenage boys aged between 14 and 16 . This was done as it was feared tensions would flare in the community and trigger a riot, News Corp reported. The four teenagers were put into the care of the Department of Child Safety in Mt Isa, in Queensland's north-west. News of the attack even reached the ears of then-premier Campbell Newman. Mornington Island has a history of unrest between families, which are further agitated by drinking issues and physical violence.

"Neanderthals may have created and worn the world's first jewellery 130,000 years ago, according to scientists. Researchers examining eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Krapina in Croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet. The claws bear multiple cut marks, notches and signs that they had been polishing by the Neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found. The eagle talons shown above were found at a site inhabited by Neanderthals and are the earliest example of jewellery yet discovered, according to researchers who have re-examined them 100 years after they were found . The findings will add to mounting evidence that Neanderthals were not the slow-witted and primative creatures they are often portrayed as. Instead they are emerging as having had a sophisticated culture, were highly intelligent and may have even created art. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly 2 per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. The new findings suggest that the talons may have had a symbolic purpose - something that some anthropologists have argued Neanderthals did not possess or copied off modern humans. However, Dr David Frayer, an anthropologist at the University Kansas who led the study along with colleagues in Croatia, said the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in Europe. He said: 'It's really a stunning discovery. 'It's one of those things that just appeared out of the blue. 'It's so unexpected and it's so startling because there's just nothing like it until very recent times to find this kind of jewellery.' The eight talons were discovered more than 100 years ago at a site where Neanderthal remains have been found just outside the town of Krapina in northern Croatia. The researchers examined the talons and found that four of them bear multiple smooth edged cut marks around the top. Three of the largest talons also have small notches at roughty the same place along upper area of the talon blade. All eight of the talons appear to show signs of polishing. The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Public Library of Science One, say the cut marks are evidence that they talons and connecting bones were cut from the foot of the eagle and attached to a string or sinew. Along with colleagues at the Croatian Natural History Museum, Dr Frayer said: 'These talons provide multiple new lines of evidence for Neanderthals’ abilities and cultural sophistication. 'They are the earliest evidence for jewellery in the European fossil record and demonstrate that Neanderthals possessed a symbolic culture long before more modern human forms arrived in Europe. Our traditional view of Neanderthals, shown above in the reconstruction at the Natural History Museum in London, is of a primative and stupid species but new evidence suggests they were  intelligent and cultured . Cuts and notches on the talons (shown above) suggest they were strung on sinew as a bracelet or necklace . 'Some have argued that Neandertals lacked symbolic ability or copied this behavior from modern humans. 'These remains clearly show that the Krapina Neandertals made jewelry well before the appearance of modern humans in Europe, extending ornament production and symbolic activity early into the European Mousterian.' Previously the oldest jewellery to be discovered in the world were some seashells that had showed signs of being used as beads around 100,000 years ago in Israel and Africa but were thought to have been made by modern humans. The new discovery now suggests that Neatherthals were also capable to creating jewellery, other sophisticated 'art', and may even have had rudimentary religion. The talons were discovered at a site inhabited by Neanderthals close to the town of Krapina in northern Croatia . The shells above were found in Israel and were thought to be the earliest example of beads that were worn as jewellery - dating to around 100,000 years ago - but the eagle talons predate these by up to 30,000 years . Previously scientists have found evidence that Neanderthals may have created engravings on rocks in Gibraltar while modified feathers and shells have also been found alongside their remains. Researchers believe Neanderthals used their mouths as a third hand for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat. In July, the biggest collection of ancient human fossils ever recovered lent weight to this theory. The collection reveals how Neanderthals developed their distinctive teeth before their brains, using them as a third hand for holding objects. The study adds to theories that the Neanderthals evolved their characteristic looks slowly, and intermittently, over hundreds of thousands of years. The ancient skulls, dating back 400,000 years, show Neanderthal-like features in the face and teeth, while other parts of the skulls, including the brain case, resembled those of more primitive human ancestors. This suggests the earliest Neanderthals used their jaws in a particular way for chewing as well as for holding objects. Such findings are also raising new questions about how this now extinct branch of the human family tree died out. Scientists have long believed that they died out as modern humans, Homo sapiens, moved into the parts of Asia and Europe where Homo neanderthalensis had lived. Others believe instead that as the climate warmed they were unable to cope or even merged with modern humans through interbreeding. Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said the discovery of the talons shed new light on Neanderthal intelligence. He said: 'This research gives us two important bits of information about Neanderthals and their intelligence levels. 'One, that they made symbolic objects which clearly means they thought in a very similar way to us, and two, much more importantly, that they were capable of making complex symbolic objects in complete isolation from us. 'Similar evidence from France dated to around 35,000 years ago is sometimes held up as an example of neanderthals copying us. 'But the date and location of the Krapina material means that this is clear evidence of independent Neanderthal innovation at its best. 'The last five years has seen our view of Neanderthals revolutionised - it is time to put the stupid cave man image to bed once and for all.' Neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago, spreading to inhabit much of Europe and parts of Asia, but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago. The reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated Homo sapiens. They were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age Europe. However, a series of discoveries are now putting Neanderthals into a new light. Stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination. A 60,000-year-old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in France also suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices . A recent discovery by researchers at the Muséum National d'Histories Naturelle in Paris suggests that Neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them. They discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones. Many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments. Cross-hatched engravings found inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are also thought to be the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art. DNA analysis has also shown that Neanderthals carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak. The traditional image of Neanderthals as primative creatures like above is no longer holding up to evidence .","Eight eagle talons were found at a site in Croatia inhabited by Neanderthals .
They had cut marks that suggest they had been strung together with sinew .
The claws, cut from the feet of a white tailed eagle, had also been polished .

"A teenage skateboarder has died after he was hit by a train while being followed by police. The 16-year-old, named locally as Mitchell Rodgers, had just been spoken to by officers who were continuing to follow him 'from a distance away' when he was hit by a passing train near Belper Railway Station in Derbyshire. He died at the scene at just before 10pm on Saturday in what has been described by police as a 'tragic accident.' A teenage skateboarder, named locally as Mitchell Rodgers, has died after he was hit by a train in Belper, Derbyshire, while being followed by police . Officers are thought to have spoken to a number of other teenagers, including Mitchell, following an 'incident' in the town centre. Det Ch Insp Julian Wilson said: 'We don't believe it was a deliberate act. We are investigating it as a tragic accident.' The case had been passed to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) watchdog. Derbyshire Police confirmed the teenager was a pupil at the John Flamsteed Community School in Denby. A spokeswoman said: 'Shortly after the officers arrived, a collision occurred between a male and a train close to Belper train station. 'The man was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene. Derbyshire Constabulary is now preparing a file for the coroner and the force has also referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.' A Facebook page has since been set up in memory of Mitchell to help create a memorial for the teenager. Shannon Rodgers, who has identified herself as Mitchell's sister, said she wanted to thank the community. She said: 'I would like everyone to know we really appreciate everything that's being done for Mitch it's lovely how much everyone can pull together!' On the fund-raising page, Stephanie Shaw said: 'Taken to soon! You will be missed by many!' Verity Adams added: 'RIP Mitch, thoughts are with your friends and especially your family.' A memorial page has since been set up to the teenager who was a keen skateboarder, to try and raise money for a memorial . And Peter Urbacz offered his services to help in building a memorial. He said: 'There are no words, but acts of kindness might ease the pain. RIP from a fellow skateboarder who never met Mitchell but would respectfully like to offer his service as a woodworker if required in the proposed skatepark bench. My heart goes out his family at this tragic and senseless time.' And on Facebook Rebecca Child offered her condolences to the family. She said: 'I am very sorry to hear what happened to this what looks like an amazing young man my thoughts are with his family and friends.' Chris Smith, who stated he was the teenager's uncle, wrote: 'My nephew didn't take his own life. It was an accident. He was a great 16-year-old lad.' He said tributes had been paid for him at the town's skate park on Sunday. Mr Smith wrote: 'Excellent turnout in support of the family. We really do thank people for their support.' Another post stated that the fund had been set up for people to donate money for Mitchell's funeral and for a bench to be made in his memory. A message left on the fund raising page said: 'Mitchell Rogers was a sweet, young, 16-year-old boy, who tragically died. 'Mitchell was hit by a train and the family have been in pieces ever since. 'The community want to raise funds for a bench or plaque to be made in remembrance of this bright boy - and money towards funeral arrangements and flowers. 'No-one deserves to die the way this boy did and we want to help the families left behind after this awful accident.'

"Scott Disick has checked into a luxury rehab center in Costa Rica. The reality star was pictured jetting off via helicopter to start his stay at the Rythmia Life Advancement Center on Monday. In a statement released via the center, he explained: 'I realise my issues are bigger than me and I'm ready to truly remedy this struggle I continue to battle.' It later emerged that Scott first visited the center back in February, but kept that spell in treatment confidential. Off to rehab: Scott Disick, second right, poses in front of a helicopter escorting him to the Rythmia Life Advancement Center; he is seen with RLAC COO Dr Jeff McNairy, Jeremy Geffen, and RLAC CEO Gerard Powell . Luxury stay:The boutique rehab center is located in tropical Guanacaste, Costa Rica, on a private estate only minutes from the beach . Scott's latest rehab stay came as it was revealed that he was found shoeless and drunk stumbling around his hotel lobby on Sunday morning after a paid appearance at an Atlantic City club. The previous evening he had been openly downing shots of tequila before taking the microphone to rant onstage. A hotel source told TMZ that the reality star had to be escorted back to his room by a supervisor. The club promoter had already made headlines by cancelling three club appearances while in the UK earlier this month, only letting fans know at the last minute via Twitter. Scott did not mention his recent troubles in his statement, instead explaining why he chose the center. 'While I have been unconvinced in the past of treatment and therapy methods, Rythmia's rehab approach puts my worries at ease,' he said. 'The fact that there is a money back guarantee that has never been called upon gives me even more confidence. I am looking forward to starting my therapy and iboga treatment there.' Scott will be treated with the controversial drug Ibogaine, which is made from the psychedelic African rainforest shrub iboga. Ibogaine reputedly causes hallucinations similar to LSD - it is banned in the U.S. Perhaps not the perfect job: Despite difficulties controlling his drinking, Scott continues to promote clubs; he is seen on Saturday at Harrah's Resort in Atlantic City - where he was later found wandering shoeless around his hotel lobby . And the center even offers 'shaman-supervised flights' while patients are taking the drug. While not undergoing treatment, Scott will certainly not be deprived. The boutique rehab center is located in tropical Guanacaste, Costa Rica, on a private estate only minutes from the beach. According to a press release it 'affords guests a secluded and serene environment with the utmost privacy.' As well as undergoing 'intensive' rehab the 31-year-old can also make use of the fitness center, five-star restaurant and full-service spa with mud bath. And indeed Scott knows exactly what he is committing to - having secretly visited the center in February. 'Scott was here last month,' Charles Johnston, director of addiction treatment at Rythmia told the magazine In Touch. And he added: 'It’s just getting him to the place where he’s ready to give up that lifestyle and hopefully that will happen soon.' Soldiering on: While her long-term partner is seeking treatment Kourtney Kardashian will be juggling the care of her three children - three-month-old Reign Aston [not seen], Mason, five, and Penelope, two . This is certainly not Scott's first spell in rehab - just last summer he spent time in a treatment facility, as fans saw on Kourtney and Khloe Take the Hamptons. It came after he was hospitalised for alcohol poisoning. The father-of-three's struggles to control his drinking have been a recurrent theme on the Kardashian reality shows, with viewers watching as Kourtney tries to support her long-term partner. And following the death of both Scott's parents within months of one another, he has spoken openly of his unhappiness and anxiety. Scott's mother Bonnie Disick, 63, passed away in October 2013 following a lengthy illness. His father, Jeffrey, died a few months later in January. 'I literally just want to jump out of my skin it's that bad,' he said of his anxiety on KAKTTH, admitting he was taking medication. Scott and Kourtney welcomed their youngest son in December, with little Reign Aston joining big brother Mason, five, and sister Penelope, two. A spokesperson for the family did not respond to requests for comment. Hands full: Kourtney takes Penelope to dance class last week .","Scott will be treated with the controversial psychedelic drug Ibogaine which is banned in the U.S.

"United Nations investigators have found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq. The human rights office published a horrifying report describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists, suggesting they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.' The report, based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors of attacks in Iraq between June 2014 and February 2015, highlights brutal ISIS attacks on the Yazidis. Scroll down for video . Atrocities: Thousands of members of the Yazidi religious minority were forced to flee a 2014 offensive by Islamic State militants in northern Iraq . They have made calls for the perpetrators to be brought to justice at the International Criminal Court. ISIS, which controls a swathe of territory in Iraq and neighbouring Syria, launched a series of systematic and widespread attacks on the Yazidi minority's heartland in the northern Nineveh province last August. The jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed, while younger boys were forced to become child solders and women and girls were abducted as the 'spoils of war', according to the investigators. Head of the investigation, Suki Nagra, said: 'These attacks were aimed at destroying the Yazidi as a group,' suggesting ISIS was guilty of 'genocide' against the minority. The report, which was ordered by the UN Human Rights Council last September following a request from the Iraqi government, pointed out that some villages 'were entirely emptied of their Yazidi population.' Evidence of genoside: A mass grave containing the remains of members of the Yazidi community was discovered by Kurdish forces near the Iraqi village of Sinuni in February . Many Yazidi women and girls were sold into sexual slavery or handed over to IS members as 'gifts', the report said, adding that witnesses had described hearing girls as young as six screaming for help as they were raped in a house used by IS fighters. Boys as young as eight were forced to convert to Islam and given religious and military training, including being forced to watch videos of beheadings, the report said. 'One of the most shocking thing was how organised the attacks have been,' Nagra told reporters. The Yazidis at first thought they would be given the same choice as Christians in places overrun by the jihadists: to convert to Islam, pay a tax or leave. But then the fighters received orders via telephone, and suddenly the men and older boys were being marched off to be executed. 'There was a clear chain of command,' she said. Innocent: A Yazidi child whose family fled a 2014 offensive by Islamic State militants at the Dohuk shelter for displaced civilians in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region . According to witness and victim testimony, foreign fighters from at least 10 countries, including a couple of westerners, had taken part in the attacks, as had some people from neighbouring villages. The Yazidis, whose ancient religion has elements of Christianity, Islam and Zoroastrianism, are considered to be devil worshippers by the Sunni Muslim militants. Other religious and ethnic groups have also been targeted, according to the report, including Christians, Turkmen, Kurds and Shia. 'No community has been spared,' said Nagra, pointing to the thousands of Christians who fled their homes last June after being ordered by IS fighters to convert to Islam, pay a tax or leave. IS fighters attacked the Badoush prison that month, dividing the 3,000 inmates into groups, freeing the Sunnis and loading the remaining 600 mainly Shia inmates onto trucks, before driving them to a ravine and shooting them. The jihadists have also ruthlessly targeted anyone perceived to be connected with the Iraqi government, the report said, pointing to the massacre last June of up to 1,700 cadets from the Speicher army base, after they reportedly surrendered. One witness had described how the cadets were either shot or beheaded, and said he had seen several IS fighters 'kicking heads around like footballs,' Nagra said. Displaced: Thousands of Yazidis fled across the border into Syria as the religious minority were subjected to mass killing, torture and rape during a 2014 offensive by Islamic State militants in northern Iraq . Outcry: Iraqi Kurdish protesters hold placards and shout slogans denouncing the ISIS threat to Yazidi women and girls during a 2014 demonstration outside the United Nations offices in Arbil . Faced with the horrific scope and details of these crimes, the investigators urged the Iraqi government to allow the cases to be tried before the International Criminal Court. They also called on the UN Security Council to refer the cases to the international court. 'Ensuring that there's no impunity, that there will be accountability' is of the utmost importance, said Hanny Megally, who heads the UN rights office's Middle East branch. The investigators meanwhile said Iraqi security forces and affiliated militia had also been accused of a range of serious crimes during their operations against IS. A separate UN investigation into the situation in neighbouring Syria has also found that IS was committing large-scale atrocities in the war-ravaged country, likely amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity.","Report describes killings, torture, rape and sexual slavery by ISIS .

"Lawyers for Boston Marathon bomber Dzkokhar Tsarnaev rested their case in his federal death penalty trial Tuesday after presenting a brief case aimed at showing his late older brother was the mastermind of the 2013 terror attack. The defense admitted during opening statements that Tsarnaev participated in the bombings, but Tsarnaev's lawyer said he was a troubled 19-year-old who had fallen under the influence of his radicalized brother, Tamerlan, 26. Closing arguments will be held next Monday, April 6. Scroll down for video . FILE - In this March 5, 2015 file courtroom sketch, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, center, is depicted between defense attorneys Miriam Conrad, left, and Judy Clarke, right . FILE - From left, Krystle Campbell, 29, Lu Lingzi, a Boston University graduate student from China, and Martin Richard, 8, all who were killed in the bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon . The defense has made it clear from the beginning of the trial that its strategy is not to win an acquittal for Tsarnaev but to save him from the death penalty. If the jury convicts Tsarnaev — an event that seems a foregone conclusion because of his admitted guilt — the same jury will be asked to decide whether he should be executed or spend the rest of his life in prison. During its brief case, the defense called a cell site analyst who showed that Tsarnaev was at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth when Tamerlan purchased components of the two bombs used in the 2013 attack, including pressure cookers and BBs. They also called Mark Spencer, a digital forensics expert, who testified about Tamerlan’s computer history and his fascination with jihadist literature and learning how to construct bombs. Tsarnaev's lawyer told jurors that it was Tamerlan who shot and killed MIT police Officer Sean Collier three days after the bombings. Tamerlan died after a gun battle with police hours after Collier's slaying. An FBI photographer was also called in hopes of showing that Tsarnaev did not target specific individuals with the bombs. FBI fingerprint examiner Elaina Graff was the fourth witness, who testified that Tamerlan's prints were found on a transmitter, a pressure cooker lid, a jar of nails, a caulking gun, rolls of duct tape and a soldering iron, and Tsarnaev's prints were found on just on a container of gunpowder found near the scene of his shootout with police. She did state however that prints could easily be destroyed in an explosion. FILE - This undated file photo provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, charged in the Boston Marathon bombing . Prosecutors called more than 90 witnesses over 15 days of testimony, including bombing survivors who described losing limbs in the attack. Three people were killed and more than 260 were wounded when two pressure cooker bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013. Jurors saw gruesome autopsy photos of the three killed: 8-year-old Martin Richard, a Boston boy who had gone to the marathon with his family that day; 23-year-old Lingzi Lu, a graduate student from China who was studying at Boston University; and 29-year-old Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager.","Lawyers for Boston Marathon bomber Dzkokhar Tsarnaev rested their case today after calling just four witnesses .

"Stars generate sounds on their surface in an unexpected way, according to new experimental evidence. Of course, as space is a vacuum it is impossible to hear sound in space, but the discovery reveals a new way that fluids can interact to produce a sound - one with an extremely high frequency. The discovery was made by a team of scientists including Dr John Pasley of the York Plasma Institute in the Department of Physics. A team of scientists that included York University made the discovery. They fired an ultra-intense laser on fluids in a laboratory. When they did this, the plasma in the fluid produced a sound wave. This process is thought to also be taking place in stars (sun pictured) They found that, when material - dust or gas from nearby - falls onto a star, it can produce an extremely high pitched sound in the plasma. Dr Pasley told MailOnline that the phenomenon is 'more common in younger stars' that are still accumulating material from their surroundings. It would be less common in more mature stars, like our sun. To make the finding, the team studied fluids in motion in a laboratory and found that, when plasma is hit with an ultra-intense laser, it produces some strange effects. Using a method not too dissimilar to how a speed camera works, they were able to observe how the fluid moves at the point it is struck. Often called the fourth state of matter, plasma is a state of matter where heat or another energy has been added to a gas. This makes many of its atoms release some, or all, of their electrons. The resultant electrically charged gas is said to be ‘ionised’, and when enough atoms are ionised, the gas is said to be a plasma. Interestingly, plasma is thought to make up more than 99 per cent of all matter in the universe. A trillionth of a second after the laser hits, plasma was found to flow quickly from areas of high density to low density. In so doing, the plasma between the regions of different density produces pressure pulses, or a sound wave. However, with a frequency of nearly a trillion hertz, the sound wave produced is six million times higher in frequency than anything that can be heard by a mammal. It is also almost the highest frequency possible in such a material. According to the scientists, a prime location for this rare event occurring is on the surface of stars. The process is thought to be taking place on stars like the sun, pictured, where plasma is in abundance. In fact, plasma is thought to make up 99 per cent of matter in the universe . ‘When they are accumulating new material, stars could generate sound in a very similar manner to that which we observed in the laboratory - so the stars might be singing - but, since sound cannot propagate through the vacuum of space, no-one can hear them,’ said Dr Pasley. However, he noted that it would be difficult to directly observe this effect in stars, as the sound waves do not propagate into the space around the star. ‘It was initially hard to determine the origin of the acoustic signals, but our model produced results that compared favourably with the wavelength shifts observed in the experiment,’ added Dr Alex Robinson, from the Plasma Physics Group at the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s Central Laser Facility in Oxfordshire. ‘This showed that we had discovered a new way of generating sound from fluid flows. Similar situations could occur in plasma flowing around stars.’ The research, published in Physical Review Letters, was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.","A team of scientists that included York University made the discovery .

"Alexandra Walkden, 62, was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease . A grandmother claims she was left 'looking like Nanny McPhee' after 13 of her teeth fell out due to dodgy dental treatment. Alexandra Walkden, 62, was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease. Her grandchildren likened her appearance to the screen governess with magical powers played by Emma Thompson. As a result, she was forced to pay £24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants. Now Mrs Walkden, a telesales worker from Preston, Lancashire, has won £35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist, Dr John Musgrave, 57. She said: 'I had to have surgery to remove 13 teeth and eventually have implants fitted. 'I looked like somebody who had been in a car crash. I had black eyes, swollen mouth and I couldn't eat for a week. It's ruined my life. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. 'My grandchildren would call my Nanny McPhee when I didn't have my dentures in because I had just one tooth at the top.' Mrs Walkden had been a patient of Dr Musgrave at the Preston-based Incisive Dental Practice for 30 years and attended dental appointments with him every six months. She said: 'During these years I didn't think anything was wrong. I'd get the all clear. 'Or I would say I was having problems and he would say he would have a poke around and say its fine and to see him in six months. 'If there were problems or a tooth was twinging, he would look at it or find a cavity and say it needs filling. I trusted him implicitly. Whatever he said, I believed. She added: 'As far as I know he did a routine check but he never told me I had gum disease. He never offered for me to see a hygienist.' The truth emerged during a holiday in 2013 with her partner when Mrs Walkden's crown fell out and she went to see a local dentist. To her horror, it emerged her teeth were rotting from the inside out. She said: 'When I went to see him the first thing he said was ""when was the last time you went to the dentist?"". 'When I said ""3 months ago"", he said ""that's not what your teeth are telling me"". 'I was completely shocked. We cut our holiday short and came home. 'I went to another dentist close to home and they confirmed I was going to lose all my top set of teeth.' 'You can't imagine the reaction when someone tell you they will have to take all your teeth out. It was horrible. 'They asked if I wanted to sit down.. It was a feeling that was absolutely horrendous. I had 13 teeth removed. 'I also had a wisdom tooth on the bottom removed that was beyond saving and had to have an implant to replace that wisdom tooth.' Despite paying for regular private dental treatment for 30 years, Mrs Walkden was horrified to be told by another dentist that her teeth were rotting from the inside out - and the top row would need to be removed . Her grandchildren likened her appearance to Nanny McPhee, the screen governess with magical powers played by Emma Thompson. Mrs Walkden, had to endure a number of deep cleaning treatments to treat the gum disease before all but four of her top set of teeth were removed. She said: 'I had to go through a few treatments of that. I have never experienced pain like that before as they clean beneath the gum line - it's very high powered. It was like torture but it had to be done. 'Then I went to have my teeth extracted, all but 4 at first. They fitted me there and then with a partial denture.' 'I had to get used to something so alien in my mouth and learn how to speak again as it changes the shape of your mouth. I didn't want to be left with dentures for the rest of time.' Mrs Walkden eventually underwent implant surgery in April 2013 and had to go to the dentist every week. She said: 'I have spent hours at the dentists and thousands of pounds and I have only been left with around £11,000 for pain and suffering. 'Compensation is not a ""pay out"". No amount of money can compensate for having lost my teeth. 'The money I've received will be used to cover the thousands of pounds I have paid out of my own pocket for all the necessary remedial and cosmetic work. 'If I weren't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought, I don't know what state my mouth would be in right now.' She added: 'This is all because this dentist didn't do proper checks. If he had done X-rays he would have known. It is basically negligence. 'I put the time in going to the dentists and I expected to be taken care of. If you look at the dentists records you see check-up after check-up every 6 months. You just don't expect to end up going through this.' 'I felt utterly betrayed by Dr Musgrave when I found out the extent of the damage to my teeth and gums. 'I've worked hard all my life to pay for extra things in life like private dental insurance and have never missed a dentist appointment. Mrs Walkden was forced to pay £24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants. She has now won £35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist, Dr John Musgrave . She said: 'If I weren't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought, I don't know what state my mouth would be in right now' 'I thought I was taking good care of my teeth and assumed that my dental insurer would have taken steps to screen its members. It was wrong to assume that my dentist's inclusion on the insurance register was a quality guarantee. 'It ruined my confidence. In that situation you just don't want to go anywhere - it's horrendous. It does nothing for your confidence and leaves you very self-conscious.' Associate solicitor, Heather Owen at the Dental Law Partnership which represented Mrs Walkden said: 'Alexandra's case was one of long-term mistreatment, compounded by a string of failures by her dentist Dr Musgrave. 'He routinely failed to check the health of her teeth, screen for gum disease, remove decay or even carry out appropriate preventative care. 'At no point was the patient advised of alternative treatment options or referred to specialists when her oral health started to decline.' Dr Musgrave, who did not admit liability, refused to comment.","Alexandra Walkden, 62, from Preston, was left virtually toothless .

And unlike the vehicles in Mad Max, it's built to keep drivers comfortable, with leather seats and a DVD player fitted in the cab . Farmers Weekly told MailOnline that GPS steering systems are farmers’ favourite piece of modern farming technology. Steering systems got one third of the total votes out of the top 10 favourite farming tools. They are used to steer tractors in more precise patterns than humans are capable of, resulting in significant savings and improved productivity. GPS provides accurate location information by calculating the distance from at least three satellites and can also be used on farms to analyse soil fertility, Alex Thomasson, professor of biological and agricultural engineering at Texas A&M University wrote in an article for The Conversation. Farmers can use a GPS receiver to collect soil samples from pre-selected parts of fields. They then send the samples off to a lab for analysis, which creates a fertility map of their farm. Farmers can use the map to work out the amount of fertiliser needed for each location, giving their crops the best chance of growing and saving them money. Variable-rate technology (VRT) fertiliser applicators dispense just the right amount of fertiliser in each location, varying the qualities as the farmers go along. Before GPS, it was down to the driver to keep the tractor straight to avoid using too much seed, fertiliser or fuel, but today many farmers have some form of GPS steering, which means overlapping has all but disappeared and straight lines are easy. This has resulted in significant savings and improved productivity, which is why the innovation is a firm favourite with tech-savvy farmers. GPS self-steering systems were voted as being British farmners' favourite piece of modern farming technology in a poll by Farmers Weekly. But not all tractors using the technology are as impressive and inwardly luxurious as this latest model. Despite its rugged appearance, the tractor offers a comfortable ride for drivers. The cab is fitted with climate control and the seat is leather and heated. There is even a DVD player to watch while the tractor follows its pre-set path up and down fields. Only 28 of the machines - which cost up to a quarter of a million pounds each ($373,000) - will be made, and Britain is set to be one of the biggest markets. One East Anglian land-owner said: ‘Years ago a 1,000-acre farm would have employed 40 men - but with a machine like this the same acreage can be farmed by just one man.’ In the film, people travel across an apocalyptic wasteland with few resources in a bid to survive. Max, a man of action and  few words,  seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. This truck is one of the extraordinary vehicles to feature in the latest film . Only 28 of the machines (pictured) - which cost up to a quarter of a million pounds each ($373,000) - will be made, and Britain is set to be one of the biggest markets . The tractor's rugged appearance bears some resemblance to the vehicles in Mad Max. This still from the latest film, shows Tom Hardy, who plays Max riding a motorcycle in considerable discomfort. However, the tractor features luxuries such as leather seats, for example . For farmers, aerial photographs taken by drones offer a quick and easy way to check on the progress of crops and determine where they may need to replant or direct pesticide applications. Researchers at the University of Illinois are using drones on farms to take aerial photos of crops growing in research plots. Dennis Bowman, a crop science teacher at the university, deliberately made mistakes on one test plot by not applying enough nitrogen fertilizer and is now using drones to see if they can reveal potentially weaker crops. ‘As the crop gets up and going, we'll fly over it and see if we can detect those areas sooner than we could visually from the ground,’ he said. ‘We're also looking at doing some scans over our herbicide studies to see if the drone photography can help us identify where crops are stressed by postemergence herbicide applications.’ Mr Bowman spent two summers as a commercial crop scout and said that walking through tasseling corn in high temperatures is unpleasant. ‘The odds of actually getting to the far end of that field on foot to see what's going on are pretty slim. To get a bird's-eye view of your crop, the drones offer a handy way to do it.’ He is using two quadricopters affixed with a Go-Pro camera and a Canon Powershot SX260 camera with a lens for infrared photography to see if they can spot potential crop trouble. ‘Standard pictures and video taken with drones can tell us a lot. But what we're looking to give us even more information is multispectral cameras that can give us imagery in other wavelengths, such as near-infrared, to help us identify areas of crop stress. ‘It probably isn't going to tell us what the problem is, but it will tell us where problems are so that we can target our scouting in those specific areas and determine what might be occurring.’ Infrared images will help the researchers identify plants in the farm that appear to be absorbing or reflecting light differently - an indication that the plants are under some type of stress, such as pests, disease or nutrient deficiencies. The drones may be used to spot an invasive weed called Palmer amaranth, which is spreading across the Midwest and is becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides to the extent that it could drastically reduce farmers' yield potential in affected fields. ‘Before the soybean rows close, or if we get a different spectrum response from some of these weeds as they break through the canopy, we may see some of those weeds show up in the imagery as well to identify where there are hot spots and problems,’ Mr Bowman said.","Tractor has a rugged look and is the latest in agricultural machinery .

"The BBC has denied claims hackers were responsible for its website going offline this afternoon just days after Anonymous threatened to attack the Corporation if Top Gear wasn't reinstated. Those trying to log on to the site at about 1.30pm today were met with an error screen and an image of the old test card clown after the BBC encountered an internal system failure. It came just days after the so-called 'hactivists' reportedly wrote an open letter stating it would use a digital weapon called a DDoS attack to bring down the site after Jeremy Clarkson's suspension. The error message that visitors to the BBC website were met with for about an hour this afternoon after it experienced an 'internal system failure' The BBC posted this message at 1.25pm on Twitter after the website went down. The Corporation denied hackers had anything to do with it, adding that this can happen when it experiences a high volume of traffic . Staying quiet: The Top Gear star was seen arriving back at his west London home today. He has not spoken publicly about the row other than to write in a column that he would not 'dwell' on the issue . However, the BBC denied that hackers are involved in the incident and put it down to an internal system failure. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'The website was down for about an hour but it is all back up and running now. 'It was due to an internal system failure, which can happen when we are experiencing too much traffic or if there is an issue with our servers. 'Some sites were working and some weren't so not everyone trying to access the site was affected.' They added that the error screen, featuring the picture of the test card clown in front of a fire, was protocol when an error of this nature occurs. The Top Gear presenter is set to go before a disciplinary hearing this week after he got into a 'fracas' with the show's producer, Oisin Tymon, and allegedly punched him in the face. Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, was suspended from the BBC on Monday and the Corporation announced the hit motoring show would not be shown on Sunday . The BBC is investigating whether Clarkson 'punched' assistant producer Oisin Tymon, right . He is said to have called Mr Tymon a 'lazy, Irish ****' and threatened to end his career, after a day's filming and allegedly became angry when he could not get the steak he wanted at their hotel. Clarkson was suspended on Monday and the BBC announced Top Gear would not be broadcast this weekend. But upset hackers reportedly jumped to Clarkson's defence and set up #OpBringBackClarkson, saying 'You don't wanna p*** off 300 million people... BBC you are warned… DDOS cannons will fire if you don’t comply,' according to the Mirror. An online petition to bring back the 54-year-old is already at 885,000 signatures and is the most popular petition posted on Change.org in the last two years. However the presented hinted today in his column in the Sun that he might not return to the show. He wrote: 'Nature made a mistake when it invented the dinosaur. It was too big, too violent. 'All the dinosaurs died and now, years later, no one mourns their passing. These big, imposing creatures have no place in a world which has moved on.'

"A wife gave her husband the gift of life for Valentine's Day by donating one of her kidneys. Sun Guofang, 28, beat odds of 100,000-to-one to be a match for Li Fangdong, 33, after he suffered kidney failure shortly after they were married. The couple, who dated for two years before getting wed in 2009, booked in for the life-changing operation on February 14. Devoted: Wife Sun Guofang (left) and husband Li Fangdong before transplant surgery to give him one of her healthy kidneys in Shandong, China . They were checked into the hospital in China's Shandong province where the surgery was successfully carried out this week, People's Daily Online reports. Li and his dad had both initially been against Sun getting tested as they thought she was too young to give up a kidney. So Sun got tested in secret before convincing them to let her do it for the sake of the couple's four-year-old son. She said: 'I actually got the results back saying that we were a match on Valentine's Day, which meant it was the perfect moment to make the offer to my husband and I was glad when he finally accepted. 'I am told I can get by fine with one kidney anyway and I have a healthy diet so I don't expect it to be any real problem.' Ultimate gift: Sun Guofang is wheeled into the operating theatre as she donates one of her kidneys to her husband . In need: Li Fangdong is taken into surgery to receive one of his wife's kidneys they hope will end years of pain . The couple from Liangwang village, near the eastern city of Jinan, are expected to remain in hospital for another five days before they are allowed home. Sun had worked as a sales manager in a local toy company until her mother-in-law was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2009. She was forced to leave her job so she could be closer to where her husband's mother was being treated. Li's mother died two years later. 'I quit my job after my mother-in-law got sick. I sold egg pancakes on the street in the day then went back to work in the shop,' said Sun. Initially, Sun was embarrassed to sell food on the streets so would cover her face with a dust mask. But then her husband became ill and needed dialysis three times a week which cost £64 a session. Worried: Li Fangdong looks anxious before his life-saving surgery while Sun's mother (right) waits nervously outside her room . Recovering: Sun Guofang gives the thumbs up sign after successful surgery to remove her kidney . She said: 'At the time, we owed other people 200,000-300,000 yuan (£32,000). 'I never thought it was a difficult situation, as long as my husband and I strive together, everything will get better.' Now the pair are recovering in hospital and Sun says she is ready for life to start going back to normal. She said: 'I have a bit of a fever but other than that I feel fine, and am looking forward to going home.' Li, who also has a heart problem and lung infection, said that the couple had already started making plans for their new life together. 'It meant a lot to me when she said she was going to spend her life with me,' he said. 'Once the stitches been removed we plan to do a bit of travelling together to catch up on lost time.'","Surprised everyone as chances of her being a match were 100,000 to 1 .

"Vladimir Putin has put on a show of Russia's military strength after mobilising the entire 'Northern Fleet' of 45,000 troops, 41 ships, 15 submarines and 110 aircraft. In what was one of the Kremlin's biggest shows of force since its ties with the West plunged to Cold War-lows, the exercises seemed to be aimed at dwarfing Nato drills in neighbouring Norway. President Mr Putin - who has promised to spend more than 21 trillion roubles (£228billion) by the end of the decade to overhaul Russia's fighting forces - called the fleet to full combat readiness. Full combat readiness: Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured yesterday) has promised to spend more than 21 trillion roubles (£228billion) by the end of the decade to overhaul Russia's fighting forces . The country’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu said: ‘New challenges and threats to military security require the armed forces to further boost their military capabilities.’ ‘Special attention must be paid to newly created strategic formations in the north.’ Mr Putin made his first public appearance since March 5 yesterday - an absence from view that had fuelled feverish speculation over his health as well as his grip on power. He was meeting Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev at the Constantine Palace outside Russia's second city of St Petersburg. Flag: The exercises are due to last for much of the week during which Russia will celebrate its annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea (pictured yesterday in Simferopol) Norway is currently holding its ‘Joint Viking’ drills involving 5,000 troops in Finnmark county, which borders Russia in the resource-rich Arctic circle where both countries are vying for influence. Tensions between Russia and Europe worsened last year, leading eight northern European nations to promise to boost cooperation to counter an increase in Moscow's military activity. Nato made new allegations last week that Russia was arming separatists in east Ukraine, where more than 6,000 people have been killed in nearly a year of fighting. The West and Kiev accuse Russia of supplying arms and soldiers to support the pro-Russian separatists. Moscow denies the claims. Talks: Mr Putin (right) was meeting Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev (left) at the Constantine Palace outside Russia's second city of St Petersburg yesterday . Nato says it counted more than 100 intercepts of Russian planes into members' airspace last year, three times more than in 2013. The intercepts have forced civilian planes to change their courses and Britain scrambled Typhoon interceptor planes after two long-range bombers flew over the English Channel. Norway said its military drills had been planned before the Ukraine crisis. ‘However, the current security situation in Europe shows that the exercise is more relevant than ever,’ Lieutenant General Haga Lunde said. The Russian exercises are due to last for much of the week during which Russia will celebrate its annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, carried out with the help of special forces.","Mr Putin has promised to spend £228billion to overhaul fighting forces .

"Twins Jason and Aaron Clark have always known they are different but the same. While Jason is a high-achieving, sporty and confident 11-year-old, his twin Aaron has Down's Syndrome, delayed speech and deafness. But despite such differences, the brothers from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, have an unbreakable bond that knits them together. Eleven-year-old Jason Clark (right, form Bamsley, South Yorkshire, is very protective of his twin brother Aaron (left), who suffers from Down's Syndrome, delayed speech and deafness . The boys' mum, Lynn Clark, said: ‘They have always been extremely close. They have a very unique and special bond. They aren’t just twin brothers, they are best of mates too. 'I’ve always told them they are very special and have different talents and skills that are unique to themselves. ‘Jason is very protective over Aaron - who looks up to his twin in a big brotherly way.’ And now ever protective Jason has sold all his old toys and books to help his brother’s education. Over the last year he has raised over £400 in a bid to raise funds for the special school Aaron attends. Lynn, a businesswoman, said: ‘He’s had table top sales, a party and placed collection boxes in shops to raise money. ‘And now he is in the process of establishing his own registered charity to carry on supporting the school which means so much to Aaron.’ Entrepreneurial and caring Jason started fundraising as he wanted to give something back to Greenacre School, who have supported Aaron for the last five years. Over the last year Jason has raised over £400 in a bid to raise funds for the special school Aaron attends . Bursting with pride, Lynn said: ‘He has always had such a loving personality and been so protective over Aaron. ‘He told me recently that when he is older he wants to run his own business so he can always look after Aaron. He wants to be able to buy him a house and make sure he has all the care he ever needs. ‘I feel so proud of Jason - he really is a very caring child. ‘When Aaron was younger, his speech was badly affected, so Jason along with ourselves learnt sign language so Aaron could communicate with us. ‘Jason never moaned about it - quite the opposite. He didn’t want Aaron to feel different so enthusiastically learnt the signs. ‘But they have also have their own way of communication - sometimes I can’t quite decipher what Aaron has said, but Jason always knows and will explain for me. ‘I just put it down to the fact that they are twins and incredibly close.’ So Jason’s latest mission to help Aaron doesn’t come as any surprise to Lynn and her husband, Jeff. As the boys mark the 10th anniversary of World Down's Syndrome Day, Lynn said: ‘I wasn’t shocked when he came up with his plan - it’s just his latest way of helping his brother. ‘He initially created a business plan to raise the money. He took it to Aaron’s headmistress to gain her approval and set up a website to promote his charity, Suportthenoun. 'He held a table top sale at his own school, invited his mates around for a party and charged them for refreshments and then asked local shops to display collection boxes.' The boys' mum, Lynn, said: ‘They have always been extremely close. They have a very unique and special bond. They aren’t just twin brothers, they are best of mates too' Jason, who is clearly very keen to support his brother’s school, said: ‘I decided it was a good idea because it does quite a lot for people born with disabilities and I wanted to do something for them. 'It feels really good to help and make a difference. I hope Aaron will be very proud of me.' The money raised will go towards a gardening project for the school. Headteacher Susan Hayter said: 'The money from Jason will help to buy gardening tools and a lawnmower. The plan is for older children to have a chance to run a gardening service and then offer the service to people so they can learn new skills and how to earn money.' Lynn added: ‘We have been completely overwhelmed by Jason's determination and enthusiasm. ‘Jason told us he had lots of toys and books that he no longer needed and wanted to put them to something useful.’ Despite being born a minute after Aaron, Jason has always taken on the big brother role. Lynn recalls: ‘When they were little Jason would always keep a very watchful eye on Aaron. If he fell over in the park, he was the first one to come to his aid and make sure he was okay. ‘And there has been the odd occasion where Aaron has been the victim of nasty comments from other kids. A boy once hit Aaron - Jason immediately jumped to Aaron’s defence and told the lad to leave him alone. ‘On their first day at school, Jason kept a very close eye on Aaron, knowing how hard it would be for him. ‘He made sure he was never alone and that he had everything he needed. And ever since he has been like Aaron’s right-hand man. ‘Despite being far more sporty and academic than his brother, he never lets Aaron feel any different. In fact he constantly encourages and teaches him. ‘Jason is very patient. He has helped teach Aaron how to ride his bike, play football and show him how to use the iPad. He never allows him to be left out of anything. ‘I used to worry about what would happen when Aaron got older, how he would cope with adult life, if he would be able to live independently. But I know now that he will always have Jason to help him and with his brother by his side, he will never be alone in life.’ If anyone would like to help Jason on his fundraising mission they can donate through his website www.suportthenoun.webs.com .","Aaron Clark, 11, has Down's Syndrome, delayed speech and deafness .

"It sounds like the ideal solution for older women wanting to have children. A controversial method to improve the health of an old egg is being used by a Massachusetts-based fertility company. The firm, OvaScience, says its technique involves rejuvenating an egg's mitochondria, which are the tiny structures that create energy to run a cell. Massachusetts-based fertility company, OvaScience, says its technique involves rejuvenating an egg's mitochondria, which are the tiny structures that create energy to run a cell . Studies suggest that 23-33 is the ideal time to conceive, as a healthy woman is still fertile and may be more psychologically prepared to have a baby. But fertility does begin to diminish slowly from the age of 25 as a woman's eggs decrease. One report claiming that women are 10 per cent less fertile at 27. This is because they now have fewer eggs to fertilise - a few thousand - which are also older. But according to a report by Tia Ghose in LiveScience, experts advise caution over those claims. 'They're quite private and secretive about what they're doing,' Dr Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a   fertility specialist told LiveScience. The technique, dubbed Augment, takes energy-producing mitochondria from a patient's own 'EggPC cells'. These are immature egg cells found in the protective ovarian lining, which are added to the patient's mature eggs to supplement the existing mitochondria. 'A key component of egg health is the number of functioning mitochondria in the egg since mitochondria are the source of energy that helps an egg develop,' OvaScience co-founder, Michelle Dipp, told DailyMail.com .

But there are still problems with the method. For instance, Kateryna Makova, a genomicist at Pennsylvania State University in State College told LiveScience that the  follicles in the ovary are unlikely to be in any better condition. As yet, there are no any published studies proving the existence of the precursor cells the company says it uses.

"The attorney for hip hop mogul Suge Knight claims the shocking new video of him mowing down two much with his truck actually helps his defense case. Following Knight's brief appearance in a Los Angeles County court on Monday, defense lawyer Matthew Fletcher told reporters: '100percent it proves Suge Knight was attacked,' according to the Los Angeles Times. The video, published by TMZ today, was recorded by surveillance cameras at Tam's Burgers in Compton, Los Angeles on January 29. It shows one of Knight's alleged victims, Cle 'Bone' Sloan, confront him as soon as he pulls up to the parking lot. Knight throws his truck into reverse, knocking Sloan down. He then shifts the vehicle back into drive, running Sloan over and hitting Terry Carter, who was standing nearby. Suge Knight made a brief appearance in court on Monday on the murder and attempted murder case he faces as a result of the hit-and-run . Suge Knight  (left) is charged with murder for running over grandfather Terry Carter and crushing his head with his truck on January 29 . This is the truck that Knight was driving when he ran over Carter and Cle 'Bone' Sloan . Carter, a 55-year-old grandfather, had his head crushed beneath Knight's truck and was killed. Knight says the video exonerates him. Defense lawyer Fletcher says it shows that he was in danger the moment he pulled up to the restaurant where Dr. Dre was filming scenes for his NWA biopic. He says the video shows a gun in Sloan's waistband. 'They started it.They attacked him… If Suge had put it in park and got out, he’s dead,' Fletcher said Monday . According to TMZ, prosecutors argue that the video shows that opposite. They say that after Knight threw his truck into reverse, he should have been able to safely flee the scene if his life was indeed in danger. Knight, who is charged with murder and attempted murder for the hit-and-run, is due to appear in court today for an evidence hearing. This is the moment that Terry Carter was hit and killed by Suge Knight's truck in January. Police say Carter's head was crushed under the vehicle . Knight's truck can be seen running over Carter (blurred) in this pictured - moments after running over Sloan, who is seen here laying on the ground . Knight is claiming that this shot shows a man approach Sloan and pull a gun out of his waistband as he writhes in pain on the ground . Sloan, 51, sustained minor injuries. Knight's lawyers say the video shows he was armed . The confrontation happened after Suge tried to approach Dr. Dre while he was filming 'Straight Out of Compton.' He says he wanted to make peace with the fellow hip hop mogul after a falling out, according to TMZ. Instead, he was confronted by Sloan, who was working security for Dr Dre. Knight's lawyers say he was threatened with a gun and that he feared for his life. He says he was surrounded by a group of armed men and that his only way out was to drive through Sloan and Carter. He argues that he believed he would be shot if he continued to reverse and that the only safe way out was for him to drive forward, through Sloan and Carter. The video also shows a man approach Sloan, who was writhing on the ground, and pull something from his waistband. TMZ reports that Knight is claiming that is proof Sloan had a gun at the time of the confrontation. Carter's family told TMZ they want the video released to the public to show he Knight mowed him down and killed him. Carter's funeral was attended by 2,000 people and he was saluted as a businessman and a community leader who mentored neighborhood children. Knight is being held without bail and has been admitted to the hospital three times since being jailed. He claims he is going blind due to injuries from previous gunshot wounds. The 49-year-old former Death Row Records CEO fired his attorneys and hired a new legal team. He also faces charges from a September 5, 2014 incident in which he and Katt Williams allegedly stole a camera from a celebrity photographer.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

'There was a time when I would change my hair colour every month – now I realise that was not necessary. 'I can't believe I used to be too scared to leave the house without makeup. I wouldn't even pop to the shops without applying slap which seems ridiculous.' 'I don't know what my natural hair colour is,' she admitted. 'Possibly brown. When it came to make up, Becca admits she used to would wear 'the whole shebang'. 'I even put power on my eyebrows to thicken them,' she said. 'This was to give them more shape. Becca also admitted hair dye was one of her biggest problems. 'I probably changed my hair colour every month,' she said. 'I became addicted - most colour I used was quite unnatural.'

We can't have it go through the whole clubhouse,' he said. For now, Milwaukee players are supposed to avoid high-fives and instead tap elbows or bump batting glove-covered fists. In the seventh inning of a 10-5 loss to the Seattle Mariners on Friday, after scoring on sacrifice fly, Hunter Morris approached the coaches sitting outside the Brewers dugout with his hand out as if he wanted to shake hands. But at last moment he pulled his hand back and gave them fist bumps. Infielder Yadiel Rivera returned to action from pink eye on Friday and played in the loss. Juan Centeno, who started at catcher, returned Thursday and homered on Friday. Ban: The Brewers are dealing with a rash of pink eye that has broken out in the clubhouse. Hoping to avoid spreading the annoying and highly contagious malady, they have banned high-fives in the dugout . Roenicke's club also is dealing with flu-like symptoms. All-Star outfielder Ryan Braun was scratched for that reason on Friday. 'I'm hoping we put an end to this thing. Now we've got this darn chest thing going around that I've got,' Roenicke said before the game. Pitcher Wily Peralta was sent home because he felt ill, as well. Lucroy is expected to return for Saturday's game and possibly catch. 'Luke, getting him back on the field and having him healthy going into the season, that's pretty important,' Roenicke said. 'The other little things, they're one or two days here and there. Everybody's going to have those.' Reliever Mike Fiers was trying to avoid the pink eye problem. 'I just don't want to catch it,' he said. 'Just try to be sanitary. Wash your hands after everything you do, be careful and don't put your hands in your eyes or your mouth. Just try to stay as clean as possible.' Break: Hoping to avoid spreading the annoying and highly contagious malady, the Brewers are staying away from the usual high-fives, for now .","'It seems like a couple of more cases show up every day,' said  manager Ron Roenicke .

"At a time when few women would leave their houses alone, Isabella Bird braved war, floods and male scorn to complete arduous solo journeys in America and the Far East. From 1894 to 1897 the Victorian explorer trekked across China while it was with war with Japan, documenting the lives of the men and women she met through detailed written accounts and a collection of vivid photographs. Some of her incredible journeys, published in her 1899 work in The Yangtze and Beyond, are now the subject of a new book by Deborah Ireland. Scroll down for video . Deborah Ireland's new book about Bird celebrates her writing and reprints many of her vivid photographs . At a time when few women would leave their houses alone, Isabella Bird braved war, floods and male scorn to complete arduous solo journeys in America and the Far East . 'She was the most incredible woman, and a true role model for women today,' Ireland told MailOnline Travel. 'Isabella didn't become famous as a travel writer until she was 44 - at that time women just didn't have careers as writers. And it wasn't until she was 60 that she discovered photography. She broke the mould.' In her book, Ireland charts Bird's three years spent travelling in China and reprints her stunning photographs of Chinese daily life gradually being infiltrated by European clothing and customs. Isabella Bird turned to writing as a way to make money for her and her unmarried sister . Born in 1831 the daughter of a clergyman, as Ireland writes: 'The adventuress who travelled and rode in all weathers, exploring remote and dangerous regions, was writing about a life in sharp contrast to the one originally envisaged for her.' The intrepid Yorkshire woman started writing in 1854 when she travelled to America to mend a broken heart. But it wasn't until  1875 that she found fame with an account of her experiences in Hawaii. Bird was on her way home from an ill-fated trip to Australia when she fell in love with the islands. She initially wrote extensive accounts of her escapades to her sister, and decided that writing would provide a much-needed income for the unmarried pair. On her return, Bird embarked on her publishing career and her candid accounts of her travel became instant bes-sellers, and she hasn't been out of print since. Ireland writes: 'As a respected international traveller her views were sought by prime ministers, ambassadors and the newspaper men of the day. 'Her books were engaging, accessible and entertaining and she opened up a world of travel to the armchair explorer.' Despite saying she was too old for arduous journeys, Bird travelled 8,000 miles during an extended trip to China, travelling on horseback and in carts, by boat and in a sedan chair, using her newly acquired camera and photographic skills to document her journey. She traversed the country, from Hangchow (Hangzhou) to Hong Kong and from one end of the River Yangtze to the other as well as venturing into Korea and Japan. Isabella Bird was 60-years-old when she discovered photography, and developed all her prints herself . In her letters home to her sister, Bird tells how she loved everything about the process of photography . In 1894 she set off from Liverpool to the Far East unaware she was travelling into the First Sino-Japanese War between China and Japan over control of Korea. She was deported from Korea on a Japanese steamer with no money and luggage and only the clothes on her back and was forced to take refuge in China. There she experienced a flood on the Manchurian Plain and risked her life helping drowning villagers in terrific storms before succumbing to malaria. She then broke her arm when the cart she was travelling in overturned just miles from the house of the missionary who was to take her in. Confined to the town of Mukden (Shenyang) by her injuries, she spent time getting to know the missionary doctors and photographing their patients, many of whom suffered from leprosy or the effects of opium addiction. Bird's account of her travels was hailed by one reviewer at the time as 'one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of late nineteenth century China ever written' As well as the scorn of her countrymen, Bird also had to contend with the hostility of the locals who were not used to seeing a foreigner, let alone a foreign woman, travelling . Her photographs of this time show pagodas and palaces as well as the mean back streets and the ravaged faces of disese sufferers. While travelling in the Chinese interior she managed to avoid the plagues of rats and other vermin by suspending her clothes and boots on the tripod of her camera. She adopted Chinese dress as the tight fitting, tailored clothes she was used to were considered offensive by the local population. In her book, Ireland charts Bird's three years spent travelling in China and reprints her stunning photographs of Chinese daily life gradually being infiltrated by European clothing and customs . Bird's legacy is her iron will and her determination to never give up in the face of adversity, says Ireland . However she did not quite escape the curiosity or hostility of the locals who were not used to seeing a foreigner, let alone a foreign woman, travelling. Ireland writes: 'Overnight halts were a problem because of the stir she created by her arrival. This could range from curiosity to extreme hostility – from holes drilled through the walls of her room followed by whispering and giggling, to a full-blown riot with shouts of ""Foreign devil"", ""Child eater"".' She also received the scorn of her countrymen, with archaeologist Sir Austen Henry Layard writing to her publisher's son: 'I must say I think the woman must be devoid of all delicacy and modesty who could travel as she did, without a female attendant among a crowd of dirty Persian muleteers and others.' However Bird's account of her travels was hailed by one reviewer at the time as 'one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of late nineteenth century China ever written.' In response to Sir Austen criticism, Ireland writes: 'Not bad for an account of a journey ""undertaken for recreation an interest solely"" or ""but to satisfy her curiosity and love of travel"".' And what about Bird's legacy? 'Never give up! And don't think you're ever too old to do anything,' Ireland tells us. 'If you want, it's possible to have a new career at 60. She certainly did.'

"Great artworks sometimes come in an unexpected form. A Chinese university professor has created a series of vivid portraits of well-known figures using tiny pieces of jeans, reported the People's Daily Online. The largest of all, an image of a Buddha, measures two metres (6.6ft) in height and comprises more than 10,000 pieces of denim. Wang Xiaolei, an associate professor at Wuhan Textile University, started creating what he calls ‘denim paintings’ after visiting a town in China in 2007 which specialised in processing off-cut cloth pieces but had a terrible effect on the surrounding environment in doing so. Creativity: Wang Xiaolei, working on a portrait of Audrey Hepburn, embarked on the unusual endeavour of 'painting' with unwanted denim after witnessing how scrap cloth factories destroy the environment . Variety: Mr Wang's paintings cover a wide range of figures from Chairman Mao to David Beckham (centre) Vividness: The professor's interpretation of Zhang Yimo (left), a famous Chinese film director, and Mo Yan (right), a Nobel Prize-winning Chinese author . His interest was strengthen after an academic visit to the University of Manchester in 2008, during which he learned more ways of recycling scrap cloth. Since then, Mr Wang has collected tens of thousands of old jeans for experimenting with his art. He says denim has a three-dimensional quality so it is easy to make shapes with. To make a portrait, he first cuts jeans into large pieces and separates these pieces into different colour shadings. Then he goes into a trail-and-error stage of setting out the outlines and establishing the different shades of colours of the particular picture, and this could take more than 100 alterations to get right. Fashion: Mr Wang's unique style has created a trend among his students at Wuhan Textile University who regularly paint with him in the studio. In this picture, he is holding a portrait of Andy Lau, a renowned singer and actor from Hong Kong . Process: The professor first cuts jeans into large pieces and separates these pieces into different colour shadings, before creating artworks of figures such as Leonardo DiCaprio (left) Effort: To set the correct outlines and colour tones of a painting sometimes takes more than 100 alterations . Mr Wang creates portraits of a range of Chinese and international figures, including Chairman Mao, Fan Bingbing, David Beckham, Michael Jackson, Audrey Hepburn and Leonardo Dicaprio. His wife Taohui, who also collaborates on him with his ‘denim painting’, says Mr Wang is so absorbed in his work that he spent one New Year’s eve in his studio. Extended periods of concentration on these denim collages, separating the cloth into almost identical shades of colour, has also resulted in his eyes almost always being bloodshot. Mr Wang’s hard work finally paid off when his paintings attracted the attention of a director of the Cultural University of Japan, who invited the denim warrior to hold an exhibition in Japan. He has also produced portraits for the eight invited guest speakers at the World Textile Conference last November. Devotion: Mr Wang's wife says her husband is so absorbed in his work that he spent one New Year's Eve in his studio . Landscape: Apart from portraits, Mr Wang also creates landscape pictures with denim such as the one pictured above . Home decor: Chairs have also had the denim treatment from Mr Wang .","Wang Xiaolei started ‘denim paintings’ in hope of protecting environment .

"A Virginia math teacher is facing a maximum of 22 years in prison for having sex with four of her students. Erica Mesa, 28, pleaded guilty on Friday to two counts of electronic solicitation of a minor and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Mesa taught math at Colonial Forge High School. She pleaded guilty to charges involving two students but admitted having sex with two others aged 16 to 18. Scroll down for video . Virginia math teacher Erica Mesa, 28, is facing a maximum of 22 years in prison for having sex with four of her students . Workplace scandal: Mesa enjoyed sexual relations with four of her pupils at Colonial Forge High School, where both she and her husband worked as teachers . In exchange for Mesa’s guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped four charges and reduced two others. Mesa, who has been in jail since her arrest last September, will be sentenced at Stafford Circuit Court on May 21, reports The Free Lance-Star. Officials at the high school were tipped off by anonymous phone call informing them that the geometry and statistics teacher had allegedly had sex with a male student. An investigation revealed that one of the students was 16 years old when the relationship began in late 2013. Investigators also found out that Mesa allegedly sent nude photos of herself using her cell phone. Most of the trysts allegedly happened at Mesa's home while her husband wasn't around and one had happened in her SUV. Erica married Keith Mesa (left) in 2012 after three years of dating. The couple have split up following her arrest last years on charges of sleeping with her students, including one who was under 18 years old . Mesa admitted to having sex with one teen while another was in her basement waiting his turn. She told authorities she had done it because it made her feel 'attractive and wanted.' The math teacher had worked at Colonial Forge High School since 2009. As well as losing her job, the teacher's marriage had also disolved as a result of her actions. Her husband of two years, Keith Mesa, works at Colonial Forge as a social studies teacher and head volleyball coach. Mesa had coached the volleyball team alongside her husband. According to the couple's wedding site, the two had only got married July 21, 2012, in Michigan. Mesa graduated from Concordia University Ann Arbor, where she studied secondary education with a concentration in math and biology, and played volleyball. Mesa taught geometry while her husband of two years worked as a social studies teacher. They coached the volleyball team together . Defense attorney Mark Gardner said Mesa is not a pedophile and ‘was not preying on people who had no interest in participating.’ He had asked Judge Victoria Willis to release Mesa on bond until her sentencing, but the request was denied. Judge Willis said Mesa would have to 'clean up the mess you have made.' Her guilty pleas means she will have to register as a sex offender.","Erica Mesa, 28, is facing a maximum of 22 years in prison after having sex with four of her students at Colonial Forge High School in Virginia .

"The latest issue of Time magazine features Hillary Clinton on its cover, but there's something different about the former secretary of state and would-be Madam President. The way the magazine's graphic designers positioned her silhouette under the letter 'M' in its iconic masthead appears to tack a pair of devil horns on her head. And it's not the first time Time has done this to a world leader. The March 23, 2015 cover of Time magazine gives Hillary Clinton unintentional devil horns . Vladimir Putin, Barack Obama, Margaret Thatcher and Pope Francis have gotten the photographic Beelzebub treatment. Even Jesus Christ was once pictured with horns – right above his crown of thorns. This week's subtle jab at Clinton, intentional or not, comes as she is under fire for using a secret, private email system during her years as secretary of state. Democratic insiders are beginning to reconsider her role as the party's 'inevitable' 2016 presidential nominee, and other potential candidates are testing the waters. Past 'Time' devil-horn cover subjects have included Presidents Bill Clinton (left) and Barack Obama (right) Time's White House correspondent shared some insider gossip about reactions to the Hillary cover . The cover story is headlined 'The Clinton Way,' and chronicles Mrs. Clinton's and her husband's long history of bending rules – and, some argue, laws – to conform to their political ambitions. 'They write their own rules. Will it work this time?' Time asks. 'Along with her husband – the 42nd President of the United States – Hillary Clinton is the co-creator of a soap-operatic political universe in which documents vanish, words like ""is"" take on multiple meanings and foes almost always overplay their hand,' author David von Drehle writes. 'Impeachment can be a route to higher approval ratings; the occasional (and rare) defeat merely marks the start of the next campaign. Whatever rules may apply to them, the law of gravity is not one.' HOLY SMOKES: 'Time' has even put Pope Francis and JESUS underneath its iconic letter 'M' One Time reporter who covers the White House wrote on Twitter that that his colleagues were trading quips about the Hillary cover. 'Actual discussion in the TIME office: ""That’s not the way the horns would be"",' he tweeted. Time's editors responded to the online hubbub with a few paragraphs online and a collection of nearly three dozen instances where the 'M' produced unexpected headgear. 'This has happened before. ... 'Any resemblance to cats, bats or devil horns is entirely coincidental,' They wrote.","'M' in magazine's logo is mostly covered by Clinton silhouette, with the inner points of the letter forming horns on a Clinton silhouette .

"The Central Conference of American Rabbis, the rabbinical branch of Reform Judaism, has installed its first openly lesbian president. Denise Eger, 55, was inaugurated Monday at the CCAR's annual convention  in Philadelphia this year, Jewish Telegraph Agency reports. Though Eger isn't the first openly gay or lesbian clergy person to lead an American rabbinic group, the road for Eger has not been an easy one. First: Denise Eger, 55, was inaugurated Monday as the first openly lesbian president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis . Eger was ordained in 1988, a time when one could not be an openly gay Reform rabbi, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Though Eger wasn't formally out at that time, her sexual preference was known and no one would hire her, according to Yahoo News. Later, Eger was offered a job with Beth Chayim Chadashim, the world's first lesbian and gay synagogue. Two years after her ordination, Eger formally came out as a lesbian in a Los Angeles Times story, Yahoo reports, saying that gay and lesbian Jews need a positive role model. 'I took a great risk but I didn't feel I could be authentic anymore — watching young men all around me die and not tell,' she told the paper. Eger has since served pulpits in Canada, Los Angeles, and New York. She has been vocal and active in LGBT community, becoming a noted speaker and award-winning activist in the community. Hire: Eger was ordained in 1988, and though she wasn't formally out at that time, her sexual preference was known and no one would hire her . She is the founding rabbi of Kol Ami synagogue in Los Angeles, Calif. Eger has been on the CCAR board of trustees for four years, JTA reports, becoming president elect in 2013. The 55-year-old was both the first female and the first openly gay president of the Southern California Board of Rabbis. Speech: Here, Eger speaks at the CCAR's annual convention, held this year in Philadelphia, where she was inaugurated . Hopes: Though Eger once believed becoming a rabbi or cantor would force her to sacrifice her hopes of having a spouse and children, she is currently engaged and has a 21-year-old son . Though Eger once believed becoming a rabbi or cantor would force her to sacrifice her hopes of having a spouse and children, she is currently engaged and has a 21-year-old son.

"I don't know how it happened, but suddenly my daughter Valentina is about to turn 18. I wanted to spend some time together - just the two of us - before she flies the nest. We've always lived in London, but Valentina has a keen interest in the animal world and longed to know more about the mysterious orca whale. We decided we would see these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. Skimming the internet, I found a site called Sea Kayak Adventures, offering a five-day sea kayaking trip in the middle of August in northern British Columbia, Canada. Fins couldn't be better for Julietta in her kayak in the Johnstone Strait in Canada . We would kayak to base camp on the Johnstone Strait and from there take daily excursions, paddling among the pods of orcas that come back year after year during the months of July and August. The website said there would be a 97 per cent chance of seeing an orca during these two months. I booked immediately. The weekend before our departure, a kit list arrived by email. It was also clear from our itinerary that we would be without any showers, hot water, electrical power or wi-fi during our time in the wilderness. We were told to bring fast-drying synthetic clothes and whittle our possessions down to the essentials. Valentina insisted on bringing her camera equipment, which turned out to be a wise choice. We flew to Vancouver, took a small aircraft to Port Hardy, and then drove to Telegraph Cove. Even the experience of preparing for the expedition was exciting. Valentina, who normally expresses all the usual teenage behaviour and reactions, could not have been a more delightful and relaxed travel companion. We laughed out loud when we were given our two tiny watertight kitbags, which would contain our only belongings for the next five days and which we would carry in our kayak. When they 'breach', they jump fully out of the water; a 'spy hop' involves them having a quick look around to see what's going on; and at night they 'fin slap', which sounds like a gun going off . Our group also included a couple, a single man, Joe, and two excellent guides, Julia and Qui. We set off from Telegraph Cove after a briefing on safety, security and weather conditions. On that first day, we kayaked down the strait to a beautiful stony beach where we ate lunch - salad, eggs, ham, cheese and fruit - prepared by Julia and Qui. Afterwards, as we headed back towards camp, we found ourselves right in the path of a pod. They were moving quickly towards us, occasionally with their fins above the water and 'blowing' through their noses. Watching these animals glide majestically through the water was breathtaking. The guide had asked us to 'raft' our kayaks together so that we could make a larger body in the water above them. They submerged about 300ft in front of us, and I hardly dared breathe as they swam beneath us. I could have reached out and touched them. From that moment on we realised that humans really do not belong in a place like the Johnstone Strait. The animal kingdom was around us at all times: sea lions, humpback whales, bald eagles, jellyfish, dolphins, porpoises. Kayakers raft their vessels together as a killer whale approaches in the Johnstone Strait . This was their world, not ours. Our base camp was beautiful, our tent pitched just a few yards from the beach. Our bathroom, meanwhile, was a makeshift wooden cubicle some distance away in the woods. We quickly fell asleep on our first night, but I awoke with a start to what sounded like a bear cracking through the undergrowth. A few minutes later I realised it was squirrels high up in the trees above throwing nuts and cones down on to our tent. Julia and Qui laughed at me, and assured me that bears and cougars are a very rare sight in Telegraph Cover. Valentina and I spent five extraordinary days in the Johnstone Strait. The water was calm and the sun shone brightly. We tracked pods every day. At times they would come and scratch their backs just yards from the beach at our base camp. In the morning the whales would gun down the Strait as if they were on the school run, then at dusk they would drift back slowly, as if they were heading home at the end of a busy day. We soon learned something of their habits. When they 'breach', they jump fully out of the water; a 'spy hop' involves them having a quick look around to see what's going on; and at night they 'fin slap', which sounds like a gun going off. Julietta and her group at the water's edge at Telegraph Cove near Port Hardy . Our guides told us not to be frightened as no one has ever been hurt, let alone killed, by a whale in the Johnstone Strait. Julia had a microphone that goes underwater and when the whales were close we could listen to them communicating with each other as any family would do. It was a deeply emotional experience to hear them conversing, especially knowing the terrible isolation they experience in confinement and captivity. The local whale-watching boats know the pods well. Each pod has a name and can be distinguished by the sound of their communication under the water - each family makes different sounds. Every day was more beautiful than the last. We became calm and relaxed among the whales, waiting for them to reappear, then easing back in our kayaks to take photographs. We grew accustomed to the quiet, and it was a relief to be far away from home, with no access to emails or phones. On our final night after dinner we added to the collected sculpture of pebbles left by previous kayakers - stones rendered heart-shaped by the lap of the waves. I asked Valentina if she had ever been in a situation where there was no wi-fi, no connectivity, and no communication with her friends - a time when she was simply a human being in the stillness of our planet. She said that while she missed talking to her friends and sharing her experiences, she actually found it deeply relaxing not to have to listen to the constant chatter. On the final night I was desperate for a shower. Without one, I opted for the next best thing - a dip in the freezing sea. It crossed my mind that I was swimming in Mother Nature's pool. Julietta and Valentina came face to face with a black bear during their trip . The next morning I walked alone down to the creek to take in the unbelievable beauty of our surroundings one last time. That's when I spotted a big black bear right in front of me, grunting through his huge nostrils. As soon as he saw me he started to lollop away into the undergrowth. I stood still, then shouted to Valentina that she should come outside with her camera. The bear hung around just long enough for her to take an out-offocus photograph. An adventure like this was made much more special for me because I shared it with my daughter. Travelling can be stressful, but we were almost always in good spirits, and in harmony with one another. We have memories that will never leave us. To have an experience like that with my daughter who will soon embark on adult life was something I shall treasure for ever. I know she enjoyed every second of it too. GETTING THERE . Sea Kayak Adventures (seakayakadventures.com) offers a six-day Blackfish Waters Orca Kayak tour from US$1,545pp (about £1,025).

A federal jury in Manhattan . found Ulbricht guilty in February of charges including . conspiracy to commit drug trafficking and money laundering.

Using those aliases, Force extorted $250,000 from Ulbricht . and later offered to sell him information about the government's . investigation for $100,000, the complaint said.

"Scientists have developed a necklace dubbed the ‘diet choker’ that monitors everything that goes down your throat - and sends you an alert if you overeat. WearSens is a metal ring that goes around your neck and has a sensor which uses the vibrations in your throat to tell when you are eating and drinking. The researchers behind the device have linked it up to a smartphone app which buzzes if you go over your daily calorie limit. Scientists have combined WearSens, a metal ring that goes around the neck (above) to monitor eating, with a smartphone app which counts calories . It also lets you know if you eat too much of the wrong kind of food. The device was developed by engineers at the University of California, Los Angeles and so far the tests on 30 people show that the it does work. But the reaction elsewhere has been mixed reaction and some tech websites likened it to a choke collar, though it does not contract if you eat too much. Another website, Bustle.com, dubbed it the ‘weirdest (tech) wearable we have seen to date’. The UCLA team said the WearSens works because each food makes a distinctive pattern of vibrations in the neck so the device is able to work out what it is you are consuming using a piezoelectric sensor, which measures changes in pressure or force. In tests with a limited menu it has guessed with 90 per cent accuracy the difference between solid and liquid foods - and even the difference between hot or cold drinks. It could also distinguish between hard and soft foods about 75 per cent of the time, the findings in the journal IEEE Sensors said. WearSens co-founder Majid Sarrafzadeh said: ‘Many nutrition methods are based on writing down what you eat. ‘But this method has low compliance so we wanted to overcome these issues and wanted to do something that a pedometer does for activity’. Scientists are hopeful the technology will also tell users when they are eating the wrong types of food (file image) In a demonstration posted on YouTube, the device asks for the user’s age, height, weight and their goal such as to lose weight or stay the same. It will then tell them what they have eaten, how fast they eat their food and gives them advice such as if you miss a meal it mentions how it could leave you fatigued. The UCLA researchers said that other applications they could see for the device included tracking when somebody takes a pill to ensure they take their daily medicine. It could also remotely monitor breathing patterns of transplant patients as abnormal breathing may be an early indicator that the organ is being rejected. Even smokers who are trying to quit could benefit from the device as it could potentially tell when they are puffing away from the movement in their neck. The WearSens is the latest example of the growing industry of wearable tech and comes on the day  that Apple is due to release details of its long-awaited smart watch. Major tech companies are banking on consumers taking to the wave of wristbands, watches and eyewear that augments the functions of their smartphone. Last year Google launched its range of Android Wear which includes a watch which allows you to check your email or send a text, meaning you don’t have to reach into your pocket for your phone. The latest update to Apple’s operating system for its iPhone includes a ‘Health’ app which monitors how many steps a person takes each day like a pedometer. Not all wearable tech has been a success however and Google’s controversial eyewear, Google Glass, was axed in the UK after less than a year of limited release. Google closed it Explorer programme, which gave select people the chance to buy Glass for £990, after a privacy backlash and because consumers did not take to the futuristic design.

"A three-month-old girl who allegedly suffered head injuries at the hands of her babysitter - just a day after her mother returned to work - has passed away. Everly Dickard, from Boiling Springs, South Carolina, died in hospital on Monday - more than a week after she stopped breathing while in the care of her babysitter, Katie Harris, on March 20. Harris, 32, had been looking after Everly just a day after the child's mother, April, returned to work following her pregnancy, according to a gofundme page set up for the family. Everly's father, Matthew Dickard, had also started a new job that day. Arrested: Katie Harris, left, has been arrested after three-month-old Everly Dickard, right, allegedly suffered fatal head injuries while in her care on March 20. Everly passed away in hospital on Monday . 'Everything was on the right track for this family until the phone rang Friday morning,' the page reads. 'Everly had stopped breathing at the sitter's house and was being rushed to the hospital.' She had suffered injuries including a build up of blood clots beneath her skull and hemorrhages inside her eyes, and medical staff told authorities the injuries were non-accidental, WSPA reported. After Everly was admitted to hospital, staff called police and the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office opened an investigation into possible abuse. During the investigation, officials say Harris admitted that she had originally lied about how Everly was injured and said she had actually fallen from a baby swing, WYFF4 reported. Following inconsistent statements, Harris agreed to take a polygraph test, which she failed. Harris was charged with abuse inflicting great bodily injury upon a child on March 23. Once the baby's autopsy has been completed on Tuesday, the charges could be upgraded.

"Death: William Graham, 16, has been described as an 'amazing pianist' and 'confident young man' A 16-year-old talented schoolboy was found hanged after he was allegedly taunted by bullies ahead of his final GCSE exams. William Graham - who has been described by friends as an ‘amazing pianist’ and ‘confident young man’ - was found dead at his home in Waterlooville, Hampshire, on Thursday. He was a pupil at Crookhorn Community College, where he studied subjects including physical education, music, history and drama. But the mother of a fellow pupil at the school, who did not wish to be named, said yesterday: ‘There are suspicions he was being bullied. What a waste of a young life.’ Flowers and tributes were left outside the school gates after his death. But friend Sianie Lucy Anderson said on Facebook: ‘Whoever did this, I hope they pay for what they have done.’ And classmate Kate Douglas said: ‘Will was a talented young man with so much going for him. ‘He was a kind friend, an amazing pianist and a loved member of Crookhorn College’s family. He was a close friend of mine, and we shared a lot of classes and therefore memories.’ Another friend, Luke Folkard said he had spoken to William about three hours before he died - and he 'sounded happy'. Luke added that William’s friends were now hoping to raise money for a piano in his memory. Grahame Sammons, headmaster of Crookhorn College, told MailOnline today: 'We know that our students have been deeply affected by this sad news and we will offer support as appropriate. Flowers: He was a pupil at Crookhorn Community College, where he studied PE, music, history and drama . 'The staff, governors and students would like to express our condolences and deepest sympathies to William’s family at this distressing time. 'William was a talented musician whose skills as a pianist we will all remember with affection. 'He was a popular student amongst staff and peers with a great future ahead of him, which makes his loss hard for all who knew him to bear.' One message for William read: ‘Will was an amazing, strong, confident young man. He would always put a smile on your face. I will miss him dearly. I will keep hold of all our deepest memories.' Remembered: Tributes and flowers  were left outside the school gates in memory of 16-year-old William . Mourning: A spokesman for the college's parents' association said its thoughts were with William's family . A memorial for William was held outside the school yesterday, attended by more than 200 pupils. A spokesman for the college's parents' association said last night: ‘The Crookhorn Parents’ Association offers their heart-felt condolences to the Graham family after the loss of their popular and talented son William. Our thoughts are with you, may he rest in peace.’ A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said police were investigating 'the death of a 16-year-old boy inside a house in Waterlooville' after being called at 5.50pm last Thursday. He added that the death was not being treated as suspicious and had been referred to the coroner. The school, council and police have all been asked today to comment on claims he was bullied.","William Graham described as 'amazing pianist' and 'confident young man'

"One of the 'naive and impressionable' teenage boys who was stopped in Turkey as he tried to join ISIS had written cruel jibes about the murder of soldier Lee Rigby on social media, it has emerged. The 17-year-old boy, an A-grade student from Brent, north west London, was stopped at Sabiha Gökçen International Airport in Istanbul with his 17-year-old cousin and another 19-year-old man on Saturday. It has now been revealed that prior to him fleeing Britain, he made comments on social media criticising the 'eruption' of public grief over the Islamist murder of solder Rigby, who was brutally killed near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, south east London in May 2013. Scroll down for video . One of the 17-year-old boys who was detained in Turkey alongside his 17-year-old cousin and another 19-year-old man (pictured being stopped at the airport) had written jibes about the murder of Lee Rigby online . The teenage boy apparently made cruel jibes about the Islamist murder of solider Lee Rigby (pictured), who was brutally killed by fanatics near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, southeast London in May 2013 . The sixth form student also spoke online about 'not being able to recognise' himself from the person he had been a year earlier. A friend of the boy has now spoken about his fears that the teenager was radicalised by an older pupil at the school. The source told The Sun: 'His radical views were well known. He fell in with a boy and was influenced by his extreme views. 'He was extremely bright and wanted to go to university to study engineering. 'On Friday when he went missing, he told people he was going to prayers. His parents were distraught.' It is understood that one of the teenagers attended Preston Manor School in Wembley, where students were recently told that weekly prayer sessions must be taken only in English amid fears of radicalisation. Pupils claimed that as part of the new requirements, a teacher must also be present at all times during prayers. The three teenagers, who have not been named, were intercepted by officials after the shocked families of the younger boys learned of their plans and quickly alerted police, who waited at the airport as the flight landed from Barcelona, Spain. The teens, all from Brent, north west London, were stopped at Sabiha Gökçen International Airport in Istanbul when an officer checked their passports  and ordered for them to be taken to a 'risk and analysis' centre . It is believed they travelled from mainland Spain to try and dodge being caught. However, they were stopped as they went through passport control at the Turkish airport after landing at about 11pm on Saturday. CCTV footage shows an immigration officer checking the passports of each of the teenage boys before telling them they will not be able to proceed to the arrivals hall. They are then escorted to a 'risk and analysis centre' in the airport by officials. All three teenagers were later put on a return flight to London and taken into custody at a high-security police station for questioning. They have since been released on bail after being quizzed by counter-terror officers on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Yesterday, it emerged that one of the boys had asked the council when he could return to school. The two younger teenage boys were at a meeting with Muhammed Butt, the leader of Brent Council, when the question arose. Muhammed Butt, the leader of Brent Council, spoke to the teenagers and their families this week and does not believe they were radicalised but 'naive' Mr Butt told Channel 4 News: 'One of them was saying to me ""when can I go back to school?"" 'I said to him I think you have to wait a little bit longer to let things settle down and we can work with the school and everyone else and make sure things are right for you to go back.' Mr Butt, who met with the teenagers and their families, said both of the boys had been behaving normally prior to disappearing. He said: 'The children had no conversations about any kind of radical speak or anything else, the conversations were absolutely normal. 'One of the boys had a conversation with his father the night before and the father had asked him do you want some pocket money? 'The father gave him £20 and the child gave him £10 back. If someone is preparing to go somewhere I think you would take as much money with you as possible. And for him to give £10 back doesn't suggest he had anything prepared or was going to do anything wrong.' The politician said he believed that they had been 'caught up in emotions' rather than radicalised and were 'naive' teenagers who had made a mistake and were relieved to come home. He said: 'Personally I don't think they had been radicalised, absolutely not. I think what they've done is they've been caught up in emotions as such. 'They were looking for a platform to speak up or to say something and they haven't found a space or a platform where they can have a grown up conversation about events in Syria. 'I met with the two boys. I met with the two families as well and you could not meet a more normal family. The two young kids they are grade A students and both of them have aspirations, one to be an engineer and one to be a doctor. 'It just beggars belief these guys got caught up in their own thinking as such, of trying to go out there and do some good. All they've said from the conversations I have with them is that they wanted to go out there and help.' In light of the recent claims that one of the boys held extremist views before fleeing the country, Mr Butt issued a fresh statement today in which he said: 'Our conversations with the children point to them both being remorseful for the pain and anguish they have caused their families and the local community. 'Every parent will recognise that children, in their teenage years, can be naïve and they will make mistakes. 'Brent Council is fully focused on working with the families and our partners to ensure these children get the support and guidance they need.' It came as the 'devastated' families of the boys said they couldn't 'thank the police and Turkish authorities enough' for getting them home safely. Mr Butt said: 'They are just normal kids with aspirations like any other kids and their families would do anything to support them and they will continue to support them to make sure they become an engineer or a doctor. 'They are 17-years-old, they are young and naive and they are learning as they go through life. One of the two 17-year-old boys is believed to have attended Preston Manor School in Wembley, north west London (pictured). One pupil told today how he believes at least one of the boys was radicalised by a pupil . The three British teenagers who were stopped in Turkey were allegedly on their way to Syria to join ISIS. Istanbul has become a well-known stop off point for British jihadis wanting to flee to join terrorist in Syria . 'The families are overjoyed to have their children back. You have to bear in mind they're still schoolchildren, still studying for their A-levels, and the families were absolutely devastated to find that the children had disappeared and then to find that they were on their way to Istanbul - the family are still in shock. 'The families are just normal, decent, hard-working families - just a normal next door family. You would have thought no different of them on Friday than you would do today, I am sure.' He said the boys now want to get back to normal, adding: 'They just want to go back to school and continue their studies. 'They made a mistake and they just want to get back to normal, so that's what we're going to do as a council help them get back on track.' Mr Butt said the families contacted the police on Friday morning as soon as they realised their boys were missing. The three teenagers were stopped in Istanbul in a dramatic security operation after British police tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul and the trio were brought back to Britain where they were questioned at a high-security London police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Sources in Turkey said there is some evidence the three communicated with terrorists about how best to evade the authorities but none of them are believed to be connected to any high-profile ISIS terrorists. The two 17-year-old boys, along with a 19-year-old man, all from north-west London, were detained in Istanbul, Turkey, the Met Police said. They are believed to have been travelling to join ISIS (file picture) A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'They have been bailed to return to a central London police station pending further inquiries.' Investigators now hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so. More than 600 Britons have fled Britain for Syria and Iraq since the appalling explosion of violence in the region began. They include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months, many of whom wanted to become 'jihadi brides'. ISIS controls huge areas of the two countries and has attracted thousands of foreign fighters to its cause. Turkey has faced criticism for not controlling its border with Syria, but has accused European states of failing to prevent would-be jihadists from leaving in the first place. MailOnline has contacted Brent Council and Preston Manor School for comment.

"David Cameron's kitchen counter admission that he will not run for a third term as Prime Minister has raised more questions than answers. But before we get to the nitty gritty of who will take over in 2020 - should Mr Cameron be re-elected in May - there is a far more pressing question to answer: Is his kitchen better than those of his political competitors? Ed Miliband was the first to welcome  cameras into his kitchen, and since then Nicola Sturgeon and the PM have both invited TV crews to snoop around the pantries of power. Scroll down to vote in our poll . David Cameron's kitchen at his Oxfordshire home is bright and airy, with plenty of room to prepare meals . Ed Miliband's 'functional kitchenette' seems dingy and less homely in comparison to the Prime Minister's . Equipped with a hob, two ovens and a sink, the Miliband's second kitchen is said to be where they make 'tea and quick snacks' Miliband, posing for a cup of tea with his wife Justine, lived to regret his photoshoot after it emerged that it was taken in the smaller of his two kitchens. The Labour leader insisted he preferred his 'functional kitchenette' - complete with a hob, two ovens and a sink - while a family friend revealed it was mainly used for 'tea and quick snacks'. The bland room, painted white with a grey floor, seems cold and rather dingy compared to the kitchens at the Prime Minister's two homes. While many were listening intently to Mr Cameron's revelation that he will not run for Britain's highest office come 2020, others were busy taking note of his family-sized kitchen at his Oxfordshire home. His practical kitchen includes a large worktop, which the Prime Minister used to chop up vegetables with BBC deputy political editor James Landale, as well as mod cons such as a blender and an ice-dispensing fridge-freezer. Showing the Tory leader's sense of humour, some viewers of his bombshell interview may have spotted a red 'Calm Down Dear' chopping board on the windowsill - a reference to when he landed himself in hot water by using the remark on Labour's Angela Eagle in the Commons. David Cameron was pictured cutting up tomatoes in his kitchen, while another red chopping board with the phrase 'Calm Down Dear' can just about be seen in the windowsill . The Prime Minister was also seen in his smart kitchen chopping tomatoes while chatting to BBC deputy political editor James Landale . The Camerons' Downing Street kitchen is fully-stocked with food - as well as at least two bottles of wine . Which party leader has the best kitchen? Which party leader has the best kitchen? Now share your opinion . The Camerons' kitchen in Downing Street was also fully-stocked when cameras were allowed in earlier this month, with wine bottles visible in the fridge and on the kitchen counter, next to a loaf of bread. Even Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the SNP, has had TV crews inside her house. Susanna Reid remarked that the First Minister's spotless house looked like a 'show home' as she sipped on a brew fresh from Ms Sturgeon's coffee machine. Reid told her: 'We are in your lovely home now... It's immaculate.' Ms Sturgeon replied: 'That's because I had my husband up most of last night cleaning it. It's not always this tidy.' In one recent interview David Cameron was seen preparing dinner, but the best Ms Sturgeon could do was make a coffee. 'I've never been very good in the kitchen,' she admitted. 'I like Indian takeaway,' she said, before joking: 'The fact we are on first names terms with the person who delivers it on a Friday night shouldn't allow you to read anything into my lifestyle.'

"A World War I-era cottage went under the hammer for $1.2 million on Tuesday. The Paddington home in inner-city Sydney has been frozen in time for a century, a period through which it was owned by one family. The bidding, which was directed by Damien Cooley, was left to three builders, who would seemingly have had an advantage in refurbishing the Victorian workers' cottage, reports Property Observer. A house frozen in time from 100 years has gone uner the hammer for $1.2million, complete with bedpans, outdoor toilet and a wireless which could have possibly broadcast the end of World War I . The Paddington home in inner-city Sydney, had been kept by one family since 1915 and is still completely in its original condition . The builders could embark on the necessary restoration for about $400,000, a job which would cost double that for non-builders. Mr Cooley was reportedly reluctant to accept the $900,000 opening bid, and the property is believed to have garnered an over $1 million price tag. Records show it was last sold when a tram worker bought it for £400 around 100 years ago. The Victorian home on 6 Broughton Street could be one of the last examples of the suburb's early 'workers cottages' and comes complete with an Arnotts biscuit tin and a fly swatter. Nestled on a laneway amongst renovated cottages, the house is easy to bypass but inside it is hidden with historic gems . A combined laundry-bathroom-kitchen complete with the double wash tub and hot water cooper fill up the bathroom area . Outside, two paths run parallel down the garden. A little outdoor toilet is as the bottom of the garden, near the laneway . There are also a huge fly swatter next to the old-fashioned stove and vintage furniture adorns the house. A modern refrigerator has been added to the house. In the two-bedroom house, two ornate dressing tables sit in the corner of the master bedroom, along with bedpans and a fireplace. A combined laundry-bathroom-kitchen complete with the double wash tub and hot water copper fill up the bathroom area. A kettle sits on the stove in the bathroom and a dresser features towels and jugs which would have been used for washing in that era. Outside, two paths run parallel down the garden. A little outdoor toilet is at the bottom of the garden, near the laneway. In the two-bedroom house, two ornate dressing tables sit in the corner along with bedpans and a fireplace . The house is open for inspection starting from February 25th and will go on auction on March 17th . The grass is withered but the time capsule house is well-kept and nothing is overgrown. It is expected that the house will sell for well over $1 million. A similar house in Paddington, which hadn't been touched in 40 years sold for over $2.5 million in 2013.

"Two swimmers who had gotten caught in the riptide at a Southern California beach while their small children watched from shore found aid arriving in the form of a helpful Bernese mountain dog. It was late Thursday afternoon at a beach in Ventura when three-year-old Nico raced into the water after a woman who had become trapped by the current began calling for help. The dog's owner, Dan Clarke, himself a former lifeguard, told KTLA about watching as Nico paddled out to the struggling woman. Scroll down for video . Hero dog: Three-year-old Nico paddled out to rescue a woman who had gotten caught in the current at Ventura Beach in California . 'He went right out to her, right up to the side of the boogie board and he swum his body around while he was swimming,' Clarke told the network. 'I just said, ""Grab him anywhere you can.""' The woman grabbed onto Nico's chest and held her boogie board with the other hand, allowing Nico to guide her to shore. The woman's husband had tried to swim the 100 yards out to his wife, but he had also become taken by the current and couldn't reach her. 'I know how treacherous it is out here and what a false sense of security it is,' said Clarke's wife Vivian. 'To be not that far off shore and just get caught out and nobody around to help you.' It was only a few months ago the Clarkes had adopted Nico, who was now paying it forward by rescuing the couple caught in the water. Grateful: The couple joined their children back on the beach, grateful to Nico for coming to their rescue while in the water . Amazed: Dan Clarke, Nico's owner and a former lifeguard, said he had never seen his newly adopted dog perform a feat like the one he saw on the beach . Warning: Signs warn swimmers at the Ventura beach not to swim into the water, as the riptide can pull beachgoers out to see .

"After entering a rehabilitation program almost six weeks ago on January 28, Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel is still receiving treatment at the facility. Manziel's NFL coach, Mike Pettine, confirmed on Monday that Manziel is still at the private rehab center in Ohio. There is no date set for the 22-year-old 2012 Heisman Trophy winner to be released. Scroll down for video . Hard-partying Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel entered a rehabilitation facility on January 28 . The 22-year-old signal-caller is still there after more than five weeks and doesn't yet have a release date . Manziel played in five games in the NFL during his rookie season last year and only completed 51.4 per cent of his passes for 175 yards, two interceptions and no touchdowns . Manziel is staying  at the center, which possibly treats alcohol and substance abuse, longer than the minimum 28 days required by many treatment programs the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported. Pettine said 'football is an afterthought' right now for Manziel. He added: 'We're just giving him his privacy and [letting him] do what he has to do.' Pettine, who visited Manziel last month, was asked if it was a good sign the young quarterback extended his stay. He responded:  'Sure. It's something that he was very resolute that needed to get done and again. 'I'll respect his privacy and leave it at that.' Browns coach Mike Pettine (above) confirmed on Monday Manziel is still at the private rehab center in Ohio . Manziel's fondness for partying and off-the-field antics were well known while he was in college at Texas A&M . A photo snapped of Manziel before the start of the season showed him in a bar bathroom with a dollar bill . Brad Beckworth, a Manziel family adviser, confirmed in February Manziel was getting treatment. He said: 'Johnny knows there are areas in which he needs to improve in order to be a better family member, friend and teammate and he thought the offseason was the right time to take this step.' Coach Pettine said it was 'too soon' to know if Manziel will be ready for voluntary offseason workouts next month, ESPN reported. He added: 'Getting him right personally comes first, then the professional part comes second. 'That was really the message when we talked to him. 'Listen, get yourself right, and the football will take care of itself.' Manziel played parts of seven quarters in the NFL during his rookie season last year. He only completed 51.4 per cent of his passes for 175 yards, two interceptions and no touchdowns.

"Louise Whitaker lost 9st but was left with huge saggy breasts resembling 'coal sacks' (pictured) After losing a staggering nine stone, Louise Whitaker expected to be brimming with confidence. But her joy at dropping four dress sizes and shrinking from a 22 to a size 14 was shattered every time she caught sight of her chest in the mirror. The 41-year-old said despite shedding the weight she was left with huge saggy breasts resembling 'coal sacks'. She said she regularly had to 'tuck in' her 48EE breasts, leaving her feeling more embarrassed of her body than ever before. After being denied a reduction operation on the NHS because her body mass index still deemed her to be obese, the support worker turned to a private clinic in desperation. And today, after having half her breast tissue removed in a three-hour operation, Ms Whittaker said she feels as though she has been freed. She said: ' I absolutely hated my breasts. They were like giant coal sacks and I spent all my time trying to tuck them into place to stop them escaping from my bra. 'I was very self conscious, not to mention the back pain they caused.' But she was rejected from the NHS waiting list for a breast reduction because after losing weight her BMI crept back up to a fraction over the 30 limit - at which point a person is thought to be obese. Ms Whitaker has three children aged 20, 17 and 14 and lives in Bradford, said: 'I was on the waiting list for a reduction for two and a half years after I lost weight then one day I got a call telling me I would have to come off it because of my BMI. 'I was disappointed because this was not a cosmetic issue and because I felt my BMI was only just over because of all the excess weight I was carrying on my bust.' She was estimated to be carrying at least 6lbs in breast tissue and without it her BMI would have fallen into the healthy range. But as her marriage broke down Ms Whittaker felt unable to contemplate her future as a single woman without addressing the confidence issues that stemmed from her bust. Scroll down for video . She said: 'I felt so much more healthy, happier and confident in every way thanks to my diet but my coal sack breasts were running everything because there was nothing I could do to change them. 'No amount of exercise in the gym made any difference. And swimming, running, anything like that was impossible due to the sheer size and weight of them.' Eventually seeing how distraught she was her parents helped her fund private surgery with Transform. She said: ' I felt weird going for the consultation because to me this was not cosmetic surgery, this was absolutely necessary.' Surgeons agreed her health and confidence would benefit from an uplift and reduction combined. She underwent the £5,800 operation in September 2013 at the Transform Hospital in Manchester. Her bust was reduced to a more manageable 40D thanks to the removal of half of her breast tissue. Ms Whitaker said: ' I just lifted the bed sheet and said ""wow"". I couldn't believe the coal sacks had finally gone. I was over the moon to see the back of them. The 41-year-old was denied a breast reduction operation on the NHS because her body mass index was just over 30 - the limit where a person is classed as obese - after losing weight . But today, after having half her breast tissue removed in a three-hour operation at a private clinic in Manchester, Ms Whittaker said she feels as though she has been freed . 'The surgeon was amazing and really did a wonderful job.' After the reduction last year she says she felt less back pain and her confidence blossomed. She said: 'People think large breasts are a blessing but they can be a curse. 'I'm delighted to see the back of them. Finally I can walk tall.' Shami Thomas, spokeswoman from Transform Cosmetic Surgery said, 'Breast reductions are one of the most life changing procedures we offer here at Transform. 'The vast majority of patients see a significant improvement in their quality of life post op. 'We hear patients talking of how much easier it is for them to exercise post op - going swimming, running, attending exercise classes are some of the activities patients are now able to take up which they would have struggled with before. 'We've seen a steady year on year increase in the numbers of women enquiring about breast reductions - between 2013 and 2014, 22 per cent up from the year before. 'It's great to hear about the positive effect it's had on this patient's life.'","Louise Whitaker dropped four dress sizes shrinking from a 22 to a 14 .

"The White House is seeking to enshrine its pledge to cut emissions in a global climate agreement to be negotiated later this year in Paris, formally submitting an outline of its commitment to the United Nations yesterday. Republican leaders are warning other countries to 'proceed with caution' in negotiations with the Obama administration because any deal could be later undone, however. President Barack Obama lacks the . political and legal backing to commit the United States to an . international agreement, they say. Republican leaders are warning other countries to 'proceed with caution' in negotiations with the Obama administration because any deal could be later undone . The White House's Tuesday announcement that the U.S. would cut greenhouse gas emissions by close to 28 percent from 2005 levels within a decade builds on a promise Obama made last November in Beijing in concert with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two countries are the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gasses. To meet its stated benchmark by 2025, the White House will rely on a host of existing laws and executive actions targeting power plants, vehicles, oil and gas production and buildings. 'We can achieve this goal using laws that are already on the books, and it will be in place by the time the president leaves office,' Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the president, said according to the New York Times. Obama has just two years remaining in office, but many of the Senate's Republican lawmakers who oppose the initiative will remain in positions of power long after the current president has moved on. 'Considering that two-thirds of the U.S. federal government . hasn't even signed off on the Clean Power Plan and 13 states . have already pledged to fight it, our international partners . should proceed with caution before entering into a binding, . unattainable deal,' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell noted on Tuesday. The UN Climate Conference is to take place from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11. U.S. officials stressed that their Intended Nationally . Determined Contribution, U.N. lingo for its official submission, . stands on sound legal footing, with the measures drawing . authority from legislation such as the Clean Air Act and the . Energy Independence and Security Act. Todd Stern, the lead U.S. climate change negotiator, said he . frequently tells foreign counterparts that 'undoing the kind of . regulation we are putting in place is very tough to do.' But elements of the administration's climate policy already . face legal challenges. On April 16, a federal appeals court in . Washington, D.C. will hear arguments from 13 states opposed to . as-yet-unfinalized regulations from the Environmental Protection . Agency (EPA) that target emissions in existing power plants. McConnell's warnings echoed the tone of a March 9 'open . letter' from 47 Republican senators to Iran, in which they . warned a Republican president would not be bound to honor a . nuclear agreement struck by Democrat Obama without congressional . approval, calling it a 'mere executive agreement.' So did Missouri Senator Roy Blunt's. Blunt holds the position of vice chairman in the Senate Republican Conference. 'Just as we witnessed throughout recent negotiations with Iran and during the previous climate agreement with China, President Obama and his administration act as if Congress has no role in these discussions,' Blunt said in a Tuesday statement. 'That’s just flat out wrong.' 'We will not stand by and allow the president to unilaterally enact bad energy policies that hurt our nation’s poorest families and young people the most,' he said. The White House's Tuesday announcement that the U.S. would cut greenhouse gas emissions by close to 28 percent from 2005 levels within a decade builds on a promise Obama made last November in Beijing in concert with Chinese President Xi Jinping . Some observers said that resistance to the administration's . climate policies leaves foreign governments questioning whether . Obama's commitments can last. 'By strenuously invoking EPA regulations, the Administration . is trying to convince skeptical international audiences that the . U.S. can actually deliver on its new climate goals, despite . Republican resistance,' said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton . White House official who is now with the German Marshall Fund of . the United States. 'But major capitals are likely to remain nervous.' The administration is clearly sensitive to the threat. Power . plants are the biggest domestic source of greenhouse gas . emissions, and the EPA is seeking to use its power to slash . carbon levels from plants to 30 percent of their 2005 levels by . 2020. On Monday, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the agency . had designed power plant rules under the authority of the Clean . Air Act - and insisted that they can withstand Supreme Court . scrutiny. 'We don't need a plan B if we are solid on our plan A,' she . said. Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer representing utilities . industries for Bracewell & Giuliani and former assistant . administrator of the EPA under George W Bush, says even if the . courts uphold the EPA proposal on power plants, a future . Republican administration can reverse it. 'There are some EPA rules that are very difficult for a new . administration to change but this is not one of those rules,' Holmstead said. He calculates that at least five high court . justices are wary of the EPA's regulatory leeway. Environmental groups, on the other hand, were more confident . that Obama's measures cannot be reversed by the courts or . politics. 'The Clean Air Act has proven to be quite durable,' said . David Waskow, director of international initiatives for the . World Resources Institute. 'While elements may be slowed or . modified by legal challenges, they are rarely overturned.'","President Barack Obama lacks the political and legal backing to commit the United States to an international agreement, Republican lawmakers say .

"Damien  Markey (pictured) and his wife Jenny were dismissed by the University of Bolton after being accused of leaking embarrassing stories . A lecturer and his wife have been sacked from a struggling university after being accused of leaking embarrassing stories about its controversial £200,000-a-year vice-chancellor to the Press, it emerged yesterday. Damien and Jenny Markey were summarily dismissed by the University of Bolton after articles in the Daily Mail highlighted how the institution spends public money, a union said. The couple, who have three young children, deny being the source of stories revealing that the university was lending vice-chancellor Professor George Holmes £960,000 to buy a new house and spending up to £100,000 on staff away days to the Lake District. Critics had branded the expenditure a waste of money from an institution which has spent much of the 11 years since it became a university near the foot of national league tables. The latest case demonstrates how harshly public bodies treat those even suspected of being whistleblowers, let alone those who are proven to have leaked information to the media. It comes amid mounting alarm that staff in all organisations are not being protected from punishment if they report their concerns to the Press. The sackings were also branded a worrying blow against the tradition of free speech on campuses. Mr Markey, 42, was dismissed as a senior lecturer in visual effects for film and television after a 45-minute disciplinary hearing last Friday for ‘leaking information to the Press aimed at damaging the university’. According to his union he was told he had been overheard talking on his mobile phone using the words ‘boats’ and ‘lakes’, and accused of being the source of the story that the university was sending its 700 staff to a Lake District hotel in a series of away days for pep talks by Professor Holmes, who has a yacht moored nearby. The article first appeared in Times Higher Education, which yesterday said neither Mr Markey nor his wife were the source. Details of the trips had been sent to all staff, while the two-year loan to Professor Holmes appeared in university accounts. The struggling university paid up to £100,000 to send all 700 of its staff for stays at  four-star Lakeside Hotel and Spa (pictured) in the Lake District . Mr Markey was also accused of making malicious statements about colleagues and bringing the university into disrepute for highlighting concerns about a shortage of equipment following an £800,000 flagship project, the union said. His 36-year-old wife, an academic administrator in the health and community studies department, was dismissed on Monday over similar allegations which she also denies. The couple have denied revealing that the university lent  vice-chancellor Professor George Holmes (pictured) £960,000 to buy a new house . Mr Markey, who is said to have had an unblemished disciplinary record, was secretary of the local branch of the University and College Union (UCU) and led a walkout in 2013 in protest at a planned 1 per cent pay rise. The couple had been advised not to comment yesterday as the union insisted it would be appealing against the dismissal. General secretary Sally Hunt said: ‘These sackings are completely unjustified. Nobody likes looking a bit silly in public, but to start axing staff without evidence is the response of a desperate despot, not a university vice-chancellor.’ Bizarrely, the university’s official Twitter feed briefly ‘favourited’ a UCU tweet branding 53-year-old Professor Holmes a desperate despot. Mrs Markey is a member of Unison whose regional secretary Kevan Nelson said: ‘We are alarmed that the university has taken this arbitrary and vindictive decision. We will challenge this by all available means.’ Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said dismissing university staff accused of whistleblowing could have a chilling effect on freedom of speech. A university spokesman said: ‘The university is comfortable that procedures have been followed and as yet no appeal has been lodged. The process is not connected with a staff member being a trade union official. The university does not comment on the merits of individual cases.’ Whistleblowing in the public sector is supposed to be encouraged, but last week there was alarm that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood had agreed plans to bar 430,000 civil servants from talking to the Press without permission or face being sacked.","Damien and Jenny Markey have been dismissed by the University of Bolton .

"Justine Miliband has dismissed the media storm around the 'two kitchens' debate by saying there is more important things in politics than their home. In an interview with The Guardian, the Labour leader's wife, known professionally as Justine Thornton, said that the media storm surrounding which kitchen she and her husband, Ed, used in their north London home was not what mattered in politics. 'Ed's grandad died because of politics. He met people who were assassinated because of politics,' she said.

"Women taking HRT could cut their risk of heart disease and an early death – as long as they start in their 50s, according to researchers. Data from 40,000 patients found that those taking the drugs from this age were less likely to die prematurely from any cause and the threat of a heart attack was halved. There was, however, a slightly raised risk of blood clots. An estimated one million women in Britain take hormone replacement therapy to control symptoms of the menopause and experts believe taking it in your 50s could help cut the risk of early death and heart attacks . HRT is given to control symptoms of the menopause and is usually taken by women in their early 50s. This large-scale review sought to investigate if it has positive or negative effects on other areas of women’s health. When evidence from those across a wider age range was examined, it showed oral HRT did not protect against heart disease and may increase stroke risk. But the beneficial effects became apparent in a group of 9,000 women who started HRT at or not long after the menopause and before 60. They took it for three to ten years. Lead researcher Dr Henry Boardman, from Oxford University, said: ‘The evidence we have provides some support for the so-called “timing hypothesis” but we should bear in mind the size of this effect. ‘When we looked at the results according to the age of women, or by how long since their menopause that they started treatment, we found that if 1,000 women under 60 started therapy we would expect six fewer deaths, eight fewer cases of heart disease and five extra blood clots over about seven years, compared to a 1,000 similar women who did not start.’ An estimated one million women in the UK take HRT for symptoms like hot flushes and mood changes although it also protects bones. However, some specialists have long held that HRT should prevent heart disease based on the fact that when women naturally lose supplies of oestrogen at the menopause, their heart risks rise. HRT is given to control symptoms of the menopause and the study collected data from 40,000 patients across the UK (file picture, posed) The theory was that taking oestrogen supplements – the basis of HRT – would help restore protection. But startling results from the US Women’s Health Initiative study in 2002 not only found no heart disease benefits but harm caused by breast cancer. However, expert analysis has since concluded that the risks were largely found in women taking HRT many years past the menopause in their 60s and 70s for whom it was never intended. The latest findings, published in the Cochrane Library international database, came to a similar conclusion. In women under 60 or who started HRT within ten years of the menopause, there was a 30 per cent drop in deaths from any cause and a 48 per cent lower risk of coronary heart disease. As well as a small increased risk of blood clots, there was a suggestion of a higher chance of stroke. However, this was inconclusive. The general findings across different age groups showed death rates from any cause, specifically cardiovascular disease, were not affected by being on HRT. But there was a 24 per cent higher risk of stroke. Dr Boardman said: ‘The evidence adds to a large bank of evidence that helps GPs advise their patients. But you need to weigh up the severity of the symptoms and the benefits and harms.’ Dr David Tovey, editor-in-chief of the Cochrane Library, said: ‘The main analysis that the authors did found no benefit and so we need to apply caution to the results from the sub-group analysis. ‘However if true, this apparent benefit in preventing heart disease in younger women should be considered alongside other possible benefits and emerging evidence of harms, including the risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and DVT.’ The review looked at almost 4,000 investigations worldwide, including two large American studies which recruited women as old as 79.","Women who take HRT in 50s could cut risk of heart disease and early death .

"If your waistband feels tighter than you’d like, blame Jamie, or Nigella or Delia. Research shows that women who makes the dishes they see on TV shows are fatter than others. They are on average 11lb heavier – the equivalent of two dress sizes. It isn’t known why but one explanation could be that butter, cream and other ‘naughty’ ingredients that make dishes look so tasty on TV cause us to pile on the pounds when eaten regularly at home. The US researchers said that while meals made by celebrity chefs may be highly tempting, they are not necessarily very healthy. Tempting: Nigella Lawson. Research shows that women who makes the dishes they see on TV shows are fatter than others . Indeed, previous British research concluded recipes by some of our favourite cooks, including Jamie Oliver, Nigella Lawson and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, to be less healthy than supermarket ready meals. The chefs’ dishes contained more calories and were higher in fat but lacking in fibre. For the latest study, researchers from Cornell University in New York state asked 500 young women where they got new recipes from. Options included word of mouth, magazines, cookery classes and TV shows. The women were also asked how often they cooked from scratch and how much they weighed. The survey focused on women aged between 20 and 35 – an age at which they are likely to cook for a young family as well as for themselves. Previous British research concluded recipes by some of our favourite cooks, including Jamie Oliver (pictured), Nigella Lawson and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, to be less healthy than supermarket ready meals . If found that women those watched TV cookery shows weighed 11lb more on average – but only if they tried to make the dishes themselves. Those that watched celebrity chefs but didn’t follow their recipes were no fatter than those that didn’t watch the shows. In other words, the problem seems to lie in the ingredients that TV chefs encourage us to use. Researcher Professor Brian Wansink said: ‘One reason for this phenomenon may be that often the recipes portrayed on TV are not the healthiest.’ Writing in the journal Appetite, he added that our admiration of celebrity chefs may blind us to the nutritional value of the food they are preparing. Plus, the thought that people all around the country are watching the same thing may make ingredients that are indulgent seem normal. Finally, we may simply eat more of something when we have gone to all the effort of making it ourselves. Dr Vicky Pope, the study’s lead author, said: ‘Because many cooking shows normalise over-consumption and gratification, it comes as no surprise that viewers’ culinary habits are negatively influenced. ‘This is why it is important for cooks who enjoy watching these shows to recognise these influences and learn to modify the recipes to be more healthy or find recipes from other sources.’ Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said he doubts whether most viewers ever attempt to make the dishes shown. But those that do may not realise that the recipes can be high in fat, salt or sugar. They may also regularly serve up a rich dish designed to be reserved for special occasions.","Women who make dishes they see on TV shows are fatter than others .

"Ellen Pao, 45, accused venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers of discriminating against her other female colleagues in a $16m suit . The CEO of Reddit has told a court how she was pursued 'relentlessly' by a male colleague at a major venture capital firm before being frozen out after breaking off the affair. Ellen Pao is seeking $16million after filing a sex discrimination suit against prestigious Silicon Valley business Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers. The 45-year-old told jurors how she was excluded from an all-male dinner with Al Gore and felt 'very uncomfortable' hearing male guests of the firm talking about pornography on a private jet. In her first day of testimony, the plaintiff testified that one male colleague was 'relentless' in his pursuit of her and cut her out of email chains and meetings when she ended the affair. Pao is seeking damages from her former employer after claiming she was passed over for a promotion because she is a woman and then fired in 2012 after she complained. Kleiner Perkins has denied wrongdoing and says Pao did not get along with her colleagues and performed poorly after she became a junior partner around 2010. In her testimony, Pao said she was given a poetry book by a senior partner in 2007 that featured drawings of naked women and poems on topics such as the longings of an older man for younger women. The partner also invited her to dinner one weekend while noting his wife would be out of town, she said. 'I thought it was strange, and it made me uncomfortable,' she said. Pao acknowledged having the affair with a male colleague, but said she broke it off when she learned he had lied that his wife had left him. She said the colleague later retaliated by shutting her out of emails and meetings. 'He was relentless and eventually told me that his wife had left him,' Pao told jurors, explaining why she got into the relationship with him. The 45-year-old told jurors how she was excluded from an all-male dinner at Vice President Al Gore's apartment . When she raised the retaliation issue with management, a senior partner explained how he had met his wife at another company while he was married, and perhaps Pao could have the same outcome with her colleague, she testified. She said she repeatedly complained that the colleague was retaliating against her, but 'Kleiner Perkins continued to do nothing.' Pao, who became interim CEO at Reddit after top executive Yishan Wong resigned, said it was humiliating not to be invited to an all-male dinner at Vice President Al Gore's apartment and have to explain to executives she ran into that she wouldn't be attending. Pao lived in the same building as Gore. John Doerr (left) previously took the stand during the trial and discussed whether the firm discriminated against Pao, his former chief of staff . At one point, she said, she felt 'very uncomfortable' about a conversation men were having about pornography aboard a private plane. The men were not Kleiner employees, but had been invited by a senior Kleiner manager, who Pao's attorneys say was present but did nothing to stop the conversation. Kleiner Perkins' attorneys have tried to portray Pao as a chronic complainer who demanded credit for work done by a team, clashed with her colleagues, and twisted facts and circumstances. Her attorneys tried Monday to dispute that portrayal and establish their client's credibility and likeability with the jury. During her testimony, Pao said she had a disagreement with a female colleague, but they improved their communication after spending more time together outside the office, as Kleiner Perkins management had suggested. Steve Hirschfeld, an investigator hired by the firm to look into Pao's bias complaint, testified Monday that she told him that her relationship with the male colleague was not consensual - a contention Hirschfeld did not find truthful. The civil trial is taking place in California Superior Court in San Francisco county. Pao became interim CEO at Reddit after top executive Yishan Wong resigned.","Ellen Pao is seeking $16million after filing a sex discrimination lawsuit .

"New pictures have been released revealing the ordeal of Brazil's Miss BumBum runner-up Andressa Urach who was hospitalised at the weekend after her buttock implants became infected. Andressa Urach, 27, had to have toxic substances drained from her body after her bottom fillers 'rotted', triggering a life-threatening infection. The model admitted she brought her health woes on herself after 'my vanity made me push the limits.' Andressa Urach is pictured in hospital this week having life-saving treatment after her buttock implants triggered an infection . The model had to have a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body . Speaking from her hospital bed in Sao Paulo earlier this week, Miss Urach revealed that she has undergone an emergency operation to remove the substances from her left butt cheek. Without medical intervention, the infection could have been fatal. She is now recovering after having a a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body. New pictures have been released of her during and after this unpleasant procedure as she hopes other women will learn from her experience and avoid having surgery in the pursuit of perfection. Andressa was first hospitalised last year thanks to cosmetic procedures going wrong . 'I am suffering a lot, but God is with me. It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits,' the mother-of-one admitted earlier this week. Despite making a living off her voluminous bottom, she said she's now happy to have a less curvaceous rear if it means she can survive. She said: 'Thanks to God I no longer need my body to work, now I work with honour and can sustain my family like that. I prefer to have legs and be able to walk and lose half a buttock than to die.' Of her hospital stay she admitted: 'It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits' Her voluminous rear used to be her most prized asset but now she said she'd rather it's smaller if it means she'll be healthier . Earlier today, the reality TV posted a picture of herself on Instagram recovering in her hospital bed with her hands making a heart sign as she thanked fans for their support and get well wishes. 'Small gestures of affection make a difference! In the most difficult moments of our lives, we can see who really are our friends,' she wrote. Prior to her brush with death, Miss Urach - who once made hotly-contested claims that she slept with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - had been an advocate of cosmetic surgery. She had reportedly undergone at least nine cosmetic procedures in the past five years. They were said to have included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, breast enlargement, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction. Most important of all was her prized rear. It won her the runner-up title in the 2012 Miss BumBum contest, which aims to find Brazil's most attractive bottom. She reportedly had injections of two filers, hydrogel and PMMA, to make it larger and more plump. But in July she began complaining of discomfort and had 400ml of hydrogel drained from each of her upper thighs. She told Brazil's R7 website at the time: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me. 'Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot. Despite the operation, she continued to be in pain and in November she was taken to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg. The model pictured earlier this month during an interview with Dailymail.com after her legs were infected . Andressa, a runner up in Brazil's Miss BumBum competition, has revealed the terrible damage wreaked on her body by plastic surgery after wounds in her thigh were infected . She spent a month in intensive care and reportedly feared she would lose her leg . This graphic photos show gaping holes in Andressa's thighs, all in the name of beauty . She underwent two unsuccessful drainage procedures, according to reports, before suffering from septic shock and being moved to intensive care. At one point her life was in danger and it was claimed her leg could have had to be amputated. After making a recovery from that incident, she was then rushed back to hospital last weekend with another infection cause by her buttock implants. She underwent another emergency operation to remove a combination of Pmma and hydrogel and is now being treated with antibiotics through a catheter and will soon begin physiotherapy. Miss Urach hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a claim the Real Madrid striker strenuously denied. Andressa featured in the Miss BumBum contest in 2012 and claimed she slept with Cristiano Ronaldo . Pain: Miss Urach when her legs began hurting last year (left) and, right, in better spirits in her hospital bed . She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund. The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.' He accused Andressa of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel where she claimed they made love for a media interview. Brazil overtook the U.S. in 2013 to become the most prolific plastic surgery nation in the world. Almost 1.5million procedures were performed in the South American country - an increase of 600,000 in just two years. These included 226,000 breast enlargements and 64,000 buttock augmentations, a fifth of all those in the world. Brazil has more than 5,000 plastic surgeons who also performed 78,000 facelifts, 77,000 nose jobs and 219 penis enlargements, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. But the U.S. was still far ahead for the number of non-surgical procedures, such as laser hair removal and chemical peels, with 2.5million to Brazil's 650,000. Fellow Miss BumBum contestant Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said last year: 'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping. 'Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid. 'We were slaves to beauty.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Illegal immigrants are being smuggled out of Britain to avoid deportation – before being sneaked back in after gaining immigration status elsewhere in Europe. Using the ‘asylum loophole’, people smugglers charge £1,000 per person to arrange trips to Europe, allowing illegal immigrants to gain legitimate paperwork. It means that if they are caught trying to return to Britain, they are not sent back to their birth country but to the European state that gave them their first asylum-seeking status. Illegal cargo: The migrants in the Romanian lorry which they boarded in Kent before it headed for Calais via Dover . The lorry was never searched and was said to have breezed through immigration controls in Britain and France . The lorry driver was confronted by reporters from BBC's South East Today programme . The ruse was exposed by the BBC’s South East Today programme which was broadcast last night. Reporters contacted a gang of people smugglers – using a fixer called Ajmal – who agreed to take him out of the country and bring him back for £1,000. Hidden cameras showed Ajmal getting on to a Romanian-based lorry in Kent before it headed for Calais via a Dover ferry. The truck was never searched and was said to have ‘breezed’ through immigration controls in Britain and France. Only hours later, Ajmal was released in Belgium along with 20 other illegal immigrants from India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The report told how many of the illegal immigrants – and some who had outstayed their student visas – were told to make their way to Italy to apply for asylum. Once there they are fingerprinted and are able to gain immigration status, allowing them to lengthen their stay in Europe. If they are caught trying to return to Britain, they only face being returned to Italy or other European countries rather than their countries of origin. Many illegal immigrants were told to make their way to Italy to apply for asylum . John Vine, the former Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said: ‘I don’t think people realise the extent of the trade of shipping people out of the UK to other parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world' Less than two years ago, border officials spoke of their shock of people trying to smuggle themselves out of the UK . Asked how he would return to Britain, Ajmal said: ‘When I want to go to the UK … he say “ring my same number and I will tell you what to do and where you need to come – I will take you back to the UK”.’ Last night John Vine, the former Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said: ‘I don’t think people realise the extent of the trade of shipping people out of the UK to other parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world. It is an issue the authorities need to look at very seriously.’ In 2006, Italy announced it would grant citizenship to immigrants who had stayed in the country for five years. However, it emerged that from January to August last year, 140,000 illegal immigrants had entered Europe via Italy. The eight-month figure was more than the entire total for the previous year. Less than two years ago, border officials in the UK told of their ‘shock’ at the ‘very unusual’ case of 28 illegal immigrants trying to smuggle themselves out of Britain. The immigrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka hid on a Polish lorry on a P&O ferry bound for France. They were returned to Dover to be questioned at the Border Force immigration centre.","People smugglers charging £1,000 per person to exploit 'asylum loophole'

"Millions of male workers who leave their rural homes to work in large cities can only have sex with their wives for a fortnight every year. At least 47 million women live in rural China while their husbands work away - leaving them desperate for intimacy when they return. 'All I can think of when returning home for Chinese New Year is sex,' one migrant claimed. And now a series of photographs, taken in Shangnan County in Shaanxi Province, has captured the moment many of these migrants return to their own bedrooms. Wang Libao (right) and wife Zhu Chunlian (left): When Mr Wang is away, his wife and children sleep on a 1.5-metre-wide bed. But when he’s home, the two children are sent to stay with grandparents . Wang Libao, 34, and his 30-year-old wife, Zhu Chunlian,  got married in 2003, according to a report by People’s Daily.   . Mr Wang works in a gold mine in Lingbao, Henan Province, in central China. He said that because he does not visit his wife in their three-bedroom house very often their two children are sent to stay with grandparents when he returns. Although he has been back for a few days, Mrs Wang said she is already trying to persuade her husband to stay for three more. Wu Maojiang (left) and wife Wang Xiaojing: Mr Wu says he spends about 20 days with his wife every year . Similarly Wu Maojiang, 36, only gets to spent 20 days with his wife Wang Xiaojing a year. The couple got married in 2006 and have a daughter, 8, and a five-year-old son. In 2013, Mr Wu spent ¥36,000 (£3,820) buying a five-bedroom house for his family. But as Mr Wu has works away, including in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Henan provinces in central China, it is his father who lives with his wife and children. Jiang Quanbao (right) and wife: In order to support the entire family, Mr Jiang has been working even though he is very sick . But for some couples it is not just working away that prevents sex. Work injuries are also common as migrants choose to take on dangerous, but high-paid, jobs such as coal mining. Jiang Quanbao, 45, works at different coal and gold mines. He does not get to spend much time with his wife, who he married five years ago. A few years ago Mr Jiang was suffering from back pain when his body collapsed. The doctors told him he had kidney stones and would require surgery. Mr Jiang said he and his wife now don’t have sex life because of his poor health. Qiao Chengfeng (right) and wife Zhang Juan (left): Mr Qiao, who got pneumoconiosis from long-time mining, cannot go out for work any more. Due to health, he has not had sex with his wife for two years . Qiao Chengfeng used to work at different mines. He is suffering from pneumoconiosis and doesn't have the strength to lift a bag of rice. The 31-year-old said although he sleeps with his wife Zhang Juan, 27, every day on the same bed, he has not been able to have sex with her for two years. On hearing this, his wife, who he married in 2005, turns around to weep. Jiang Kun (left) and wife: Mr Jiang and his late father are both miners. He has decided to stay at home for two more weeks in order to spend time with family . Jiang Kun, 31, who is also a miner, said the reason many men spend so much time away from home is because it is not possible to feed the whole family by working in a nearby factory. He added that this decision was made despite many men being aware of the dangers of coal mining. Mr Jiang’s wife is two years younger than him. The two have a nine-year-old son and a seven-year-old daughter. He said he decided to return to work after the Lantern Festival, the fifteenth day after Chinese New Year, because he wants to spend more time with his family. Huang Jiao (left) with her daughter and mother in law their house. Ms Huang's husband left home in central China on the eighth day of Chinese New Year to return to his factory in southern China . But it is not just couples who have been together for years that are affected. Huang Jiao, 26, got married around six months ago. Her husband works in an electronic factory in Guangdong in southern China and earns some ¥3,000 (£318) every month. Ms Huang said every year she only has opportunity to ‘be with my husband’ for a handful of days – the same applies for most of her female neighbours. Zhu Xianshun (left), whose wife died 14 years ago, is taking care of his paralysed mother-in-law. He has given up the idea of re-marrying . Zhu Xianshun, 64, has been supporting his wife’s parents since his wife died 14 years ago. His father-in-law passed away and his mother-in-law, 85, is now paralysed. Mr Zhu, who has four children, thought of re-marrying but has given up the idea. He says no woman would want to marry a man like him. Yang Fan (left) and wife: The couple married three years ago and now have a little daughter . Yang Fan, 22, married wife Chuan Zhenzhao in May 2012 and now have a little daughter. Mr Yang did not graduate high school as he went out with his father to work. Because they both are working in coal industry, the family is financially stable. The Yang family even bought a pickup truck – a luxury for people with his background. Mr Huang (right) and his wife: Mr Huang suffers from pneumoconiosis while his wife and daughter work in Xi'an . Mr Huang, 48, suffers from pneumoconiosis. He got the disease from working in coal mining and was diagnosed in 2009. In 2014 he developed a more serious illness. Mr Huang says that this disease cannot be cured and many of his colleagues have died. His wife Chen Qiuqin and his daughter work in Xi’an, the provincial capital of Shaanxi. His youngest son is studying in a university in Xi’an. The bedroom of Zhang Chengjun, 28, who works as a welder in Guangdong . Zhang Chengjun, 28, shows his bedroom. Mr Zhang works in Guangdong and is a master of welding. He left home with his wife and four year old son. Mr Zhang father says long-term separation is not an option for young couples. Although it’s expensive to support the wife and child in the city, the family will be more stable and the couple happier.","At least 47 million wives live in rural China while husbands work away .

"A  mother was shamed into losing more than 10 stone after being left mortified by a photograph which she believed proved she was bigger than a buffalo. Janine Furr, 29, tipped the scales at 25st 7lb  and could barely fit into a size 30 dress after years of eating unhealthy takeaways. But the final straw came for the mother-of-three  when she saw a photo of herself sitting on the back of a wooden buffalo in 2012. Scroll down for video . Janine Furr, 29, tipped the scales at 25st 7lb  three years ago and struggled to squeeze into a size 30 but now she's shed 10st on a healthy diet . The final straw came when she saw this snap of her on a wooden buffalo in the park and was convinced that she was wider than the large model . She was convinced that she was wider than the large model, which she even got stuck on top of at a children's playground in Nottingham. Doctors told Janine that - due to her size - she qualified for a gastric band, but the determined housewife decided to take matters into her own hands to shift the excess pounds. She signed up to her local Weight Watchers and lost 10st 6lb over the next three years. Janine even managed to shed 1st 7lb while she was pregnant with her third child Jasmine, now 20-months-old. Now Janine, from Netherfield, Nottingham, is a healthier 15st 7lb and can fit into a size 16 dress with ease. Speaking about her weightloss journey, she said: 'I was huge and my health suffered as a result. But the final straw was when I struggled to get on top of that buffalo and even got stuck there for a while. Doctors told Janine that due to her size, she qualified for a gastric band but she joined a slimming club and lost the weight herself naturally . Janine is a healthier 15st 7lbs  and slips into a size 16 with ease thanks to her new lifestyle . Janine replaced a diet of takeaway pizzas and curry with healthier fruit and vegetable options . She explained: 'I had to be helped off it. When I saw the photo  I was absolutely mortified. I was actually wider than a buffalo. I knew then I had to do something. 'I go to that park regularly now and have no trouble getting on and off it. It feels unreal actually to look back at that picture now. It is a big achievement.' Janine, who also has a seven-year-old daughter, Halea, and a son, Tyler, four, said she had severe confidence and health issues after piling on the pounds during her teens. Janine tried to avoid walking long distances or climbing stairs when she was at her heaviest . She says she didn't feel comfortable eating in public because people looked at her and assumed she was always eating because of her size . She added: 'I've always been quite big. But when I had two young children I was tired all the time. I had pain in my knees often and just wanted to change things really. 'I would have tried to avoid walking long distances or climbing stairs when I weighed my heaviest. It was difficult to play with the kids at times. People used to laugh at me and snigger and make comments about my size in public. It wasn’t nice and knocked my confidence. 'There was one incident where somebody took a picture of me, laughing at me when we were out. It wasn't even discreet. That really bothered me. I did not feel comfortable eating in public because people looked at me and assumed I was always eating because of my size.' After joining Weight Watchers, she soon replaced a diet of takeaway pizzas and curry with healthier fruit and vegetable options. Janine said she had severe confidence and health issues after piling on the pounds during her teens . Janine added: 'I lost weight gradually but each week I could see the scales going in the right direction and as the plan is so flexible, I could fit it around my life. I didn’t want it to happen overnight as I knew I had to lose the weight in a healthy and sustainable way. 'I love walking and swimming and I have more confidence. My life has transformed and I feel completely different. I can now run around after my three children and I’ve introduced healthy food into our family meals too. 'I’m now a bit of a clothes addict.

"Web-savvy militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq could control as many as 90,000 Twitter accounts worldwide, allowing them to spread their sickening propaganda with ease. The terror group is able to 'exert an outsized impact on how the world perceives it' because of its shrewd use of social media and sheer number of online followers, terror experts have concluded. Recommendations in the report by the Washington-based Brookings Institute report include governments and social media companies working together to find new ways to tackle the problem of pro-ISIS accounts spreading horrific murder videos and images and jihadist rhetoric. Power: ISIS militants (pictured) are able to 'exert an outsized impact on how the world perceives it' because of its shrewd use of social media and sheer number of online followers, experts have concluded . The report, by Brookings academic JM Berger and technologist Jonathon Morgan, says: 'While we do not believe that any mainstream social media platform wishes to see its services used to further acts of horrific violence, we also suspect some would rather not be bothered with the challenge of crafting a broad and coherent response to the issue. 'While we can sympathise with the challenges and dilemmas such a response would entail, it is clear that social media companies do feel an obligation to respond to some social standards and illegal uses of their services. 'We are not aware of any major company that takes a hands-off approach to the use of its platform to promote child pornography or human trafficking - or, less dramatically, phishing, spam, fraud, and copyright violations. 'Extremism, while raising thornier issues, merits attention, especially when faced with a rising challenge of violent groups who manipulate platforms to reap the rewards of spreading images of their cruelty.' Showboating: ISIS terrorists use social media to boast of the organisation's victories and territorial gains . The study of ISIS-linked accounts between September and December estimated there were between 46,000 and 70,000 IS-supporting Twitter accounts, with the researchers believing that the true figure was towards the lower end of this scale but setting an absolute maximum at 90,000. It argues that the problem also applies to other social networks and extremist groups such as far-right organisations. Brookings' analysis was based on 'robust' data collected about 50,000 accounts, and partial information about a further 1.9 million. Only a small number of the accounts were able to have their locations identified, as most had this function switched off. But of those that could be located, the vast majority were in the Middle East and North Africa. Other were found in the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium and Australia, but these numbers were in single figures, the report found. They noted that platforms including Facebook and YouTube have already introduced changes aimed at tackling extremist material. Horror: The militants also use social media to share barbaric images of atrocities they commit, such as throwing men accused of being gay off the roof of high buildings . Twitter had started suspending accounts linked to ISIS by the time the research was started, but the authors said this created a new risk, arguing: 'While suspensions appear to have created obstacles to supporters joining Isis's social network, they also isolate Isis supporters online. 'This could increase the speed and intensity of radicalisation for those who do manage to enter the network, and hinder organic social pressures that could lead to deradicalisation. 'Further study is required to evaluate the unintended consequences of suspension campaigns and their attendant trade-offs. Fundamentally, tampering with social networks is a form of social engineering, and acknowledging this fact raises many new, difficult questions. 'Social media companies and the US government must work together to devise appropriate responses to extremism on social media. 'Although discussions of this issue often frame government intervention as an infringement on free speech, in reality, social media companies currently regulate speech on their platforms without oversight or disclosures of how suspensions are applied.'","Militants use social media to 'impact on how the world perceives ISIS'

"Incredible photographs show a bear cub in Russia struggling to subdue a gigantic salmon. Pictured with the fish in its mouth, the creature was seen thrashing around in an effort to keep the catch under control. Wildlife photographer Sergey Ivanov, 52, spent days photographing the bears hunting at Kuril Lake in Kronotsy Reserve, Russia. Pictured with a fish in its mouth, this bear was seen thrashing around in an effort to keep the catch under control . Wildlife photographer, Sergey Ivanov, 52, spent days photographing the bears hunting at Kuril Lake in Kronotsy Reserve, Russia . Slippery customer: The cub wrestles with the huge fish as a parent stands in the river nearby . Amusingly, the bear's sibling was also seen looking on in awe as the cub wrestled its meal into submission. But although the feisty fish was nearly equal in size to the little cub, the youngster managed to win the battle to bag himself a hearty lunch. After finding a secluded spot near the river, the cub then tried to tuck into its supper in peace but it wasn't long before its brother wondered over to see the impressive catch for himself. Sergey said: 'I'd been watching this bear family for some time and I had spent a few days around them. Amusingly, the bear's sibling was also seen looking on in awe as the cub wrestled its meal into submission . Trying to fin-ish the job: The tiny bear grapples with the fish, which puts up a brave fight as it stands in the shallow water . Ivanov said 'The lakes and rivers here are full of salmon and that's why the bears look so well, they don't even sleep in the winter until late January because they have plenty to eat' Fight on a grand scale: The bear cub just can't seem to get a grip on its prey and looks up anxiously for support . 'I was not really far from them, probably no more than 50 metres and after a few days they get used to your presence and pay you little attention. 'The lakes and rivers here are full of salmon and that's why the bears look so well, they don't even sleep in the winter until late January because they have plenty to eat. 'But considering the fact that the lake is full of fish, I have never seen such a small bear tackle such a big fish.

"Concerns: There is growing evidence of weak benefits along with serious problems with rosuvastatin although it is the best statin for lowering cholesterol, says Dr Sidney Wolfe . A powerful statin carries a high rate of harmful side-effects including an increased risk of diabetes, a leading campaigner warns today. There is growing evidence of weak benefits along with serious problems with rosuvastatin although it is the best statin for lowering cholesterol, says Dr Sidney Wolfe. He is the founder and senior adviser to the US civil rights body Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, which attempted to get the drug banned ten years ago because of muscle and kidney problems. Since then, evidence had continued to mount about the drug’s poor benefits, he claims. British experts have said statins are safe and effective, with protection against heart attacks outweighing possible side-effects. One has reassured patients on rosuvastatin, saying they should continue taking it. Statins are the most commonly prescribed group of drugs in the NHS and given to between eight and ten million adults. They include those with cardiac disease or at risk of a heart attack or stroke. Initial approval of rosuvastatin to prevent heart attacks in a very select group of people was based on a study which was stopped early, says Dr Wolfe. This led to concern that the effects may have been over-estimated, he adds in an editorial in The BMJ medical journal. A review of trials showed that the drug, also known as Crestor, was linked to a 25 per cent extra risk of diabetes compared with a placebo, he says. Crestor was the most prescribed brand name drug in the US last year and accounts for around four per cent of NHS prescriptions for statins. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Patients taking rosuvastatin should not stop taking it. They are on it for a very good reason. Statins are the most commonly prescribed group of drugs in the NHS and given to between eight and ten million adults . ‘This opinion piece raises more questions about pharmaceutical marketing and prescribing practices in the US than the safety and use of statins in general. ‘Rosuvastatin is more expensive than other statins and is one of the least commonly prescribed in the UK. 'It is generally prescribed for a small number of people at high risk of a heart attack or stroke and who cannot tolerate the older statins or have not had the desired reduction in cholesterol levels on them.’ Dr Wolfe adds that worldwide 2013 sales of the medicine were £5.5billion, the third highest for any branded drug. He accuses advertising campaigns of exploiting its potency despite ‘long-standing, continuing evidence of rosuvastatin’s comparative lack of clinical benefits and increasing evidence of risk’. The drug’s patent expires in 2016 and he expresses hope this would lead to a sharp decline in its use. The NHS estimates statins save 7,000 lives a year. A spokesman for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said: ‘They are safe and effective, and play an important role. People should continue to take their medicines as prescribed.’ A senior doctor took a statin for two years despite being at low risk and developed crippling muscle pain. But Dr Kailash Chand, a GP and deputy chairman of the British Medical Association, did not make any link at first. Hospital tests, X-rays and an MRI scan all came back clear. Senior doctor: Dr Kailash Chand, a GP and deputy chairman of the British Medical Association, took a statin for two years despite being at low risk and developed crippling muscle pain . He said: ‘I thought it was worth seeing what would happen if I stopped taking the drug. Within two to three weeks, my back and legs began to feel a lot better and my sleep improved. ‘Statins have an important role for patients who already have heart disease. But we must take much more care about prescribing them to low-risk patients. I was healthy and I became unhealthy.’ London cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra said the side-effects of statins have been downplayed. ‘To think that taking a drug that drastically reduces one’s cholesterol will have no other potential adverse effect is not just lazy medicine, it’s bad science,’ he added.","Rosuvastatin carries a high rate of harmful side-effects, campaigner claims .

"A skier participating in a charity event for Make-A-Wish Foundation in New Hampshire fell 60 feet to his death Monday after losing control on a trail, police said. Samuel Moore, 34, of North Conway, died at about 9.30am at the Wildcat Ski Area in Pinkham Notch, in the White Mountains region, after crashing while skiing near the bottom of the Lower Polecat trail in an area known as 5 Corners. Investigators said Moore fell and tumbled down the trail before the drop. Tragic: Skier Samuel Moore, 34, was killed while taking part in 12th annual 100,000 Vertical Foot Challenge charity event for Make-A-Wish in New Hampshire . Accident: Moore crashed and tumbled down while skiing near the bottom of the Lower Polecat trail in an area known as 5 Corners . State police Det. Belanger Sheldon Belanger said Moore was wearing a helmet when he fell on the trail, which is rated as a beginner slope. Forty skiers were taking part Monday in the 12th annual 100,000 Vertical Foot Challenge charity event for Make-A-Wish. Skiers were to log a total of 48 trail runs to achieve 100,000 vertical feet over the day. 'This is a tragedy to what is traditionally a fun and self-fulfilling challenge for participants and a major fundraising event for Make-A-Wish of New Hampshire,' said Wildcat General Manager Brian Heon. 'My thoughts, and those of Wildcat Mountain and its employees, go out to the family and friends of this man.' The Make-A-Wish Foundation in the state grants 80 to 90 wishes each year for children with life-threatening medical conditions. Safety first: Moore, who was wearing bib No. 28 (right), had a helmet on when he fell on the trail . Adventurer: Besides being a skier, Moore was also an avid camper and mountain biker . Julie Baron, president and CEO of Make-A-Wish New Hampshire, called Moore's death devastating. 'We're all just so deeply saddened by all of today's events,' she said. 'This young man was out there to help kids.' According to his Facebook page, Moore, a 2003 graduate of Alfred University, worked as a ceramic process engineer in his day job. Two days before the fateful ski event, the 34-year-old took to his social media page to thank everyone who has donated money to Make-A-Wish Foundation. 'Thanks for the support and wish me luck on 50 runs top to bottom on Monday. 100,000 vertical for a great cause!' he wrote March 7. Do-gooder: Two days before the fateful ski event, the 34-year-old took to his social media page to thank everyone who has donated money to Make-A-Wish Foundation . A short video posted on Wildcat Ski Resort's Instagram account shows that the 34-year-old participant entered the challenge wearing bib No. 28. Organizers of the fundraiser stopped the ski event after Moore's death. In the past, the 100,000 Vertical Foot Challenge had raised more than $595,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation of New Hampshire. In addition to being a skier, Moore was also an avid mountain biker. He is survived by his parents and cousins.","Samuel Moore, 34, was killed while taking part in 12th annual 100,000 Vertical Foot Challenge charity event for Make-A-Wish .

"It is no secret that woman fake orgasms as Meg Ryan proved in that famous scene of When Harry Met Sally, however just how many of them are faking and their reasons why might surprise you. In a new survey commissioned by Cosmopolitan revealed that 67 per cent of the 2,300 of the women surveyed had faked an orgasm with a partner. The reasons for faking were to spare a partners feelings (28 per cent) but the remainder of women said that it was because they wanted to end the session more quickly (27 per cent). A new survey of 2,300 women has revealed the truth behind their orgasms . The survey also suggests that when it comes to The Big O women's pleasure isn't always a priority. Some 57 per cent of those surveyed said that they orgasmed most or every time they had sex with a partner while 95 per cent believed that their other half orgasm every time they have intercourse. Shockingly 72 per cent of women admitted that their partners have climaxed without helping them to finish despite 78 per cent agreeing that they believed their partner cared about pleasuring them. The survey also explored when women experienced their first orgasm with the majority (27 per cent) claiming it was between the age of 17 and 19 shortly after the age of consent. Women who complained they weren't orgasming with their partner pointed to a number of reasons from being 'almost there' but unable to 'quite get over the edge' (50 per cent) to 'not the right kind' of stimulation from their partner (35 per cent). For 32 per cent, being 'in my own head' or too focused on how they look prevents them from reaching a climax. When it comes to reasons for not quite finishing most agreed they were often close but not close enough . Some 72 per cent of women admitted that they have experienced selfish sex with a partner . However, when asked how they had they experienced their first orgasm most women said it was down to experimenting rather than with the help of a boyfriend/girlfriend. Reasons for a first climax included masturbation, water jets in the bath and accidental stimulation when making contact with furniture. Despite the struggles in climaxing with a partner the survey revealed that almost all women surveyed had experienced an orgasm at one point or another. For 84 per cent of women, they had their first one age between 18 and 24, for 92 per cent, it happened before the age of 29 and 96 per cent of women over the age of 30 had an orgasm. An overwhelming 67 per cent of women admitted to faking an orgasm with reasons being that they wanted to spare a partner's feelings or wanted the sex to end quicker . When it comes to the most efficient way of climaxing it appeared that working alone worked best . The majority of participants experienced their first orgasm between the age of 17-19 . And most of women's first orgasms were down to experimenting alone . Out of 2,300 women surveyed the majority said that they had experienced an orgasm at one point .","A new survey by Cosmopolitan has revealed female orgasm habits .

"Severely disabled Jade Norton, aged 10, from Blackpool in Lancashire, was given the £2,600 BaKare Klearside bed to stop her rolling out at night . The NHS is facing a criminal trial over the death of a severely disabled ten-year-old girl who fell out of a faulty bed and was suffocated by a plastic sheet. Jade Norton, aged 10, from Blackpool in Lancashire, was given the £2,600 BaKare Klearside bed to stop her rolling out at night if she suffered a seizure. She suffered from Rett Syndrome, a rare disorder which impacts on breathing and movement. Just days before her 11th birthday in June 2011 she suffered a fit during the night and fell from the bed because the barrier to stop her falling out was broken and had not been fixed. Her parents claim they put in four requests in with the NHS and their care providers over a six week period asking for the bed to be fixed, but were ignored. They also say the bed was not serviced in four years. Three years after the tragedy health bosses have finally apologised and paid undisclosed compensation as part of a civil case. But yesterday criminal proceedings were launched by the Health and Safety Authority against NHS Litigation Limited and Jade's carers, Interserve Healthcare. Jade's mother Amanda, 42, a support worker said: 'At the end of the day an innocent girl has died. 'She would still be here if it was not for the faults. 'I hope that we get the truth. I know nothing will bring her back but people need to be made more aware of what has happened so it never happens again. Jade pictured with her mother Amanda. She suffered from Rett Syndrome, a rare disorder which only affects girls and impacts on breathing and movement and is usually caused by a spontaneous genetic mutation . 'It is justice for Jade. My little girl has lost her life - I do not want it to happen to anyone again.' Her father Lee, a graphic designer, noticed the bed's barrier was faulty but claims his complaints were ignored. He was the one to find his daughter's lifeless body beneath a plastic sheet on the floor. Just days before her 11th birthday in June 2011 Jade suffered a fit during the night and fell from the bed because the barrier to stop her falling out was broken - she suffocated under a plastic sheet . Mr Norton, 41, said: 'I thought she was asleep - but then I noticed she was blue. I just howled.' Rett syndrome is a rare chromosome condition that only affects girls. The disease usually strikes youngsters when they have learned to walk or talk. Over time the disease drags a girl's progression backwards so they lose their new skills and are left unable to communicate. Most girls with Rett syndrome reach adulthood but lose their motor skills. The syndrome is most often caused by a spontaneous genetic mutation and can occur in any family at any time. It affects around 1 in 12,000 live female births. There is no current treatment for the condition but there are hopes of finding a cure. The condition also affected Coleen Rooney's little sister who died in January 2013. Sufferers can live to their 40s and some have been known to live to their 70s. People do not die of Rett Syndrome but of complications that can appear with it such as epilepsy or pneumonia . See reverserett.org.uk . Mrs Norton added: 'Lee screamed. I started CPR to try to resuscitate her while Lee rang for an ambulance. 'I would hate to go through it again.' Today Mrs Norton demanded justice for her daughter. She said: 'Nothing will bring her back but people need to be made more aware of what has happened so it never happens again.' The NHS faces one allegation of failing in its duty of care to Jade in relation to the supply of a prescription bed at her home. Care provision company Interserve Health Care - formerly known as Advantage Health Care - faces two allegations of exposing Jade to risk through their delivery of nursing and personal care. Jennifer Maloney of Slater Gordon law firm confirmed the civil settlement had been agreed and an apology received by the family. A letter to the family from Richard Jones of NHS England, said: 'I do appreciate that no apology I can make will be adequate in these circumstances, but I am truly sorry.' NHS Litigation Ltd spokesman said: 'Any criminal liabilities of former PCTs were passed to the NHS Litigation Authority by Transfer Orders when PCTs were abolished.' Interserve Healthcare declined to comment. Three years after the tragedy health bosses finally apologised and paid undisclosed compensation .

"Philip Hammond will describe the 'greatest challenge to our collective security for decades' today . Britain faces the ‘greatest challenge’ to national security in decades, the foreign secretary will warn today. Philip Hammond will say evolving threats from a subversive Russia and the spread of Islamic extremism must be stopped before they harm the UK. In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute, the former defence secretary will say no-one can ‘confidently and accurately’ predict the source of the next major threat the UK faces. But intelligence agencies must be able to secretly identify, monitor and act against the range of threats in order to thwart terror plots and uncover clandestine weapons systems under development by the enemy. In a damning assessment of the dangers facing Britain, Mr Hammond will say: ‘…the sheer number and range of cases, old and new, amounts to the greatest challenge to our collective security for decades and places unprecedented demands on those charged with keeping us safe.’ He will say the country is now faced with a Russian leader ‘bent’ on subverting the international rules-based system which keeps the peace between nations. ‘President Putin’s actions… fundamentally undermine the security of sovereign nations in Eastern Europe’, he will say. Britain is being forced to cope with a greater range of threats, from state-sponsored aggression, to international terrorist organisations, to ‘lone wolf’ self-radicalised terrorists with the intent on damaging UK national security. The emergence of groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria and Islamic State in Syria, Iraq and Libya serves to underline the ‘pace’ with which the threats to Britain’s safety and security are ‘evolving’, he will claim. Mr Hammond will throw his weight behind plans for new laws to force internet companies to store email, web and social media records so they can be accessed by the security and intelligence agencies. The former defence secretary will describe Putin's actions as having 'undermined' the security of sovereign nations . He will say: ‘We must respond decisively and positively to the public and parliamentary debate about the powers required by our intelligence agencies to do their job in a changed technological environment – and in doing so draw a line under that debate so that the agencies can get on with the job of keeping this country safe.’ The security services warn that the law is failing to keep up with changing technology so their ability to track terrorists online is constantly diminishing. He will add: ‘As the range of threats gets bigger, so the pace of technological change with which the Agencies must keep up is getting faster, making their central task of keeping us safe ever more demanding.’ He will also speak of 'warped' view human rights activists have taken on the case of jihadi Mohammed Emwazi . The clandestine nature of some of the threats launched against us ‘require that we maintain a highly effective, secret capability to identify, monitor, and act against these threats before they can do us harm’, he will say. These include ‘the weapons systems that are developed in secrecy to threaten our national security.... and the great lengths that individual terrorists or terrorist organisations go to in order to try and keep their plots from being uncovered’. The head of the MI5, Andrew Parker, has warned that ‘if parts of the radar go dark’ and terrorists are beyond the reach of his agency, Britain would be more vulnerable to attack. Tory plans for new laws to require firms to store data on internet communications, so they can be accessed as part of an investigation, were blocked by the Lib Dems who brand them a ‘snoopers’ charter’. But David Cameron has pledged to revive them if this Tories are re-elected. Intelligence gathered by the UK security services has already been instrumental in helping the UK counter the threat from extremists and identifying targets for building effective sanctions against Russia, Mr Hammond will say. He will also use the speech to criticise the ‘warped’ human rights organisation Cage, which sparked outrage after one of its research directors described Mohammed Emwazi as a ‘beautiful young’ man, and praise the ‘dedication’ and ‘brilliance’ of intelligence officers. He is expected to say: ‘The responsibility for acts of terror rests with those who commit them. ‘But a huge burden of responsibility also lies with those who act as apologists for them.’","Former defence secretary to give speech warning of threats against UK .

South Korea's president President Park Geun-hye visited injured U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert on Monday amid an outpouring of public sympathy and support for the envoy who is recovering from an attack by a knife-wielding man . Hospital officials said they expect to release Lippert on Tuesday as he recovers from his injuries . Lippert has been hospitalized since Thursday at Seoul's Severance Hospital, where President Park Geun-hye also received treatment in 2006 when she was knifed by a man with a box cutter during an election rally . Park's office said the president went to the hospital shortly after she returned to South Korea on Monday from a Middle East tour. Park was quoted as saying 'my heart is aching more' because Lippert is hospitalized at the same hospital due to a similar attack. Lippert told Park that he and his wife have been moved by the support the South Korea government and people have showed to him, according to a statement from the presidential Blue House. Conservative activists and Christians have wished Lippert a quick recovery, held pro-U.S. rallies and conducted dance performances near the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. High-level government officials and politicians have visited him, and one well-wishing man even tried to offer dog meat to him. Hospital officials said they expect to release Lippert on Tuesday. 'He has strongly expressed his desire to go back to work,' said Yoon Do-heum, general director of Severance Hospital said. The alleged attacker, known as an anti-U.S. activist who was previously convicted of hurling a piece of concrete at the Japanese ambassador in Seoul in 2010, was arrested Friday.

High-level government officials and politicians have visited him, and one well-wishing man even tried to offer dog meat to him . Kim Ki-jong could face charges including attempted murder. Police said the exact motive for Kim's action was not known but he shouted after the attack that he opposes the ongoing U.S.-South Korea military drills that Pyongyang condemns as a preparation for a northward invasion. Police said Monday that some of the books, computer disks and other materials found at his home support rival North Korea, which could result in charges of violating an anti-Pyongyang security law. Critics want the law abolished, saying past authoritarian rulers have used it to suppress their political opponents. The two Koreas have shared the world's most heavily fortified border since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

"George Osborne announced scrapping income tax paid on interest from regular high street accounts . The Chancellor heralded a savings revolution yesterday by scrapping income tax paid on interest from regular high street accounts. In a major move to counter the effects of years of historically low interest rates, he announced a new personal savings allowance that will make ordinary accounts tax-free for 95 per cent of the population. It means a basic rate taxpayer can earn £1,000 in savings interest without paying tax. A higher rate taxpayer will be able to earn £500. At current rates, a basic rate taxpayer would need to have more than £70,000 in an average account to go over the new £1,000 allowance. By stopping tax on savings the Chancellor has effectively handed a 20 per cent boost to the rates earned by most savers in the UK. The Revenue estimates that the allowance will benefit some 28 million savers. The way savings are taxed is currently riddled with complications. Every year someone can pay in £15,000 to a cash Isa where interest is paid tax-free. But on a standard high street savings account, interest is taxed at the saver’s normal rate of income tax. This tax is automatically deducted by a bank and building society before the interest is paid, and passed directly to HM Revenue & Customs. Higher earners paying 40 per cent or 45 per cent income tax are supposed to declare the interest they receive on a self-assessment form. Lower earners who do not pay income tax can fill in a form to stop the tax being deducted. These deductions mean that someone with £20,000 in a high street savings account paying 2 per cent would earn only £320 a year interest if they were a basic rate taxpayer. A higher rate tax payer would earn £240 and a top rate taxpayer £220. If the interest was untaxed the saver would earn £400. In addition to this, those with total income below £15,600 a year can apply to have their savings interest paid tax-free. Every year thousands of pensioners who can claim tax-free interest on their savings miss out on this perk because they do not realise they qualify. It means a basic rate taxpayer can earn £1,000 in savings interest without paying tax, while a higher rate taxpayer will be able to earn £500 . Figures from HM Revenue & Customs suggest around £1.8billion a year is received a year in savings interest tax. George Osborne said Britain will be back in the black before the end of the decade – as he shot down Labour’s claims that he is taking the country back to the 1930s. The Chancellor outlined plans to bank a surplus of £5.2billion in 2018-19 – the first since 2001 – as he hailed a UK ‘that is growing, creating jobs and paying its way’. He said the national debt will start to fall as a percentage of national income next year, having risen consistently since 2001. ‘Those 13 years amount to the longest year-on-year rise in our national debt since the end of the 17th century,’ he said. ‘Today we bring that record to an end.’ The Chancellor announced that state spending will fall to 36 per cent of national income in 2019-20 – marginally above the 35.9 per cent it reached in 1999-2000. He had previously planned to slash spending to 35.2 per cent of national income – the lowest level since the 1930s. But Mr Osborne said the reality was that the state will now return to a size last seen under the previous Labour government ‘before spending got out of control’. Two years ago, Britain’s building societies called for the Government to scrap all tax on savings to remove this complexity. Yesterday the Chancellor revealed his major overhaul. His introduction of a personal savings allowance means that from April 2016 those who earn below £16,800 a year won’t have to pay any tax on savings interest. Meanwhile, anyone earning below £42,700 – the point at which higher rate tax starts – will be allowed to have £1,000 in savings interest tax free. Those with earnings from £42,701 to £150,000 will have a £500 allowance. Anyone earning more than this, and paying the 45 per cent tax band, has to pay tax on their savings interest. The Buildings Society Association has welcomed the move. A spokesman said: ‘This is great news for savers. We are delighted to get rid of the complicated tax system on savings.’ Anna Bowes, director of analysts Savings Champion, said: ‘It feels like interest rates on savings accounts have been falling for ever, and so this effectively gives them a 20 per cent boost to a basic rate taxpayer. ‘It makes regular savings accounts as competitive as tax-free cash Isas, and the change is likely to force a serious change in the way people save.’ Maike Currie, director at investment firm Fidelity, said: ‘This allowance will eradicate the double taxation most people currently experience, where they pay tax on their wages and tax again on the interest from their savings. However, it does little to deal with the paltry interest rates currently on offer to savers.’ Thumbs up: Ivan and Clair Palmer - with Maxwell, four, and Zachery, two - welcomed the tax-free boost . Ivan Palmer, 36, and his wife, Clair, 41, have more than £45,000 in savings. They described yesterday’s announcement that the first £1,000 in interest on savings will be tax-free from April 2016 as ‘fantastic news’. It means they will keep all of the interest they earn on their savings. Mr Palmer earns £42,000 as a Nottinghamshire teacher, while his wife is a stay-at-home mother. They are keen savers and put a lot of money aside after Mrs Palmer was made redundant from her job, where she earned £75,000. They have £10,000 in a high-rate savings account, £20,000 in a current account and £15,000 in an Isa. They also put £200 per month in a regular saver for their children, four-year-old Maxwell and two-year-old Zachery. Mr Palmer said: ‘This is fantastic news for us. Interest rates are so low that it’s really hard to save money, so any helping hand to make saving more worthwhile is going to be beneficial. ‘We earned £150 on our Isa last year, so for us to see our savings income be protected from tax really gets the thumbs up.’ Flexibility to dip in and out of your Isas . By Victoria Bischoff, Money Mail Reporter . Plans to introduce smart cash machines which allow customers to pay in as well as withdraw cash could lead to bank branch closures, experts warned last night. Budget documents yesterday revealed plans to develop new ATMs that will offer a range of services currently only available inside branches. As well as taking out money and getting balance statements, people will be able to deposit cash and cheques. These machines already exist in many branches to cut down queues, but are only available to customers of that bank. It is thought the new machines could allow customers of any bank to use them. However Derek French, director of the Campaign for Community Banking, said: ‘These will lead to the closure of more branches.’ Last year 479 bank branches shut – more than double the number that closed the year before. Savers will able to dip in and out of their Isa without using up their vital annual allowance, the Chancellor has announced. Currently, everyone can pay £15,000 a year in to an Isa – which is rising to £15,240 from April 6. Isas are hugely popular with savers as they allow them to earn interest without paying tax. Around 10.5 million were opened last year. But at present, once savers have invested their full allowance, that’s it. Should they need to make any emergency withdrawals during the year they are not then allowed to later put any extra cash back in to replenish their account. Many savers find this a huge inconvenience as it means their one-off allowance disappears if they suddenly need to get money out in arush. So the Treasury plans to overhaul the rules in the autumn. From then, savers will be able to pay £15,240 in to an Isa and then, for example, withdraw £2,000. Should they get another £2,000 later in the year they will then be able to put this back in to their account to top up back up to the maximum allowance. It is the latest change to Isas which were given an overhaul at the last Budget. Then the Chancellor increased the annual allowance to £15,000, and said savers would be allowed to move between cash and shares. Investors in stocks and shares Isas will not benefit from the new rule. George Osborne said the Government would offload £11billion of mortgages the State was left holding . The sale of bank assets taken on by the Government during the financial crisis will raise £20billion to pay down the national debt, the Chancellor said. The Treasury plans to sell at least £9billion worth of shares in Lloyds Banking Group in the coming year as it reduces its stake in the bailed-out lender. Mr Osborne said the Government would also offload £11billion of mortgages the State was left holding following the rescue of Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley. ‘The last government put taxpayers’ money into the banks – this government is getting it back,’ he said. Mr Osborne said it would be ‘deeply irresponsible’ to treat the cash as a ‘windfall’ that could be spent ahead of May’s election. He added that it would involve ‘spending money we didn’t really have’ and ‘racking up borrowing our country couldn’t afford’. ‘We’d be repeating all the mistakes the last government made instead of fixing those mistakes,’ he said. Instead the money raised from the sales – as well as savings from lower welfare bills and debt interest payments – will be used to pay down the national debt.","Basic rate taxpayer can earn £1,000 in savings interest without paying tax .

"Planning the perfect road trip isn't just about creating the ultimate playlist and getting a map - what you really need are algorithms. Now the man behind the 'Where's Waldo' algorithm has created a road trip route revealing the best way to visit 48 US states. Using a series of equation, the Michigan data scientist says his method can also be used on shorter journeys, beating Google maps on providing the best route possible. Zoom in on this interactive map to find the best road trip route across the US . Randy Olsen came up with the map when Discovery News challenged him to plot the best route across continental America. His only limitation was to make one stop in all 48 contiguous US states, along with Washington D.C. and two stops in California. Each stop would be at a national natural landmark, national historic site, national park or national monument. And the car could never leave US soil. To create the map, Mr Olsen first found the shortest distance by road between each of the 50 landmarks provided. The tricky part was putting the landmarks in order to eliminate as much driving back on himself as possible. Zoom in on this interactive map to find the best road trip route across Europe . The man behind the 'Where's Waldo' algorithm has created a road trip route revealing the best way to visit 50 US states. The resulting 13,699-mile route would take 9.33 days of non-stop driving if you had the road to yourself . Rather than looking at every possible solution, Randy Olsen used something known as a 'genetic algorithms' which starts with just a few random solutions. It then manipulates these solutions, while trying something slightly different each time, until it finds one that it can't improve on. The resulting 13,699-mile route would take 9.33 days of non-stop driving if you had the road to yourself. In his blog, Mr Olson explains how he used information from Google Maps API and wrote code to discover the optimum distance to drive to all 50 landmarks. This was the same code he had previously created to discover Waldo – or Wally in the UK. 'With 50 landmarks to put in order, we would have to exhaustively evaluate 3 x 1064 possible routes to find the shortest one,' he wrote. 'If you started computing this problem on your home computer right now, you'd find the optimal route in about 9.64 x 1052 years — long after the sun has entered its red giant phase and devoured the Earth.

I'll leave the interpretation of that fact to the reader,' Olson wrote. Olson also created an ideal European road trip and he's released the code so that anyone can create their own route. The European trip covers 16,287 miles and 14 days of driving, and Mr Olsen advises putting three months aside to explore the cities.","Michigan data scientist, Randy Olsen, came up with route using an algorithm that calculates shortest distance .

"Malaysia Airlines has revealed that an expired battery in the beacon of the 'black box' flight data recorder on missing Flight MH370 would have made no difference in the search for the plane. Lawyers acting for some of the families of those on board said earlier that the fact the battery had not been replaced could be key in any legal action against the airline. MH370 vanished shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, bound for Beijing, early on March 8 last year, becoming one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history. Malaysia Airlines has revealed that an expired battery in the beacon of the 'black box' flight data recorder on missing Flight MH370 would have made no difference in the search for the plane . A 584-page interim report into the disappearance of the Boeing 777-200ER, released on Sunday, said the beacon battery for the flight data recorder had expired in December 2012 and was not replaced. The beacon is designed to send a signal if a crash occurs in water. Malaysia Airlines said in a statement on Monday that a similar beacon was also installed with the solid state cockpit voice recorder  and its battery life was still good. Emotional: A Chinese relative of a missing passenger on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 weeps outside the main gate of the Lama Temple  in Beijing today . Sadness: A relative of MH370 passengers holds a sign reading 'Dad I miss U!' outside the Lama Temple today . 'The SSCVR battery would have been transmitting for 30 days upon activation when immersed in water,' MAS said in the statement. U.S. law firm Kreindler & Kreindler LP, which is representing around 20 families, had said the expired battery was 'potentially very significant' in determining compensation if it had hurt the search for the missing plane. The oversight was blamed on a failure to properly update a computer system in the engineering department of Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation said in Sunday's report. The plane, which was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, went missing with 239 people on board on March 8, 2014 - and a huge search in the Indian Ocean has so far proved fruitless. Family: There were 239 people on board the flight when it disappeared  en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . Relatives of MH370 victims: (Clockwise from top left)  Li Jiuying holds a picture of her brother Li Guohai;  Jacquita Gonzales holds a portrait of her husband,  in-flight supervisor Patrick Gomes; Liu Kun displays a photo of his brother Liu Qiang; and Chinese woman Dai Shuqin, who lost five members of her family . Apart from the anomaly of the beacon, the report devoted many of its pages to describe the complete normality of the flight - shedding little light on one of aviation's biggest mysteries. The significance of the expired battery was not immediately apparent, except indicating that searchers would have had lesser chance of locating the plane, even if they were in its vicinity. The report said: 'The sole objective of the investigation is the prevention of future accidents or incidents, and not for the purpose to apportion blame or liability.' Whilst the battery had expired on the beacon of the Flight Data Recorder, the report said that the battery on the locator beacon of the cockpit voice recorder was working. Standing together: Relatives of MH370 passengers attend an event today marking the one-year anniversary of its disappearance in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . Calling for their return: The brother of a missing passenger writes a message during the Kuala Lumpur event . Memories: Two Chinese people hold a picture of their son, an MH370 passenger, during the event in Malaysia . Remembered: Jie Yie, four, holds a picture of her grandmother Lee Sew Chu and her aunt Ng May Li who were aboard MH370, in Kuala Lumpur today . Ordeal: A Chinese relative of a missing passenger on  MH370 cries as she sits on the curb outside the Malaysia Embassy  in Beijing . The two instruments are critical in any crash because they record cockpit conversation and flight data, leading up to the end of the flight. Relatives of passengers and crew today marked the anniversary of the day the plane went missing, under a heavy police presence. Chinese relatives had planned to commemorate the disappearance of the Boeing 777 at a number of sites in Beijing, including the Malaysian embassy, the airport and the Lama Temple, a popular Tibetan Buddhist place of worship and tourist site. Dozens of uniformed security sealed the street around the diplomatic mission, while relatives said they had opted to avoid the airport as police were out in force. The big question: Artist Sudarsan Pattnaik creates a sand sculpture of MH370 on Puri beach in Odisha, India . Writing: A family member of MH370 pens a message on a balloon during a memorial event  in Kuala Lumpur . Tears: Wang Guohui (right), mother of MH370 passenger Li Zhi, cries next to another passenger's relative . Sign: Catherine Gang, whose husband Li Zhi was on the plane, holds a banner outside Lama Temple today . About 30 visited the Lama Temple, with around 10 entering the site in groups of two or three to pay their personal respects, as if attempting to keep a low profile. Flight Captain: Zaharie Ahmad Shah . The physical and mental well-being of Flight Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was examined by the report, which said he had no known history of apathy, anxiety or irritability. 'There were no significant changes in his lifestyle, interpersonal conflict or family stresses,' it said. It also said there were 'no behavioural signs of social isolation, change in habits or interest, self-neglect, drug or alcohol abuse' by the captain, his first officer and the cabin crew. Financial checks also showed nothing abnormal about their gross monthly income and spending pattern. It said the captain held several bank accounts and two national trust funds. He had two houses and three vehicles, but there was no record of him having a life insurance policy. Co-pilot: First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid . The co-pilot, First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, had two saving accounts and a national trust fund account. He owned two cars and 'spent money on the upkeep' of these vehicles. 'He does not have much savings in his bank account. He has a life insurance policy,' it said. The remainder waited outside the temple in a group, wearing T-shirts saying 'Pray for MH370', and waving placards to photographers reading 'Keep searching for MH370'. Meanwhile, Voice 370 - a support group for the relatives - hosted a 'Day of Remembrance' at a shopping centre in Kuala Lumpur with songs, poems and prayers. Grace Subathirai Nathan, whose mother Anne Daisy was on the plane, said: 'It is important to highlight to the public that we still don't have any answers and that we must pursue the search.' The Malaysian prime minister said he still is hopeful the plane will be found. Najib Razak said: 'The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear. 'Together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists. Malaysia remains committed to the search, and hopeful that MH370 will be found.' While the country's government has already formally declared the disappearance of the plane as an accident, and said all those on board are presumed dead, relatives of those on the flight have said they are frustrated by the lack of answers. Ministers from Australia, China and Malaysia are expected to meet next month to decide on the next course of action for the wide-ranging search. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said his government would provide 'all needed service to every next of kin' and help uphold their 'legitimate and lawful rights and interests'. Most of the plane's passengers were Chinese. 'A year has passed, the plane has not been located, but the search effort will continue,' Mr Wang told a news conference in Beijing. 'Today must be a difficult day for the next of kin. Our hearts are with you.' The report by an independent investigation group went into minute details of the crew's lives, including their medical and financial records and their training. It also examined the aircraft's service record, as well as the maintenance schedule, weather, communications systems and other aspects. No way though: A journalist (right) is blocked by Chinese police outside Lama Temple after prayers in Beijing . A relative of a Chinese passenger from MH370 shows a poster saying 'Bring the MH370 passengers home' Moving away: Chinese police block journalists with cameras filming relatives of MH370 passengers in Beijing . Talking: A relative of a Chinese passenger from MH370 speaks to the foreign media outside the Lama Temple . These showed nothing unusual except for the one previously undisclosed fact of the battery's expiry date. It said that according to maintenance records, the battery on the beacon attached to the Flight Data Recorder expired in December 2012. 'There is some extra margin in the design to account for battery life variabilty and ensure that the unit will meet the minimum requirement,' it said. 'However, once beyond the expiry date, the (battery's) effectiveness decreases so it may operate, for a reduced time period until it finally discharges,' the report said. While it is possible the battery will operate past the expiry date, 'it is not guaranteed that it will work or that it would meet the 30-day minimum requirement,' said the report. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing.

"Giant ‘cannibal’ slugs are set to wreak a trail of destruction in gardens across Britain, experts have warned. Two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for Spanish slugs - an horrific, aggressive species which grows up to six inches long - to expand their territory. The species, nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives, was first spotted in this country in 2012. The giant Spanish slug, pictured, was first spotted in the UK in 2012 and is now starting to take hold . Sightings have since been reported in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, London and Hampshire. But this year it is expected to tighten its hold on the country and spread even further. Dr Ian Bedford, the expert who first identified the species three years ago, warned that it is likely to thrive after two very mild winters. ‘If this warm weather continues and we do not have any cold spells before May we could see very high numbers of the Spanish slug this year,’ he said. Dr Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, said the slug - which officially is called Arion vulgaris and originates in southern Europe - cannot survive extreme cold temperatures. Common native slugs, although less aggressive, are much better at surviving cold conditions. Experts say it is too early to know whether common varieties will have a boom year, because the volumes of rain we see this spring and summer will be much more closely tied to their fortunes. The winter of 2012/13 saw several cold snaps, blizzards and frosts, which hit the new population of Spanish slugs hard. But the intervening two winters have been much warmer, particularly in southern England which has barely seen any snow in 24 months. The average temperature in England for December, January and February this year was 4.4C (39.9F), and the year before was even warmer at 5.8C (42.4F). The average English winter temperature is 4.2C (39.6F). Slug expert Dr Ian Bedford, pictured, said Britain was on course for record numbers of Spanish slugs . The slug, pictured, is not able to survive extremely cold winters and frozen conditions . The Spanish slugs, which are thought to have made it to the British mainland on imported vegetables, have been recorded feeding on dead mice, meat and each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets. They also devour garden plants - terrible news for gardeners. Unlike native species, they produce so much slime that birds and hedgehogs tend not to eat them. They also produce twice as many eggs as native slugs, so are more likely to increase their populations and expand their territory quickly. Dr Bedford said: ‘If you spot these in your garden the best way to deal with them is to drown them in a bucket of soapy water, add a bit of household bleach, and then bury the remains 18 inches deep. ‘If they spread it could really affect British farmers. We found in 2012 that farmers were having to replant oil seed rape because of these slugs. ‘If we allowed large numbers to develop in our gardens it will be a problem for commercial growers to control them because they are only allowed to use a certain limit of pesticides each year.’ Anna Platoni, entomologist at the Royal Horticultural Society, said it is too early to tell how much of a problem normal native slugs will be this year. ‘Although native slug damage can be predicted by the temperature and humidity, it is really the conditions over spring and summer that are important, rather than over the winter,’ she said. ‘They tend to overwinter in sheltered spots so are protected from the worst of the weather.’ Sarah Fuller, marketing director at Wyevale Garden Centres added: ‘Slugs and snails are a real problem for gardeners, making this hobby and pastime a true 24-hour activity. ‘Last year gardeners removed up to 4,000 slugs a month. ‘It’s likely more slugs have survived this winter so gardeners will be fighting larger numbers and need to use really effective methods.’","The Spanish giant slugs arrived from the continent during 2012 .

"Killer: Triple killer Ian McLoughlin, pictured, stabbed to death Graham Buck, 66, while allowed out of prison on day release . A triple killer was allowed out on day release, leaving him free to murder a Good Samaritan in a decision today branded a 'catastrophic failure' by the chief inspector of prisons. Ian McLoughlin stabbed to death Graham Buck, 66, while allowed out from HMP Springhill in Buckinghamshire, where he was serving a 25-year jail term for killing two men he believed were paedophiles. McLoughlin had travelled to the home of former prisoner and convicted sex offender Francis Cory-Wright in Hertfordshire in July 2013, and filled a pillowcase with cash and family heirlooms in a robbery. Mr Buck heard his neighbour's screams and went to investigate what was happening, but was dragged inside by McLoughlin, who slashed his throat. In a report drawn up in January last year but made public today, Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, highlighted a catalogue of failings that allowed McLoughlin to be released. He said: 'The decision to release Ian McLoughlin had catastrophic consequences.' In a highly critical report, Mr Hardwick warned that the system for identifying and managing prisoners released on temporary licence (ROTL) are woefully inadequate. The number of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences, which are handed out to the most dangerous convicts, and allowed out on day release has increased from 38,000 to more than 90,000 between 2008 and 2012. But Mr Harding said the systems for managing these offenders in open prisons 'lack clarity and are insufficiently robust'. He added: 'There is a general presumption in favour of granting ROTL. The purpose of individual releases is not clear, and there are insufficient safeguards to manage the risks presented by some higher-risk-of-harm prisoners.' Wanted: Ian McLoughlin  met convicted paedophile Francis Cory-Wright, 88, in prison, and during a subsequent manhunt he was last seen at this hotel CCTV, released by police at the time . Attack: McLoughlin burgled convicted sex offender Francis Cory-Wright and neighbour Graham Buck heard his neighbour's screams and was dragged inside by McLoughlin, who slashed his throat . He said protection arrangements 'are not routinely reviewed when prisoners transfer to open prisons' and 'risk assessment processes are inadequate'. A lack of competence and failures to share information are leading to 'indefensible releases', he added. McLoughlin had a history of violent attacks towards men he suspected of paedophilia and had failed to return to prison after being allowed out on day release before. But despite these warning signs, poor leadership and a failure to properly assess the risk he posed meant officials waved through his day release in July 2013. The convicted killer failed to return to HMP Springhill while released for the day in December 2010. He went out drinking all day and returned to a man's house where he was found by police called out to reports of two men having a row. McLoughlin was arrested, but not charged, for being drunk and disorderly and returned to a closed prison. Yet the following year the Parole Board recommended he was returned to an open prison. Crime scene: McLoughlin killed Mr Buck at the home of Francis Cory-Wright in the Hertfordshire village of Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted. He was on temporary day release from jail at the time of the murder . Mr Hardwick warned that officials had failed to appreciate McLoughlin's dangerous 'pattern of drinking, identifying single male targets who he believed to be paedophiles and/or homosexuals, returning to their houses, getting involved in an altercation and attacking them'. Despite these worrying signs, McLoughlin was sent back to an open prison in March 2013. But his multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) were not properly reviewed on his return, and his new offender manager did not even see him before he was cleared for day release, the report found. Mr Hardwick concluded: 'It was not appropriate to release Mr McLoughlin for the first time since his previous failure in 2011 for such a lengthy, unaccompanied, unstructured and unmonitored ROTL. 'Mr McLoughlin's custodial behaviour was good and the prison had no security intelligence or concerns about his conduct. However, he presented a concerning risk profile. 'He had previously been convicted of manslaughter and had committed at least one murder. He had failed open conditions twice before. This was his first opportunity to be released on temporary licence since his ROTL failure in 2011. The risks he presented on ROTL were not sufficiently assessed or managed.' Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, has been described as ‘astonishingly bright’, with an IQ of 140. Born in Lancashire in 1958, he spent much of his youth in care homes and picked up a string of convictions for petty theft and burglary. By his early 20s he was a drifter, reportedly earning money as a rent boy and sleeping rough when his cash ran out. He briefly married at 25, but his marriage collapsed under the strain of his heavy drinking and his continued involvement in crime and prostitution. In October 1983, he was stopped by police after crashing a stolen car in London while drunk. Kept in a cell to sober up, he demanded to see the custody sergeant and told him: ‘I’ve done a bad thing.’ McLoughlin had killed a gay man, Len Delgatty, smashing his skull seven times with a hammer before strangling him with a towel. At his trial, McLoughlin told the jury that Delgatty, 49, – who had previous convictions for sexually abusing teenage boys – had played him an audio tape describing a graphic sexual fantasy of having under-age sex with a teenage boy. McLoughlin claimed he had ‘panicked’ and repeatedly struck out at Delgatty. He said he had thrown the tape away. The jury convicted him of manslaughter, not murder, and he was sentenced to 13 years, reduced to eight on appeal. He was released in 1989 after serving only five years. Just 17 months later he stabbed gay barman Peter Halls, 55, through the neck at his home in Brighton. In July 1992, he was convicted of murder and given a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 25 years. McLoughlin’s 25-year minimum term would have meant he was eligible for release on licence in 2017 but he was moved to a Category D ‘open resettlement prison’ so he could prepare for life outside. Assault-rifle wielding thug tried a bank raid while on day release... but was taken by a gang of have-a-go-heroes . Today's report also criticised the decision to allow robber Al-Foday Fofanah out on day release from HMP Ford in West Sussex in July 2013. While out he used an assault rifle to hold up a bank in Borough High Street, central London. His raid was foiled when a group of have-a-go-heroes, including an off-duty police officer and an ice cream vendor, intervened. He was jailed for nine and a half years for attempted robbery and other offences. Robbery: Al-Fodday Fofanah brandishes the assault rifle in the Borough Barclays bank branch while out on day release . At the Barclays on July 25 last year, Fofanah joined the queue and waited to be served. He was carrying a large bag and concealed his face with a sheet of paper. Al-Fodday Fofanah was apprehended by a host of have-a-go heroes including an ice cream man and a pair of roofers . The customer in front of him was an off-duty police officer - commander Adrian Hanstock from the Safer Transport Command. When it became his turn to be served, Fofanah pulled a stocking over his face and took an assault rifle from the bag and aimed it at the cashier while demanding money. Fearing for their lives, a number of customers ran out into the street. The cashier dived behind the counter as Fofanah waved the weapon at the other cashiers, again demanding cash. When Fofanah realised no money was forthcoming, he walked out of the bank with the gun in the bag. Mr Hanstock, who had already left the bank, was confronted with the fleeing suspect and he tried to call for police assistance. The commander, along with the bank's assistant manager Dean Smith and Michael Duncan - a trainee ambulance driver - followed the suspect along Borough High Street. Other men joined in and Fofanah was eventually disarmed and held on the ground until police arrived on the scene to arrest him. It turned out that the weapon was a deactivated assault rifle, classified as an imitation firearm.","Ian McLoughlin murdered Graham Buck, 66, while out from HMP Springhill .

"Social media users have labelled a construction sign hanging on a metal fence outside the Melbourne Immigration Museum which read 'Keep Out' as a 'poignant coincidence'. The museum, which documents immigration history and provides educational programs, is currently undergoing repair after damage to it's exterior and had placed metal barricades around it's main entrance with the sign. A photo of the situation was uploaded to social media with the caption, 'It's a small museum, but it really captures the Australian spirit,' sparking a flurry of comments over the situation which was 'thick with irony'.

"An abandoned Ohio mansion that was once the opulent home of heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is being turned into a house of worship after a church splashed out $750,000 for the property. Pastor Nick Dejacimo of The Living Word Sanctuary has revealed that he and his congregation are delighted to have secured the 58-acre property as their new home. He is especially pleased to have purchased the derelict mansion - still dripping with gold and marble - at the knockdown price of $750,000, compared to the $1.3 million pricetag when Tyson sold it in 1999. Scroll down for more . Intimidating: The iron gates at the entrance to the derelict mansion in Southington, Ohio, still bear the name of the former heavyweight champ . Stagnant: The vast indoor swimming pool complex, the same size as many family homes, has also fallen into disrepair. It will now be filled in and become an area for sanctuary . 'The skylights, arches, and windows in the pool area, it literally looks like a church,' said Pastor Nick of his new home . Opulent: Tyson's jacuzzi hot tub features a mirrored ceiling, lashings of black marble and gold plated taps . 'The skylights, arches, and windows in the pool area, it literally looks like a church,' Pastor Nick told TMZ. Before worship can begin, the church is carrying out some rennovations and repairs including turning the former boxing glove-shaped swimming pool into an area for sanctuary. They also plan to renovate part of the land into a workout facility with a jogging path. The church, which only has a congregation of 140, saved nine years worth of tithing donations to pay for their new home. The property was once home to the self-declared 'baddest man on the planet' and the scene of many a wild party, but Pastor Nick says Tyson is welcome to come and join the new owners for worship any time he likes. Tyson lived in the 33,000 sq. ft. home in Southington, Ohio, during the late 1980s and 1990s until his dramatic fall from grace following a conviction for rape and financial problems. Tyson is pictured in 1988 after knocking out British champion Frank Bruno, left, and at the iHeartRadio Music Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, right . Sanctuary: The boxer lived in the property in the late 80s and early 90s until his dramatic fall from grace when he was jailed for rape . The property features five bedrooms, several living spaces, seven and a half bathrooms, a full kitchen, a mini-kitchen/washroom, two attached garages, one external garage, full size pool and Jacuzzi, tiger cages and a basketball court . No expense spared: Another view of the boxer's marble and gold jacuzzi room now falling into disrepair and daubed with graffiti . Featuring gold-plated furnishings, a mirrored ceiling jacuzzi and a swimming pool twice the size of the average family home, Tyson, now 48, used the property as a base while training for fights at Don King's facility 20 miles away in nearby Orwell. And while the iron gates inscribed with his name may now be shut, one photographer Johnny Joo, 24, was allowed inside to explore the property. It features five bedrooms, several living spaces, seven and a half bathrooms, a full kitchen, a mini-kitchen/washroom, two attached garages, one external garage, full size pool and Jacuzzi, tiger cages and a basketball court. Tyson decked out the mansion with crystal chandeliers, a pool larger than most homes, tiger print carpet and everything else necessary to make it his private party pad. But now the property lies eerily quiet with just the shell of what was once home to the youngest boxer to win the WBC, WBA and IBF heavyweight titles at age 20. Photographer Mr Joo, from Cleveland, Ohio, said: 'My journeys have taken me to some strange places but nothing quite like the abandoned home of a former professional boxer.

Playroom: The massive entertainment room features bespoke cabinets for the huge television and sound system speakers the champion boxer had installed . Tyson, now 48, occupied the spacious home in Southington, Ohio, USA, during the late 1980s and 90s while training for fights at Don King's facility 20 miles away in nearby Orwell . 'It felt cold, rather empty and eerie - not so much a creepy eerie but a more interesting one. 'I knew Mike Tyson had once just hung out here and now I stood staring down everything that had been left behind. 'I loved the bathroom simply because of the view and the mirrored ceiling above the Jacuzzi tub. 'But the pool was probably my favourite just because of how incredibly large it was and thinking how vibrant it was at one point in time. 'The room was bigger than three of my houses, it was pretty incredible to look at while standing at one end. Everything was so full of life and now simply collects dust. 'As I wandered the halls and rooms I imagined the wild parties which must have taken place within these walls. 'I looked across a living room once full of life but now empty of parties, tigers and celebrities.' The boxer was taken into custody in 1991 on allegations of rape and in 1992 a jury found him guilty with the ruling committing him to a six year prison sentence with four years of parole.

Tyson decked out the mansion with crystal chandeliers, a pool larger than most homes, tiger print carpet and everything else necessary to make it his private party pad . In 1995 Tyson was granted parole and released from prison, returning to rural Southington in hope of escaping the media which ended up following him. Because of his increasingly desperate financial situation he put the mansion up for sale and sold it in 1999 for $1.3m. It has since had multiple owners - including one who was the subject of an FBI investigation when he tried to sell it. The Living Word Sanctuary bought the property in December 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015, allowing Johnny to explore before the work takes place. He added: 'I've seen a few restorations throughout my work but nothing so contrasting as this. 'But it's definitely one of the more well-preserved structures I have been in through years of exploring and photographing abandoned places. 'It makes a perfect candidate for the church to move into and build their sanctuary. Structurally the home is wonderful and I can't wait to see the restoration completed over time. 'The group would like for Mike to attend the first gathering inside the churches sanctuary. 'I hope to help by sharing this story far and wide, maybe bringing his attention to this matter. It could be quite an experience for him walking through his former home, seeing it brought to a completely different light.'

"She's as well-known for her stunning figure as she is for her chart-topping hits so it's perhaps no surprise that American songstress Taylor Swift is reported to be insuring her legs for a cool £26.5million. Grammy-winning Taylor, 25, attributes a huge slice of her global success to her energetic stage performances and her team have apparently looked into how much it would cost to insure her legs against potential career-threatening accidents. The Pennsylvania-raised star is embarking upon a global tour in May and the move is said to be a precaution against such a physically-demanding schedule. Scroll down for video . Diamonds in those heels: Taylor Swift's super-slim legs have reportedly been insured for a whopping £26.5million ahead of her gruelling world tour which begins in May . Prized assets: Taylor's pins, on display (left) at the Saturday Night Live anniversary special last month, are considered a key part of her high-energy stage performances. Showing them off at a pre-Grammy Gala in LA in February (right) The Blank Space singer is reported to have said she was 'embarrassed' at how much her slender limbs are said to be worth. Celebrity insurers Lloyd's, which has specialised in offering body-part policies since the 1930s, said they were not surprised by the vast sums attributed to Taylor's pins. Underwriter Jonathan Thomas told FEMAIL: 'Taylor Swift’s income-generating capacity is hugely dependent upon her stage presence and thus her exceptional legs are indeed very likely worth millions of dollars of insurance.' She's certainly not the first celebrity to insure herself, however, with a whole host of other stars on record for ensuring their prize assets, which they often consider the key to their success, are protected by policy. Long before Kim Kardashian's derriere arrived on the scene, Jennifer Lopez famously insured her perfectly-round bottom for millions of dollars. Australian singer Kylie Minogue, whose rear grabbed the headlines in gold hotpants in the video for hit single Spinning Around back in 2000 was said to have insured her behind shortly after to the tune of £3million. That booty! J-Lo (left) was the original doyenne of the derriere and is said to have a £17million premium protecting her bottom. Kylie Minogue (right) has a similar policy, worth £3million . Dolly Parton is as well-known for her 40DD chest as she is for her back-catalogue of country music hits and is alleged to have once insured them for £3.8million - or £1.9million each. Bruce Springsteen's relentless live dates contribute hugely to his overall fortune so he needs more than the price of honey and lemon to keep his voice safe - the vocal chords of 'the Boss' are covered for up to £3million. For obvious reasons, sports stars can also have high premiums attached to certain parts of their anatomies. Although it's common practice for football clubs to insure against injury, a career-threatening tackle on a higher-profile star could potentially lose the club millions in sponsorship deals. In 2006, it was revealed that David Beckham had insured his cross-whipping legs against injury for around £100million while playing for Paris Saint-Germain. While in 2013, Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo's club Real Madrid renewed their insurance for his lightning-quick legs at a cost estimated to be around £74million. Legs eleven: When David Beckham was competing at a professional level, his goal-scoring limbs had a whopping £100million price tag on them. The Boss, aka Bruce Springsteen, is so protective of his lucrative voice that he's insured it for £3million . No need for a stuntman: 007 star Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own action scenes in the 2008 Bond film Quantam of Solace...at a cost of £5million in insurance . In 2008, Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own stunts for Bond film Quantam of Solace. 'He does a lot more than Pierce used to do,' said the film's chief stunt coordinator Gary Powell at the time, '...and he's allowed to because he's capable of doing it. He thinks, ""You're paying to see me, and that's me doing it."" He wants the audience to know.' It might have given the film's makers a headache though, for such daredevilry came at an eye-watering insurance price, said to be £5million. A head for business: The Only Way is Essex star Joey said last year that he would insure his perfectly coiffured hair for £1million...shortly after launching his D:Reem range of hair products for Tesco . Good golly, Miss Dolly: Country star Ms Parton has protected her surgically-enhanced bosom for £3.8million while trailing in her wake is reality tv star Holly Madison, who has a similar chest-protecting policy for £66,000 . Million-dollar smile, literally. Film actress Julia Roberts was the subject of an insurance policy that saw her pearly whites covered for just shy of £20million . Becoming savvy about protecting career-boosting parts of the body isn't a new phenomenon. As early as the 1930s celebrities became aware of how much certain bits of them can influence their success. Specialist insurers Lloyd’s say the entertainment industry developing in California in the early 20th century quickly appreciated just how much a film could gross if its central star's appearance was just right. Early film stars such as Cyd Charisse’s (legs) and Jimmy Durante (nose) chose the company to provide them with policies. Present-day clients include  burlesque star Holly Madison’s breasts and NFL player Troy Polamalu’s hair.","The Blank Space singer is said to be 'embarrassed' by hefty insurance sum .

"Jurors were shown pictures of a little boy stuffed in a box to recreate the way six-year-old Etan Patz was allegedly discarded after being choked to death. A boy of Etan's height, weight and age was pictured in court on Friday curled up in a zip-up bag and squeezed into a produce box similar to the one Pedro Hernandez said he used to store the child's corpse in 1979. Etan, who went missing as he walked to school, was never found. He was declared dead in 2001. Horrific: This recreation shows a little boy stuffed inside a bag then a cardboard box. It is allegedly the way Etan Patz's lifeless body was discarded after he was choked to death on the way home from school . Etan (left), whose body was never found, was declared dead in 2001. Pedro Hernandez (right) is the suspect . Defense attorneys, who claim Hernandez's alleged confession is fiction, will begin presenting evidence on Monday in the trial that is expected to last for at least another month. Hernandez, from Maple Shade, New Jersey, told authorities he choked Etan in the basement of a Soho bodega and then put his body in a bag and tossed it in a box. In February, the trial was transformed by the discovery of three boxes of evidence from the investigation, including more than 1,400 pages of information. Alice Fontier, one of the attorneys representing Hernandez, said the findings could mean witnesses will be recalled. 'Given this massive disclosure at this point, in the middle of the trial, there may be issues,' she said. The boxes were found recently at a Harlem police station that covers public housing complexes in the area, prosecutors said late last week. 'Confession': Defense attorneys claim Hernandez's alleged confession (pictured), when he told police he strangled Etan in the basement of a Soho bodega in 1979, was fabricated . Fighting for justice: Here, Etan's father Stanley Patz and his sister Shira Patz are pictured outside court . The location is miles from the precinct near where Etan disappeared on May 25, 1979, as he walked to school. Etan's body has never been found, and he was declared dead in 2001. The boxes contain police records from the investigation, notes from assistant district attorneys who worked on the case and handwritten memos from a detective who investigated longtime suspect Jose Ramos, who was never charged. Some of the information involves two informants who were working with prosecutors to try to link Ramos to Etan's death. Other boxes contain missing-person posters, records of people arrested and catalogs of files made by the original detective on the case. Tragic: This is the missing poster which was made and plastered around New York after Etan's disappearance . Immediately after the discovery in mid-February, Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said that prosecutors were working to turn over the information to the defense attorneys. Outside court, defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said it was unclear what the documents contain but he hopes they won't affect the case and he doesn't want a mistrial. 'We want it resolved for Mr Hernandez,' he said. 'He's been in jail for three years, so we definitely want to continue this case.' Hernandez, a former bodega worker, pleaded not guilty to Etan's murder after telling police he strangled the boy.","Pictures of boy stuffed in a bag then a box shown to court on Friday .

"Spotting a cat dart headlong under a car, he decided to give hot pursuit. But the heat of the chase soon turned into burning embarrassment for this little dog, as he became stuck in the car’s engine. Woody the Bedlington terrier was only discovered when his owner’s neighbour opened the bonnet of his Vauxhall Corsa to find a white furry face looking out from beside the engine. I think I'm stuck: Woody the Bedlington terrier peers out from beside the Vauxhall Corsa's engine . They were eventually forced to call the Plymouth fire brigade to release the three-year-old dog – who was covered in oil but otherwise unhurt after his ordeal last week. His master Mike Tracey, 52, said: ‘My neighbour opened up the bonnet of his car Woody was just sat there looking at me. It was almost like he was saying, “I’m stuck dad”.’ After trying to free him, with the help of fellow residents in Crownhill, Plymouth, the 52-year-old owner was forced to call the fire service for assistance. Free! Plymouth fire brigade released the three-year-old dog . Mr Tracey added: ‘We thought about using a jack to try and get him out but we were worried about something going wrong. ‘I didn’t really want to call the fire brigade and be one of those ‘cat stuck in a tree kind of people’ but they turned up and were absolutely brilliant.’ A crew from Crownhill fire station attended and helped free a bashful Woody by removing one of the leads within the engine, to allow him to be pried out of the top. The three-year-old dog was covered in oil but didn’t sustain any injuries during his mini-ordeal and was right as rain after a good bath. But Woody may need a bit longer to deal with the embarrassment after his unique ordeal. Mr Tracey, who works for an employment centre, added: ‘I think he was feeling a bit sheepish as there was a bit of a crowd to watch the firefighters get him out. ‘Even the firemen said ‘well, this is a new one’ when they turned-up. ‘I plan to go up to the station and say thank you to them because they didn’t take the mick at all and were really good about the whole thing. ‘Woody does seems a bit sulky but I suppose he has been through a lot.’","Woody was only discovered when owner’s neighbour opened car bonnet .

"Iceland is known for its hot springs and Northern lights. But now, researchers have revealed it is also the chlamydia capital of Europe. While the Nordic countries has high rates of the sexually transmitted disease (STD), rates in the US are even more alarming. Since 1980, rates of chlamydia in the US have soared compared to Europe. And while the number of Americans with gonorrhoea has declined since 1980, the figure for the US still eclipses rates of its European counterparts. Washington D.C., shown in the diagrams under its former name of the District of Columbia, had the most syphilis, HIV and gonorrhoea, while Kentucky was the state with the highest rates of hepatitis. Meanwhile,  Estonia tops the European scale for HIV rates, Russia sits in the top five for the most HPV, hepatitis B, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV. Researchers at onlinedoctor.superdrug.com used the latest data from the World Health Organisation and the US' Centres for Disease Centers Control and Prevention (CDC). They plotted maps and graphs of STD rates in Europe and the US, from 1980 to 2013. Here, they reveal the most STD-riddled countries... Researchers found a stark difference between the United States and Europe. Graphs, showing the difference between rates of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and syphilis in Europe (left) and the U.S. (right), show Europe has managed to keep the incidence of STDs relatively low. There was one spike for chlamydia in 2005 and increases in gonorrhoea and syphilis in the mid-1990s. Outside of that, there were no drastic increases in these STDs in Europe. What occurred with STD rates in the United States is more alarming, researchers said. gonorrhoea rates, which were soaring compared to incidences of the disease in Europe, declined drastically in this period. But the gonorrhoea in the US still eclipses rates  of its European counterparts. Worse yet is how much the US’s chlamydia incidence has risen over the same period of time; rates are sky high compared with statistics across the sea. The table shows the top five countries in Europe with the highest rate per STD. Iceland may be known for it's natural beauty, but it also sits No. 1 on the top five for chlamydia, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C infections in Europe. It is also in the top five for HPV.  Russia had the most top five placements on these not-so-flattering charts, showing up in five of the eight lists. Moldova has the most herpes, while the UK tops the HPV chart . The table shows the top 5 US states by STD incidence. The District of Columbia - now known as Washington D.C. -   is the place where HIV, syphilis, and gonorrhoea are diagnosed at the highest rates. Researchers said D.C.’s own health officials have called its HIV rates 'higher than rates in West African nations'. They pointed out the District’s massive rates of HIV and AIDS are linked to delays in treatment after diagnosis, a lack of testing, and misconceptions about susceptibility to HIV/AIDS . The map above highlights which STD had the most new diagnoses annually in a given country, averaged from 2000 to 2013. Certain STDs seem to rule certain regions. For example, among northern European and eastern countries, chlamydia was typically the disease with the most new cases. In Germany and Poland in central Europe, hepatitis C was the most frequently diagnosed STD. In southwest Europe, France, Spain, and Italy, there were more new HIV cases than any other STD. However, looking at rates per individual, new diagnoses of STDs – especially chlamydia – are still far less common in Europe than in the United States . The heat maps above show the changes over time in the  rates of new cases of chlamydia and gonorrhoea per individual across the US. Notably, Washington, D.C., requires its own scale, researchers said, due to its very high rate of STDs. Peak rates of gonorrhoea in the capital were more than three times higher than the peak rate among the other 50 states. The District’s Department of Health acknowledges a struggle of epidemic proportions with chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and other STDs, as well as hepatitis and HIV. The US' Centres for Disease Control has attributed its success – and failure – in combating sexually transmitted diseases to education and access to healthcare.

The winning picture was taken by Maurice Flynn, 46, from Waterford City, Ireland, who used a camera trap and sat up all night waiting for the pine marten to appear. Mr Flynn said: 'The picture I wanted to get was of them jumping or moving through the trees. They never came out in daylight so it had to be done at night.' Wildlife garden expert Kate MacRae, who helped judge the contest, said it was a 'cracking image.' She added: 'Most of us would be thrilled with a static picture of a pine marten, but the technical expertise and dedication to capture a perfectly exposed camera trap image such as this, is impressive. A cracking image that is testament to the dedication of the photographer.'

"India’s groundbreaking Mars Orbiter Mission (Mom) has returned stunning images, revealing an enormous canyon and its moon Phobos  in orbit. The spacecraft itself entered orbit around Mars in September 2014, and has now started returning key data as its mission continues. This included the switching on of a new methane sensor yesterday, which has allowed scientists to measure the amount of radiation on the Martian surface - and could help in the search for life. Scroll down for video . This spectacular image reveals Phobos, one of the two moons orbiting Mars (the other is Deimos), silhouetted against the Martian surface (shown). Although Phobos is the larger of the two moons, it is still only about 14 miles (22km) across, and completes an orbit of Mars once every seven Earth hours. The odd colour of Mars is due to the specific filters used by the camera . The latest images, released by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), include a spectacular 3D view of Arsia Mons, a huge volcano on the surface of Mars that has its peak 10 miles (16km) high. Volcanic despoits can be seen on the flanks of the mountain in the image, which was mapped from an altitude of 6,653 miles (10,707km) and has a resolution of 1,824ft (556 metres) per pixel. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has released amazing images from its Mars Orbiter Mission (Mom). Among them is this 3D view of Arsia Mons, a huge dormant volcano on the surface of the planet. Volcanic deposits can be seen on its flanks . The ISRO's Mars Orbiter Mission (Mom), India's first spacecraft launched to Mars, arrived 23 September 2014 to study the Martian surface and atmosphere and demonstrate technologies needed for interplanetary missions. One of the working group's objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between Nasa's Maven spacecraft and Mom, as well as other current and future Mars missions. The team are also searching for methane on the surface, which could indicate signs of life on the planet. The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (Mola) instrument on the spacecraft was used to help map the topography of the region. An equally spectacular image reveals Phobos, one of the two moons orbiting Mars (the other is Deimos), silhouetted against the Martian surface. Although Phobos is the larger of the two moons, it is still only about 14 miles (22km) across, and completes an orbit of Mars once every seven Earth hours. The images were taken with the Mars Colour Camera (MCC) on the spacecraft, which weighs 2.9lbs (1.3kg) and is used to view the surface of Mars and its moons. In a close-up view of the surface, the MCC captured a shot of the huge Valles Marineris Canyon – which at more than 2,500 miles (4,000km) long is one of the largest canyons in the solar system, covering nearly a fifth the circumference of Mars. The image was taken from an altitude of 15,000 miles (24,000km), with a resolution of about 0.7 miles (1.2km) per pixel. A portion of the canyon known as Eos Chaos was also observed by the spacecraft, revealing fracture patterns in the surface. The images of the surface could help scientists understand the geological processes taking place on Mars at a local scale.

This week also marked the return of results from the Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) payload on the spacecraft, which will detect the presence of methane in the atmosphere. It measured the reflectivity of the Martian surface, to work out how much of the sun’s radiation is reflected back into space by the planet. Officials said they will not release the data until it has been peer-reviewed, though, reported Sen. But it is the hunt for methane that is of particular importance, as it could indicate whether there is life on Mars or not. Dr Syed Maqbool Ahmed, a former scientist on India’s Chandrayaan-1 lunar mission said on his blog that the use of the MSM was important as it proved the instrument worked. ‘This is like scaling Mt. Everest for an instrument specialist like me,’ he said. This image, showing the limb of Mars against the void of space, was taken using the Mars Colour Camera from an altitude of 8,449km .

"More than 200,000 British second home owners are celebrating a decisive victory over French tax laws. The European Court of Justice has ruled that President Hollande's eye-watering charge targeting second homes violated European law, the Telegraph reported. As a result, Britons who have rented out or sold second homes in France over the past three years can look forward to receiving tens of millions of euros in reimbursement from the French government. Victoire: British citizens who own second homes in France, like this attractive stone manoir in Sarlat-la-Caneda, southern France, left, will no longer have to pay the large 'social contribution' charge levied by French President François Hollande, right, and can apply to the French government for a payout . In 2012, François Hollande's Socialist government introduced painful new charges on second home owners, which hit hundreds of thousands of Britons. Tax on rental income from second homes was raised from 20 per cent to 35.5 per cent, while capital gains tax was increased from 19 to 34.5 per cent. A mandatory, 15.5 per cent 'social contribution' was introduced on both capital gains and rental income, raising an additional €250 million a year for the French welfare system. This, the French finance ministry said, would 'remove an unjustified tax advantage' for ex-patriot owners. The measures caused uproar among British owners of French property. It meant they were paying towards a social security system from which they would not benefit, on top of paying towards the welfare state in Britain. Moreover, since the charge was categorised as a 'contribution' rather than a tax, it did not qualify for Britain's double-taxation treaty with France, meaning that British second home owners were effectively being taxed twice. According to calculations by the Telegraph, this meant that a British couple who bought a French home for €200,000 20 years ago and sold it for €750,000 would be forced to pay a painful €60,000 'social contribution' on top of standard capital gains tax, which would not be acknowledged by the UK tax system. But now the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, the EU's highest court, ruled that the 'social contribution' charge violated EU law because it is illegal for EU citizens to contribute towards the social security systems of two member states at once. 'A person exercising an activity in one Member State is only subject to social security regulation of that Member State', said Eleanor Sharpston, the EU's top legal advisor. Experts in French tax law are advising anybody who may be affected by the ruling to submit a claim to the French tax authorities as soon as possible, also demanding a refund of fees charged by tax agents. British couples duped into buying illegal Spanish homes finally have a reason to celebrate after a decade of campaigning led to a change in the law. During the property boom, Britons who dreamed of spending their retirement in sunny Spain forked out their life savings to buy new homes - only to find they had been built illegally and could be demolished and were not guaranteed compensation. But thanks to years of campaigning by heart-broken Spanish homeowners, the law now states homes will not be demolished until they receive a payout. At the beginning of the last decade, new homes were built in abundance in Spain and buyers from northern Europe were keen to snap them up. But thousands had been built without planning permission and property promoters were ordered by the court to demolish the homes at their own expense, despite having already sold them. Although the court would acknowledge the existence of a buyer, there was no guarantee they would receive compensation. On Tuesday, the Senate of Spain made an amendment to the law meaning those who bought their properties in good faith must be compensated before demolition. This is, in part, thanks to determined British expats who have campaigned for change for many years.","In 2012, François Hollande's Socialist government introduced painful new charges on British second home owners .

"'Devastating' head injuries: Austen Harrison, four, had been playing with a heavy fitting-room mirror . Staff at a Hugo Boss store where a four-year-old boy was fatally struck by a falling mirror were warned it was dangerous nine months before, an inquest has heard. Head of shop construction Ben Mareschal told staff at the Bicester outlet village in Oxfordshire the three-way mirror needed to be fitted properly in September 2012. In June 2013, the same mirror toppled over onto Austen Harrison, of Turners Hill, West Sussex, who died in hospital four days later after undergoing an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain. Austen was with his parents, Simon and Irina Harrison, when the incident happened at the Bicester outlet village at around 8.30pm on June 4, 2013. Mrs Harrison and her son met Mr Harrison after he finished work and had dinner at a Carluccio's restaurant before going to the Hugo Boss store. The four-year-old had been playing with the mirror while his father tried on a suit when it fell. An inquest into his death at Oxford Coroner's Court heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall and that its free-standing position meant it could easily overbalance. Mr Mareschal, who has since left Hugo Boss, told the inquest: 'I clearly remember the three-way mirror was in the wrong location, it was not in the fitting area. 'I recall putting my hand on the mirror and I said ""guys, it can't be here, it needs to be fitted properly"". 'It was not attached to the wall and was masking a gap in the wall fittings. I walked to the fitting room and indicated where it needed to go. 'The three-way mirror was certainly not a freestanding mirror and to leave it standing on the floor would have been inherently dangerous due to its size and weight. 'It needed to be fixed securely to the wall.' Mr Mareschal visited the shop just before leaving the company for a new job and sent an email to area manager Matthew Pink, copying in contractors, containing an update on work at the store a month after it opened in August 2012, the inquest in Oxford was told. It said another night of work was needed to install items including a three-way mirror, which meant the wall would have to be reinforced. He said: 'If I had received notification the mirror was not fitted correctly, I would have taken the necessary steps to rectify that. 'I was very shocked to hear about the incident.' Mr Mareschal said Hugo Boss did not cut corners in relation to health and safety but admitted the job was 'low cost and fast paced', taking place at a time when the contractors Pattons were going out of business. Accident scene: An inquest at Oxford Coroner's Court heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall of the Hugo Boss store in Bicester (above) and that its free-standing position meant it could easily overbalance . However, Pattons and Keith Johns, a project manager for Hush Minoan, was brought in to liaise between Pattons and Hugo Boss, both claimed no three way mirror was ever installed. Colin Quinn, from shopfitters Pattons, told the inquest: 'No mirrors were to be installed. The three-way mirror never appeared. At the handover, there was no three-way mirror in the store.' Earlier, Hugo Boss facilities manager Nigel Hobson told the inquest that shop fittings should only be moved around by contractors and not be employees. He said: 'This would have been a shop construction issue.' Meanwhile, manager  Andrew Morgan told the inquest that he checked the fixtures and fittings every day, and that he would have reported any concerns. But he refused to answer questions on whether he documented monthly health and safety inspections. Mr Morgan told the court that neither he nor any of his staff took down the old mirror or installed the new one as it would have needed to be done 'by a professional'. He added: 'I put my trust in the professional person doing that, and to my knowledge it was attached to the wall.' Treatment: Austen was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital (pictured) in Oxford, where he underwent emergency surgery for swelling to his brain, but died four days later . Mr Morgan said the mirror was in a 'very high-traffic' area, used by customers and with access to an upstairs section of the shop and a stock room. But there were no reports of any concerns from customers. He said: 'In the event that there were, I would have addressed and communicated them. I would have had no reason not to.' Mr Morgan told the inquest: 'The fixtures and fittings were checked daily by myself. If there were any concerns they would have been highlighted daily.' And he told the court that two risk assessments were carried out at the shop, one by an external company which told him that 'everything was fine and in working order'. But when asked by Mr Barry whether he had documented the monthly health and safety inspections he was required to carry out, Mr Morgan replied: 'No comment.' Giving evidence: Simon Harrison (left), the boy's father, said the shop was not busy when they arrived and that he tried on a number of suits and jackets. Pictured (right) is a closed sign following the incident . Mr Morgan - who was not working the day of the incident - told the inquest he had watched the CCTV of the incident after Austen was crushed. He revealed: 'He was waving his arms and legs and pulling the wings of the mirror towards him and then the mirror fell on him. 'It was approaching a triangle on the floor. I believe Austen was trying to close the wings around him. It happened very quickly, it was not something that was pleasing to watch.' Earlier, Arif Jarvis, the operations manager in charge of providing cleaners at the store, told the inquest: 'I would come into the store to complete checks and one of them involved running my hand along the top of the mirror to check it had been dusted properly. 'It never moved. I am 99 per cent certain it was fixed to the wall. The mirror is not one that would be suitable to be freestanding on the floor. 'Neither of the cleaners ever raised any concerns about the mirror.' Mr Jarvis told the jury inquest he received a call on June 5, the day after the incident. He said: 'I went to the store and the mirror had been propped up. The wings were not attached and there were shards of glass and a pool of blood. 'I noticed how heavy it was. I was convinced it must have been attached to the wall. It makes no sense for it it to be freestanding on the floor.' Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said: 'The evidence indicates the mirror was not fixed to the wall.' On Monday, Austen's father Simon, of Crawley, West Sussex, relived the moment he heard a 'quick loud sudden bang' and turned around to see the mirror on the floor. An-off duty doctor desperately tried to keep young Austen alive before paramedics arrived. In a statement, he told the inquest: 'I was walking towards my wife Irina to choose a tie and Austen was behind me near the winged mirror. 'I heard a quick loud sudden bang, but no sound of breaking glass. I heard someone gasp and I looked and saw the mirror had fallen over. 'I knew Austen was underneath it as it was not lying flat to the floor.'

"A terrifying anonymous letter telling the founder of a not-for-profit to 'watch your back' also included threats against the woman's daughter, claiming they knew where she went to school. Lordina Jane, President and Founder of Palm Oil Investigations (POI) discovered the harrowing letter on Tuesday, ahead of the release of the POI app on Wednesday evening. The free app - developed by the not-for-profit over the past 12 months - will inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products available on supermarket shelves. 'When I opened that letter I went cold... I took the letter and went straight to the police,' Lorinda told Daily Mail Australia. This anonymous letter was sent to Palm Oil Investigations (POI) President Lorina Jane threatening her, and her daughter and claiming to know where they live . 'It's a really gutless thing to do... The person who sent it has been that gutless they wouldn't put their name to it.' Lorinda is the founder and president of the not-for-profit  which provides information to consumers about products that contain palm oil . Coming from an anonymous source, the letter made claims that should their company feature 'unfavourably' in the new app, 'we will be your worst enemy'. 'We know you are soon to release a phone app about products with palm oil in,' the letter began. 'If our company is listed unfavourably we will be your worst enemy. 'If our listing has a negative effect on our company, we know where you live, we know you have a daughter and we know where she goes to school. You will both need to watch your back,' it continued. 'You have bragged online that your app will be a ‘game changer’, it well may be only not how you expect,' the letter concluded, . Lorinda said in the years since the POI launched their Facebook page - which has over 144,000 'likes' - they have never encouraged any consumers to boycott particular brands, but are about simply providing information. The letter, which was printed and not handwritten, and featured no company markings, is the first of its kind according to the POI founder. Lorinda believes it could have come from a smaller brand they have contacted in the process of putting together their app - which acts as a barcode scanner and puts products into five categories. The threats came a day ahead of the release of the POI app, which aims to inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products they consume . The first category is palm oil free, the second indicates the company has signed on to stop deforestation, the third is palm oil certified - which means they use ethically sourced oil, the fourth is for companies or products which used a mixed supply of certified and uncertified oil, and the final is a fail. A fail means the company have refused to provide details when approached by POI, or that they use uncertified palm oil. 'It is going to make big waves,' Lorinda said, speaking of the app. 'I don’t know what this person or company thinks they’re going to achieve. It's not the correct way to approach us'. 'Whoever it is is worried… in a way that’s a good thing because it shows the app is going to do exactly what it’s meant to,' she continued. In recent years there has been controversy over illegal deforestation in south-east Asia . Animals such as orangutans, tigers and elephants are losing their natural habitats to the deforestation . As a single mother to her young daughter, the POI founder said the letter was frightening, and it was now being investigated by detectives. And she had a message for the anonymous sender: 'If they’re worried, why not send us a letter and say how are our brands sitting in that app … instead of sending something like that'. A controversial ingredient in recent years, palm oil is used in a large amount of products found on supermarket shelves, from foods to beauty and cleaning products. The issue surrounding the resource stems from the illegal deforestation of areas in Borneo and Sumatra, which is having a devastating impact on the animals that call these areas home. Orangutans, tigers, rhinoceroses and elephants are among the native animals which face extinction as more and more land is cleared to harvest the cheap oil. Harvesting the crops from which the oil comes from is not the issue at the centre of the debate, rather the uncertified and dangerous ways the resource is being collected and sold.","A letter was sent to Lorinda Jane threatening her and her daughter .

'Smaller than a candy bar, the Chromebit is a full computer that will be available for less than $100,' Google said. 'By simply plugging this device into any display, you can turn it into a computer. 'It's the perfect upgrade for an existing desktop and will be really useful for schools and businesses.' Google also said it is releasing its cheapest Chromebook laptops yet, two versions priced at $149 aimed at undercutting Microsoft's Windows franchise and gaining ground in even more classrooms. Various PC manufacturers have been working with Google to design lightweight laptops running on the Chrome operating system since 2011. The newest versions are made by Hisense and Haier. Hisense's Chromebook can be ordered beginning Tuesday at Walmart.com and Haier's version can be bought at Amazon.com. Their arrival coincides with Microsoft's rollout of a lower-priced Surface tablet in an effort to reach students and budget-conscious families. Pre-orders for that device began Tuesday, too. As the prices for tablets and smartphones have been declining, it has forced PC makers to lower their prices, said International Data Corp. analyst Jay Chou. The success of the Chromebook line is intensifying the PC pricing pressure. TA $149 Hisense Chrome laptop in San Francisco. Google and Microsoft are releasing cheaper laptops and tablets in an effort to reach students, budget-conscious families and overseas markets. Chromebooks have been steadily gaining in popularity, particularly in schools, as more applications and services made available over Internet connections — a phenomenon known as 'cloud computing' that has reduced the need for hard drives. About 6 million Chromebooks were sold worldwide last year, more than doubling from 2.7 million in 2013, according to IDC. In contrast, sales in the overall PC market slipped 2 percent last year, marking the third consecutive annual decline. IDC is projecting 8 million Chromebooks will be sold this year. 'It has been good news for consumers, but not so good for vendors,' Chou said. The cheaper version of the Surface Pro 3 sells for $499, compared with $799 to $1,949 for the higher-end models. The discounted version has a slightly smaller screen — 10.8 inches rather than 12 — a slower processor, and less flexible kickstand — just three angles rather than unlimited positions. The Chromebook has served a dual purpose for Google. Like the company's Android software for mobile devices, the Chrome system is set up so users will automatically begin using Google's search engine and other services, such as Gmail and YouTube. Google has used the Chromebooks as a prod to bring down the prices of all PCs, something the company wanted to do because it has more opportunities to show the digital ads that bring in most of its revenue when more people can afford to buy an Internet-connected device. This product image provided by Google shows the Haier Chromebook 11, a $149 laptop running on Google's Chrome operating system. Google is releasing two $149 laptops in an effort to undercut Microsoft¿s Windows franchise and drive down already falling personal computer prices. (AP Photo/Google) 'We cannot be happier that Microsoft is helping drive down the prices of PCs,' said Caesar Sengupta, Google's vice president of product management for Chromebooks. 'If Microsoft is reacting to (Chromebook's low prices), that's fantastic. We love it.' Unlike most computers, Chromebooks don't have a hard drive. Instead, they function as terminals dependent on an Internet connection to get most work done. Despite those limitations, Chromebooks have been steadily gaining in popularity, particularly in schools, as more applications and services made available over Internet connections — a phenomenon known as 'cloud computing' that has reduced the need for hard drives.

"A man accused of killing his young wife and dumping her body in a shallow grave 18 years ago has pleaded not guilty in court. Steven Fesus is accused of murdering his wife Jodie Fesus after her body was found near a popular camping spot at Gerroa on the NSW south coast 16 years ago. The security guard was arrested in 2013 over her alleged murder and was arraigned in the NSW Supreme Court on Friday. Steven Fesus walked from NSW Supreme Court on Friday carrying a newborn baby after he pleaded not guilty to killing his wife Jodie in 1997 . Jodie, then 18, was reported missing from the couple's home near Wollongong in August 1997 after recently returning home from their honeymoon. Roughly one month later, her body was uncovered in a shallow grave at Seven Mile Beach after police were tipped off by an anonymous caller. Fesus, who lived in the same suburb with the couple's children for 15 years, denied involvement in Jodie's death and maintained she had disappeared. He was arrested just one week after his teenage daughter Kimberley made a public appeal for information about the suspected murder of her mother. Jodie, then 18, was reported missing from the couple's home near Wollongong in August 1997 after recently returning home from their honeymoon . Kimberley and her brother Dylan were both at court when their father appeared shortly after his arrest. Despite having several requests for bail denied, Fesus was granted bail under NSW's new risk management bail laws last year. Fesus appeared at the NSW Supreme Court on Friday and will go to trial on October 12. It's expected to last eight weeks due to the 'significant' number of witnesses listed. The security guard was arrested in 2013 over her alleged murder after repeatedly denying any involvement in his wife's murder for 15 years .

"If President Barack Obama could start his presidency over, he says he would have made closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba his first order of business. On his second day in office, Obama did sign an executive order seeking that the detention center for terrorism suspects be closed within a year. President Obama made the comment about the prison during a speech to the City Club of Cleveland in Ohio on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama said he should have closed Guantanamo Bay prison on the first day he was in office . On his second day in office, Obama did order the detention center for terrorism suspects be closed within a year . The prison had 242 detainees when Obama began his presidency, but its population has been reduced to 122 . He was responding to a question about what advice he'd give his inexperienced self, according to Politico. He said: 'I think I would've closed Guantanamo on the first day. 'I didn't because at that time we had a bipartisan agreement that it should be closed.' The prison had 242 detainees when Obama began his presidency. According to Obama, the politics around closure grew increasingly tough and 'people got scared by the rhetoric.' Obama made the comment during a speech to the City Club of Cleveland in Ohio on Wednesday. He said Wednesday that 'the path of least resistance was just to leave it open.' He's been able to cut the population down to 122 detainees, but Congress has blocked the closure. Lawmakers have banned the Obama administration from bringing detainees to the United States for imprisonment or trial. In his State of the Union earlier this year, Obama repeated he wanted the facility closed,The Hill reported. He said: 'I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.' Defense Secretary Ash Carter testified before Congress Wednesday that the administration needs to work with lawmakers to find a 'lawful' way to close the prison. The delayed order to shut down the prison isn't the only thing Obama regrets. He also said he would have done something different with his hair if he could do it all again. Obama joked: 'I was thinking maybe I should've told myself to start dying my hair now, before people noticed, because by a year in it was too late. 'Michelle thinks I look distinguished.'","Obama made remark during a speech to the City Club of Cleveland in Ohio .

"The 'house mom' from University of Oklahoma's disgraced Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity said she's 'heartbroken' about being portrayed as a racist after being caught on video chanting the n-word. Beauton Gilbow, 79, released a statement on Tuesday after a Vine video emerged from February 2013. She appeared to be laughing and singing at a party, repeating the 'n-word' seven times on camera. Gilbow said in her statement she was singing along to Trinidad James' All Gold Everything, as Buzzfeed earlier reported. However at no point does the song used the n-word seven times in a row. Her statement read: 'I have been made aware that a video of me that is circulating on social media and in the news. I am heartbroken by the portrayal that I am in some way racist. 'I have friends of all race and do not tolerate any form of discrimination in my life. 'I was singing along to a Trinidad song, but completely understand how the video must appear in the context of the events that occurred this week.' 'House mom' of the SAE frat, Beauton Gilbow, 79, (pictured) was seen in a Vine video, published in 2013, chanting the N-word . The racist video appears to have been taken on a charter bus, with at least one of the chanting young men wearing a tuxedo. The screen shot on the right shows a woman clapping along with the chant . Daily Mail Online was also waiting for comments from the fraternity's national headquarters and the University of Oklahoma. The fraternity was closed by University of Oklahoma on Sunday after footage was posted online of members  chanting the n-word, referencing lynching and indicating that black students would never be admitted to their chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. The video appeared to have been taken on a charter bus, with at least one of the chanting, young men wearing a tuxedo. It's unclear who recorded the video, when it was made and who initially leaked it online. University President David Boren suggested it was likely taken by another student who didn't agree with the racism. OU Unheard, a black student group on campus, posted a link to the video after someone anonymously called it to the group's attention on Sunday afternoon. In an interview on Monday with 9 News, 'frat mom' Gilbow denied every seeing racism at the frat house and said she had never heard the racist song. Her longtime friend and former OU coach Barry Switzer also told the station in an emotional interview that he didn't believe that members of SAE were involved and that the racist chanting was down to a few freshman who didn't live in the house yet. Gilbow lost her job after the frat closed along with the frat's chef, Howard Dixon. A fundraising page for Mr Dixon has raised close to $34,000 as of Tuesday. National leaders of Sigma Alpha Epsilon said late on Sunday that its investigation confirmed members took part in the chant and announced it would close the local chapter. The national group said it was ‘embarrassed’ by the ‘unacceptable and racist’ behavior. Frat 'house mom' Beauton Gilbow appeared in an interview on Tuesday claiming that she had never heard racism in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house . On Monday, University President Boren said he was sickened and couldn't eat or sleep after learning viewing the racist video. Boren said members had until midnight on Tuesday to remove their belongings from the fraternity house. He said the fraternity was ‘not totally forthcoming,’ and he was still trying to find out who was on the bus so the school could consider disciplinary actions. And now a sorority at the beleaguered University of Oklahoma is being investigated over their involvement in the racist incident. In the video, at least one woman can be seen in the back of the bus clapping her hands along with the vile chant. As of Monday night, the woman has not been identified, reported NBC News, but the national office of Delta Delta Delta sorority, also known as Tri Delta, released a statement online saying that it was 'cooperating fully' with the university’s investigation into the matter.

"The oldest known Roman camp has been discovered in Italy's northeastern border, revealing clues to how the ancient civilisation gained its military prowess. Italian scientists say the fort may have been used to fight off pirates 2,000 years ago and possibly paved the way for the modern Italian city of Trieste. Researchers discovered the structure, built in 178 BC, using Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) – a technology which uses pulsed lasers to measure distances to the Earth. Lidar  revealed the oldest known Roman military camp called San Rocco.  Italian scientists say the fort may have been used by to fight off pirates 2,000 years ago, paving the way for what is today the city of Trieste . A scanner was placed aboard a helicopter which then flew over parts of Muggia Bay. A laser then sent out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second. A sensor recorded the light to measure a range, which was combined with position and orientation data from GPS to create a 3D map. The method allows researchers to reveal structures that are hidden beneath trees or that have a form that are not easily recognised in other ways. 'After seeing the image of the first Roman camp, [Federico Bernardini] ran to the site, 30 minutes from our institute, to search for direct evidence,' study co-author Claudio Tuniz, from the Fermi Center in Rome told Live Science. 'After a brief stroll through the site, he found clear signatures of the Roman period.' These included hobnails used to make the military shoes of Roman soldiers and fragments of Roman amphorae, widely used to store oil, wine and other food products. Pictured is a Lidar-derived digital terrain model of the fort. Red represents surviving emerging features. The black circles indicate the main pre-Roman sites of the area . After spotting the site using Lidar, researchers then explored the area on foot to find several Roman artefacts. Pictured is military footwear hobnail from Grociana piccola . Flying above the intended target area, Lidar works by sending out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second. When a laser is pointed at a targeted area on the ground, the beam of light is reflected by the surface it hits. A sensor then records the light to measure a range. When laser ranges are combined with position and orientation data from GPS the result is a dense, detail-rich 3D map. The pulsed light can reveal structures that are hidden beneath trees or that have a form that are not easily recognised in other ways. Lidar mapping was originally used to provide intelligence after earthquakes, military spying and for river erosion detection. Around 32 acres (13 hectares) in size, the structure was defended by fortifications, such as ramparts up to about 80 feet (25 metres) wide. The main fort was on a hilltop 1.2 miles (2km) from the shore of the Bay of Muggia, and was flanked by two minor forts either side. The fort was built in 178 BC, making it several decades older than any other Roman fort ever found. Up until now, the oldest Roman military camps found had been located in Numantia and Pedrosillo in Spain, dating to 154 B.C. and 155 B.C., respectively. The find has excited researchers studying the Roman Empire as the timing of building of the fort coincides with the second Istrian War. The early Romans were keen to protect a settlement called Tergeste - which grew to become Trieste - from the people to the north which the Romans referred to as pirates. The Romans lost the first war, and the building of the fort suggests they were quite serious about winning the second.

The hope is that further study of the fort will offer clues about the very beginnings of the Roman army and how it came to become such a powerful force. Archaeologists also say that further analysis could lead to direct evidence connecting the fort with a fort that mentioned by the Roman historian Livy. Livy reported that the pirates found wine inside the camp and got drunk, and this helped the Romans reconquer the area. Researchers now plan to do full-scale excavations at the site.

"A coronial inquest into the death of two-year-old Darcy Atkinson has heard that the toddler was covered in bruises and had traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system when he died. He was rushed to Gosford Hospital by paramedics before being airlifted to Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital after throwing up three times and going rigid in the bath under his mother's boyfriend Adam Taylor's care. 'We need to call an ambulance because this isn't normal,' Mr Taylor was urged by his flatmate, Nicole Warne, Glebe Coroners Court was told on Monday. Darcy died from brain injuries the next day, December 7, 2012. Darcy Atkinson, two, died of brain injuries in December 2012. He was covered in bruises and had traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system when he died . The boy, described by his father Peter Atkinson as smart and proud, had earlier been paddle boarding with Mr Taylor, the inquest was told. This is despite his mother Tara Rae-Maxwell claiming her son was 'petrified' of water, News Corp reports. He'd experienced difficulty returning to daycare after a week-long holiday and was instead put in Mr Taylor's care after telling his mother Tara Rae-Maxwell he didn't want to go to school. While on the board, Darcy had fallen back and bumped his head, Mr Taylor is alleged to have written in a text to Ms Rae-Maxwell. Mr Taylor then took Darcy to the home he shared with Ms Warne for a swim. The toddler  was rushed to Gosford Hospital by paramedics before being airlifted to Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital (pictured) after throwing up three times and going rigid in the bath under his mother's boyfriend Adam Taylor's care . Darcy seemed fine, Ms Warne told the inquest, but he twice vomited while near the pool. Both adults became concerned when he again threw up, this time an alarming chunky-white mixture. They took Darcy to a bathroom and ran a bath to warm the boy but his body became stiff. 'That's when Adam started to panic,' Ms Warne said. Darcy, she said, was making loud, deep, gargling sounds but couldn't speak. The usually bright and assertive young boy had become lethargic and lost patches of hair in the days before his death, the court heard. When he died he had bruising on his ears, temple and limbs and traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system. The Glebe Coroners Court (pictured) heard that the usually bright and assertive young boy had become lethargic and lost patches of hair in the days before his death . After informing Ms Rae-Maxwell Darcy had bumped his head, Mr Taylor allegedly sent her a photo of the boy. 'Adam sent me pictures all the time of Darcy when he had him,' Ms Rae-Maxwell said. But she repeatedly denied receiving the photo that day and it has never been located by investigators. Deputy State Coroner Hugh Dillon questioned how a mother who posted so many Facebook photos of her son couldn't locate the image. 'I know it sounds ridiculous.

"David Cameron and George Osborne are at war over Treasury plans to order savage new cuts in Britain’s Armed Forces. The dispute, one of the first to erupt between the Downing Street neighbours, has been sparked by fears the Treasury plans to slash another £1billion from the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) budget. The Chancellor is refusing to guarantee to protect the Armed Forces from cuts after the Election, saying it would undermine his attempts to reduce the UK’s debt. The dispute has been sparked by fears the Treasury plans to slash £1billion from the Ministry of Defence’s budget - and Chancellor George Osborne (pictured left) is refusing to guarantee to protect the Armed Forces . But the Prime Minister fears it will damage relations with US President Barack Obama, who urged him last month not to set a bad example to other Nato nations by cutting spending. The row was revealed on the eve of a Tory revolt over defence in the Commons this week. Up to 30 Conservative MPs are thought to be backing a bid by John Baron, MP for Basildon and Billericay, to force a protest vote against defence cuts. It follows controversy over whether Britain will stick to the Nato target of spending two per cent of its gross domestic product on defence. Tory MPs claim that if Mr Osborne gets his way the figure will fall below that level. And The Mail on Sunday has learned that the Prime Minister shares the rebels’ worries. The Prime Minister fears cuts will damage relations with US President Barack Obama (both pictured) ‘The stumbling block is Mr Osborne not Mr Cameron,’ said a senior Conservative. ‘Osborne has made it clear the MoD cannot be exempt from cuts. The PM fears it will expose him at Nato meetings, where he has been urging others to stick to two per cent. ‘He will be called a phoney if he isn’t spending it himself.’ One Tory MP said: ‘Mr Cameron has a natural affinity with the Armed Forces. As PM he is constantly talking to generals and visiting troops all over the world. He knows the importance of maintaining our front line strength with Putin and Islamic State causing havoc. ‘But you rarely see Mr Osborne anywhere near a tank or battlefield. He is interested in money, not military matters.’ Mr Cameron secretly visited the SAS headquarters at Hereford last week and is said to have returned more determined than ever to win his trial of strength with the Chancellor. In a powerful personal plea to Mr Cameron during talks in Washington last month, Obama gave him a blunt warning: maintain UK defence spending or weaken Nato. He said: ‘If Britain doesn’t spend two per cent on defence, then no one in Europe will.’ But military top brass fear the Treasury will raid another £1billion a year from MoD coffers to try to balance the nation’s books. Defence spending in the UK is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020, even without further cuts. But Mr Osborne was defended by one influential Tory who said: ‘We have ring-fenced overseas aid, the NHS and schools. If we do the same with the MoD it will mean even bigger cuts elsewhere, such as the Home Office and policing. The Chancellor has to be fair if we are to get out of the red.’ Spokesmen for Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne said there was no rift. NO WONDER PUTIN FEELS FREE TO BUZZ BRITAIN WITH HIS BOMBERS . by John Baron, ex-soldier, MP and member of Defence Select Committee. At this time of mounting global uncertainty, Britain needs a strong defence to deter potential aggressors. Last week we learned that Raymond Odierno, the top general in the US Army, is ‘very concerned’ by the falling levels of our defence spending – and even suggested that British brigades might have to operate within US divisions on future operations. John Baron believes Britain needs a strong defence to deter potential aggressors . This should certainly make us pause for thought. As a bare minimum, Britain must abide by its Nato commitment to spend two per cent of GDP on defence. We are hovering around this figure and forecasts suggest we will shortly fall below the threshold. This would be a grave mistake. Maintaining a capable military can do much to prevent conflict, as Nato proved throughout the Cold War. Britain needs to remain a global power to protect our strategic interests and support our alliances. We require Armed Forces of sufficient capability and capacity to respond to any challenge – including the ability to act in an independent, sovereign manner. In addition, a successful foreign policy is underpinned by the heft of a strong and well-resourced military. A shrinking defence budget threatens our ability to lead global opinion, reduces our foreign policy options and sends the wrong message to both allies and potential adversaries alike. Yet the Coalition continues to make cuts, as starkly demonstrated by the decision to replace 20,000 Army regulars with 30,000 reservists. The Royal Navy has been reduced to 19 surface ships. The last strategic defence review suggested a minimum of 30. The scrapping of the RAF’s venerable Nimrod means we are without a maritime patrol aircraft. No wonder the Russians feel they have free rein to fly their bombers and position their submarines around our coasts. Westminster is becoming increasingly impatient. On Thursday, MPs from all sides of the Commons will support my debate demanding that the Government should meet Britain’s Nato commitment. The first duty of Government is the defence of the realm. We ignore history at our peril.","Cameron and Osborne at war over new Treasury plans to cut defence .

"Pope Francis has said he has accepted that he may be assassinated- but has asked God to make sure it doesn't hurt too much as he is 'a real wimp'. Francis said that if fanatics want to kill him, it is 'God's will'. He said: 'Life is in God's hands. I have said to the Lord, ""You take care of me. But if it is your will that I die or something happens to me, I ask you only one favour: that it doesn't hurt. Because I am a real wimp when it comes to physical pain.""' Pope Francis has revealed that he accepts he may be assassinated - but has asked God to make sure it does not hurt too much . The pope made the light-hearted comments in an interview with Buenos Aires favela tabloid La Carcova News in which inhabitants of the shantytown Villa La Carcova collectively came up with the questions. The parish priest of the extremely poor area is Jose Maria Di Paola, or Father Pepe, described as 'the spiritual son of Francis'. For months, there have been threats against Pope Francis by the ISIS militants, who call him the 'bearer of false truth.' In January an assassination plot to kill Francis by detonating a bomb in Manila was reportedly thwarted by the Philippines military, although this was denied by the Vatican. Former Special Action Force (SAF) commander Getulio Napeñas testified before the Philippine senate that the Philippines National Police had received information that Southeast Asian Jihadist terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiya, planned to set off a bomb near the papal convoy. Francis (pictured) said that if fanatics want to kill him, it is 'God's will'. he made the comments in an interview with Buenos Aires tabloid La Carcova News . Italian prosecutors have also warned that the Mafia have considered a lethal strike on Francis. Francis also used the unusual interview to address the concerns of the slum dwellers. He condemned drug trafficking saying that there are now countries that are 'slaves to drugs', and where the traffickers are 'triumphant because they feel that they have won'. He also answered the concerns of those that feel that today's children 'often live virtual relationships,' The real 'danger' is that children today have the capacity to gather information, but will be transformed into 'young museums', who do not know what to do with what they know. He said he would visit Argentina in 2016 'in principle'.","Pope Francis says that if fanatics want to kill him them it is 'God's will'

"If you don't possess Piers Morgan's interrogation skills, making someone laugh may encourage them to spill their secrets. Researchers claim that sharing a few chuckles makes people more willing to tell others something personal about themselves, without necessarily being aware that they are doing so. The act of verbally opening up to someone is a crucial building block that helps to form new relationships and intensify social bonds. Laughing with a stranger (illustrated with a stock image) makes us more likely to open up and tell others something personal about ourselves, which encourages bonds of friendship, a new study claims . Such self-disclosure can be of a highly sensitive nature - like sharing one's religious convictions or personal fears - or a superficial scrap of information such as a favourite type of food. Alan Gray of University College London (UCL) set out to investigate the role and influence of laughter in this disclosure process. Together with his colleagues, he observed the behaviour of 112 students from Oxford University, who did not known each other and were divided into groups of four. They watched a 10-minute video together, without chatting to one another. The videos were designed to invoke different amounts of laughter as well as the amount of positive feelings or emotions they elicited. Participants watched different videos including a clip of comedian Michael MacIntyre (pictured) to encourage them to laugh . One, for example, featured a stand-up comedy routine by Michael McIntyre, while another was a golf instruction video and a third, an excerpt from a nature documentary. After the volunteers watched the chosen video, the levels of laughter and their emotional state was measured. Each group member also had to write a message to another participant to help them get to know each other better. The researchers found that participants who had a good laugh together shared significantly more intimate information than the groups who did not watch the comedy routine. Mr Gray suggests this is not merely because it is a positive experience, but because of the physiology behind laughter, which triggers the release of the so-called ‘happy hormone’ endorphin. The findings, published in Springer's journal Human Nature, support the idea that laughter encourages people to make more intimate disclosures to strangers. Scientists believe that the person who disclosed information, was seldom aware of what they had done, and it was only the listener who realised it had happened. ‘This seems to be in line with the notion that laughter is linked specifically to fostering behaviors that encourage relationship development, since observer ratings of disclosure may be more important for relationship development than how much one feels one is disclosing,’ Mr Gray said. ‘These results suggest that laughter should be a serious topic for those interested in the development of social relationships.’ A recent study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a long-term partner. Experts say that a sense of fun is more important to many people than whether someone has a degree or is religious. Research by the University of Zurich revealed that playfulness is important to both sexes – just behind friendliness, intelligence and a sense of humour. Play to win hearts: A new study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a partner (illustrated with a stock image) - just behind friendliness, intelligence and a sense of humour . They also found that naturally playful people deem humour, a laid back attitude and creativity more important in partners than their more serious peers. They described playful adults as those having a love of wordplay who enjoy teasing, people who are spontaneous and will take on a challenge lightheartedly and those who play the fool, for example. Reserachers asked asked 327 young adults from Germany, Switzerland and Austria to examine a list of 16 characteristics and indicate whether or not they found them desirable in a potential long-term partner. The results showed that men and women largely agreed in their orders of preference, although there were differences in individual ratings. For example, women found a sense of humour more important than men and men found an exciting personality more important than women. Friendliness, intelligence, humour and a fun tendency came at the top of the list. Playfulness ranked mid-table, although not all that far behind the favourites. ‘Therefore, this personality trait also seems important for the choice of partner – at least more so that the partner having a degree, good genes or being religious,’ said Dr René Proyer.","Act of verbally opening up to someone helps form friendships .

"An aspiring singer who made it to boot camp on X Factor has become the first short-haired finalist in the Miss England pageant. Jade McQueen bagged first place in her regional competition when she beat off long-locked competitors to take home the title of Miss Surrey. And now the 24-year-old wants to demonstrate to other young women that you don't have to be 'perfect' to win a pageant. Jade McQueen is the first dark-short-haired contestant to earn a place in the Miss England finals . Jade wowed the judges at the regional contest, her first ever pageant, in a dark blue satin dress as a she shared the tale of how she delivered her sister younger sister in her family's front room. Before Jade earned her place in the Miss England final there had only ever been one other shorter-haired competitor, but even she had a traditional look. Jade says: 'There was a short-haired contestant in 2009 with blonde hair but hers was shoulder length and that was considered short. Mine is cropped so is much shorter.' Jade says that for her winning was especially important after the short-haired Miss Jamaica lost out to the long haired Miss Columbia at last year's Miss Universe final. Jade took home the crown at the Miss Surrey finals which was her first ever beauty pageant . Jade wants to demonstrate to other potential contestants that you don't have to conform to win . 'Everyone was so shocked that short hair would get in the way of winning. So I am pleased that more short-haired women are being recognised in beauty pageants now. 'I want to prove that long hair isn't the only beautiful hairstyle.' Jade, who works as a coordinator receptionist has a history of charity work which she says helped her find her way into beauty pageants. 'I'm really into charity work and I wanted to expand that so pageanting was the perfect fit. It was Jade's love of charity work that helped her find her way into pageanting, she now works with Beauty with a Purpose, a Miss World charity . 'It was researching pageanting online that I found Beauty with a Purpose (the Miss World charity) and that's what got me into the pageanting scene.' With her cropped hair and undercut Jade doesn't exactly fit the pageanting stereotype, however Jade says that her alternative looks have helped her secure modelling jobs in the past that led to her success at the Miss Surrey contest. 'I worked as a gothic model when I was younger. You are always offered cash or the pictures from the shoot and I always picked the pictures so that I was able to build up my portfolio.' Jade says that by winning a beauty pageant she hopes to show other women that you don't have to conform to a stereotype to win or even enter a contest. Jade also hopes to further her singing career having appeared on last year's X Factor . 'I want to use the way I look to promote diversity and I want to inspire other girls and show them that you don't have to be stick thin to enter. There are no rules, anyone can enter. I did and I won. 'I believe all women are beautiful in their own way and that they should not feel the need to look the same just to fit in.' Jade added that many young women are unaware that there are no requirements to enter a pageant and she believes that is down to bad stereotypes. 'A lot people think that beauty pageants are old-fashioned because they have this perception of a traditional looking girl, but it's not the pageants that are old-fashioned, it's the public's perception.' Jade's hair helped to set her apart from her more traditional looking competitors but rather than rely on a salon for her perfect crop, Jade looks to her own mother, Sara. 'My mum is the only person allowed to cut my hair I never go to salons. I have had my cropped hair for about six years, and will probably always have it. 'Short hair suits my body and face shape and I will not grow it or put extensions in so that I look the same as other contestants.' When it comes to beauty inspiration Jade looks to fellow short-haired celebrities. 'My idol is Grace Jones I think she shows how glamorous you can be with short hair but I also love Halle Berry. I've always wanted to be in a Bond film so she is a real inspiration.' Jade is certainly ambitious and as well as aiming for gold at the Miss England finals in September the 24-year-old hopes to progress in her singing career having reached the boot camp stages of X Factor last year. 'I never take on a permanent job I only ever do temporary work. I'm a singer and I sing a lot so if a job comes up for me I don't want to be restricted by a full-time job,' she says.","Jade McQueen took home first prize at the Miss Surrey contest .

"A balloon carrying sensors designed to detect the faint traces left by alien life on other planets has been sent on a mission high into the Earth's atmosphere. The Planetary Atmospheres Minor Species Sensor (PAMSS) spent more than an hour at 105,000 feet above the Earth's surface taking measurements before parachuting safely back to the ground. The experimental sensor, developed by researchers at Nasa and the University of Central Florida, was being tested ahead of plans to send the device to other planets. The high altitude balloon above carried the new highly sensitive instrument 19.8 miles into the atmosphere . Capable of detecting traces of gas at parts per trillion - far more sensitive from current technologies - it could reveal the existence of life on other planets. Even low levels of methane on a planet could indicate that there is life there breaking down organic material. The PAMSS sensor is launched into the air beneath a high-altitude balloon from Tucson, Arizona . Professor Robert Peale, a physicist at the University of Central Florida who is leading the project, said: 'Our sensor has the potential to detect specific gases at extremely low concentrations. 'Metabolic byproducts of life include characteristic gases like methane, which on Mars would be a very low concentrations.' Professor Peale and his team launched their sensor, which uses an infrared laser the size of a grain of salt, on a high altitude balloon from Tucson, Arizona, on Sunday. The toaster-sized device uses a technique known as 'intracavity laser absorption spectrometry' to detect small amounts of gas. Most atmospheric probes used to day are unable to measure the concentration of trace vapours or gases. However, Nasa hopes that by using the PAMSS they may be able to detect small amounts of methane on other worlds like Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus. Low levels of methane have already been detected on Mars with hot spots where levels are thought to spike. Scientists now want to explore these more closely in the hope that here may still be life existing somewhere beneath the surface. The test on the balloon was designed to show that the PAMSS could function in the extreme cold and low pressures of near space. In the stratosphere temperatures fall as low as -75°F (-59°C). Scientists claim to have discovered evidence that suggests there may be alien life living high up in our own atmosphere. Researchers from the University of Sheffield and Buckingham University claim to have gathered samples that show microscopic organisms are living 16 miles up in the stratosphere. Using a high-altitude balloon, they gathered samples of dust and other microscopic debris high above the Earth's surface and say they found fragments of single celled algae known as a diatom. They argue that this could be the first evidence to show how life may have arrived on Earth from space, perhaps carried here by meteorites. It is not the first time organisms have been found in the atmosphere and indeed the skies are thought to be teeming with microscopic life. Scientists working with Nasa found 314 different types of bacteria living in the atmosphere up to five miles above the Atlantic Ocean and the US in 2012. They concluded the bacteria, which accounted for 20 per cent of the particles they collected, were carried up into the atmosphere by wind currents. However the team believe the device could also have applications on Earth to help monitor changes in the ozone layer as well as helping to detect traces of gas in breath tests to help diagnose disease. Professor Peale said: 'The flight was very successful. The balloon reached 105,000 ft for over one hour, achieving objectives.'The instrument parachuted safely back to earth and I was able to join the recovery team. 'Our instrument functioned, and a first look at the data show expected types of numbers. It will take a while to analyze all of the data.' The Planetary Atmospheres Minor Species Sensor, shown above sitting on top of laboratory equipment being used to calibrate the device, is about the size of a domestic toaster and can detect minute traces of gases .","Planetary Atmospheres Minor Species Sensor can detect tiny traces of gas .

"Bigger is better when it comes to selling bras because according to new market research, women are more likely to buy lingerie if it's modeled by a plus-size woman over a thin blonde. Adore Me, a rapidly growing lingerie start-up based in New York, has revealed that its television ad featuring a plus size model quadrupled online sales when compared to the brand's commercial starring a group of blondes. 'There's an overall mentality that you have to be super skinny,' the company's founder Morgan Hermand-Waiche told CNN. 'We are showing that we offer lingerie for everyone.' Scroll down for video . Betty versus Veronica: Online retailer Adore Me has revealed that new research shows that its television ad starring a plus size brunette sold more lingerie that its commercial featuring a group of blondes . The three-year-old start-up, which sells its lingerie and swimwear through monthly subscriptions, as well as one-off purchases, used a marketing strategy called A/B testing, in which consumers are shown different ads in order to measure what models, poses and settings increase the retailer's sales. When Adore Me debuted its first national television campaign last January, the company used the  testing method for its three different commercials, which aired on channels such as Bravo, Lifetime and MTV. One television ad featured a cast of all blonde models, another showcased all brunette models and the third starred one plus-size brunette. After the company monitored online traffic and sales throughout the month, they came to the -perhaps surprising conclusion - that the 30-second commercial featuring the dark-haired plus-size model generated four times as many sales than the one featuring the blondes. Making sales: A curvy brunette can be seen modeling a pink lingerie set for one of the brand's commercials . Foolproof method: The company's founder Morgan Hermand-Waiche told CNN's Rachel Crane that he relies on customer research to build his company's website . Even better news for the thriving company is that the plus size clip only cost one-tenth of the other commercials' production expenses to make. The online retailer also learned that its female consumers preferred the commercial that left its models unretouched. Adore Me didn't do any digital retouching to the ad featuring multiple brunette models - and that commercial was the one that was favorited by consumers. A/B testing is an important strategy for the company, which unveils a new collection every month. Blondes don't sell: Last year's research showed that women are far more likely to buy lingerie online if it's modeled on a brunette over a flaxen haired beauty . Coveted curves: This year's data revealed that women prefer model to remain digitally untouched . Last year's marketing research showed that women are far more likely to buy lingerie online if it's modeled on a brunette over a blonde. Keeping that information in mind, the company wasn't surprised when its commercials featuring brunette models fared better than the ones that starred blondes during this year's round of testing. 'At the end of the day... it's [our] customers who choose the model they like [and] the pose they like instead of us imposing on them,' Mr Hermand-Waiche told CNN's Rachel Crane. 'Its really the customer who builds the [Adore Me] website based on what they prefer,' he noted.","Adore Me has revealed that its television ad featuring a plus size model generated more sales than the commercial starring a group of blondes .

"A push for answers on how a New York City police officer avoided criminal charges in the videotaped chokehold death of Eric Garner has stalled because it does not protect grand jury secrecy. New York State Supreme Court Justice William Garnett ruled on Thursday that the grand jury record would remain under seal. He rejected arguments by the New York Civil Liberties Union and others that the public had a right to know why jurors refused to indict the officer in spite of the video. He wrote that the law required the plaintiffs to establish a 'compelling and particularized need' to release the grand jury minutes. Testimony from the grand jury than did not indict the police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner (right, with family) will remain sealed after a decision from New York State Supreme Court Justice William Garnett . Mr Garner was seen saying 'I can't breathe' after being taken to a ground by a policeman on New York's Staten Island borough . The Staten Island judge's ruling cited a handful of rare instances where New York courts authorized disclosure, but only to specific parties for specific reasons — not out of the public interest. For example, a 2012 appeals court ruling authorized release of bank records from a grand jury proceeding to someone seeking a civil judgment against the United Arab Emirates. Another ruling in 1978 turned over witness statements to state police for disciplinary proceedings. A 2001 decision even gave the son of a defendant in a decades-old murder case access to grand jury minutes to use for a movie script. At a hearing in February, Garnett had asked over and over how the Garner grand jury minutes would be used. 'The only answer which the court heard was the possibility of effecting legislative change,' he wrote. However, he said that hopes of legal efforts to combat police brutality or 'journalistic curiousity' were not strong enough to unseal the documents. 'That proffered need is purely speculative and does not satisfy the requirements of the law.' The death of Mr Garner (left poster) and Michael Brown (right poster) and the subsequent non-indictment  of the police officers involved in their deaths sparked a series of protests. Justice Garnett wrote that none of the plaintiffs seeking to unveil the grand jury testimony showed a 'compelling and particularized need' for the information . The effort to make the Garner grand jury record public had been considered a longshot. But the decision comes amid an ongoing debate over whether the laws need revisions promoting more transparency, particularly when it involves police shootings. By preserving secrecy in the Garner case, the court 'has reinforced the distrust many New Yorkers already feel toward the performance of the criminal justice system in this case,' said NYCLU legal director Arthur Eisenberg. Officer Daniel Pantaleo and other officers had stopped Mr Garner on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes last July. A video shot by an onlooker shows Mr Garner telling the officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed. Pantaleo responded by wrapping his arm around Mr Garner's neck in what he said was a sanctioned takedown move and not a banned chokehold. The heavyset Garner, who had asthma, is heard on the tape gasping, 'I can't breathe.' He loses consciousness and died at a hospital. The NYCLU and others had asked the court to order Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan to release the grand jury transcript, including the testimony of Pantaleo, and dozens of witnesses, detailed descriptions of evidence and other documentation. A lawyer for Mr Garner's family said that the secrecy of grand juries was an 'anachronism.' Above, his daughter Erica leads a demonstration in September, when the grand jury decision was announced . A similar step was voluntarily taken by the prosecutor in Ferguson, Missouri, when a grand jury there refused to indict an officer in the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Both Mr Garner and Mr Brown were black; the officers involved are white. The deaths sparked nationwide protests about the treatment of communities of color by law enforcement and a debate about the role of race in policing. Donovan argued that the disclosure would damage the credibility of prosecutors seeking to assure both grand jurors and witnesses that details of their participation would be kept from public view. The judge agreed that the argument 'is particularly cogent in 'high publicity cases' where the witnesses' truthful and accurate testimony is vital.' Garnett wrote: 'It is in such notorious cases that witnesses' cooperation and honesty should be encouraged — not discouraged — for fear of disclosure.' 'If every newsworthy case were deemed compelling and, thus justified disclosure, the veil of grand jury secrecy would be lifted and every citizen's right to have fellow citizens, sitting on a grand jury, check the power of the police and the prosecutor without pressure from outside influences — real or perceived — would be imperiled,' the justice said. Justice Garnett said that secrecy is especially vital in 'high publicity cases'. Above, a memorial to Mr Garner on Staten Island . The decision by the Staten Island grand jurors, he added, 'was theirs alone, after having heard all of the evidence, having been instructed on law and having deliberated. 'Their collective decision should not be impeached by the unbridled speculation that the integrity of this grand jury was impaired in any way.' Jonathan Moore, who represents Garner's family, called the ruling misguided. 'We think this grand jury process was deeply flawed,' he said. 'Secret grand juries are an anachronism,' he added, according to the New York Times. 'The judge has essentially sanctioned the use of a secret trial for a very public matter. If this was a normal grand jury process, they would have had an indictment in five minutes,' he said. Mr Donovan said Thursday his office would respect 'and will adhere to Judge Garnett's well-reasoned decision.' The parties, which also include the Legal Aid Society, the New York City Public Advocate's office, New York Post and the NAACP, are appealing. Parties in the case are appealing the decision of Justice Garnett, though the application itself was considered a longshot .","New York justice said request didn't show 'particularized need' for info .

"A rare pink diamond that surfaced in 2013 to fetch $40million at auction has fueled a feud among relatives of a late Italian senator as his son claims the stone was stolen by a backstabbing step-sibling. Amedeo Angiolillo, who currently lives in New York, filed suit against Christie's on Friday, alleging the auction house had sold off the 300-year-old, 34.65-carat Indian diamond to an anonymous buyer on behalf of someone other than its rightful owner. Named the Princie Diamond, the pink gem 'is one the rarest, perhaps most famous and illustrious pink diamonds in the world,' according to the complaint filed in Manhattan supreme court. Scroll down for video . Rare: The Princie Diamond that surfaced in 2013 to fetch $40million at auction has fueled a feud among relatives of a late Italian senator as his son claims the stone was stolen by a backstabbing step-sibling . According to Christie's website, the diamond received the name after being purchased at auction by jewelers Van Cleef & Arpels, who named it in honor of the 14-year-old Prince of Baroda, son of Maharani Sita Devi. The gem had been passed down through generations of Indian rulers before landing in the possession of Mir Osman Ali Khan of Hyderabad, who eventually sold it through Southeby's. The jewel came into Angiolillo's family's possession when his father, Renato Angiolillo, the founder of Italian newspaper Il Tempo, purchased the stone in 1961, the New York Post reports. Having just wed his second wife, Maria Girani, Renato made a gift of the diamond - one that carried a caveat. Renato's new bride would 'not have unfettered access to' her husband's collection of precious stones, according to the complaint. The arrangement would last up until the newspaper magnate's death in 1973, when Amedeo cut a deal with his step-mother that allowed her to continue wearing the diamond, the lawsuit states. Prized possession: The jewel came into Angiolillo's family's possession when Renato Angiolillo (pictured), the founder of Italian newspaper Il Tempo, purchased the stone in 1961 . High society: Renato Angiolillo (right) had a taste for precious stones, and was reported to have bought the diamond in Paris after losing big at the Monte Carlo casino . The younger Angiolillo agreed to let Girani hold onto the diamond 'because she was quite active and influential in Italian politics and sponsored political, social and business meetings at her home,' a gift Renato bequeathed her in his will. 'Girani had a good relationship with her husband’s children and grandchildren, confirming on several occasions that the gems in her possession, including the Princie Diamond, belonged to them by inheritance, and that they would be returned to them after her death,' according to documents filed. Yet when Girani, too, passed away in 2009 and her husband's heirs came looking for the precious stone, they say it wasn't among her belongings. Pedigree: The Princie Diamond was once owned by a succession of Indian rulers, the last of which was Mir Osman Ali Khan of Hyderabad, who sold it through Southeby's . Girani's son, Marco Bianchi Milella, who had once been friends and even roomed with his step-brother Angiolillo, claimed he never saw the diamond among his mother's possessions, . Yet Christie's later told Angiolillo that Milella told them he was the '100 percent beneficial owner of the Princie Diamond,' according to the lawsuit. However, Christie's anonymous consignor bought the diamond 'in good faith' during a closed-door deal in Switzerland, and the auction house refused to stop any sale, in spite of a lawsuit working its way through the courts of southern Italy, the Daily Beast reported. Police even seized other gems that had once been in Renato's collection at Milella’s home in Monte Carlo, which included a ruby necklace he'd given to his girlfriend, the lawsuit states.. 'New York law provides that once there is a ""thief,"" an involuntary transfer, or if the property is lost in the chain of title, no one can take good title,' the lawsuit argues against Christie's claim that a 'valid title' was provided by a Swiss entity. Angelillo and his nieces and nephews are suing to recover the diamond, which Angelillo claims to have an insurance certificate proving his claim to ownership, along with damages.","Amedeo Angiolillo is suing Christie's auction house in New York to recover the 'Princie Diamond,' a 34.65-carat pink diamond he claims was stolen .

"The number of mortgages being approved to home buyers is increasing as borrowers take advantage of the ultra-low rates on offer, according to a high street banking report. Some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in February with a collective value of £6.2billion, marking a 2 per cent increase on the previous month, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said. While the number of house purchase approvals is still 20 per cent lower than a year ago, early 2015 is seeing a higher demand for mortgages than the levels seen towards the end of last year, the BBA said. Some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in February with a collective value of £6.2billion . Meanwhile, in further signs of growing consumer confidence, the annual growth in people's borrowing on personal loans, overdrafts and credit cards is continuing to increase at its fastest rate since 2008, at 4.4 per cent. The BBA also said that deposit levels with high street banks saw slow growth in February, which could be partly due to the popularity of the Government's recently-launched, market-beating 'pensioner bonds'. Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the BBA, said: 'The increase in mortgage approvals is welcome news and a sign that the housing market is beginning to improve. 'We're seeing stronger demand for mortgages as consumers take advantage of some of the very competitive deals currently available. 'Demand for loans and other types of personal borrowing is rising at its fastest rate since the financial crisis. Consumers are feeling increasingly confident about buying big ticket items, such as cars or home improvements, as the recovery really begins to take hold. The British Bankers' Association (BBA) have said the increase is 'welcome news' 'Personal deposits grew very slowly as alternative savings vehicles remain attractive, particularly the new pensioner bond.' Lending to non-financial companies fell by £200million, with growth in manufacturing, transport, storage and communication offset by net repayments from the construction, accommodation and food services and the wholesale and retail sectors, the BBA said. Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said: 'The recovery in mortgage lending reflects a very favourable economic backdrop. 'Mortgage rates are at record lows, and fewer households now expect a rise in rates within the next year. The reform to stamp duty has also increased most buyers' purchasing power. And that boost to affordability has been accompanied by further improvements in the labour market. 'Real earnings are finally rising, unemployment is falling, and the employment rate has reached record highs. That should all act to boost the mortgage market.' Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the BBA's mortgage figures reinforce his belief 'that the housing market is now gradually turning around after weakening during much of 2014'. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said low mortgage rates are likely to be around for a while yet. He said that with Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation at 0 per cent, a rise in the Bank of England base rate from its current 0.5 per cent level this year is 'highly unlikely and could even have been pushed back for 18 months to two years'. Mr Harris said: ''The good news for borrowers is that rates are likely to be very competitive over (the) coming months.'","Some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in February .

"A supermarket price war has saved shoppers across the high street £400milllion in the last 12 weeks. Prices are down by an average of 1.6per cent on a year ago, fuelling evidence that the Government’s official measures of inflation will show a period of ‘good deflation’. The figures, from retail analysts Kantar, have delivered some positive news to Tesco, where sales were up 1.1per cent, which is its best performance for 18 months. Scroll down for video . Supermarket price wars have driven down the cost of essentials for customers, saving them £400million . Tesco’s revival comes on the back of significant price cuts on household food essentials, coupled with a host of voucher give-aways. Britain’s biggest supermarket, along with Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, have been forced to slash prices to combat the rise of budget chains, Aldi and Lidl. Essentials such as milk, bread, eggs, vegetables and roasting chickens have seen big price cuts since the turn of the year, delivering a real reduction in the cost of putting food on the table. The Kantar figures show Aldi continues to thrive with sales up 19.3per cent on a year ago, giving in a market share of 5per cent, which means it is almost on a par with Waitrose. Sales at Lidl are up by 13.6per cent in a year, giving it a market share of 3.5per cent. Both Aldi and Lidl are thriving by deliberately target middle and higher income shoppers by peppering their aisles with high profile luxury or award winning food and drink. Just last week, Aldi launched packs of two gourmet beef Wagyu burgers at £2.99, which compares to £29 for the price of a similar burger at fashionable restaurants such as the London’s Dorchester Hotel. Kantar’s Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight, said: ‘A combination of lower general inflation and the grocery price war has saved shoppers £400 million in the past 12 weeks, with deflation driven to a record low of -1.6per cent.

Retailers are focusing their efforts on simple price cuts rather than complicated ‘multi-buy’ deals.’ He added: ‘Among the big four supermarkets Tesco has been the standout retailer. It has posted its strongest performance in 18 months with sales up 1.1per cent compared with a difficult 2014.’ Despite this, the firm’s grocery market share continued to fall, going down by 0.1per cent to 28.7per cent. Kantar said Tesco’s return to sales growth came largely at the expense of Asda, where sales over the 12 weeks were down by 2.1per cent - £95m – compared to the same period last year. Sales at Sainsbury’s were down by 0.5per cent, while the figure at Morrisons was 0.4per cent lower. By contrast, Waitrose continues to do well with sales up 4.9per cent on a year ago, giving it a market share of 5.2per cent. However, much of this sales growth has been built on the back of deep price cuts to match the figures charges by the supermarkets, which is hitting its profit margins. For example, Waitrose ran a promotion where it cut the price of its small ‘Essentials’ whole chicken from £4.23 to £2.11 – a saving of 50per cent – making it even cheaper than Aldi and Lidl. The current CPI measure of inflation is running at 0.3per cent. The Bank of England and economists believe it could show a minus figure for March and April, which should feed through to an increase in spending power and living standards. Tesco has recorded its most positive performance in 18 months as it follows the price cuts of Aldi . Negative inflation, or deflation, has not been seen in Britain since March 1960, which was one year before construction started on the Berlin wall and two years before the Beatles released their first single. John F Kennedy did not become president of the USA until one year later, while the British prime minister at the time Harold McMillan was revealing plans to dismantle the Empire by agreeing independence for many former colonies. The Centre for Economics and Business Research said: ‘Unlike in the Eurozone, where there is a risk of a negative spiral of falling prices and weakening economic performance, the UK’s bout of deflation is expected to be short-lived and virtuous, as the declining prices of essentials increase household spending power.’","Supermarket price war has seen cost of milk, bread, eggs and chicken drop .

"Britain will be saddled with a crippling extra £148billion of debt if the SNP wins a share of power, the Treasury warned last night. The official costing of Nicola Sturgeon's plans reveals they involve a massive spending spree that would have to be funded by higher taxes or even higher borrowing. The analysis, conducted by Treasury officials and signed off by the Permanent Secretary, show that spending under the SNP would be £148billion higher than forecast in this month's Budget. It came as Gordon Brown used his valedictory speech in the Commons to warn that the 'fragile' UK is 'potentially at a point of departure' in the wake of last year's referendum on Scottish independence. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond's plans for a deal with Labour could cost Britain £148billion . The Conservatives seized on the Treasury figures as evidence that a Labour government propped up by the SNP would force Britain deeper into the red. A spokesman said taxpayers would be landed with a huge bill if the parties ended up in power. 'It is now impossible for Ed Miliband to become Prime Minister without crawling into Downing Street on the coat tails of the SNP – with Alex Salmond calling the tune,' he said. 'We now know the consequence of that will be £148billion more borrowing, higher taxes, unlimited welfare, and weaker defence.' David Cameron this week branded Ed Miliband (pictured) 'Alex Salmond's poodle' – warning that Labour would be forced to dance to the SNP's tune . Miss Sturgeon, the SNP's leader, has pledged to reverse austerity measures if she wins a share of power in May. While the Conservatives are promising to identify £30billion of spending and welfare cuts, Miss Sturgeon says she would increase real-terms public spending by at least half a per cent a year to allow extra 'investment'. The Treasury analysis suggests this would lead to massive additional spending, adding to Britain's £1.5trillion debt mountain. It suggests the SNP's plans would involve an extra £20.7billion spending next year, an extra £39.7billion in 2017-18, an extra £48.8billion in 2018-19 and an extra £38.3billion in 2019-20. The analysis is a blow to the SNP, whose economic credibility is already under question, but it is also a setback for Labour, which may be forced to do a deal with the nationalists who appear poised to claim dozens of Labour seats at the election. Former SNP leader Mr Salmond, who hopes to return to Westminster as kingmaker, says his party will vote down any attempt by the Tories to run a minority government after the election. Instead, he says his MPs will line up with Labour to put Mr Miliband in Downing Street. David Cameron this week branded Mr Miliband 'Alex Salmond's poodle' – warning that Labour would be forced to dance to the SNP's tune. The SNP's plans were facing fresh scrutiny last night over claims that the party 'fiddled the figures' in order to hide a £4.1billion hole in its bid for Scotland to be handed full economic powers. Labour called for an inquiry into the proposals, amid fears the collapse in the price of oil makes them unsustainable. A study by leading economist Professor Brian Ashcroft and the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, found that the plans now fell more than £4billion short. Labour's deputy leader in Scotland Kezia Dugdale said the report left the SNP's plans 'in tatters'. But Miss Sturgeon dismissed the report, saying that taking full control of economic powers was the only way to 'defend' Scotland from Westminster cuts.","Nicola Sturgeon's plans for deal with Labour could cost Britain £148billion .

"Boris Berezovsky was killed in his bathroom because he was preparing to give Vladimir Putin evidence of a plot involving leading oligarchs to topple the strongman in a coup, it was claimed today. The exiled Russian tycoon was slain by Western secret services linked to the plan to overthrow the Kremlin leader. The theory comes from Berezovsky's former long-time head of security Sergei Sokolov, who disputed the version of British police that the ex-billionaire took his own life, aged 67, in Berkshire in March 2013. Scroll down for video . 'Convinced': Berezovsky's former head of security Sergei Sokolov says he knows his boss did not take his own life - and alleges he was killed by Western secret services over evidence of a plot to overthrow Putin . 'I am convinced it was done by the Western secret services,' he said. 'If Berezovsky's death is a puzzle for you, it is a problem solved for me. Boris was killed simply because he possessed certain secret information and was going to make it public. This is not just my guess, I know it for sure.' Sokolov, the head of a major Moscow private security agency, said his ex-boss was intent on returning to Russia, and had opened negotiations with Putin on allowing him back despite years of bitter opposition to the president. 'Boris forwarded Vladimir Putin a letter with repentance,' he said. Deceased: Boris Berezovsky, left, was found dead at his ex-wife's home in Berkshire in March 2013. An outspoken critic of Putin, he is said to have sent the Kremlin leader a 'letter of repentance' and was planning his return to Russia . 'It was a part of the big venture he had been planning. Berezovsky was living and looking forward to his return to Russia. Of course, he was hoping for indulgence. 'Boris was killed only because he possessed information which he was going to share with Putin. 'I am absolutely sure that Boris had video and audio evidence about certain oligarchs who offered to organise a coup in the country, promising him to be seen as being at the head of the attack. 'Berezovsky planned to come back to his motherland with this sensational material. 'You understand it now: those people he had gathered compromising materials for, considered him to be a serious threat.' Berezovsky - who had a penchant for secretly recording conversations - had hidden his treasure trove, claimed Sokolov. Allegations: The explosive theory was made by Sergei Sokolov, who claimed his former boss had gathered 'compromising material' as part of his plan to return to Russia . 'Western secret services are still chasing it. Boris was not a predictable guy, who would keep precious information under the pillow in his house.' He claimed that Berezovsky had inside information from MI6 about Russia. 'I knew that Boris was in close relations with MI6, Mossad and the CIA,' he claimed. But 'when he became dangerous for their recruited residents such as Russian politicians and oligarchs, the Western secret services decided to get rid of him.' He alleged: 'Berezovsky's murder was prepared for several months. It was a brilliant operation by the secret services. 'You decide: Berezovsky had a house .... round the clock security, CCTV cameras around the house. A fly would not make it. 'And on the day of his death all the security guards vanished, CCTV cameras were switched off for some reason, although they are placed every 100 metres. 'It is likely that not only MI6 took part in this operation but also CIA. There were people around Boris who were recruited by these secret services, including some of his guards.' His personal guard and driver Avi Navam would later find his body in the locked bathroom. He also disputed claims that Berezovsky was impoverished and depressed when he died having lost all his money, following a bitter £3 billion high court battle against Roman Abramovich. Death: Berezovsky was found dead at his ex-wife's home, pictured, in Berkshire in March 2013. 'Let me assure you, Boris was not a poor man. There were rumours after his death that he did not have money for a plane ticket. This is just lie. At the moment of his death he had about $1 billion dollars in his bank accounts. 'One should agree, it is possible to enjoy your life with this money. Yes, he could not afford yachts like Abramovich but, gently speaking, he was not poor.' He also had a string of young lovers, he claimed. 'I knew Boris very well. He was a man with solid mental health. He was full of adrenalin - it was obvious he was about to start a new venture.' 'Not a poor man':  Berezovsky owed the taxman £46 million when he died, but Sokolov claimed he had about $1 billion in his bank account . Sokolov also claimed that in the 1990s, Berezovsky had ordered him to follow Boris Nemtsov, the Russian opposition leader killed in Moscow on 27 February. He admitted to a Moscow newspaper that he had installed listening equipment in the politician's flat during the Yeltsin era. 'Berezovsky ordered us to follow Nemtsov,' he said. 'We tried to understand what he was interested in, and if he can tell the truth - we followed his movements plus installed recording equipment in his flat. 'Some part of compromising materials Berezovsky showed to Boris Yeltsin, something used for other purposes.' 'Every oligarch or official has a weak side,' he said. 'The best agent is the person who is next to you but you hardly notice him - either a secretary or a driver. It was easy to recruit women.' He told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: 'Nemtsov collected beautiful women. 'When young guys were going out with girl, he was studying, and then he got to the top of this life. And started to compensate it. This where his interest in young women was coming from.' He claimed that Nemtsov could have been killed by a jealous husband. 'But first of all, Western secret services are the beneficiaries of Nemtsov's death.' 'From the point of view how it was planned, it is very much like CIA operation,' he claimed. Despite this, Russian police have identified a Chechen link to the murder. 'It was a simple murder - go up the steps, shoot, jump into a car... and the killers, it does not matter who they are - Ukrainian or Chechen,' said Sokolov. Negotiation: Berezovksy had opened talks with Putin about allowing him to come out of exile and return to Russia . A coroner last year recorded an open verdict at Berezovsky's inquest. Mr Berezovsky, 67, was found with a ligature around his neck. Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford said that 'contradictory' evidence meant he could not prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the businessman either took his own life or was unlawfully killed. Sokolov was head of the Atoll security agency, and worked with Berezovsky from 1994 to 1999. The security specialist has changed his mind on the tycoon's death which he originally saw as suicide. Soon after his body was found, Sokolov said: 'Berezovsky was not a threat to anybody and nobody really needed him. 'His death was quite natural. He did not like sports, he did not care a lot about his health...It is a case like Whitney Houston.'","Sergei Sokolov says he doesn't believe Russian tycoon took his own life .

"Tory peer Karren Brady has ruled out replacing Lord Sugar on the Apprentice – but hinted she could make a run to be London Mayor. The West Ham chairman, who was elevated to the House of Lords by David Cameron last year, said she had 'no desire to do television' and would walk away from the hit BBC show whenever Lord Sugar leaves. Baroness Brady said she was 'looking to do less television and more House of Lords – not the other way around'. Tory peer Karen Brady has ruled out replacing Lord Sugar on the Apprentice – but hinted she could make a run to be London Mayor . The celebrity businesswoman, who has been made the government's Small Business Ambassador, said she would consider running for London Mayor once West Ham had moved into their new stadium at the Olympic Park. She told House magazine: 'I always say 'never say never'. If you'd asked me five years ago, would I be here in the House of Lords, I would have probably said 'No'. 'There are certain things you know as you get older you definitely don't want to do, like more television. But there are some things that you become more open to.' She added: 'I spend a lot of time talking to Boris about it. I think Boris has been a fantastic Mayor. I think whoever does that job, it's the one job in politics that I think is very meaningful, that is like the CEO of a company. 'There are issues that need resolving and there's a lot of campaigning that needs to be done to promote London around the world.' Asked if she also had ambitions to replace her friend Lord Sugar when he retires from The Apprentice, she replied: 'No… I have no desire to do television, I do it because I like Alan and we have a lot of fun together, and it's a really interesting show. 'But when he leaves, I leave. I'm looking to do less television and more House of Lords, not the other way around.' Karren Brady, Lord Sugar and Nick Hewer are the stars of the hit TV show The Apprentice. Baroness Brady said she would leave the show when Lord Sugar stepped down . Asked if she will be known on the show as Baroness Brady or Lady Brady: 'I have no idea, I haven't even thought about it!' She added: 'Alan is a friend, first and foremeost. And as he said friendship first, politics second. 'I was really pleased to have him with me on the day, we've been very close, we've known each other for 20 years, and of course other than doing the show we share a common interest in football. He said 'friendship first, politics second' and I said 'football third!' She said the pair were 'like-minded on many things', but added: 'Obviously he supports Tottenham, I support West Ham, he's on the Labour side and I'm on the Conservative side, but friendship is important to us.' Baroness Brady, who revealed that her first job paid just £8,000, laid into Ed Miliband – claiming the Labour leader, unlike Lord Sugar, 'doesn't understand business'. She said: 'I think there's a real danger. Labour has shifted so to the Left that I think most businesspeople are very concerned about what will happen to their business and their growth if there's a Labour government. 'He doesn't understand business. He's never worked in business.

"A tap that sends the water flowing through it into a swirling vortex pattern could help reduce the amount of water used by households. The designer of the Swirl tap claims the hollow vortex of water created by the faucet can save around 15 per cent more water than standard taps. He claims that it is also more comfortable to use as the water does not pour out in a solid jet. The Swirl tap sends water from the tap in a symmetrical design that apparently saves 15 per cent more water . Simin Qiu, a student at the London Royal College of Art, said he hoped the design might become popular in hotels and homes. He said: 'It's a very simple design. I've used two turbines to create the effect, with one making the water flow clockwise and the other anticlockwise. 'The spiral is an organic shape water takes in nature and I wanted to recreate that. 'It is more comfortable on people's hands because it's not flowing in a solid line. My design changes the angle the water hits your hands at and it's smoother.' Mr Qiu is curerntly testing a prototype of his tap, which took him two months to design. It uses turbines that spin in opposite directions inside the valve at the mouth of the tap to send thin streams of water spiralling down into the sink. The Swirl tap uses two turbines inside the faucet (left) to send the water into a spiral. The graphic on the right shows how the turbines fit together with push value to provide a spinning vortex of water onto the users hands . The tap works by pressing a single button on top, allowing water at a preset temperature to flow out of the tap . The tap is operated by touching a switch on the top. Mr Qiu says the desing allows water to come out at the same pressure as a standard faucet but uses less water. However, the temperature from the tap has to be preset so that the water coming out will always be the right temperature. Mr Qui added: 'I hope it will be ready by the end of the year. 'It will be more expensive than ordinary taps, it's not something that will be in every home. 'It's a luxury product that will probably be in hotels and limited use in homes by next year.' Designer Simin Qiu envisages his tap being used in hotels and luxury homes but it could find wider uses as the swirling pattern it produces in the flow can help to reduce the amount of water used when washing hands .","Swirl tap was designed by art student Simin Qiu at the Royal College of Art .

"The tiny Tasmanian town of Ross may only have 272 residents, but more than 50 Japanese tourists rush to their bakery every single day. Incredibly, the Ross Village Inn Bakery in rural Tasmania is a favourite tourist destination for anime enthusiasts has an uncanny resemblance to the setting in a beloved cult film. Fans of 1989 anime film 'Kiki's Delivery Service' flock to the bakery, astounded by the likeliness that the café, established in 1860, bears to 'Gütiokipänja Bakery, the famous fictional setting in the film. The urban myth claims that the animators of the film visited the tiny town and drew their inspiration from the bakery, recreating it in their animated movie as the home and workplace of their heroine, 13-year-old Kiki.

'We don't know if this is true. What do you believe?' However, the animators of the film reportedly insist they have never been to Tasmania, meaning the near-perfect resemblance between the two bakeries may just be an incredible coincidence. Ross bakery co-owner Carl Crosby says the attention is staggering and persistent. Business is booming, a wonderful feat considering the bakery is located in a small town in the centre of Tasmania with a population of less than 300.

As the bakery's popularity grew, the owners decided to make the most of the opportunity and makeover the attic bedroom in the building. To the delight of fans, the tiny bedroom has been converted into a replica of Kiki's bedroom, which was also located above the bakery in the film. 'My partner's mum put it together a few years ago just because there was so many people coming and asking, 'where's the room?',' Mr Crosby told ABC.

Business is very strong, especially considering they live in such a small town in the centre of Tasmania with a population of less than 300 . Many of the fans who are interested in 'cosplay' even arrive in a 'Kiki' costume, eager to hire the room for $85 a night and pretend they are their favourite character for a day. 'Some of them will come in their little costumes, with their bow in their hair and their little red shoes, and they want to stand in front of the oven and take a multitude of pictures,' Mr Crosby told news.com.au. The room even provides a 'TV/VCR to watch Kiki videos'.

"Robert Durst's family is so scared of the suspected-murderer that they have taken out a restraining order against him, even though he is currently behind bars without bail. A New Orleans judge has approved an order of protection, preventing Durst from contacting his brother Douglas, head of family business Durst Corp, and other members of Douglas' family. The former real estate heir was arrested this week on charges related to the murder of his long-time friend Susan Berman, who was killed execution-style in 2000. Prosecutors have charged Durst with capital murder, making him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Scroll down for video . Robert Durst's (left, in mugshot taken Saturday) family has taken out a restraining order against him, in the wake of his recent arrest on murder charges. Durst's brother Douglas pictured on the right in November 2014. In the state of California, murder convicts can only be eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without parole if prosecutors prove that the murder was carried out with a 'special circumstance'. In Durst's case, the alleged special circumstances include killing a witness and lying in wait. Last year, California's death penalty was deemed unconstitutional, but the state will likely appeal the decision. The last time a California death row inmate was executed was in 2006. Durst, 71, was recently the center of HBO documentary The Jinx, and in the final episode which aired Sunday, appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off. But Los Angeles Police say his Saturday arrest has nothing to do with the recording. The latest protective order prohibits Durst from communicating with brother Douglas, his wife Susanne, their children Helena and Alexander, as well as their respective spouses and children. According to documents obtained by TMZ, Durst must stay away from their offices and homes - something he has had difficulty doing in the past. Durst was the recent subject of HBO documentary The Jinx. In the final episode, which aired Sunday, he appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off. LAPD say his arrest on Saturday has nothing to do with the show . In April 2013, Durst was arrested for lurking outside of his brother's house. The Jinx follows Durst's long fued with his younger brother Douglas, who father Seymour named head of the multi-billion-dollar family corporation. In the wake of Durst's arrest, Douglas issued a statement on behalf of the family which reads: 'We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.' In addition to the death of Susan Berman, Durst has been linked to the disappearance of his wife Kathleen in 1982, and the homicide of his elderly neighbor Morris Black. Durst was acquitted of Black's murder after claiming he killed and then dismembered the neighbor out of self defense. He is currently being held without bond since he is considered a flight risk. Authorities are currently in the process of extraditing Durst from New Orleans to Los Angeles where the most recent charges were filed.","The restraining order prohibits Durst from contacting brother Douglas, and other members of Douglas' family .

"Leanne Wood, the leader of Plaid Cymru, said she would refuse to be part of a formal coalition with a Labour Party committed to implementing austerity and replacing Trident . The leader of the Welsh nationalists has vowed never to help prop up the Conservatives in the event of a hung parliament - but could work with the SNP to drag a Labour government to the left. Leanne Wood, the leader of Plaid Cymru, said she would refuse to be part of a formal coalition with a Labour Party committed to implementing austerity and replacing Trident. But she said the election was 'an unprecedented opportunity' to force the next Government to give Wales  as much public spending per head of population as Scotland. The intervention echoes demands made by Alex Salmond’s SNP that the Scottish nationalists will not support Ed Miliband as Prime Minister unless he agrees to ‘end austerity’. Although Miss Wood is largely unknown outside of Wales, this is set to change on Thursday night when she takes part in an unprecedented seven-way leaders debate. Launching her party’s manifesto in Bangor, she said the election offers voters in Wales an ‘unprecedented’ opportunity to influence the direction of government policy if Plaid Cymru holds the balance of power. Miss Wood said Plaid was aiming to use any influence it gains to rebalance power and wealth away from the City of London and towards Welsh communities. ‘This election provides Wales with an unprecedented opportunity,’ she told supporters. ‘There will in all likelihood be another hung parliament after May and the direction of the next government could come down to how strong a presence of Plaid Cymru MPs there are in parliament. ‘If Plaid Cymru holds the balance of power, we will use that to rebalance power and wealth throughout the UK, away from the financial sector in the City of London and to those communities in Wales that need the investment.’ Asked earlier about her party's positioning in the event of a hung parliament, Ms Wood told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that it would work with the Greens and the Scottish National Party if it was ‘in our interests’. She said: ‘We've said we'll work and co-operate with the Greens in England and the SNP if the numbers – of course we've got to have an election and it's a matter for the people to decide - but depending on the numbers, if it's in our interests to work with those other parties to secure the very best deal for Wales, then we will. It may be that it's in our interests to work separately.’ She added: ‘There's no way that we could support the Tories in government, absolutely not. Wales has never given a mandate for the Tories to rule over us and it's highly unlikely that they will next time.’ Miss Wood (left), Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the Green Party leader Natalie Bennett (right) could unite after the election to keep David Cameron out of Downing Street . Plaid Cymru, she said, had ‘no appetite’ to see Tory policies implemented by Labour, adding: ‘So while we won't prop up a Tory government, we won't back a Labour government to implement austerity and Trident replacement either. ‘We would not be part of a formal coalition with a Labour government prepared to renew Trident. There is no way that Plaid Cymru MPs will ever vote to support the replacement of a system which would cost £100 billion and which no government would ever realistically use.’ She said Plaid Cymru has a ‘very close’ relationship with the SNP, is in regular contact and has a lot of common ground. She added: ‘It makes sense for both our parties to continue working together.’ Miss Wood added: ‘We want to end austerity, we want to bring an end to this Conservative Government and we want a better funding deal for Wales.’ Party leaders, she added, ‘see no reason’ why Wales should not be treated equally with Scotland and Plaid is the only party in Wales seeking to achieve parity with Scotland. She said Wales ‘risks being overlooked again’ unless there is a strong team of Plaid Cymru MPs whose chief priority would be Wales and securing the best deal on powers and resources.","Plaid leader Leanne Wood said she would refuse a formal coalition .

A neighbor called 911, prompting the emergency services to tell residents to stay inside. One person who was caught up in the swarm was reportedly stung eight times. In Utah, 1,000 bees terrorized baseball fans on Saturday. One man was said to have been stung between 200 and 300 times and is now recovering in hospital. Several other people were treated for stings at the scene. Lone Peak High School baseball coach Matt Bezzant told The Spectrum newspaper of St. George that the bees came from a dugout and players were chased by as many as 70 bees at one point. Fire crews doused the dugout area with a chemical foam to combat the bees. Reaction: Vargas said it was initially painful, but now sees the funny side of it .

"A  man wanted by police made a couple of critical mistakes that led to his capture - he sent out Snapchat messages pinpointing his location. The Somerset County Sheriff's Office had been looking for Christopher Wallace, of Fairfield, Maine for several weeks in connection with a burglary in January. Police told the Morning Sentinel that on Sunday night they received tips from people who said Wallace, 24, had posted on Snapchat that he had returned to his Fairfield home. Snapped up: Wanted man Christopher Wallace was caught by police on Sunday at his home in Maine after posting messages on Snapchat which pinpointed his location . The Somerset County Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook on Monday: 'Over the past few weeks, since our press release looking for the public's assistance in locating him, Mr Wallace had become cocky. Which led to his downfall. This is where our story picks up. 'Using the Snapchat app, Wallace posted that he was at his house in Fairfield, which prompted people to call the Sheriff's Office.' Erika Hall, 20, was also arrested for hindering the police search for Wallace . Police went to the house. While they were searching with permission of the resident, they were tipped off that Wallace had posted a new Snapchat message saying police were in the house looking for him and he was hiding in a cabinet. Police wrote: 'A search of the kitchen cabinets turned up some food, some pots and pans, and also a pair of feet. 'The pair of feet just so happened to be attached to a person, and that person was Christopher Wallace. The police added: 'He was removed from the cabinet, and placed under arrest. All of that, brings me to the moral of the story. Always remain humble, my friends.' Erika Hall, 20, was also arrested for hindering apprehension. The sheriff's office wrote on Facebook: 'Let's put it this way, when the police ask you multiple times if someone is in the house, and you answer repeatedly that they are not in the house, and that you have not seen said person in ''weeks'', you're just going to get arrested. That's how it happens.'","The Somerset County Sheriff's Office had been looking for Christopher Wallace, of Fairfield, Maine in connection with a burglary in January .

"A dog walker who spent two years thinking he owned a £100,000 piece of rare whale vomit has discovered the pungent rock is actually worthless. Ken Wilman thought he had found 'floating gold' when he stumbled across what he believed was a 3kg lump of the highly sought-after ambergris on the beach in Morecambe, Lancashire. But his dream of netting a small fortune has now been shattered after an expert in the U.S revealed the 'stone' is not authentic ambergris - and has absolutely no value. Scroll down for video . Ken Wilman, 52, thought he had discovered a £100,000 piece of rare whale vomit when he found this yellow-grey rock washed up on the beach in Morecambe, Lancashire, while working his dog Madge . An expert in the U.S believes that the pungent  rock has absolutely no value and is not authentic ambergris . Ambergris, or 'grey amber', is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem. The substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water, where it hardens and develops into a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell. It is this aromatic quality which makes it is used in perfumes such as Chanel Number 5. Mr Wilman said: 'If I had my time over again, I would kick the rock to one side and walk away. I wish I'd never found it. I've got to accept what happened and get on with it.' The 52-year-old was walking his boxer dog Madge along the beach in January 2013 when he stumbled across what he believed to be the rare item. The highly sought-after Ambergris, or 'grey amber', is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem (file picture) Ambergris is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem. The substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water, where it hardens and develops its distinctive odour. The decades of floating and exposure to sun and salt will then turn the matter into ambergris, a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell. It is that quality which means it is highly sought-after with perfume makers, who use it to prolong the scent of perfume. Although ambergris is still an ingredient in perfumes today, producers usually remove it from their product because of the legal ambiguities surrounding its use. As it comes from sperm whale, which is classed as a vulnerable species, cosmetic companies tend to shun using it because it is associated with whaling. But the sweet-smelling sick has been used in a variety of other ways throughout history. Ancient Egyptians reportedly found a use for it by burning ambergris as incense. The country still uses it today for scenting cigarettes. During the Black Death in Europe, worried people also thought they could thwart the plague by carrying a ball of ambergris because the vomit masked the smell, which they thought was the root of the illness. It is rarely found on British beaches, usually being washed up in America and Australia. A French dealer offered him 50,000 Euros if it turned out to be real, while some experts said it could be worth double that quote. But the true value of the stone was discovered when documentary maker Peregrine Andrews -- who produced a Radio 4 show called Ken, Madge and the Strange Rock following the find - sent a sample to an expert across the Atlantic. Christopher Kemp, an American author who wrote a book about ambergris, then broke the news that it was definitely not whale vomit. To add to Mr Wilman's heartbreak, his beloved dog has also passed away since he made the discovery. Mr Andrews said: 'He (Christopher Kemp) emailed me back and said it's definitely not ambergris, although he didn't know what it was. 'Then I had a text from Ken telling me Madge had died. He was in complete shock and then I had to tell him it wasn't real ambergris.' Mr Andrews has since contacted a dealer in New Zealand who has promised to send Mr Wilman a 2g piece of real ambergris. Although it is virtually worthless, Mr Wilman is delighted at the gesture. He said: 'When Peregrine told me, I nearly broke down. I cant believe there are nice people in the world, like this lady, who feels sorry for me and wants to send me a piece of ambergris. 'I've kept a level head about things and I'm trying to find humour in the situation.' Although it is rarely found on British beaches, eight-year-old Charlie Naysmith discovered a 600g piece after taking a stroll along Hengistbury Head, near Bournemouth in 2012. Beachcombers Sean Kane and, 24, and Ian Foster, 39, also discovered a 110lb of whale vomit washed up on the beach in Criccieth, North Wales, in 2008. In 2006 a couple walking on an Australian beach found a 32-pound chunk of ambergris, which netted them $295,000 (£155,000).","Ken Wilman found yellow-grey rock while on the beach with his dog Madge .

"New research funded by farmers aims to breed a wheat variety for people who can't eat the  grain, an endeavor that comes as wider consumer interest in gluten-free foods is booming. The Kansas Wheat Commission is spending $200,000 for the first two years of the project, which is meant to identify everything in wheat's DNA sequences that can trigger a reaction in people suffering from celiac disease. The disease is an autoimmune disorder in which eating even tiny amounts of gluten - made up of numerous, complex proteins that gives dough its elasticity and some flavor to baked goods - can damage the small intestine. Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry, said funding research to breed gluten-free wheat is 'the right thing to do' The only known treatment known is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley. Though celiac disease is four-to-five times more common now than 50 years ago, only about one per cent of the world's population is believed to suffer from it, and just a fraction have been diagnosed. But the gluten-free food business has skyrocketed in the last five years, driven in part by non-celiac sufferers who are either intolerant to gluten or following a gluten-free fad diet because they believe it may help them lose weight or that it's somehow healthier. Sales of gluten-free snacks, crackers, pasta, bread and other products reached $973million in the United States in 2014, up from $810million the previous year, according to a January report by consumer research firm Packaged Facts. The research analyzed the sales of hundreds of explicitly labeled and marketed gluten-free products and brands at supermarkets, drugstores, and mass merchandisers. Supporters of the Kansas research, though, say this isn't a way to regain market share. Miller shows a flour solution from a specific strain of wheat at a research facility in the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. The only known treatment for celiac desiseas is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley . The research for gluten-free wheat began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. It is still in its early stages and researchers are looking at proteins inside the grain . 'If you know you are producing a crop that is not tolerated well by people, then it's the right thing to do,' according to the project's lead researcher, Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry. Gluten-free foods are a niche product, and in the broader context of the world's wheat markets, it is not a driving factor, according to Dan O'Brien, extension grain market specialist at Kansas State University. 'I anticipate it will develop as a specialty market,' Miller said.The research, which began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas, is still in its early stages, with researchers extracting proteins from seeds of various varieties of wheat. Miller has yet to begin work combining the proteins with antibodies produced by the human immune system to test for reactions. He also plans to examine the wild relatives of wheat as well as modern varieties, and will tap into a Kansas wheat variety repository that dates back to the 1900s in hopes of finding a variety - perhaps one that fell out of favor among commercial farmers - that might already be low in reactivity for celiac sufferers. Researchers hope to use that variety to develop a gluten-free wheat using traditional breeding methods. Miller's methodology might be 'too simplistic an approach' that wouldn't identify all the toxic sequences that trigger a celiac reaction, according to Armin Alaedini, assistant professor of medical sciences at Columbia University and a researcher at the New York-based school's Celiac Disease Center. Miller (pictured) plans to look at wild relatives of wheat as well as modern grains. Researchers hope to use these varieties and traditional breeding methods to develop a gluten-free wheat . Alaedini, after looking at Miller's plan online, said the project may end up with a less toxic wheat product that isn't completely safe for all celiac disease patients. 'After all this effort, this product that is coming out... is unlikely to be superior in terms of nutritional value or baking properties and taste to the gluten-free products that are already on the market,' Alaedini said. The medical advisory board for the Celiac Disease Foundation, a nonprofit based in Woodland Hills, California, could not reach a consensus on the viability of Miller's research. But the organization's CEO, Marilyn Geller, is encouraged. Her son had been sick his entire life before being diagnosed with celiac disease at age 15, Geller said, and his father also was later diagnosed. Since the disorder is genetic, her grandchildren will be at risk of getting it. The more the disease is in the public eye, the more physicians are aware of it, she said, and it'll be more likely the federal government would fund research. 'I am certain that there are a large number of people with celiac disease who (like) the idea of being able to eat actual wheat, with the properties of wheat that make the bread nice and fluffy,' she said. 'The idea of having a variety of wheat that they could eat that has those wonderful wheat-like properties would certainly be very interesting for them.'

"A BBC boss has insulted nearly half the country by dismissing them using marketing jargon. Creative director Alan Yentob was trying to rebut the allegation that the corporation caters only for the ‘metropolitan elite’. The executive, who earns around £330,000 a year, insisted that the BBC appeals to all sorts of audiences because it airs programmes that ‘reach out to… C2s [and] DEs’. Scroll down for video . BBC creative director Alan Yentob has been mocked for using marketing speak to deny that the broadcaster was elitist describing working class people as 'C2s' and 'Ds' as he defended Jeremy Clarkson's sacking . Mr Yentob's comments quickly attracted the attention of social media users, who criticised the way he had described viewers . Robert MacDonald, tweeted: 'Did Alan Yentob really just say 'lots of our programmes reach out to C2 Ds' (in rejecting BBC is for 'metropolitan elite')?' C2 and DE are terms used by marketing professionals to describe the working classes – more than 47 per cent of the UK population. Mr Yentob’s extraordinary declaration on Newsnight on Wednesday was an attempt to prove what an inclusive organisation the BBC is, amid concern that a huge swathe of its audience will stop tuning in now Jeremy Clarkson has been axed from Top Gear. However, his comments backfired as viewers used social media to accuse him of arrogance and sounding so ‘out of touch’ they thought it was a spoof. They accused Mr Yentob of using obscure jargon that only the metropolitan elite would understand, in a way that suggested that working class viewers are a niche audience. John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, accused Mr Yentob of ‘arrogance’ which only confirmed his status as part of the metropolitan elite. He said: ‘In essence, he’s admitting that the BBC doesn’t do much for the working classes, and he is doing that in a way that is not making it easy for many people to understand.’ Mr Yentob – who earns more than £180,000 a year as creative director as well as an estimated £150,000 fee for editing and presenting the BBC arts series Imagine – made the remarks as he attempted to explain the decision to fire Clarkson. Mr Yentob was appearing on Newsnight to defend the sacking of Jeremy Clarkson, whose contract is not being renewed after he attacked Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon . Twitter user Sacred Antinous wrote: 'Yentob describes all those who aren't 'metropolitan elite' as C2DEs. Our licence fee is so well spent on this man of the people #newsnight' The terms C2s and Ds are marketing terms to describe working class people . Presenter Emily Maitlis asked if getting rid of the Top Gear host would make it harder for the BBC to reach ‘a demographic... increasingly disregarded’ by a corporation which ‘plays largely to the metropolitan elite’. Apparently unaware of the irony, Mr Yentob responded: ‘I don’t know that I would buy that, actually, about the metropolitan elite. 'There are quite a lot of programmes which reach out to audiences which are C2s, DEs, which aren’t the metropolitan elite.’ The terms are part of the Approximated Social Grade, which defines social groups by occupation. AB (22 per cent of the UK) broadly covers higher and intermediate managerial. C1 (31 per cent) is supervisory, clerical and junior managerial. C2 (21 per cent) is skilled manual while DE (26 per cent) is semi-skilled and unskilled, plus the unemployed. Others questioned whether the BBC really were keen to make programmes that appealed to all audiences . Toby Wood said: 'Only metropolitan elite luvvies speak like Alan Yentob on @BBCNewsnight - he's in more opaque bubble than Westminster politicians #Clarkson' A BBC spokesman said: ‘There’s nothing elitist about making programmes and services used by 97 per cent of people every week, and that’s the point Alan made.’ Mr Yentob admitted that axing Clarkson marked ‘a bad day’ for the BBC. But he said director general Lord Hall felt he had no choice after the Top Gear star’s unprovoked physical and verbal attack on his producer. However, he refused to rule out Clarkson returning to the BBC. Clarkson  attacked Mr Tymon (pictured) leaving him in such a state that he later took himself to A&E . The BBC has said that Top Gear will continue without Clarkson, but there are doubts as to whether co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May will return . Consumers are sometimes grouped into classes or social grades used to describe their social grade and earnings for market research purposes. Social grade A denotes people of upper middle class who have higher manergerial, administrative or professional roles, B and C1 are middle class, C2 are the skilled working class, D are working class and E are low grade workers or state pensioners with no other income. These social grade demographics were originally developed by the National Readership Survey to provide audience research for advertising in newspapers and magazines to show the audience for each publication. However, they now more widely used in market and statistical research and analysis, as well as social commentary.","Alan Yentob was appearing on Newsnight over Jeremy Clarkson row .

"A new report is claiming that it was a member of Hillary Clinton's own party who leaked to the press that the political heavyweight was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State. The New York Post is reporting that Valerie Jarrett, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers, leaked details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House. What's more, the entire thing was timed to become public just as Clinton was planning to announce her candidacy for president. Scroll down for video . A new report claims that it was a member of Hillary Clinton's (above) own party who leaked to the press that the political heavyweight was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State . Valerie Jarrett (left), one of President Barack Obama's (right) top advisers, leaked details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House . The story ran in the New York Post and was written by Ed Klein, who spoke last Wednesday about his belief Jarrett was involved on Fox and Friends . 'Obama and Valerie Jarrett will go to any lengths to prevent Hillary from becoming president,' said a source close to the White House. 'They believe that Hillary, like her husband, is left of center, not a true-blue liberal.' Sources claim that the long rumored tension between Obama and the Clintons hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the party refused to be seen campaigning with President Obama. Jarrett is reported to have commented this was because the Clintons had begun 'marginalizing the president' and that they were 'trying to wrestle control of the Democratic Party away from Obama.' Because of this she reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge, working to get Monica Lewinsky high profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the Clintons. Then, shortly after the midterm elections, she, President Obama and Michelle Obama had Clinton in for a meeting and reportedly told her in no uncertain words that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president. This as Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about possibly running in the 2016 election. 'She’s promised O’Malley and Warren the full support of the White House if they will challenge Hillary for the presidential nomination,' said a source. Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O’Malley (above), the former governor of Maryland, about running in 2016 . She has also reportedly reached out to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about entering the primary . Edward Klein, the author of Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, also spoke to a friend of the Clintons, who told him that Bill said; 'My contacts and friends in newspapers and TV tell me that they’ve been contacted by the White House and offered all kinds of negative stories about us.' He then added; 'The Obamas are behind the e-mail story, and they’re spreading rumors that I’ve been with women, that Hillary promoted people at the State Department who’d done favors for our foundation, that John Kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes Hillary left behind.' It seems like it is not over yet either, as there are reportedly six more probes currently going on that are looking into Clinton's performance. Bill, upon learning of this, reportedly said to a friend; 'The Obamas are out to get us any way they can.' Klein seems to have known about all this for some time, discussing it when he appeared on Fox and Friends last Wednesday. '[Bill] has said, according to my sources, that the White House is leaking to their friends in the mainstream media stories about the Clintons. Not only about Hillary, but about him, and about what she did while she was in the State Department,' said Klein. 'This is from sources within the White House, that the Clintons know that Hillary is under not one, but six different investigations prompted by the White House.' He then added; 'They're going through these, looking for problems on her expense account, on her dealings with foreign leaders. All of this, I'm told, is prompted by Valerie Jarrett and the president, who do not want to see Hillary Clinton become President of the United States.' Jarrett, 58, is one of President Obama’s longest serving advisers and closest confidantes, and said in a recent interview that she would stay in the White House 'until the lights go off.'","A new report claims that Valerie Jarrett, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers, leaked the Hillary Clinton email scandal to the press .

"Tony Blair helped broker a deal to secure a £1million donation designed to curb the influence of trade unions on Labour, it emerged today. The former prime minister reportedly hosted a dinner with Hull City boss Assem Allam to secure cash to plug a hole caused by the Unite union withdrawing support from Ed Miliband. It comes just days after a row erupted over Labour MPs rejecting £1,000 donations from the triple election winner. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair has stepped up efforts to secure a Labour victory on May 7, despite repeatedly appearing to question the direction of Mr Miliband's leadership . Mr Blair has stepped up efforts to secure a Labour victory on May 7, despite repeatedly appearing to question the direction of Mr Miliband's leadership. The ex-PM has warned that fighting on a 'traditional left-wing' platform was a recipe for defeat for Labour. But claims he is working to limit the influence of the unions has sparked a row among left-wing Labour MPs who accused him of pursuing 'underhand tactics'. Mr Miliband has been seen as too left-wing since the moment he narrowly beat his brother David to the leadership with the support of the unions. Unite chief Len McCluskey has warned Labour that funding for its election warchest is dependent on pursing policies he supports. It is also claimed that he is demanding his friend Karie Murphy be included in a shortlist to be the Labour candidate in Halifax. The Unite activist was embroiled in allegations of vote-rigging in the Falkirk seat, but was cleared of wrongdoing. According to the Sunday Times, Mr Blair sealed an agreement with Mr Allam that he would find more money for the Labour party if Unite withdrew support. The former prime minister reportedly hosted a dinner with Hull City boss Assem Allam (pictured) to secure cash to plug a hole caused by the Unite union withdrawing support from Ed Miliband . The chairman of Hull City football club has already given £200,000 to Labour this year, and has promised another £300,000. If Unite cuts its support, Mr Allam is said to be ready to donate another £500,000. Mr Allam told the newspaper: 'I want to see a strong Labour party, less reliant on trade union money, so I have said if you have any problem with the Unite money I will make my donation £1m.' He added: 'As I have always said to our friends in the Labour party, Tony Blair and Ed Miliband, I would increase my political donations to gradually reduce the Labour party's financial reliance on the trade unions. 'I hope I can inspire other like-minded business people to do the same so that the Labour party can stand on their own without having to satisfy one paymaster.' It is the latest example of the growing influence of New Labour grandees in the effort to secure a victory for Labour. Labour leader Ed Miliband is under pressure from Blairites not to lurch to the left in the days before the election . Mr Miliband has appointed former Deputy PM John Prescott as an adviser on climate change, while ex-spin doctor Alastair Campbell is playing an increasingly high profile role in the run-up to the election. But Mr Blair's invokvement provoked the wrath of Jim Sheridan, the chairman of the Unite group of Labour MPs. 'A lot of MPs are members of Unite,' he said. 'Unite have just given £1.6m to the party to try to get Ed Miliband into power so if this guy [Allam] or Blair are working against the party, then I think people will be really angry and frustrated.' Last week Mr Campbell publicly attacked Labour candidates turning down donations from Mr Blair - and warned they should prepare for another Tory government. At least two candidates - Lesley Brennan and Sally Keeble - rejected Mr Blair after he offered 106 key battleground seats £1,000 each to fight the election. The former Prime Minister said the swing constituencies were 'where the election will be won for Labour'. Mr Campbell accused the candidates of being 'attention seeking' and questioned whether they wanted to win.","Former Prime Minister hosted dinner with Hull City boss Assem Allam .

"Google unveiled plans earlier this year for a cancer-detecting wristband that it was testing using moulds of human skin. Now the firm has been awarded a patent for the technology that will 'automatically modify or destroy  targets in the blood that have an adverse health effect'. According to the files, the wearable could target these cells using an 'external energy source' such as ultrasound or radio frequencies. Google's patent explained its wearable (illustrated) could target any substances or objects that, when present in the blood, may affect the health of a wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels. This could include infrared signals, a radio-frequency or acoustic pulse, or a magnetic field . 'A number of scientific methods have been developed to examine physiological conditions of a person by detecting and measuring one or more analytes [chemicals] in a person's blood,' explained the Nanoparticle Phoresis patent. 'Analytes could...be indicative of a medical condition or health of the person' and could include 'enzymes, hormones, proteins, cells or other substances.' Google continued that its wearable would target  any substances or objects that, when present in the blood, may affect  the health of wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels. In an interview with Bloomberg, Google Ventures' president Bill Maris recently said he thinks it's possible to live to 500 years old. And this will be helped by medical breakthroughs as well as a rise in biomechanics. He has already ploughed money into genetics firms and cancer diagnostic startups and said: 'We have the tools in the life sciences to achieve anything that you have the audacity to envision. I just hope to live long enough not to die.' Mr Maris founded Google Ventures in 2009 and oversees all of the fund’s global activities. Elsewhere he has develop Google’s Calico project. Calico is a research and development company set up in 2013 by Google and Apple to tackle 'ageing and associated diseases.' Google co-founder Larry Page said the project would focus on 'health, wellbeing and longevity' and last September Calico partnered with AbbVie to open a research centre into neurodegeneration and cancer. This could include infrared signals, a radio-frequency or acoustic pulse, or a magnetic field. The energy used would depend on what the band is targeting, but it would be designed to alter the chemical composition of the analyte. 'In one relevant example, certain proteins have been implicated as a partial cause of Parkinson's disease; the development of Parkinson's disease may be prevented or retarded by providing particles functionalized with a bioreceptor that will selectively bind to this target' continued the files. 'These bound particles may then be used, in combination with a wearable device as described above, to modify or destroy the target protein. 'As a further example, the target could be cancer cells; by selectively targeting and then modifying or destroying the cancer cells, the spread of cancer may be diminished.' In January, Andrew Conrad, head of Google Life Sciences unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells. After travelling around the body, these nanoparticles would then be collected, using a magnet, to reveal what cells they encountered. The nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up, for example, allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body. The system relies on light emitted from the cells as a result of the nanoparticles, so scientists must understand how light passes through skin. So Google started making skin. It would scan the blood for so-called analytes, or chemicals, in the blood such as the presence of 'enzymes, hormones, proteins, cells or other substances.' Google said it could target certain proteins that have been implicated as a partial cause of Parkinson's disease, for example, or cancer cells . In January, Google's Life Sciences lab unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells. To assist with their research, the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors (pictured) To assist with their research, the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors. As the wearable is still in the early stages of development, Google X is working to determine what defines a 'healthy' person. They are monitoring 175 healthy volunteers to frequently collect physiological information. Mr Conrad admitted that people may find it 'weird' having particles constantly tracking the cells in their body. After travelling around the body, these nanoparticles would then be collected, using a magnet, to reveal what cells they encountered. The nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up, for example, allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body . 'It's way weirder to have cancer cells floating through your body that are constantly trying to kill you,' Mr Conrad continued. He said that the Google X team is trying to change medicine from being episodic and reactive to being proactive and preventive. 'We're making good progress but the journey is long and hard, he said. 'So I think we will get there and I hope it's years, not decades.'","Patent details a wearable that could target  substances in a wearer's blood .

"Microsoft says its new Windows 10 operating system will be coming 'this summer' in 190 countries and 111 languages. In a blog post late Tuesday, Microsoft executive vice president Terry Myerson said the operating system designed for multiple devices would also have a 'small footprint' for connected devices. 'We continue to make great development progress and shared today that Windows 10 will be available this summer in 190 countries and 111 languages,' he said. Scroll down for video . Microsoft is yet to provide a precise date for the launch of the Windows 10 operating system, which is aimed at powering PCs,smartphones and also connected devices such as bank machines and medical equipment. New operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'. Cortana personal assistant runs on the desktop. Various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. Users can create multiple desktops to keep things organised. Microsoft has yet to provide a precise date for the launch of the operating system, which is aimed at powering PCs,smartphones and also connected devices such as bank machines and medical equipment. 'For the first time, a new version of Windows for small footprint IoT (Internet of Things)  devices will be available -- for free -- when Windows 10 launches,' Myerson said. 'Windows 10 will offer versions of Windows for a diverse set of IoT devices, ranging from powerful devices like ATMs and ultrasound machines, to resource constrained devices like gateways.' Microsoft is also working with fast-growing Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi to test Windows 10 on its devices. The US tech giant also announced partnerships with Chinese-based Tencent and Lenovo to help customers in China upgrade to Windows 10. The company also said Tuesday that Windows 10 will allow users to sign in to a device without a password by using biometrics, including facial recognition. It is also making its biggest push into the heavily pirated Chinese consumer computing market this summer by offering free upgrades to Windows 10 to all Windows users, regardless of whether they are running genuine copies of the software. The move is an unprecedented attempt by Microsoft to get legitimate versions of its software onto machines of the hundreds of millions of Windows users in China. Recent studies show that three-quarters of all PC software is not properly licensed there. Windows 10 will include a new Xbox app to allow users to easily share with friends, and is extremely similar to the firm's Xbox One console system. Terry Myerson, who runs Microsoft's operating systems unit, announced the plan at the WinHEC technology conference in Shenzhen, China. 'We are upgrading all qualified PCs, genuine and non-genuine, to Windows 10,' he said in a telephone interview with Reuters. The plan is to 're-engage' with the hundreds of millions of users of Windows in China, he said, without elaboration. Microsoft said in January it would offer free upgrades to Windows 10 for users of Windows 7 or later in an attempt to hold onto users and make up for lost revenue by selling services such as Office over the Internet. Microsoft is working with Lenovo Group Ltd, the world's biggest PC maker, to help roll out Windows 10 in China to current Windows users, Myerson said. It also is offering Windows 10 through security company Qihoo 360 Technology Co and Tencent Holdings Ltd, China's biggest social networking company, which will build a Windows 10 app that will work on smartphones and PCs for its popular QQ gaming and messaging service. QQ has more than 800 million users. Lenovo said in a statement that it will make phones running Windows software, available through China Mobile, sometime later this year. Microsoft also said it is working with Chinese handset maker Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd - which generally uses a form of Google Inc's Android on its devices - to offer some customers a test version of Windows 10 on their smartphones.'","Microsoft has yet to provide a precise date for the launch .

"For the first time, Nasa has tested one of the explosively powerful boosters that will help its Space Launch System rocket reach space in 2019, and eventually take humans to Mars. The 126-second static-fire test took place in Utah today at 11:30am EDT (3:30pm GMT). Temperatures reached 2,500°C (4,500°F) - enough to melt  sand on the site into glass - as 3.6 million pounds of thrust poured out of the engine. Scroll down for video . Nasa has tested one of the boosters for the Space Launch System in Utah. That static-fire test (seen in the animation above) took place at 3:30pm GMT and lasted 126 seconds. The 3.6 million pounds of thrust produced temperatures of 2,500°C. When SLS eventually flies, two of these boosters will be used . This was the first test of the redesigned booster for SLS. When it ultimately flies, it will use two of these Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB). There will be two versions of the rocket. The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321ft (98 metres) tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Towering a staggering 384ft (117 metres) tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. In its final configuration the SLS will be the most powerful rocket ever launched, more powerful even than the Saturn V rocket that took men to the moon. During the test, flames exited the nozzle at about Mach 3. The booster itself is an upgraded version of the same one that took the Space Shuttle into orbit, but it has an additional section to allow more fuel, and thus more power, to be added. Known as Qualification Motor 1, the booster spent several days inside a chamber as it was heated up to a core temperature of 32°C (90°F). It measures 117 ft (54 metres) in length, 12.2ft (3.7 metres) in diameter and has a total mass of around 725 metric tons.

"Suspected Taliban gunmen have brutally murdered a Pakistani former lawyer who represented the doctor that helped the United States track down Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. Senior police officer Shakir Khan said unidentified assailants shot and killed Samiullah Khan Afridi this morning in the northwestern city of Peshawar before fleeing the scene. Although the Pakistani Taliban have not yet claimed responsibility, they are considered the most likely candidates for an attack that took place close to the border with Afghanistan, in the terrorist organisation's heartland and just over 100 miles from Bin Laden's Abbottabad compound. Scroll down for video . Victim: Senior police officer Shakir Khan said unidentified assailants shot and killed Samiullah Khan Afridi (pictured) this morning in the northwestern city of Peshawar before fleeing the scene . Tragic: Relatives wipe away their tears as they move the body of Samiullah Afridi at a hospital in Peshawar . The lawyer was killed just months after he announced that he will no longer be representing Dr. Shakil Afridi Afridi. The doctor was convicted in May 2012 of 'conspiring against the state' by giving money and providing medical treatment to militants, not for helping the CIA track down Bin Laden. Samiullah Khan Afridi left Pakistan in November after receiving threats from Taliban militants. Investigating Officer Khan says the lawyer recently came back from abroad, adding that the motive for the killing was not immediately known. The murder came on the same day as Pakistani officials executed 12 people  in the country's single-largest day of executions since a moratorium on the death penalty was lifted in December. Campaign: Friends and supporters of Dr Afridi say he has been pursued by the Pakistani government because officials were embarrassed and angered by the killing of Bin Laden . Targeted: Unidentified gunmen shot and killed the former lawyer for the Pakistani doctor who helped the US find Osama bin Laden . Shot: An ambulance takes the body of Samiullah Afridi, lawyer of Dr. Shakil Afridi, accused of running a fake vaccination campaign to get DNA of al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden on behalf of the CIA . Comfort: People console a family member of the Pakistani lawyer Samiullah Khan Afridi who was killed today . Mourning: Hospital staff and family members carry the body of Samiullah Khan Afridi into an ambulance . Hiding in plain sight: Osama Bin Laden lived in this fortified compound, sending messages via couriers . Terrorist: Dr Shakil Afridi took DNA from Osama Bin Laden allowing CIA to identify him in 2011 . The executions are sure to raise concerns over due process and proper oversight of the country's troubled criminal justice system, which rights groups say often does little to protect defendants. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted the moratorium on December 17, a day after Pakistani Taliban gunmen attacked a school and killed 134 students and 19 adults. The killings put pressure the government to do more to tackle the Islamist insurgency and the current wave of executions are a continuation of Pakistan's crackdown on the Taliban. Authorities at different jails in the country's largest province of Punjab today hanged 10 people who had been sentenced to death in murder cases, said the provincial Home Minister Shuja Khanzada. He said authorities planned to execute more convicted criminals in the coming weeks, adding: 'We have started a process, and it will continue.' The superintendent of the main jail in the southern port city of Karachi, Qazi Nazir, said they executed two convicted murderers and handed their bodies over to their families. Late last year, Pakistan's prime minister lifted the death-penalty moratorium specifically for terror-related cases after the December Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar killed 153 people, most of them children. Last week, in a controversial step, the government completely lifted the death-penalty ban for all cases. Human rights groups estimate Pakistan has roughly 8,000 prisoners on death row.","Samiullah Khan Afridi was shot dead this morning in the city of Peshawar .

"In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday night the Australian businessman accused of masterminding an international paedophile ring revealed he is writing a journal that will serve as a confession for his alleged depraved crimes. Speaking from behind bars to 60 Minutes' Tara Brown, Peter Gerard Scully, 52, was evasive, non-committal and vague throughout the interview. But Scully hoped that the journal he was writing would help explain his mental state and the motivations behind his actions. He was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, and killing another young girl, leading to calls for the reintroduction of the death penalty. Scroll down for videos . Peter Gerard Scully, 52, was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old . Relaxed and in control throughout the interview, Scully kept referring to a journal that he was now writing in prison and that the reasons for his horrific actions that he details in it could only be explained by a psychiatrist. 'What I'm looking for is the real reason why I took that road and what drove me to that, because in Australia I wasn't like that,' he said. However, for every direct question Ms Brown had, Scully had an equally opaque answer. 'I don't want to get into any of that... Are we almost done? Because we seem to be going round in circles,' he said at one stage. Asked by Ms Brown if he had any remorse for his actions he said that he did, but could not say exactly when he felt this. 'That's a good question. There's different degrees of remorse when you finally realise what you have done,' he said. ‘At what point do you have remorse? I can't answer that honestly yet.' When pressed on why he did what he did his only answer was to 'ask the psychiatrist that question'. 'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Ms Brown told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Brown went behind bars to face Scully in a prison in Cagayan de Oro in the country's south, where Scully is currently being held, and will be tried at the same location, facing life in prison if found guilty. Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The father-of-two slipped out of Melbourne after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences and fled to Manila in 2011 where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. Videos seized in the Philippines last week, including one called 'The Destruction of Daisy', allegedly show a 13-year-old girl being forced to perform 'horrific' acts of whipping and torture with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. The 60 Minutes team was on the ground when Scully was arrested after the remains of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon and authorities, who had been keeping the 51-year-old under surveillance, swooped on his house. 'We went inside his house of horrors, right into the heart of darkness to understand exactly why it was so important that he was taken off the street,' said Ms Brown. 60 Minutes Tara Brown went behind bars in the Phillipines to speak to the alleged paedeophile . Scully was arrested in February on charges of sexually abusing 13 children and causing the death of another . Scully is accused of feeding a global market of paedophilic videos, charging up to $10,000 for footage of children being tortured and abused by other underage victims. Ms Brown claimed that several of the young girls who were groomed by Scully became partners in his video ring, falling 'into his net, manipulated to become girlfriends and later accomplices', including Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. 'Part of me feels sorry for them, but I can't understand taking it to the next step into torture and possibly murder,' she said. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, allegedly approached two cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie. She offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. 'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened,' Scully said earlier in the week . 'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Tara Brown . Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other. 'You don't want to overuse the word monster, but that is what he is. He is the face of global perversion' said Ms Brown. 'This story is so confronting, it's a story about all lines being crossed, not just once, but repeatedly. We are talking about the sexual abuse of an 11-month-old, and the misery and lead up to the alleged death of another,' she said. Ms Brown said that Scully, a father of two grown children, claims to have remorse for his crimes. 'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened. That is something to talk about in the court which is the proper forum. There's nothing I can do to change what they [the girls] said,' Scully told The Sydney Morning Herald earlier in the week. Ms Brown said that as a mother of two young boys she is very aware of how 'innocent and trusting young people are'. 'It adds to the tragedy. It's almost beyond belief that there is something so dark within some people and when they act on that it's the most innocent that are their victims,' she said.

'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Scully said that he isn't concerned about being sentenced to life in prison. 'If I get sentenced, I get sentenced. That is something out of my control,' he said. 'I get bigger than Ben-Hur and people get interested. There is nothing I can do about it, so why worry about it?' Scully said. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said.

"A decorated soldier has been left penniless and jobless after being repeatedly hounded by 'ambulance-chasing' lawyers over the death of an Iraqi man 12 years ago. Sergeant Kevin Williams shot Hassan Abbas Said because he believed he was going to shoot him after he grabbed his rifle during a violent struggle in Iraq in 2003. The soldier, then 21, was cleared by two military investigations only to then face a murder charge in a civilian court, where he was once again cleared. Sergeant Kevin Williams has been left penniless and jobless after being repeatedly hounded by 'ambulance-chasing' lawyers over the death of an Iraqi man 12 years ago . He went on to be praised for his heroism after saving seven lives in Afghanistan – but in a worrying display of how lawyers are profiting under the Human Rights Act, Mr Said's family could now be awarded compensation. In a blistering attack on the system which has forced the Ministry of Defence to spend millions in British courts defending actions of soldiers on the battlefield, Mr Williams said: 'I feel like I've been on trial for 12 years. 'It is a disgrace that soldiers are having to explain their actions so ambulance-chasing lawyers can abuse farcical rulings and line their pockets on the death of Iraqi civilians.' Mr Williams, who joined the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment in 1999 aged 16, said he was angry that Mr Said's family could receive compensation after pursuing their case with controversial lawyers Leigh Day & Co. It is understood they could receive thousands of pounds. The soldier, then 21, was cleared by two military investigations only to then face a murder charge in a civilian court, where he was once again cleared, pictured with his partner Rachel Lord . He went on to be praised for his heroism after saving seven lives in Afghanistan, but said it feels as though he has been on trial for 12 years . Waiving his right to anonymity, Mr Williams said: 'I was just doing my job as a soldier fighting for my country and defending a comrade. It is disgusting and completely unfair that [Mr Said's] family could now receive compensation and I've lost two jobs and am struggling to support my family.' Mr Williams, now 32, was on a random patrol during his second tour of Iraq in 2003 when he came across up to nine men pushing a cart filled with ammunition. When the soldiers moved to arrest them, Mr Williams chased one to a nearby village and into his home.

Feb 2015: As a result, he loses his second job and flies back to the UK . March 2015: Sir George Newman attributes no wrongdoing to Mr Williams for the death of Said. But MoD says Said family could still get compensation . Mr Said refused to leave peacefully and after trying to grab Mr Williams's gun, he was shot dead by the young soldier as the Iraqi was said to have reached for his colleague's pistol. Mr Williams said: 'I was only a young boy and I was very scared. I felt both mine and my colleague's life were in danger. I didn't think, 'I'm going to shoot to kill him', but I wanted to shoot to stop him.' He was initially subjected to two internal military investigations in 2003 and 2004, which cleared him of any wrongdoing. But with the civilian police unhappy with the decision, he was arrested on suspicion of murder by officers from the Metropolitan Police while on leave in Burnley where he lives with his partner Rachel Lord, 29, and his daughter. After a two-year investigation in which he suffered from depression, his trial collapsed in 2005 when the Crown Prosecution Service eventually accepted there was no realistic prospect of a conviction. The judge said that many people felt Mr Williams had been 'betrayed'. In 2009 he deployed to Afghanistan, saving the lives of seven comrades by pulling them from an armoured vehicle submerged in a river. He was later awarded a Joint Chief's Commendation after trying to save the life of a colleague when their vehicle was hit by an IED. He left as a teaching sergeant in 2013 and moved back to Iraq to work in private security last year. But then he was told about an official inquiry by ex-High Court judge Sir George Newman who was investigating the deaths of Mr Said and another Iraqi, Naheem Abdullah, who died as a result of injuries sustained at a road block in May 2003. Seven paratroopers were cleared of murdering Mr Abdullah in 2005. Mr Williams lost his security job after the inquiry was announced. But on Friday a report by Sir George again attributed no blame to Mr Williams for Mr Said's death. However, the MoD said it could still be forced to pay compensation to Mr Said's family. After a two-year investigation in which he suffered from depression, his trial collapsed in 2005 . Mr Williams, who joined the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment in 1999 aged 16, said he was angry that Mr Said's family could receive compensation . They are represented by law firm Leigh Day & Co, who were criticised last year along with Phil Shiner's Public Interest Lawyers firm after another inquiry demolished their claims that UK soldiers tortured Iraqi detainees in May 2004. The International Criminal Court then announced it examining claims of mistreatment by British troops after being handed a dossier by Public Interest Lawyers. Mr Williams was told that he could face a war crimes trial in The Hague – which usually tries dictators who carry out genocide – over the death of Mr Abdullah. By this time he had found another security job in Iraq but he lost the post within hours of the ICC investigation being announced. He said: 'To possibly be investigated again by the ICC, it makes me feel sick.' Mr Williams said he felt 'abandoned' by the Army, adding: 'I went to war wanting to protect everyone I work with and you expect the Army to support you. They haven't. Nobody has.' An MoD spokesman said: 'The Government wishes to express its regret at the death of Mr Abdullah and is prepared to pay appropriate compensation to his family.'

"China's space authorities have announced plans to launch over 40 different spacecrafts into orbit in 20 separate launches this year. One of the vessels to be launched is the ground-breaking  Yuanzheng 1 - also known as the 'space bus' - which can launch 10 different satellites at once. 2013 was a massive year for China whose scientists launched 16 spacecraft to firmly establish their cosmic credentials. In October 2003, it became only the third country in history to independently launch a manned mission into space on the Shenzhou 5. Ground-breaking: One of the 40 aircraft China plans to put into orbit is the Yuanzheng 1 'space bus' which can carry 10 satellites into space and restart its engines over 20 times . Historic: In December 2013, China's Chang'e-3 lunar probe became the first object to soft-land on the moon since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 in 1976 . A spokesman for the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation said the vessels going up this year will mostly be 'communication satellites' orbiting at around 36,000ft. Director of its Space Department Zhao Xiaojin added: 'There will also be some remote sensing satellites sent up to observe the earth as well as navigation satellites.' Chinese space authorities also said a number of 'cutting edge' technologies will be tested for the first time, including the highly anticipated 'space bus'. The Yuanzheng 1 is China's largest ever rocket with a diameter of 5.2 meters. It needs to be assembled at the launch site because trains carrying it would not be able to pass through tunnels. Its engine can restart over 20 times when flying in orbit and it is thought to be 75 per cent more efficient than spacecraft of the same size. It also has the capability to move old, scrapped satellites out of useful orbit and into so-called 'cemetery orbits' to prevent them from hindering other space-faring vehicles. In December 2013, the Chang'e 3 lander - named after the Chinese moon goddess - became the first object to soft-land on the moon since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 in 1976. China's National Space Administration operated the mission which incorporated a robotic lander and the country's first ever lunar rover. Exploration: In June 2012, the Shenzhou-9 carried China's first female astronaut Liu Yang into space . Cosmic: A spokesman for the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation said the vessels going up this year will mostly be 'communication satellites' The county announced its aspiration to carry out deep space exploration in September 2010 and planned to send a man to the moon by 2025. Mr Xiaojin says work is also continuing to extend China's lunar program, adding: 'We have made breakthroughs in most of the key technology needed for the Chang'e-5 mission [which is expected to land on the Moon by 2017]. 'This year we will conduct more ground tests, particularly ones involving theconditions which will imitate the environment on the moon.' Meanwhile, the Chinese government has already begun opening up its its lunar exploration program to private investment.","Chinese space authorities planning to send 40 different aircraft into orbit .

"Gareth Bale's future at Real Madrid was thrown into more doubt after his white Bentley was attacked by abusive supporters. The Spanish club acted swiftly on Monday night by identifying those responsible. A club statement said that three men had been involved and that one was a club member who would now be banned for life. The £80million former Tottenham forward, who has been linked with a return to the Premier League in the summer, was accosted driving away from the club’s training ground in the early hours of Monday morning after arriving back in Madrid following the 2-1 defeat in Barcelona. Gareth Bale's car was attacked by angry Real Madrid fans following their 2-1 defeat by Barcelona on Sunday . The world's most expensive footballer was confronted by fans as he left the club's Valdebebas training base . The £86million signing's white Bentley is struck by this fan while others jeered Wales international Bale . The fan tries to give the car a kick as Bale pulls away and the abuse continues to be thrown his way in Spain . Two men tried to stop Bale, kicking out at his car as he sped away from them without stopping. The men shouted ‘Hijo de puta’ (‘Son of a bitch’) at the player as security guards attempted to calm them down. Bale's team-mates Jese and Sergio Ramos were also targeted. Bale has been singled out by Real supporters since the turn of the year as the team have lost three games in the league. On Monday, Real announced that the offending member's identity has been sent to the club's discipline commission with the request for him to be expelled from the Santiago Bernabeu outfit for the 'very serious offence.' In addition the club say that they will take applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for the incident. Bale and his Madrid team-mates lost 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Sunday night in a fiercely-contested El Clasico . An estimated 400 million people watched Bale struggle on television as Real moved four points behind Barca . On their official club website, Real Madrid's statement read: 'Following the incidents that occurred involving three individuals in the early hours of this morning outside Ciudad Real Madrid, Real Madrid C. F. wishes to outline the following: . 1.- The Club has already identified the individuals responsible, one a Real Madrid member, for these aggressive and violent actions against several of our players. 2.- Details of this member's identity were sent to the Club's Discipline Commission, requesting that it expel the individual from Real Madrid for what is considered a very serious offence. 3.- This afternoon, the Discipline Commission held an emergency meeting and decided to open a disciplinary investigation and provisionally suspend the individual's rights as a member and access to the Santiago Bernabéu or any Real Madrid facilities. 4.- Real Madrid has notified Spain's National Anti-Violence Commission of the incidents that took place, as well as the identities of the individuals responsible, requesting that it apply those sanctions that it considers appropriate. 5.- Furthermore, Real Madrid will take any applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for these incidents.'

Bale was unlucky not to score at the Nou Camp in front of an estimated 400 million watchers on television as his first-half goal was ruled out for Cristiano Ronaldo being offside. The Wales international, despite helping Madrid win the Copa del Rey and Champions League by scoring in both finals last season, has found life difficult in Spain this year. Bale scored both goals in a 2-0 win against Levante  less than two weeks ago, and celebrated ending his 829-minute drought by covering his ears as if to block out the criticism. The corner flag received a kicking from the 25-year-old, too, as he let out his frustration. It came after the former Tottenham Hotspur winger was whistled at his own stadium last month and a fan poll that found 40 per cent of supporters wanted Bale to be dropped by manager Carlo Ancelotti. Bale has been linked with moves to Manchester United and Chelsea previously, with the majority of Madrid fans seemingly hoping he decides to return to the Barclays Premier League.

"When I arrived at eco-chic resort Amansala for Bikini Bootcamp, I was expecting just that – a week full of hard-core beach workouts to tone up my body for spring. I was also escaping New York’s brutal winter and after a quick three-and-a-half hour flight from JFK to Cancun, bootcamp base is just a 90 minute drive to Mexico’s bohemian town of Tulum - a decidedly more exotic getaway than Miami for seasonally depressed New Yorkers. What I wasn't expecting at Bikini Bootcamp was the spiritual journey that accompanied it and how the group of 18 women who had also traveled from America’s North East, Canada and London would be the ingredients to such a unique experience. Bikini blast: Bootcampers kick off the day with a 7am beach walk in Tulum, Mexico, followed by a blast of exercises before heading into yoga . Vigorous Vinyasa: Jessica Satherley practices her bridge pose in one of Bikini Bootcamp's yoga studios in the class before the 9:30am breakfast . Much like a summer camp, but for professional women mainly in their thirties and forties, we all sat down for opening circle on the first night to introduce ourselves and reveal what brought us here. The fitness instructors – predominantly Americans who work seasonally in Mexico or moved down permanently for the lifestyle – told us that every group each week is here for a reason. We had all come from different backgrounds, with our different reasons for choosing Bikini Bootcamp. Some were mothers who needed a week to themselves, some were marathon runners who wanted a scheduled workout vacation and others needed a kick-start on their fitness regime before summer. Whatever the intention for signing up, we all ended up being here this same week, and the first uncanny coincidence of the group was realized when the two complete strangers from London found out they live on the exact same street, just two houses apart. Broadway Dance Class: Jessica and the bootcampers pictured learning choreography for dance class . Rooftop yoga: The group hit the rooftop studio for an ocean view while performing chair pose . Most of the women weren't looking for a bonding experience when they signed up for bootcamp, but inevitably tight friendships soon formed. After a night of introductions and our first yoga class, it was time to hit the sack and drift into a deep sleep while listening to the Caribbean waves lapping right outside our bungalows. The fitness aspect of bootcamp kicked off straight away each morning, with one hour sunrise beach walks at 7am followed by a ‘bikini blast’ on the white sands to feel the burn in our arms, gluts and abs. Morning sessions are encouraged to be performed on an empty stomach and after the ‘bikini beach blast’ it is straight into either Power Pilates or Vigorous Vinyasa before breakfast. Meditation: The studio was filled with candles and flower petals for an afternoon of yoga and meditation . By the time 9.30am rolls around and we’ve already worked out for over two hours on empty, all I can think about is running to the restaurant for a well-earned feast. Food prepared by the resort is all low sugar and low carb and the naturally delicious meals are all accompanied by detoxifying juices. Despite not seeing bread for the entire week, each meal leaves me feeling satisfied and ready to take on the next physical challenge. Breakfast is followed by a one hour circuit class taken by a Channing Tatum-lookalike, which makes the push-ups and sit-ups a little more bearable, and then bootcampers are allowed a five hour break before afternoon classes resume. 7am: Beach walk ending with a 'bikini blast' workout for arms, gluts and abs . 8.30am: Power Pilates or Vigorous Vinyasa . 9:30am: Breakfast . 10:30am: Circuit class . Or bike tour to the Tulum Ruins and Gran Cenote for snorkeling . 12:30: Lunch . Free time for spa services and relaxation . 4:30pm: Power abs/ Dance Class or Kickboxing . 5:30pm: Restorative rooftop yoga . 7:30pm: Dinner . 8:30pm: Salsa . Breakfast: Fresh fruit, Mexican eggs (scambled/poached/hard boiled), home-made granola and natural yoghurt served with detoxifying juices . Lunch: Green gazpacho, home-made salad with mixed greens, cabbage and carrots, accompanied with either grilled fish or chicken and house-dressing made of Mayan honey, balsamic, olive oil and sesame . Afternoon snack: Smoothie of your choice . Dinner: Puree of local squash and either fresh fish or chicken on a bed of quinoa, shredded broccoli, spinach and almonds . Relaxing in paradise: Bikini Bootcamp's Caribbean beach (pictured) at the resort is the perfect place to rest in-between fitness and yoga classes . Mexico’s Riviera Maya is home to some of the most beautiful beaches on earth so it’s not hard for every afternoon in Tulum to feel like you’re in paradise. A 20 minute bicycle ride along the dusty beach road will take you to the Tulum Ruins, which were erected 700 years ago on the Mayan coast to protect the city. Another short drive from the ruins will take you to Tulum’s Gran Cenote, which is one of the most popular diving and snorkeling areas in the Riviera Maya. The intricate cave system consists of stalagmites and stalactites that will have you weaving between each formation while discovering the underwater mazes. Diving in: Jessica Satherley seen diving in Tulum's Gran Cenote cave system . Day tours: Afternoon breaks from bootcamp can be filled by cycling to the Tulum Ruins, sitting on the coastline of Riviera Maya (pictured) The underground rivers and caves are over 6,500 years old and you’ll definitely burn a few calories while swimming through the system. And while myself and my fellow bootcampers aren’t exploring the bio-diversity and history of Tulum, we are working around our massage schedules back at the resort. Part of the spirituality within the program comes from the healing powers of those who work in the spa. The therapeutic treatments are so rejuvenating that it’s no wonder Demi Moore came here after her divorce from Ashton Kutcher in 2013. Healing her heart: Demi Moore (pictured) went to Bikini Bootcamp in Mexico in 2013 after her divorce from Ashton Kutcher . Before Botox: Jessica Satherley spreads the anti-aging Mayan clay over her as one of the treatments . A huge list of spa services offer everything from a typical full body massage or reflexology, to alternative treatments such as an appointment with the heart whisperer – an old Mayan healer who whispers in your ear while detoxifying your body and soul. And then there is the Mexican Temazcal – a sweat lodge which is not only a spiritual journey that originated from the pre-Hispanic Indigenous people of Mexico but is also a detoxifying ‘rebirth’ which will leave sweat dripping from every pour of your body. Each treatment is influenced by a meditative angle and even the Mayan clay full-body mask used for anti-aging was accompanied by a visualization technique. The Aztecs used Mayan clay to maintain their youthful skin centuries before Botox was invented, so I generously lather the substance from my head to my toes. The 18 women in my group all join in and once we’re unrecognizable in our clay body-masks we assemble down at the ocean’s edge where one of our yoga instructors carries out a meditation exercise on us. As the sun dries the clay and it slowly begins to crack, it’s time to run into the Caribbean Sea and wash away the mud… and all our negative thoughts. It is easy to become distracted in this avant-garde beach town perched on the Yucatan Peninsula, which is why the bootcamp schedule helps keep me on track. Ready to cleanse: Jessica and her fellow Bikini Bootcampers pose after their full body Mayan clay mask before washing it off in the Caribbean Sea . Classes resume at 4.30pm, which rotate daily between kickboxing, Broadway dance classes, Power abs or a tone and sculpt class. Bikini Bootcamp's price range starts from $2,250 for a triple room to $3,950 for a private deluxe beachfront room. Aeromexico has daily direct flights from New York's JFK to Cancun and return flights start from $600. 7:10am: New York JFK to Cancun . 5:46pm: Cancun to New York JFK . Shuttles drive from Cancun Airport to Amansala Resort in Tulum for Bikini Bootcamp in 90 minutes . Buses also leave regularly from Cancun Airport to Tulum, via Playa Del Carmen . In terms of the quality of the fitness classes, they are on par with my local gym in Manhattan, but the ocean views from open-walled and rooftop studios are unbeatable. The programme is also a la carte so bootcampers can choose to participate in every activity on the day’s menu or only attend the ones of interest. I often miss the circuit class straight after breakfast and opt to swim in the ocean or cycle to the local boutiques instead and never feel any pressure to have my butt kicked by the blonde heartthrob taking the session. I also never get the feeling that this week is about extreme weight loss and in fact neither I, nor any of the women that I ask feel they had lost any substantial weight by the end of the week. It is instead about cleansing the mind, body and soul, without an obsession with bathroom scales. Sunset yoga: Bikini Bootcamp days would end with Restorative Yoga classes during sunset on the rooftop . Despite not losing weight, I definitely feel a deep awareness of having a healthy body, mind and an overall rejuvenated sense of self. My favorite class of each day is always restorative yoga on the rooftop studio during sunset between 5.30 and 6.30pm. I still consider myself a beginner at yoga and only started practicing regularly over the past six months but one thing I enjoy about every class is learning to be present in the moment and finding gratitude for something in my life. As I watch the sunset over Tulum during my downward dog, the only thought going through my mind is to be grateful for this very moment in paradise.","Bikini Bootcamp is a fitness and yoga retreat in Tulum, Mexico .

"The sight of birds pecking at seed or nuts from a garden feeder fills many people with joy. Now, a device called the Crow Box could enable bird watchers to make money from their hobby, as well as watch birds develop new skills. The training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts, or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids. The Crow Box training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts, or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids. People who want to train crows can follow the open-source instructions to make their own box (pictured left) which includes a perch and funnel to dispense tasty peanuts (right) Research has shown that crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes. The box is similar to a vending machine for birds, but crows have to use their brains to earn treats. So far, the Brooklyn-based maker of the box has managed to train captive crows to retrieve coins in return for peanuts and hopes that wild crows will learn the same tricks. The sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers, a 12 volt power supply, two motors, cables and sensors. It is powered and run by a laptop that can be placed up to 50ft (15 metres) away. Research has shown that crows (stock image) have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes . An experiment by the University of Cambridge has proved that members of the crow family, known as corvids, aren’t just among the cleverest birds, they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food, which the University of Oxford’s Behavioural Ecology Research Group said is the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The device has a perch, a food tray and a funnel, designed to test a crow’s cognitive abilities and incentivise them to learn new tricks. There are four steps (illustrated) to training crows to find coins, involving peanut rewards . To begin training, the device pushes a few peanuts and two coins into the feeder tray whenever a crow leaves the machine, which ensures food is always on offer and the sound of the machine is linked to the reward so the crow learns to accept it. The machine is then adapted so that it does the same thing when a crow arrives – training the bird to wait for its reward by visiting the machine. Once visiting crows have learned patience, the machine is changed again so it only dispenses coins and not peanuts. This part of the training is the highest risk, because it seemingly removes the incentive of nuts. But the contraption is designed so that if a bird pecks or sweeps coins off the tray – which is fitted with sensors – and into a funnel, peanuts are revealed and the bird's ingenuity is rewarded. This stage is designed to strengthen the relationship between the coins going down the funnel and food. The training is complete when crows bring coins of their own volition to unlock food. They may collect coins scattered nearby by the owners of the machine to encourage their behaviour, or travel further afield to collect bonus treasure. Gabi Mann, from Seattle, Washington, feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange. The eight-year-old has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads, buttons, pieces of metal, brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions. Perhaps the most touching is a metal fragment with the word 'best' written on it - one half of a pendant that would be completed by the word 'friend' if reunited with the other part. Among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl-coloured heart. 'It's showing me how much they love me,' Gabi told the podcast The BitterSweet Life and the BBC. 'They give me all the special stuff you could ever find. 'We know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty and nothing like what a person would carry around. Sometimes we find them on the bird feeder.' As Gabi throws the food for the birds, crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence. In return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb, earrings, pieces of Lego, rusted screws, polished rocks and glass beads. The open source experiment is designed to look further into the brains of corvids. ‘The more people trying different things the faster we'll all figure out how to work cooperatively with crows,’ hacker and writer Joshua Klein writes on the Crow Box website. ‘Once we’ve got the system optimised for teaching coin collection we can move to seeing how flexibly they can learn other tasks, like collecting garbage, sorting through discarded electronics, or maybe even search and rescue.’ The box is similar to a vending machine for birds, but crows have to use their brains to earn treats. The sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers, a 12 volt power supply, two motors, cables and sensors. Some of the inner workings are shown here . Members of the crow family are known to be among the cleverest of birds, but scientists are finding that they may have intelligence that rivals most mammals and even young children. An experiment by the University of Cambridge showed that crows can perform task that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. The programme shows 007 the crow completing the eight stage puzzle in approximately two-and-a-half minutes. The individual processes are detailed in this diagram . Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The problem-solving creature performed the series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult set up of the course beforehand. The wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat. The animal was later released. In another astonishing test set up by BBC Two, a crow called 007 completed an eight stage puzzle in two and a half minutes. It is one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever devised.","Crow Box training aid is designed to teach corvids to collect coins .

"A drone has been used in a daring night-time attempt to smuggle drugs and weapons into a high security jail. The plan was only thwarted when the machine became entangled in razor wire on a security wall and was then spotted by staff at Bedford Prison. It is the first known case of a remote-controlled aircraft being used to infiltrate a British jail. The Chinese-made machine was carrying a package containing drugs, mobile phones, screwdrivers and a knife. Prison staff spotted it on the razor wire and managed to retrieve it. The plan was only thwarted when the machine became entangled in razor wire on the security wall at the jail . This is the first known case of a remote-controlled aircraft being used to infiltrate a British jail . One theory is that the 'pilot' planned to direct the drone to a spot where it could hover outside a cell window. A prisoner might then have been able to reach out and grab the illicit cargo. The miniature aircraft are already a major concern to police, who want to be given powers to seize them if they suspect they are being misused. The one flown into Bedford Prison two weeks ago was a DJI Phantom 2 Vision, which weighs just 2.5lbs but has a range of nearly half a mile. The device is fitted with a wide-angle camera and can be bought online or at an electrical retailer for around £900. A Bedfordshire Police spokesman said: 'We were called to reports that a small drone had been discovered alongside a package at HMP Bedford at 11.30pm on March 6. 'Both the device and the contents of the package are currently being examined and investigations are on-going.' The jail can contain around 500 inmates. A recent report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons said the main challenge facing staff was the prevention of 'the inward trafficking of unauthorised items, including mobile telephones and illegal drugs'. Adam Bailey, of the Association of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, said: 'It's a pretty stupid way of trying to get stuff into a prison. 'A drone sounds like a swarm of bees and has flashing lights so you're likely to attract attention. You'd have to be very skilled to pull this off and these guys clearly weren't.' The jail can contain around 500 inmates. A recent report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons said the main challenge facing staff was the prevention of 'the inward trafficking of unauthorised items' A possible rehearsal for the drone's flight may have taken place a month ago. Farhat Erdogan, who works in a Londis store close to the site, said he thought two men had been involved. Mr Erdogan, 29, said: 'I saw these guys in their 30s with a drone and wondered what they were doing. 'They were standing near traffic lights a couple of hundred yards from the prison. I watched as they sent the drone up into the air.' Shop worker Paddy Pain, 22, said a friend serving a sentence at the jail had been offered money by fellow inmates to accept a delivery of banned substances. And Sonya Minney, 55, chief officer of the Bedford Guild House charity, which backs on to the prison, said: 'Staff have recently covered up the cell windows that face outwards to prevent stuff being thrown in. 'We often hear the police helicopter and sometimes they patrol the perimeter with sniffer dogs but we've never seen a drone.' Drones have been widely used in the United States and Canada to fly drugs into penal institutions and in October a miniature helicopter packed with pills crashed into a net guarding the exercise yard of a jail in Ireland. Phantom Vision devices are small enough to fit into the corner of a suitcase and manufacturer DJI claims they can fly for up to 50 minutes if fitted with an extra battery. There have been no arrests in connection with the Bedford incident yet. Police have appealed for information. A Prison Service spokesman said that the package had been 'quickly intercepted by vigilant staff'.","First known case of remote-controlled aircraft being used at British prison .

"Prince Charles can often be found in his study late at night writing letters to ministers, civil servants and other prominent figures . Long after the servants – and his wife – have retired to their beds at Clarence House, Prince Charles can often be found in his study, a lamp burning on the desk as he scratches away in black ink. At his most productive period, his passionate words have poured out at the rate of 1,000 letters a year to ministers, civil servants and other prominent public figures. To regular recipients, this correspondence is known as the ‘black spider’ memos, which have been thumping on to the desks of successive government members for well over three decades. An underlined phrase here, an exclamation mark there and notes of emphasis in the margins everywhere. This has been the Prince’s modus operandi for tackling the issues of the day for so long now that no one among his staff can remember a time when he was not crafting these often heartfelt missives in the dead of night. He sees it as his constitutional duty to speak his mind about the subjects that matter to him. Indeed, the closer he edges to the throne, the more opinionated he seems to become. He freely admits that he is an ‘inveterate interferer and meddler’. Only last week he made a rare public defence of his interventions during a visit to Washington. Asked why he ‘still cared so much’ about environmental issues, he replied: ‘Well, I’ll turn it round the other way. I think you’d be surprised if I didn’t care about things,’ adding: ‘There’s an awful lot to worry about.’ To some, these regal intrusions have become dangerously parti pris and political – a charge Charles denies. In private, he maintains that because he’s been around so long and meets so many different people his own experiences of many matters are often greater than those of the minister charged with dealing with them. Indeed, there is an argument he would have avoided the controversy over the 27 letters written to seven Whitehall departments in a six-month period between September 2004 and March 2005 – and seized back the initiative – by disclosing them in full himself. One former advisor tells me that he would have urged the Prince to publish them on his website to allow the public to make up its mind about their content. ‘Publish and be damned, because what he was saying was just great common sense that would strike a chord with the public,’ the ex-aide says. Instead, a legal battle has waged for ten years. According to former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who fought the case all the way to the Supreme Court because he said the notes risked sacrificing the political neutrality of the future king, they reflect the Prince’s ‘most deeply held personal views and beliefs’. Yet not all his views are expressed with sense. Long before these fears surfaced, it was known that Charles was at odds with the then Labour government. In 2002, he was reported to have told Tony Blair that the Government would not dare attack ‘blacks, gays and ethnic minorities’ in the way that supporters of fox-hunting were being persecuted. And to which was added the alarmist point, apparently made by the Prince to a senior politician, that if the Labour government ever did ban fox-hunting, ‘I might as well leave this country and spend the rest of my life skiing’. Former Attorney General Dominic King (left) fought the case all the way to the Supreme Court. However, long before his fears surfaced, it was known that Charles was at odds with Tony Blair's (right) Labour government . Much more sensitive was a letter leaked to the Mail that he sent to Lord Irvine, the then Lord Chancellor. In it, the Prince railed about new hygiene laws in care homes that forbade volunteer workers from cooking meals in their own homes and then taking them to residential homes for the elderly or hospices to be reheated and served. Pouring scorn on the legislation, he wrote: ‘Many of these sorts of volunteers are middle-aged ladies who have cooked for their families for 40 years without poisoning anyone. ‘In order to protect the elderly from a tiny but theoretical risk, a whole section of volunteers is in danger of being alienated. These sort of people will not volunteer if they are patronised or if regulation makes it impractical.’ In the same letter, he derided legislation, also affecting the preparation of food in care homes, which made staff throw away wooden chopping boards and replace them with plastic ones colour-coded for meat, vegetables and fish – only to find they had to change them back again because wood turned out to be more hygienic than plastic. Charles also raised the issue of fire safety doors in homes which legislation decreed should be so firmly sprung to ensure they close that many frail old people were unable to open them. And he complained about the ‘passing of ever more proscriptive laws… the blame-culture they can in practice encourage, and the bureaucratic red tape which accompanies new rules. The more I talk to people, the more convinced I am that this cumulative effect has the potential to be deeply corrosive to the fabric of our society.’ He also questioned how new rules and regulations were making people so over-cautious that even the quality of Army training was being affected. Military exercises using live ammunition were so rare because ‘modern safety precautions are so strict’ that he feared for the effectiveness of the training when the soldiers had to face the real thing. Prince Charles is believed to have once confronted Lord Irvine with his concerns over the Human Rights Act . The Prince also raised the extraordinary but all too realistic possibility – one that he had been told was where current trends were leading us – of a soldier suing his superior officer for making a poor decision in battle which results in his being wounded. And he mentioned that he had heard of a case where the surviving member of a two-man military aircraft that crashed faced a possible manslaughter charge, as well as the threat of being sued by the widow of the other pilot. ‘Why should any other pilot in that squadron, knowing there is a risk of litigation if he gets it wrong, take any calculated risk, exercise his professional judgment, push himself to the limits or fly in marginal weather,’ Charles asked. ‘In short, why should individuals continue to operate in the way which has always made our Armed Forces so capable and professional if a different set of rules based on individual rights makes the potential penalties too great? He also confronted Lord Irvine with his concerns over the Human Rights Act. The leaking of the letter caused a political storm and sent Downing Street into meltdown. Royal aides reacted by saying the Prince saw himself as a ‘dissident’ working against the current political opinion. Others said Charles had become the only effective opposition to the then all-powerful Labour government. So will Charles now go quiet? It seems highly unlikely. The Prince has received backing from the Prime Minister to continue writing. Freedom of Information laws have already been amended to give him absolute exemption to his future contacts with ministers and David Cameron has indicated they could be tightened further to prevent this week’s ruling from the Supreme Court. It would certainly be out of character if he were to go quiet. Certainly his enthusiasms – and, let’s face it, some prejudices – are undimmed, and for as long as he is Prince of Wales he believes he has carte blanche to interfere as much as he wishes.","Prince Charles often writes to ministers, civil servants and public figures .

"A Navy SEAL who was shot 27 times and still managed to pull out his handgun and kill two enemy fighters is now training to run a half-Ironman triathlon in honor of his fellow veterans. Mike Day is representing Dallas-based Carrick Brain Centers, where he was treated for PTSD eight years after he survived a gunfight while serving in Iraq. In 2007 Day was hit 27 times by enemy fire after he was the first of his SEAL team to enter a room where four enemy fighters were waiting and quickly shot the rifle out of his hand. Scroll down for video . Former Navy SEAL Mike Day, who was shot 27 times during a gunfight in Iraq, is now training to run a half-Ironman triathlon in honor of his fellow veterans . During the attack 11 shots hit Day's body armor while the other 16 wounded him. He was shot in both legs as arms, the buttocks and scrotum, as well as his abdomen. His thumb almost had to be amputated . Day managed to kill two enemy fighters with his pistol before he was knocked unconscious by a grenade that exploded less than 10-feet away from him. Eleven shots hit Day's body armor while the other 16 wounded him, according to WTKR. When Day woke up a minute later in the midst of a firefight, he grabbed his handgun and shot down two enemy fighters before the gunfire ceased. The tough SEAL then got up and walked himself to the medical helicopter. Day described the extent of his numerous injuries on his half-Ironman fundraiser page, writing that he was shot in both legs and arms, as well as the buttocks and scrotum. He said a shot to his abdomen also left him with a colostomy bag for a year, and his left thumb was almost amputated. Day said now his life's mission is to 'care for and lead my wounded brothers and sisters' Day's ribs were also fractured and he suffered contusions to his lungs after his body armor was hit so many times, but the bullets missed all his vital organs. 'This was a single gunfight at an ordinary day at the office,' he wrote on the page. After spending 16 days in the hospital, where he lost 55 pounds, Day was discharged and awarded the Purple Heart. Day, who has spent 20 years in the SEALS, has also won the Silver and Bronze Star. But Day said his life's mission is not about him but to 'care for and lead my wounded brothers and sisters'. Day has raised $68,585 of his $75,000 goal for the center, which specializes in working with wounded warriors as well as children with severe brain injuries. He will run participate in the half-Ironman, a 70 mile triathlon, in Florida next month. Day shows his body armor, which was hit by 11 bullets.

"An eight strong volunteer unit of former British servicemen are preparing to travel to Syria to fight against militants from the Islamic State terrorist organisation, it has been claimed. The ex-soldiers - some of whom have Special Forces training - call themselves the International Volunteer Force and will fight alongside the Kurdish resistance  in the north of the country. Images posted on social media purportedly show the men taking part in special training exercises in Europe ahead of their journey to Syria, where they join an estimated 100 other Western volunteers to have joined the Kurdish peshmerga and YPG armies in the fight against ISIS terrorists. Unit: The former soldiers - some of whom have Special Forces training - have branded themselves the International Volunteer Force and will fight alongside the Kurdish resistance militias in northern Syria . Images posted on social media purportedly show the men taking part in special training exercises in Europe ahead of their journey to Syria, where they join an estimated 100 other Western volunteers battling ISIS . The images were posted on a Facebook page titled 'Sgt Tom', which carries the colours of the Kurdish flag and disguises the faces of all the men photographed. The images show the men wearing military fatigues and clothing suited to fighting in a desert environment while clutching large assault rifles. Alongside captions making threats towards ISIS militants, one image appears to act a as the group's manifesto, identifying the leader as the aforementioned 'Sgt Tom' who says he is a former serviceman travelling to  'defeat you [ISIS] and the evil you stand for'. 'Poor foreign policies, weak government and law have allowed the spread of a cancerous, perverted form of Islam to our shores,' he adds. He goes on to state that ISIS 'do not have the right to claim Islam as their own property to pervert and undermine a magnificent that to true Muslims, is based on peace'. 'I am not right wing, nor fascist, I am not anti-Islam nor anti any religion,' Sgt Tom says before adding 'I am a free man in a free country and free to fight for freedom and democracy'. 'Your heinous crimes have stirred my inner morality, I will not turn against peaceful Muslims but I am sickened by what you [ISIS] do and as such...I volunteer my skill-set to the people of Kurdistan.' Prepared: The images show the men wearing military fatigues and clothing suited to fighting in a desert environment while clutching large assault rifles . Ex-servicemen: The former soldiers will be leaving 'within weeks' to join the YPG militias that have so bravely defended northern Syria against ISIS in recent months . The group have called themselves IVFOR (International Volunteer Force) but some of them are understood to have tattoos bearing the moniker 'ISIS Hunting Club'. They will be leaving 'within weeks' to join the YPG militias that have so bravely defended northern Syria against ISIS in recent months - most notably in the town of Kobane, which the terrorists besieged for four months before being flushed out. Speaking to the Evening Standard newspaper, one of the former soldiers said the group had bought uniforms and are training every day and have even created a lightning a sword based logo and adopted the Latin motto 'Cita et Certa', meaning Swift and Sure. 'I and colleagues have formed a small unit which is open for any English-speaking individuals from any nation,' the former soldier was quoted by the newspaper as saying. He added that the group had already raised more than £13,000 to fund their trip - with one of the men selling his sports car to raise the money. The body of Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, who was killed while fighting against ISIS, was handed over to his family in a ceremony attended by hundreds of Syrian Kurds (pictured) Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting against ISIS in Syria . The former Royal Marines body was handed over to his father and uncle in a coffin which was draped in both the Kurdish flag and the Union Jack. Soldiers turned out for the ceremony on the Syria-Iraqi border yesterday . There are estimated to be as many as 100 Western volunteers fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, including an ex-public schoolboy, using the 'nom de guerre' of Macer Gifford who has joined the fight against ISIS and insisted he would never be captured alive vowing: 'I’ve got a grenade in my pocket and I’ll take them with me'. Many of the Britons who have travelled to fight the terrorists are ex-military and have joined the Kurdish People's Protection Unit - known as the YPG. This group have a designated foreign legion for Western fighters, known as the Lions of Rojava, which is believed to be led by American Jordan Matson. Last month 25-year-old Konstandinos Erik Scurfield became the first Briton to die in action against ISIS, having joined the Lions of Rojava within days of leaving the British army last November. The former Royal Marine from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was hit by mortar fire while fighting alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. Over the weekend his body was returned to his family in a special ceremony attended by hundreds of Syrian Kurds. His coffin, which was draped in both the Kurdish flag and the Union Jack, was handed over to his father and uncle in a special ceremony on the Syria-Iraq border.","Ex-servicemen will be travelling to northern Syria to fight ISIS militants .

"Allison Hopton, 40, posted a string of abusive remarks on Facebook about the hospice where she worked . A children's hospice nurse has been struck off after posting a four-letter rant about work on Facebook . Allison Hopton, 40, posted a string of abusive remarks on the social networking site about the hospice - which provides end of life care for terminally ill children - in the mistaken belief that only her 380 friends could see them. Mrs Hopton had complained online about her job telling friends she had 'big b******ing sh***ing bast*** work tomorrow'. In another message she joked that she was going to make a student nurse her 'b**ch' - and a picture of another colleague sitting on a bedpan. But a hearing was told her remarks could easily be seen by any patient, their families or a colleague with Facebook accounts if they simply searched for her name. Mrs Hopton was sacked from her job at the Ty Hafan hospice in Sully near Cardiff after the posts were discovered. She told her employers: 'Facebook is where people vent. Nurses are human. I don't mix work with my private life. 'I feel I have been professional.' She admitted to the Nursing and Midwifery Council that the comments had been inappropriate. The disciplinary panel, in Cardiff, ruled that she should be banned from working as a nurse. In a statement Mrs Hopton said: 'I cannot go back in time, although I wish I could. 'I have however reflected on the whole incident and changed my behaviour because of it. I accept that comments were irresponsible and stupid, a complete lapse of judgment.' Mrs Hopton, from near Swansea, South Wales, worked at the hospice from 2007 to 2011 when she was dismissed. She was originally given a six-month ban but the panel reviewed their decision and chose to strike her off as well. They ruled that Mrs Hopton, who did not attend the hearing, had not used her taken the opportunity to 'reflect' on her misconduct. A panel spokesman said: 'Mrs Hopton used a number of profanities on her Facebook page and made direct and indirect references to the hospice. Mrs Hopton moaned about her job telling friends she had 'big b******ing sh***ing bast*** work tomorrow'. In another abusive message she said she was going to make a student nurse her 'b**ch' - and a picture of another colleague sitting on a bedpan . 'The panel was mindful of the vulnerable nature of those in her care and the sensitivity that would need to be applied to the families of patients at the hospice and the wider public. 'Her comments on Facebook had been wholly inappropriate and had undoubtedly called into question her judgment and integrity. 'The public rightly expect nurses to act in such a way as to uphold public confidence in the profession. 'As a registered nurse, Mrs Hopton had a duty to uphold public confidence in the profession.

"Ed Miliband yesterday left the door open to a Labour-SNP coalition after the General Election – as the latest polls point to a ‘Braveheart battalion’ of nationalists storming Westminster. In a speech to party members in Edinburgh, led by Jim Murphy, the Labour leader ignored calls from his own frontbench, led by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and Health Spokesman Andy Burnham, to rule out a deal with Nicola Sturgeon’s party. Last week a poll by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft put the SNP on track to increase its representation at Westminster to 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats, up from just six seats now. Scroll down for video . In a speech led by Jim Murphy (left), Ed Miliband (right) ignored calls from his own frontbench to rule out a deal with Nicola Sturgeon's party . This means that dozens of nationalist candidates are knocking on the door of the Commons. They include Tommy Sheppard in Edinburgh East who, as The Mail on Sunday has previously reported, left aggressive messages about the Monarchy during the Royal Wedding – including the line ‘off with their heads’ – and Mhairi Black, aged just 20, who has talked about headbutting her Labour opponents in Paisley. The SNP’s projected success could cancel out Labour gains in other parts of the UK, leading to a dead-heat between the two main parties – and allowing nationalists to play ‘kingmakers’. Many Labour MPs think the only way to avert a humiliating collapse is for Mr Miliband to tell voters he won’t deal with the nationalists, to persuade anti- Conservative voters that a vote for him is the only way to remove David Cameron from Downing Street. However Mr Miliband barely mentioned the SNP at the Scottish Labour spring conference. The Labour leader said: ‘The Tories could wreak havoc in Scotland without winning a majority by being in government as the largest party.’ Tommy Sheppard - Edinburgh East . Sheppard is an unreconstructed republican who tweeted ‘off with their heads’ during the Royal Wedding in April 2011 and said ‘this might be a good time to declare a provisional government’. Unreconstructed republican: Tommy Sheppard . Mhairi Black - Paisley and Renfrewshire South . The student, who is tipped to beat the Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander at the age of just 20 – which would make her the Britain's youngest MP – wants to headbutt ‘fat-cat Labour councillors’ and tweets about her boozy antics. Future MP? 20-year-old student Mhairi Black . Paul Monaghan - Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross . Monaghan was suspended in 2008 from his job as head of planning and development at Northern Constabulary, a Scottish police force, after circulating an unflattering email about his boss. Paul Monaghan: Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross . Martin Docherty - Dunbartonshire West . Docherty issued a call to arms to nationalist supporters in January, with the volunteer activist urging voters to take the opportunity to ‘hold Westminster’s feet to the fire’. Martin Docherty: Dunbartonshire West . Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh - Ochil and South . The ex-soap actress was a Tory and then briefly a Labour party member before she signed up to the SNP. As a Tory she described Alex Salmond as ‘hopelessly out of his depth’. Ex-soap actress: Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh . Alison Thewliss - Glasgow Central . Thewliss boasted that she used Labour campaign literature to wipe her bottom. The councillor, who could topple former Scottish Labour deputy leader Anas Sarwar, also wrote in 2007 about her Labour rivals: ‘Can I hope some of them keel over?’ Glasgow Central: Alison Thewliss . Phil Boswell - Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill . Boswell posted messages on social media last month praising anarchy in Greece. The oil engineer said: ‘It’s about time we did like the Greeks and disempowered the corrupt self-serving establishment parties.’ Phil Boswell: Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill . George Kerevan - East Lothian . The former member of the International Marxist Group told November’s SNP conference that the UK has a ‘disastrous economy whose banking system is an organised criminal conspiracy’. George Kerevan: East Lothian . But he failed to spell out whether his own party would be willing to strike a deal with another party if it does not win a majority. Mr Cameron responded by raising the spectre of a left-wing axis between Labour and the SNP. He said: ‘If you thought the worst outcome for this Election was a Labour government led by Ed Miliband, think again. 'You could end up with a Labour government led by Ed Miliband – propped up by the Scottish National Party – an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt Britain and the people who want to break up Britain. 'And even today, Ed Miliband will not rule out a deal or backing from the SNP. If he cares about this country he should do so.’ An SNP spokesman said: ‘The SNP are fielding an excellent team of candidates to give Scotland a powerful voice in the House of Commons.’","Ed Miliband leaves door open to Labour-SNP coalition after the Election .

"A 27-year-old childcare director has been arrested after she allegedly falsely claimed more than $3 million worth of child care subsidies meant to fund care for children who are abused, neglected or disadvantaged. The woman, Melissa Higgins, is the director of the family day care centre Aussie Giggles in the Albury Wodonga area, on the New South Wales-Victoria border, the ABC reported. Australian Federal Police officers seized $2.1 million in cash, a $90,000 car and a number of other items after searching a number of properties in the Albury-Wodonga area connected to Ms Higgins.

The 27-year-old was arrested on Monday and charged with three counts of Obtaining a Financial Benefit By Deception. Police will allege Ms Higgins started fraudulently claiming Special Child Care Subsidies (SCCB), worth more than $3 million, in December 2013. SCCB is a payment that subsidises up to the full cost of child care for a child who is at risk of serious abuse or neglect, or where the child's family is experiencing temporary financial hardship. Ms Higgins' Aussie Giggles is a family day care provider, meaning she cares for children in her own home. Her arrest is a result of a joint AFP, Department of Human Services (DHS) and Department of Social Services (DSS) investigation after the agencies discovered irregularities in payments.

"A suicidal man was preparing to jump  off a bridge when he was talked down  by his two-year-old son. Rao Ni was perched on the ledge and ready to take the fatal leap when he heard the toddler scream, 'Dad, come back, don't jump.' The child's desperate plea brought to an end hours of tense negotiations and convinced the troubled 39-year-old to climb back to safety and give life another shot. The construction worker had clambered onto the bridge after he was left unable to pay the the rent on the family home in Lingao County, southern China's Hainan Province. The tearful father was spotted balanced on the edge by a member of the public who raised the alarm, according to The People's Daily Online. Rai Ni embraces his two-year-old son after the boy's pleas for him to 'come back' convinced the father-of-one to give life another shot . Troubled Mr Ni was recognised by a co-worker as crowds began to swell around the crossing. With trained negotiators struggling to get through to the man, his wife and son were brought to the scene by police in a last ditch attempt to convince him not to end it all. His wife said: 'Don't do stupid things husband. Our child is so young. The whole family rely on you.' But it was his son's cries of 'Dad, Come back, don't jump,' that talked him down from the suicide attempt. After allowing himself to be hauled to safety Mr Ni enveloped his son in his arms. Police spokesman Guo Tsou said: 'It is difficult to know what the boy could make out of what was happening, but he must've heard his mother and father talking for hours and realised both were upset, and he was also in tears. 'At the end when he started calling his dad, it seemed to get through to him and then the two fell into each other's arms.'

"Battery life is consistently listed as a major flaw of smartphones, smartwatches and other wearables. But this problem could soon be solved thanks to technology that promises to extend battery life for 'decades.' Atmel has released its latest  microcontrollers (MCUs) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person's body. Atmel has released its latest microcontrollers (MCUs) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person's body. Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices' The ultra-low power SAM L microcontrollers are part of Atmel's 32-bit ARM-based MCU range. These are all powered by chip maker ARM's Cortex M0+ 32-bit processors. A number of Apple devices, including the iPhone 5S and iPad Air are powered by chips based around ARM technology. During a demonstration of the microcontrollers to ARMDevices.net at this year's CES, Andreas Eieland, Atmel's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel. This panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge. Mr Eieland said this is based on piezoelectric materials. The material is able to produce an electric charge when it stretches and is subjected to mechanical stress. PFC is a type of piezoelectric material made up of integrated electrodes, and an adhesive polymer matrix. The material is able to produce an electric charge when it stretches and is subjected to mechanical stress. Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms, healthcare, medical, wearable, and devices placed in rural, agriculture, offshore and other remote areas.' They use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made. The microcontrollers run on the firm's picoPower technology and Atmel's Event System that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks. By effectively 'sharing' energy, the whole device uses less power and, subsequently, less battery. It can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible. Plus, the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature.

The firm said that the microcontroller itself can run for years on a single charge, but the battery life of the devices it is added to will depend on how much they are used. Atmel's current model is designed for smart household devices and other gadgets that use relatively low power, but the technology has the potential to one day run on more power-hungry gadgets such as phones and tablets.","Atmel has released its ultra-low power ARM-based microcontroller .

"Gold standard: A pot of freshly brewed White Smoked Tea from the Wee Tea Company, Scotland, which has been named the world's finest cuppa . When going in search of the world's best cup of tea, you might think of heading to lowlands of Assam in India, or of taking a trip to the Far East and the mountains of Oolong. But the finest brew in the world is actually being grown by a Northern Irishman on a disused sheep farm in Scotland, and has just been awarded the prestigious Salon du Thé Gold Award in Paris. The fragrant leaf is so rare and so highly prized that grower Tam O'Braan is selling it for £1,150 per lb - 200 times the usual price - making it the second most expensive in the world. In addition, most of his tea is being exported to China, a feat likened to selling coals to Newcastle. The success comes as something of a surprise to Mr O'Braan, who founded his Wee Tea Company in 2011 with £140,000 and just three plants. Mr O'Braan told The Times that he spent years on organic farms around the world, studying how best to grow crops in Scotland's cold climate, and convinced himself he could do it. While he initially met with success, creating 2,000 cuttings from his original plants, disaster struck in 2012 when the coldest winter in 200 years all but killed his crop. He said that after the setback he and his wife were too embarrassed to tell anyone what they were doing, so kept their operation a secret. But on Valentine's Day last year the plants sprouted again, at which point Mr O'Braan revealed his scheme, along with his first batches of White and White Smoked Tea. He sold his first tea at Christmas by mail order, with most of it going abroad, and Fortnum and Mason have now started stocking the leaves at £30 for a 35g sachet, or roughly £10 per cup. Tam O'Braan, who is from Northern Ireland, developed his tea plantation on an old sheep farm in Perthshire (pictured) using £140,000 and just three plants from which he managed to grow 2,000 cuttings . And today the White Smoked variety was handed the top gong at Paris's prestigious tea awards, making it officially the best cuppa on the planet. Mr O'Braan said: ‘We started with a dream and pursued it. It’s wonderful to have all our hard work recognised. 'Some said we were mad but my partners and I knew we could do it, and with two new daughters on the way I confidently expect my children and grandchildren to be producing tea. 'We are in it for the long haul.’ The upmarket Palm Court at the Balmoral hotel in Edinburgh has also announced it will be serving the beverage as part of its afternoon tea range, priced at £10 per pot. Executive Chef Jeff Bland said: 'At the Balmoral, we are always looking to promote Scottish produce to our international guests and local visitors alike. As well as being sold by mail order online, and at Fortnum and Mason in London, the award-winning brew can also be found at the Balmoral Hotel Palm Court, Edinburgh (pictured), for £10 per pot . 'I was extremely impressed with the flavours of the Dalreoch white and smoked teas. It is even more impressive that the teas are able to grow in our climate. 'As a nation of tea lovers, it is fantastic news that The Wee Tea Plantation has delivered such an impressive product to such a high standard. 'Many tea connoisseurs visit The Balmoral for our wide selection of loose leaf teas, and we are thrilled to be adding these two new local teas to our collection on an exclusive basis.' The tea taste test... by Jim McBeth . An urge to delicately raise one’s pinkie in its honour is irresistible. The china cup perched on a delicate saucer somehow demands reverence. The tea it contains has, after all, been 5,000 years in the making – surely it is owed more respect than your average mug of PG Tips. When the warm golden liquid, cooler than one might expect from a cuppa, is raised to the lips, does one notice the suggestion of smokey apple, or a hint of botanicals? Yes, there is definitely apple in its clean, fresh flavour. But as to the botanicals, I don’t even know what they are. Pinkies out: Jim McBeth detects a hint of smoky apple flavour and a hint of botanicals in the clean, fresh flavour of the award-winning White Smoked Tea . These terms are used by the visionary who has produced the first tea in the world to be grown in Scotland. Tam O’Braan has created something very special, so special in fact that he is on course to sell it to the Chinese – the tea retailing equivalent of sending coals to Newcastle and persuading the people of the Inuit tribe to buy a refrigerator. Sipping the tea, one can appreciate its appeal. It is unusually delicate and fine. Suffice to say, it tastes lovely and one would be loath to gulp it down, grab one’s bag and run off to the office. But as a lover of very strong black coffee and weak black Scottish Blend, it would take a palate more refined than mine to extol all of its virtues. Mr O’Braan assures me, however, that experts who know about things, men whose tongues are insured for £1million, have informed him officially that he is making the best tea in the world. International orders are already flooding in for his white and white smoked teas, which are produced in the wilds of Highland Perthshire by his Wee Tea Company, based on the Dalreoch estate near Dunkeld. The tea's makers believe it benefits from altitude, clean mountain air and fresh spring water which is unique to Scotland . High-class London store Fortnum & Mason has already sold 230 kilos at £2,300 a kilo – or £30 for a convenient 35g sachet. Working out at £10 a cup, it is the second most expensive tea in the world. And from today, in the sumptuous surroundings of the Palm Court in Edinburgh’s Balmoral Hotel, an iconic venue for afternoon tea, Mr O’Braan’s produce is, in another world first, now up for the public taste test. The prestigious hotel on Princes Street has secured exclusive rights to put the teas on their menu, a snip at £10 a pot – twice the usual cost of ordinary afternoon tea – with an accompaniment of the ‘finest shortbread in the world’. This is highly pleasing to a man who was once regarded as mad for sinking £140,000 into the dream of growing tea in the cold ‘marginal’ climate of Scotland – and producing a drink of such distinction and quality that it costs 200 times more than the usual stuff. ‘The price reflects the rarity,’ said the former chemist, a father-of-two whose wife, Gracie, is expecting to deliver twin daughters before Mothering Sunday. His tea came first in the prestigious French Salon de Thé awards in Paris, which was, he said, like receiving an accolade for making the finest of fine wine. He added: ‘We started with a dream and pursued it. It’s wonderful to have all our hard work recognised. Some said we were mad but my partners and I knew we could do it, and with two new daughters on the way I confidently expect my children and grandchildren to be producing tea. We are in it for the long haul.’ Mr O’Braan, 44, has 14,000 plants growing at 700ft above sea level, more than enough to produce tea for the next 70 years. The Wee Tea Company was originally the brainchild of his partner Jamie Russell, and they were joined by Derek Walker. The partners believe tea plants benefit from altitude, clean mountain air and the fresh spring water unique to Scotland. Mr O’Braan said: ‘I’ve worked in five different continents researching how to grow organic foods in marginal climates. I knew we could grow crops in Scotland, and we have. ‘The honour of being the most expensive tea in the world rests with a black Chinese tea costing £4,000 a kilo. ‘Bizarrely, it is not produced to drink but to be bought and sold as an investment. ‘Our tea, while expensive, is very much made to sipped.’ I’ll drink all the tea in Perthshire to that.","Tam O'Braan started tea plantation in 2011 with £140,000 and three plants .

"A small beaker bought with a job lot of pottery for under £100 has sold for a whopping £45,000 after it was found to be an incredibly rare piece of porcelain. The three-inch tall cup with a chipped rim was bought by accident by a lucky dealer who snapped up a tray-load of pieces because he liked another item on it. After retaining the item of porcelain he took the rest to an auctioneer who immediately spotted the potential of the blue and white beaker. Lucky: The job lot one buyer snapped up for £100 because he liked a different item in it contained a very rare beaker (pictured) that ended up selling for £45,000 . Hallmark: The crown and trident on the bottom of the valuable cup featured on only 20 pieces of Chelsea porcelain . Closer examination showed it was made by renowned Chelsea porcelain 266 years ago and was one of two pieces of its type in existence today. Despite this, the auctioneers remained cautious and gave the beaker an estimate of just £100-£200 ahead of its sale. But interest in the item took off as did the bidding and it eventually went under the hammer for £37,000. With fees added on the British buyer paid £44,400 for it. It is believed the beaker once made up a high quality dining set for a wealthy family and would have been akin using cut glass crystal. On the bottom of the vessel is a seal mark of a crown and trident and only 20 pieces of Chelsea porcelain contained this mark. Chris Large, of auctioneers Peter Wilson of Nantwhich, Cheshire, said: 'Chelsea porcelain was at the top of the tree in terms of quality and was comparable to Meissen. Estimate: Cautious auctioneers at Peter Wilson valued the incredibly rare beaker at between £100 and £200 . 'The beaker would have been used for practical purposes back in the day. It was a status symbol, a bit like getting out your best crystal while entertaining today. 'A local dealer bought it in a tray-lot of items. He wanted something else on that tray and gave us the rest. 'I recognised as very early Chelsea porcelain but the vendor wasn't convinced that it was. We remained cautious but after we advertised the sale we started getting calls from the Lonon trade reserving telephone lines for the auction. 'Needless to say the vendor is over the moon with the outcome. 'I have never handled an item that is rarer than this beaker and probably never will.'","The three-inch tall beaker turned out to be a very rare piece of porcelain .

"Labour has been accused of suppressing a major report because it did not support its claim that the NHS is under threat from privatisation. The health select committee was due to publish its study of NHS funding before the election. But, according to Conservative MPs on the all-party committee, it had heard little evidence of fundamental changes to the Health Service as a result of Coalition reforms. The MPs were told that, on the contrary, the pace of privatisation had actually slowed since the election, and that there had been no extension of charges and top-ups – meaning that there was no reason to think the NHS would not remain free at the point of use. Healthcare row: Tory MPs on the health select committee have accused four Labour counterparts of blocking a report that suggested the 'pace of privatisation' in the NHS has in fact slowed since the last election . This dealt a blow to Labour's argument that David Cameron cannot be trusted with the NHS. Rather than publish the report weeks before the election, the four Labour committee members blocked it after reading a draft, claimed their Tory counterparts Charlotte Leslie, Robert Jenrick and Andrew Percy. Mr Percy, the MP for Brigg and Goole, said: 'This is despicable. We heard hours and hours of evidence, but because it does not support the national party line about the NHS being under threat, they block it. 'Labour were only interested if they could use it to weaponise the NHS.' Last night, the angry Tory MPs released a dossier of some of the report's findings. It said: 'The weight of evidence… showed there had not been an extension of charges, of top-ups during the current Parliament, and that these are not planned. 'It showed very little increase in private-sector providers since 2010 [and] a general trend of declining administration costs in the NHS.' It added that independent provider admissions had increased by just 0.6 per cent under the Coalition's Health and Social Care Act, while foundation trusts now receive a lower proportion of their income from private patients than during Labour's time in power. Conflict: Tory MPs Charlotte Leslie (left), Robert Jenrick and Andrew Percy claim their rivals blocked the report because it made the Conservatives look good, but Labour MP Valerie Vaz says the report they released themselves 'did not make full use of the evidence' The dossier also said expenditure on NHS administration had fallen from 5.1 per cent in 2009/10 to a planned 2.7 per cent in 2015/16. And it found that nothing 'suggests that continuing with a comprehensive tax-funded NHS is intrinsically undoable'. Mr Percy said: 'They said the report was too pro-Government. But that's ridiculous, because many of our reports have been very critical of the Government. 'On this occasion, the evidence simply didn't support what Labour wanted to hear.' Valerie Vaz, a Labour MP on the committee, told The Spectator: 'This was a private meeting and I am disappointed a colleague has publicised their version of what was said. 'The report … did not make full use of the evidence. At a different point in the parliamentary cycle… there would have been time to redraft the report as we have done previously.' A Labour source said: 'The Tory MPs didn't want to admit to what their Government has done.'","Health select committee was due to publish report before general election .

"The twin of a British jihadi bride arrested last week as she arrived back in the UK has told of her fury after missing out on a girls' holiday because of her sister's links to Syria. Jamila Henry, 21, was arrested at Luton airport after landing on a flight from Istanbul. She is thought to have fled the region after the breakdown of her second marriage. Her identical twin Jalila, who lives in Balham, south London, is a self-proclaimed party girl who has admittedly followed a very different path from her Muslim convert sister. Self-proclaimed party girl Jalila Henry (left) has spoken of her shock at her twin sister Jamila's (right) connection to Syria. The 21-year-old  was arrested Luton Airport after landing on a flight from Istanbul . Jalila said while she and her sister were close as children they began following different paths as teenagers. Jamila (right) devoted herself to Islam while her party-loving twin (left) began clubbing late into the night . Speaking for the first time since her sibling's arrest, Jalila has told of her shock at learning the mother of one may have been living alongside the murderous terror group. Jamila has since been charged with possession of an identity document with intent. At a hearing on Saturday morning at Westminster Magistrates Court she spoke only to confirm her name. The 21-year-old did not enter a plea. Her parents and sister were present for the brief hearing. In an interview published on the same day, Jamila's twin told The Sun's Rachel Dale how her plans for a girls' weekend to Amsterdam were scuppered by her sister's scheme. She added she was disappointed with her sister's decision to return to Syria, but that the pair had followed different paths since they were teenagers. 'She seemed completely normal. I don't know what to think, I can't believe she has treated me like this.' Despite growing up in a shared bedroom in their Jehova's Witness mother's home in Streatham, south London, the twins grew apart as teenagers, she added. While Jalila became involved in London's nightclub scene, often staying out until the early hours of the morning, her more reserved sister devoted herself to the Koran. She had converted to Islam while at secondary school where 'it was the ""in"" thing to do,' her sister said. Jalila, who lives in Balham, south London, said she was disappointed her sister had returned to Syria . Jalila (left) said her sister (right) described Syria as 'beautiful'. The young mother fled to the region after the breakdown of her first marriage to a Muslim Turkish Cypriot . At 18, Jamila married and had a child in the UK. She and her husband became estranged and the increasingly devout youngster fled to Syria with their son. There she is thought to have married an ISIS militant before returning to Britain in December. Upon her arrival she was questioned by police over alleged links to the terror group but was never charged. She returned to the war-torn region alone earlier this year and was picked up by Turkish authorities as she tried to re-enter Syria. Counter terrorism police  picked her up at Luton Airport on Thursday. Speaking of her sister's stints in Syria, Jalila said she thought fondly of the country despite its ongoing turmoil. British teenagers Shamima Begun, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana walk through security at Gatwick airport before boarding a flight to Turkey in February . The girls were later captured on Turkish CCTV preparing to board a bus headed towards the Syrian border . 'She said it was beautiful... she showed me pictures of all the amazing food they made and the house they lived in. 'God knows what was in her mind when she got up and left again. She promised she would never go back.' Last week the pair's mother said she was planning to meet with relatives to discuss her daughter's arrest. Sharmeena Begum was named as the first of four Bethnal Green Academy schoolgirls to have fled home to join ISIS . Jamila was remanded in custody this morning following a brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Her case will be heard at the Old Bailey on April 7. She was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism but has not been charged. She has not entered a plea with regard to one charge of possessing an identity document with intent. It comes after five teenage girls who took an interest in Syria were banned from travelling abroad amid fears more British youngsters are planning to join the terror organisation. The girls, two of whom are 15 and three 16, had their passports removed by a High Court judge yesterday after concerns over their alleged plans were raised by a local authority. The adults responsible for them were also stripped of their passports.  The previous day a 16-year-old boy from Brighton was also banned from travelling abroad following the deaths of his older brothers, both killed in Syria. Earlier three teenage boys were thrown out of the country after being picked up in Istanbul as they tried to cross the border. Their British parents phoned police after the boys, aged 17 and 19, went missing. Their arrival back in the UK came as footage of three north London schoolgirls who had earlier left the country to join frontline militants emerged. In February Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, all fled to Syria. The girls were captured on CCTV in the UK and in Turkey where they are thought to have been ushered over the border by an ISIS 'fixer' who provided them with false documents. Sharmeena Begum, who went to the same school as the girls in Bethnal Green, travelled to the region before them. Messages and images on Jamila's mobile phone suggested she was planning to head to Islamic State territory. Pictured is an ISIS member in the Syrian city of Raqqa .

"Donna Savigar was eating breakfast at a Newcastle-under-Lyme branch of McDonald's when she found a screw in her sausage and egg McMuffin (above) A grandmother who discovered a metal screw in her £3.39 McDonald's breakfast is 'outraged' after staff did not offer her a refund. Donna Savigar ordered a sausage and egg McMuffin at a Newcastle-under-Lyme branch of the fast food chain around 9.45am on Friday. The 45-year-old was three-quarters of the way through her sandwich when she felt metal crunch between her teeth and spat out a screw. Donna's daughter Dayna Bennett, 20, went to complain about the dangerous nail - but staff said they could only make her a fresh one. Ms Savigar, who works for a charity, said: 'I could have ended up choking to death - imagine if it had happened to a child. 'A child would start choking and you wouldn't know what to do because you certainly wouldn't be expecting them to have swallowed a screw in the middle of McDonald's. 'I don't see why they don't just pay up. All I was looking for was a refund.' The mother-of-one, from Halmer End, said she complained to headquarters but couldn't receive a refund until they had done a thorough investigation. She added: 'They need to train staff to deal with that sort of situation. A manager needs to come over and deal with it. 'We weren't offered a refund and we weren't even told how we could go about complaining to McDonald's about it, we had to Google that for ourselves. Scroll down for video . 'I had already eaten three-quarters of the burger when I felt something weird in between my teeth. 'Your first instinct is to spit it out, so I did, and I couldn't believe it. It was about an inch big and quite fat.' The mother-of-one (above), from Halmer End, said she complained to headquarters but couldn't receive a refund until they had done a thorough investigation . Ms Bennett, who works as a carer and lives in Alsagers Bank, Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'It was absolutely outrageous. 'Imagine if it had been a child who ate it, they could have choked to death. Donna's daughter Dayna Bennett (left above), 20, went to complain about the dangerous nail - but staff did not offer a refund and instead suggested making a fresh McMuffin . 'We had gone in for a quick breakfast because we were going out shopping for the day. Mum was eating her McMuffin and then started making a funny face and then spat out the nail. 'I took a picture straight away so no one could say we had planted it there and then took the McMuffin back to the counter. 'They just took it away, I don't know what they did with it. Then they just asked if we wanted a fresh one. 'I said no and went back over to my mum. I couldn't believe they hadn't offered us a refund, but we didn't go and ask again because we just wanted to get out of there by that point. 'I've never been to McDonald's before and I won't be going back.' McDonald's confirmed it is investigating. A spokesman said: 'We are sorry for Ms Bennett's experience when visiting our restaurant. 'Food safety and quality are our highest priority and both our restaurants and our suppliers place great emphasis on quality control and follow rigorous standards in order to avoid imperfections in our products. 'An investigation is underway following the reporting of this incident and our Customer Service department will be in touch with Ms Bennett to keep her updated.' The embarrassing incident comes days after another McDonald's diner, April Gilmour, 24, discovering beard trimmings in her breakfast McMuffin, in Kilmarnock.","Donna Savigar ordered breakfast at branch in Newcastle-under-Lyme .

"Those from noteworthy families often feel entitled to abuse young people according to Robert Montagu, the son of the 10th Earl of Sandwich who was abused by his own father as a boy. He made the comments at the Oxford Literary Festival while discussing his book, A Humour Of Love, in which he reveals years of abuse, including a single rape, carried out by father Victor. Mr Montagu said that, during his years at Eton, rape was common, adding that people with 'entitled backgrounds' were given 'more opportunities' to be abusive towards children. Robert Montagu, son of the 10th Earl of Sandwich, suffered years of abuse by his father. Speaking at a Literary festival in Oxford, he said 'noteworthy families' often feel entitled to abuse people . In a report for The Times, he said: 'People from noteworthy families do feel a sense of entitlement. 'It is true that people from an entitled background have more opportunities, maybe circumstances have made it more likely that they will abuse. 'We used to have this ethos that you just kept quiet about things in your life. At school you were taught the stiff upper lip. Thank goodness we got rid of that lip.' Mr Montagu was abused by his father (pictured) from the age of seven to 11, including a single instance of rape . Mr Montagu has talked in the past about how a loving relationship with his father turned to abuse when he was aged seven. It began after his mother, Rosemary Peto, goddaughter of Queen Maud of Norway, left the family home, and he believes his father used it as a way to cope with the loss. He wrote about being groomed by his father, as hugs and tickles gave way to kisses, which in turn gave way to serial and serious abuse. In a previous interview, he said: ‘It was what we did every day. It was accepted that I would always go to his room at half past seven in the morning until quarter to nine. ‘I felt I was fulfilling a function of my mother who was missing. It was my duty, to some extent, to be in the position I was in and that is the reason I did not resist. 'That feeling was hinted at by my father, by sometimes making comments comparing me to my mother. 'He never said it in outright terms – we never discussed what he was doing in any terms whatsoever – but it was implicit that I was helping him emotionally.' At the time of the book's publication, in September last year, he said it would likely sour relations between himself and his elder brother John, the 11th earl, who is also a peer in the House of Lords. Speaking now, he says his family are 'cross and unhappy' with his book, and that he is given dark looks at family events, and hug which are then turned into pushes. However, he has repeatedly stated that he felt the story needed to be told, after he revealed the abuse to his mother and family doctor as a young boy, only for it to be swept under the rug. Mr Montagu has previously told how, every morning, he would be called to his father's room at the family home at Mapperton, in Dorset (pictured), and would stay there from 7.30 until 8.45am . He said that following his confession he expected his father to be taken to jail, but nothing was done, and Mr Montagu was even returned to his care, though the abuse stopped. Mr Montagu says there were other victims, beside himself, and that he has personally spoken to ten of them - though believes there could be another ten he has yet to identify. Asked why there was such a reluctance for her father's story to be told, his daughter Fiamma said: 'In our case it has been because of the Establishment. Everybody has a vested interest in getting him to shut up.","Robert Montagu made remarks while discussing book telling of his abuse .

"Getting devoured by an army of angry ants isn’t something most people would volunteer for. But 27-year-old YouTube sensation Andrew Ucles, who hails from Wollongong, south of Sydney, is not your average Joe. In a peculiar new video uploaded to his channel this week, the animal enthusiast lies on a large meat ant nest in a dubious bid to walk in the shoes of an echidna.

"This is the terrifying moment a driver went the wrong way round a busy roundabout and almost caused an accident. Dash-cam footage shows a silver Toyota Yaris heading onto the A14 roundabout in Cambridge and going through traffic lights from the wrong side.

The person who took it said: 'I spotted someone going the wrong way around the roundabout. 'I think this is probably a genuine mistake as it seems they tried to rectify it as soon as possible. 'I go around that roundabout often and have often mentioned that the lanes are poorly marked and people have told me they agree that it needs some updating.'

"A Mexican trying to enter the US for a heart and liver transplant has been denied a visa for the second time, he and his family announced Wednesday. Jose Chua Lopez, 20, has suffered from a heart defect from birth and was hoping to enter the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where he has an appointment in 10 days. 'My world has fallen down,' Chua said. 'This needs to be fixed quickly.' World has fallen: Jose Chua Lopez, 20, and his mother, Myra Lopez Martinez, said he had been denied a visa for the second time that would have allowed him to seek treatment for heart and liver conditions . His mother, Myra Lopez Martinez, said her son could die if he cannot receive the transplants. A spokeswoman for the State Department, Jen Psaki, said people at the department are looking into the case, though the department did not have a comment on Chua's case. Consejo de Latinos Unidos, which is based in the US where it helps uninsured people secure medical care, stepped in to try to get Chua to the Mayo Clinic. The organization's director, Kevin Forbes, said the case was mishandled at the US Consulate in the northern city of Hermosillo, where Chua lives. He said that consulate officials processed an application for a tourist visa when they should have told Chua to apply for a humanitarian visa and that they then failed for weeks to respond to queries about his status. 'We have dealt with around two dozen similar international cases,' Forbes said. 'They have never denied us a visa. It's the first time this has happened.' Struggle: Chua's friends and family raised $15,000 to pay for an evaluation leading up to the treatment, and though the operation could millions more, Chua's mother says they will try . Weakened: Chua's heart has only one ventricle, which causes circulation problems, and at this point, in spite of several heart surgeries, his liver has also been damaged . Come together: Chua and his family have held fundraisers, such as Coffee for a Life, where several musical acts played to raise money for the treatments . Big hopes: Chua wants to overcome his health problems and hopes to become a doctor . Long road ahead: Chua's family says the transplant will cost much more, and even as they are looking for help to fund it, they are unsure about how to pay the high cost . Forbes said the family would file a visa application on humanitarian grounds shortly and he hopes the problem will be resolved in two or three days. He called the situation an 'absolute abomination.' Chua's heart has only one ventricle, causing circulation problems that mean blood reaches only one of the four chambers, said Dr Ernesto Duarte, who treats him. Chua underwent three open-heart surgeries between the ages of 5 months and 12 years, including a cardiac implant that stopped working properly in 2013. At this point Chua's liver has also been damaged, so he needs a double-organ transplant, a procedure that is not performed in his home country. 'The experience in Mexico for a transplant of that complexity is nil,' Duarte said, adding that 'nobody can be sure that he won't deteriorate at any moment.' The doctor added that in severe cases, not performing the surgery in time can make a transplant impossible later. Chua, whose father is an Arizona resident, had a US visa until he was 15. But when it expired, his family didn't renew it because they didn't have money to pay for more trips. The family currently lives in a modest, one-story home in a potholed suburb of Hermosillo, capital of Sonora state. He shares a room with his brother. Thin and pale with his body swollen from his condition and marked by scars from his operations, Chua is nevertheless active and optimistic about the future. He dreams of becoming a doctor, even though his health problems have so far made it impossible to attend college, work or stand up for long periods. Family and friends in Hermosillo organized fundraisers, sold tamales, hamburgers and seafood and held raffles to defray the initial cost of his potential treatment at the Mayo Clinic. 'We needed $15,000 and we put together a little bit more, just for the evaluation' said Lopez. 'Afterward, the double transplant would cost around $2 million... For now, I don't want to think about that.'","Jose Chua Lopez, 20, has an appointment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota in 10 days .

"The White House sent a stern message on Monday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with President Obama's chief of staff declaring that Tel Aviv 'must end' a 47-year policy of holding contested territory that Palestinians claim as their own. 'An occupation that has lasted for almost than 50 years must end,' Denis McDonough told an annual convention of 'J Street,' a left-wing Jewish advocacy group, in Washington, D.C. Obama himself did not attend, but sent McDonough to read a speech in his stead while he attended a science fair for schoolchildren at the White House and gave brief remarks to an investment summit. 'An occupation that has lasted for almost 50 years must end,' said McDonough, his eyes often glued to his paper. 'And the Palestinian people must have the right to live in and govern themselves in their own sovereign state.' 'Palestinian children deserve the same right to be free in their own land as Israeli children in their land,' he declared later to applause. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Obama Chief of Staff Denis McDonough spoke at the annual meeting of J Street, a liberal Jewish group, insisting that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu withdraw his objection to Palestinian statehood . MISSED THE DEADLINE: J Street's printed program left open the possibility that President Obama might have delivered the speech, but he had declined to address the more conservative AIPAC group three weeks ago . MIXED SIGNALS: The White House has excoriated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netnyahu and negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran while simultaneously insisting it's a strong ally to Tel Aviv . The printed program said only that a 'US administration speaker' would address the crowd. Had the president delivered the message himself, comparisons would have instantly been made to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, J Street's conservative counterpart, which Obama snubbed during the week when Netanyahu was in the U.S. to deliver a speech to Congress. But Obama managed to be elsewhere, leaving McDonough to walk on stage to the sound of The Who's 'Teenage Wasteland' – whose fourth stanza opens with, 'The Exodus is here / The happy ones are near.' He immediately grabbed the liberal crowd's attention with news that the president 'has appointed more women, minorities, and openly gay judges' than any other Oval Office occupant. But it was mention of a 'two-state solution' to the decades-old Arab-Israeli conflict that brought the disproportionately young crowd, seeded wth raucous college students, to its feet. 'President Obama asked me to convey his deep appreciation to all of you for your partnership and your work on behalf of the U.S.-Israel relationship,' McDonough said near the beginning of his speech. 'especially building support for our efforts to advance a two-state solution.' Netanyahu, now poised for another four years as prime ministrer, pledged before last week's Israeli elections that with his Likud Party in power, he would refuse to allow the Palestinian Authority to graduate to full statehood. He qualified that promise after his come-from-behind victory on Election Day, saying conditions on the ground would have to change before he would consider approving a Palestinian state. The PA, he said, would have to break with Hamas and other terror groups, and stop firing rockets into Israel. The White House focused Monday on Netanyahu's pre-election vow, saying that 'we cannot simply pretend that these comments were never made.' The Obama administration, like others before it, supports the idea of Israeli and Palestinian states coexisting on adjacent lands. But unlike past presidents, Obama's testy relationship with his Israeli counterpart has brought him to the verge of taking action. BUSY, BUSY, BUSY: President Barack Obama sent his chief of staff to deliver an ultimatum to Israel while he presided over a science fair in the East Room at the White House . ENTHUSIASTIC: Liberal Jews, led by college students on Spring Break, erupted into applause at the mention of a two-state solution . TENSIONS: Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas (right) argues – and J Street agrees – that Israel is encroaching on his people's lands with settlements (left) built by Netanyahu's government . The U.S. has for decades used its permanent-member veto on the United Nations Security Council to block resolutions demanding Palestinian statehood. That, White House officials signaled las tweek, could soon change. McDOnough followed his saber-rattling in Netanyahu's direction with a calmer assurance that 'no matter who leads Israel, America’s commitment to Israeli national security will never waver.' That was meant to be a salve for Jews who fear a nuclear-armed Iran less than 1,000 miles away, an outcome the White House says it's trying to avoid with secret negotiations conducted in Switzerland. The U.S., McDonough said, 'will do everything in our power to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.' 'The deal we are pursuing is both realistic and achievable,' he said of the bilateral talks, which Netanyahu and congressional Republicans in Washington have criticized as a tool of appeasement that's too soft on Tehran. 'A scenario where Iran forgoes domestic enrichment capacity for all time would surely be ideal, but it’s not grounded in reality,' McDonough declared. 'Not even our closest partners support denying Iran the ability to pursue peaceful nuclear energy forever, and Iran already knows how to enrich uranium.' 'We can’t turn back the clock on that,' he said.","President Obama didn't personally address the annual meeting of 'J Street,' Washington's most influential left-wing Jewish group .

"Food hygiene is so poor in more than 500 hospitals, care homes and nurseries that they have been ordered to take action to improve. More than 250 kitchens require major or urgent improvement after being rated one-star or lower, the standard of hygiene usually associated with the worst kebab vans. It raises fears that patients, children and the elderly risk illness from meals served by public service kitchens and sparks calls for urgent action to address the problem. More than 250 kitchens require major or urgent improvement after being rated one-star or lower, the standard of hygiene usually associated with the worst kebab vans . Under the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme, establishments preparing and serving food are given a star rating for hygiene. Public health minister Jane Ellison said it 'provides transparency to consumers on hygiene standards in places where they eat or buy food'. The best rated sites are given five stars and a named 'very good'. Four stars awarded for 'good' levels of hygiene, and three stars for being 'generally satisfactory'. However, two stars mean improvement is required, one star means 'major improvement required' and zero stars suggests 'urgent action required'. According to figures released in Parliament, more than 500 hospitals, childcare and caring premises have been given two or fewer stars. The Food Standards Agency says its ratings scheme 'will help you choose where to eat out or shop for food' It includes 242 given two stars, 255 one star and six given no stars at all. A further 1,467 are only 'generally satisfactory'. The ratings are awarded by council inspectors. Luciana Berger, Labour's shadow public health minister, said: 'It is not acceptable that over 500 hospitals, childcare and caring premises have been told to improve their food hygiene. 'Everyone using these public services should have the right to expect food that has been prepared safely, in a clean environment. 'The Government must hold these premises to account on the urgent action they must now take to address these serious failings in standards.' Lciana Berger, Labour's shadow public health minister, said was 'not acceptable' that over 500 hospitals, childcare and caring premises have been told to improve their food hygiene . The Food Standards Agency says its ratings scheme 'will help you choose where to eat out or shop for food by giving you information about the hygiene standards in restaurants, pubs, cafes, takeaways, hotels, and other places you eat out'. But people admitted to hospital will not have the same degree of choice, and most will be forced to eat the meals served or rely on friends and family to boy food from outside. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'These figures show 98.6 per cent of kitchens in hospitals and care facilities are performing well – the second highest number of all industries in the UK. However there are a small number that need to improve and we expect local services to take strong action on this.' At the inspection, the officer will check: . * how hygienically the food is handled – how it is prepared, cooked, re-heated, cooled and stored . * the condition of the structure of the buildings – the cleanliness, layout, lighting, ventilation and other facilities . * how the business manages what it does to make sure food is safe and so that the officer can be confident standards will be maintained in the future . The hygiene standards found at the time of inspection are then rated on a scale. At the bottom of the scale is '0' – this means urgent improvement is required. At the top of the scale is '5' – this means the hygiene standards are very good. Source: food.gov.uk .","EXCLUSIVE: Patients and elderly risk illness from public service kitchens .

"Northumbria chief constable Sue Sim, pictured, is being investigated about the way she treats senior officers under her command . The top police officer in the hunt for cop-killer Raoul Moat is being investigated for bullying male officers who are allegedly terrified of receiving her Alex Ferguson-style hair dryer treatment. Northumbria's Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird is currently looking into claims that chief constable Sue Sim has left her senior officers demoralised over the candid manner she delivers critical assessments. Less than one in four chief constables in England and Wales are women. Northumbria Police told Mail Online that they were unwilling to discuss the situation. One source told The Times: 'One woman has all these grown men walking on eggshells because they're terrified of her. She's a heart on her sleeve person but the knives seem to be out for her.' Her style has been compared to her predecessor Sir John Stevens who delivered what have been described as legendary 'b**********' to the officers under his command. Chief Constable Sim came to public prominence during the hunt for crazed killer Raoul Moat in 2010 when she held her position in a temporary capacity. Speaking in September 2011, the six-foot tall police chief revealed she had received sexist criticism during the manhunt and was the subject of cruel jokes. Addressing a North East women's business conference, Chief Constable Sim said: 'It was quite hurtful to read what the media said about my hair and make-up, and them making comparisons with Margaret Beckett. 'I can't imagine that they would have done the same if I was a short fat man. 'I work in a male dominated environment, so there have been obstacles simply because I'm a woman, but it also helps that I'm a six foot woman, so that makes it easier to stand my ground. 'But I had an important job to and I had to get on with it.' PCC Baird confirmed the chief constable is under investigation. She said: 'Over the past few days, I have sought clarification about the issues raised by some officers. I am no clear that they wish to make complaints against the chief constable of Northumbria Police which merit investigation. 'The first step in the statutory process in such a situation is for me to assess the severity of any such complaint and I have done so. 'I have told the chief constable that there is a prima facie case to be investigated as to whether she is guilty of misconduct. 'The nature of the complaint to be investigated is that the chief constable may have fallen short of her tudy as a police officer to treat her colleagues with respect and courtesy.' PCC Baird confirmed that chief constable Sim has not been suspended and the probe does not involve gross misconduct. Chief constable Sim confirmed she will assist the investigation into her conduct but was unable to comment further. Chief constable Sim's style has been compared with the hairdryer treatment delivered by Alex Ferguson .","Chief constable Sue Sim is under investigation over her management style .

"Known at the time as 'America's sweetheart', Katie Couric was NBC's star. And in their moment of need, the station is reportedly trying to recapture that magic. According to a series of reports, the 58-year-old newscaster is in talks with incoming chairman Andrew Lack to make a return by replacing disgraced anchor Brian Williams on the Nightly News. NBC has yet to respond to DailyMail.com's request for a comment. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lined up? Katie Couric is allegedly in talks with NBC chairman Andrew Lack to discuss replacing Brian Williams on the Nightly News. Williams is currently suspended without pay for allegedly fabricating anecdotes . 'It makes sense (that she could come back) because she is so closely associated with the brand,' a source  The New York Daily News. 'She and Andy are close friends, but this is still only in the most preliminary stages.' It is possible that Couric could be lined up for other roles at NBC such as hosting the ratings-poor Today show or working as a 'special correspondent' in a 'Barbara Walters-type role', notes Brian Stelter, author of Top Of The Morning: Inside The Cut-Throat World Of Morning TV. Writing for CNN, Stelter says Couric is one of many A-list reporters that harbor a close relationship with NBC's returning chairman Andrew Lack - who is credited with masterminding her rise to fame. He writes: 'Lack has a special knack for working with A-list television anchors -- he knows how to massage egos, how to manage internal rivalries, how to pair anchors and producers. 'A 1999 profile of Lack in Brill's Content said ""a number of on-air talent and top executives have asked to link their contracts with Lack's -- saying, essentially, ""I don't want to be here if it isn't Andy."" Making a return? Couric, 58, (pictured with Today's Matt Lauer) became a star on NBC's Today show . America's sweetheart: Since being known as America's sweetheart, she has worked at CBS and 60 Minutes . 'And one of the stars he's stayed in touch with, through the decades, is Couric.' The alleged talks come after Williams, 55, was suspended without pay for allegedly fabricating anecdotes about the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina in news reports and interviews. Lester Holt and Savannah Guthrie are temporarily holding the spot until Williams is reinstated or a replacement is found this summer. Couric, who is now at Yahoo News, left NBC in 2006 after 15 years presenting Today. She worked at CBS Evening News until 2011, while also doing segments for 60 Minutes for a reported salary of $15 million a year - the most ever for a journalist at the time. The meeting comes as NBC tries to fumble its way back into viewers' hearts after the scandal surrounding Brian Williams' fabricated anecdotes. Williams, 55, is currently suspended without pay as a team investigates claims he lied in reports about the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina, among others. In 2011, Couric was allegedly in talks to return to Today to reunite with her former co-host Matt Lauer - a move that was never realized. According to Stelter, in his book Top Of The Morning, Couric said at the time: 'I feel like it would have been a fun thing to reunite and to show that you can go home again. 'But I also thought, there's a reason why I left the show.' Her most famous interview came in 2008 when she sat down with vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin for a series of pieces that many believed doomed Palin and McCain's campaign. In was during that interview that Palin famously talked about Alaska's proximity to Russia and was unable to name a single magazine she read on a regular basis, instead telling Couric; 'Um, all of them, any of them that have been in front of me all these years.' Palin would later claim that Couric had a bias against her. Couric left CBS in 2011 to go work as a special corespondent at ABC, where she did segments for Nightline and 20/20 and filled in on all their morning programs at some point: The View, Live with Kelly and Good Morning America. Then, in 2012, she launched her own talk show, Katie, on ABC, which was cancelled after just two seasons in 2014. After leaving ABC there were rumors she might rejoin Today as the show was struggling in the ratings.","Couric, 58, rose to fame on NBC's Today from 1991 to 2006 .

"Not many people were more excited for the first day of spring - weather in sync or not - than Jillian Tenen. The 29-year-old events planner moved to Boston from Florida two years ago and doesn't have any family in town. When the first of many record-breaking snowfalls dumped down on the city in January, Tenen was sick with the flu, and didn't dig out her 2007 Honda Civic. Only the snow didn't stop, and the street plows only pushed more mounds in and around where her car was parked in Bay Village. By the time Tenen got her shovel out, it was all-but too late. 'I'm 5' 2,' and it was all ice, an iceberg on top of my car,' Tenen told The Boston Globe. 'I couldn't reach it. I couldn't lift it. And even if I could, there was nowhere to put it. I just didn't know what to do.' After a few laughs, quite a lot of tears, and at lease one breakdown, Tenen realized she had no choice but to abandon her car until winter passed. It's under the iceberg: Jillian Tenen was sick with the flu during the first big snow of winter in Boston in winter, and after failing to dig out her car, it ended up under this mountain of snow on Isabella Street in the Bay Village neighborhood . There it is: Recently, some of the 'iceberg' began to clear and the car - or at least its shape - became a little more clear . Not again: But with this winter being Boston's snowiest ever, the heavens kept opening and the car kept getting buried . Bleak: Jillian Tenen's car is seen parked on Isabella Street in Boston on February 23, 2015. Winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of Boston's history . Clearing up: Jillian Tenen's car went through weeks of storms and melting snow, staying frozen in place at the same on-street parking spot . Almost there: By last week - March 12 - and after two months almost, the Honda Civic was almost ready to escape its cave . Finally!: On March 16, Jillian Tenen's was finally back on the road, seven weeks after it was first snowed in . Yay! All-smiles, Jillian Tenen finally got behind the wheel of her car on March 18, and was shocked that it started right away . But after seven weeks, and a heap of chipping, the car has finally freed from its icy cave. Sadly not much could be done about the damage. The windscreen buckled under the weight of the snow and is all smashed up. There were also deep dents in the roof. But, surprisingly, the car started on the first go after it had thawed. Tenen said her insurance company will now assess the damage. While she hopes that future winters won't be so severe, and will plow her car diligently from now on, she learnt a valuable lesson. 'If I had to do it again, I would definitely do one thing differently,' she told The Globe. 'I would not park on the corner.' Although the storm didn't cripple Boston as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary residents . Damage: The weight of the snow and ice smashed the windscreen and dented the roof quite badly, but Tenen is filing an insurance claim . Many people in the northeastern US had to put on winter boots as Winter Storm Ultima hijacked the first official day of spring . The Brooklyn Bridge was coated with snow as New York City was hit with yet another snowstorm on Friday, March 20 . Brooklyn residents had to bundle up and deal with the cold even though Friday was the first day of spring . Spring arrived on Friday, but Winter Storm Ultima ensured that winter would have at least one more go around with snow . Snow will continue to fall in some parts of the country throughout the weekend . Winter Storm Ultima may have cause more issues for Tenen and her car on Friday. Although the storm didn't cripple the city as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary Boston. In the city, it's par for the course to pick up another 3 to 4 inches of snow after March 20, Weather.com reported. During the April Fools' Blizzard of 1997, 25.4 inches of snow in just 24 hours paralyzed Boston. On Friday, Ultima led to some travel advisories and early school dismissals . Weather.com meteorologist Jon Erdman said: 'While late March surface temperatures and Ultima's quick movement won't make this a blockbuster, some fairly impressive snowfall rates today will likely lead to at least a slushy afternoon commute in parts of the New York City and Philadelphia metros. The storm dumped 7.3 inches of snow in Lynnport, Pennsylvania, 6.7 inches at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey and six inches in Cascade, Maryland.","Winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of Boston's history .

"The devastated owners of a rental property left with $20,000 worth of damage are desperately trying to track down the tenants who they believe left it in a disgusting state of disrepair. Val Douskova discovered her Heathridge house, in Perth, Western Australia, covered in obscene graffiti and its windows smashed when she returned to it on Friday. Alongside drawings of male genitalia and phrases such as ‘f**k you’ scrawled across the walls and fridge, Mrs Douskova also found egg yolk on the walls and a kitchen sink stinking of urine. Photos of the destruction show rubbish all over the floors, including pizza boxes, empty takeaway boxes and torn up paper. The last couple that lived in the property also allegedly owe Mrs Douskova over $4,000 in rent after they stopped paying it in December. Val Douskova discovered her Heathridge house, in Perth, Western Australia, destroyed when she drove past it on Friday . The house was covered in obscene graffiti and its windows smashed after the former tenants moved out . The devastated owners, who are experienced in property management, have been lumped with a $20,000 repair bill . Mrs Douskova and her husband spent three months trying to evict the couple, who are named on the lease as Jeff De Florenca and Marit Johansen, before a court order was issued. Bills at the house show their names spelt with three different variations. But the family reportedly fled leaving the horrific mess before the sheriff bailiffs came to the house to evict them. Mrs Douskova’s son Peter Dousek told Daily Mail Australia the couple first moved in on a six month contract on June 10 2012. He explained that his parents are very experienced in property management and had run all the appropriate credit checks. On December 11 2012, they signed a 12 month rental agreement and then on December 12 2013 automatically went on a verbal periodic tenancy agreement. 'Everything was good for two years and my dad did frequent inspections... he was regularly over the house doing bits and pieces,' Mr Dousek said. On January 4 2014, the couple were given a notice for not paying rent. The owners are desperately trying to track down the tenants who they believe left it in a disgusting state of disrepair .

Then in December 5 2014 they started not paying their rent again. The landlords issued a notice and eventually took the matter to court. On March 3, Peter’s mother drove past the house and found the property abandoned. ‘When my mum walked into the property she found the place turned upside down and trashed,’ Mr Dousek said.

'Landlord insurance doesn't cover everything, there are a lot of costs that aren't covered... there are also such massive flaws in tenancy laws,' Mr Douesek said.

"Money troubles may have been the motive behind what friends believe was a shocking suicide pact that saw Jerry Springer producer Jill Blackstone survive after the death of her disabled sister, Wendy and their three dogs. Blackstone was deep in debt and filed for bankruptcy just three years ago, court papers uncovered by Daily Mail Online reveal. And Jill owed Wendy Blackstone, the deaf and blind sister who died of asphyxiation on March 14, more than $122,000 for a loan, the papers reveal. Blackstone was recently forced to sell the three-bedroom, two-bath house that she and her sister had called home for eight years, although they continued to live in it as the new owners awaited permission to demolish and rebuild. Motive? Money troubles may have been the bottom of what police and friends believe was a shocking suicide pact that saw Jerry Springer producer Jill Blackstone (left) survive after the death of her disabled sister, Wendy (right) 'She couldn't get the money she wanted,' one neighbor told Daily Mail Online exclusively. 'So she listed the house for less — under a million — and when it sold, I imagine that's when she became desperate.' Public records reveal that Blackstone put the single story house in Studio City, in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, on the market in November for $950,000. It sold within a month for the full asking price. She had bought the house in 2007 for $930,000. Papers filed in her 2012 bankruptcy reveal she was paying $5,055 a month in mortgage payments — more than 60% of her total income. Shimon Ben, an agent for the new owners, refused to talk to Daily Mail Online about whether the sale of the house was connected to the apparent suicide pact. 'Don't ask me questions, do me a favor,' Ben said before hanging up the phone. Blackstone, 52, was arrested after her sister was found dead in the garage of the Landale Street house. Police told TMZ they believe Jill intended to kill herself along with Wendy and their three dogs. Paramedics arrived at the scene to find Wendy and the dogs dead. They were killed by carbon monoxide fumes coming from a barbecue grill placed at Wendy's feet. Attempts to resuscitate Wendy, 49, who was grasping a handwritten suicide note believed to have been written by her sister, failed. But Jill apparently woke up and had a change of heart about killing herself. She called a friend who then dialed 911. Jill Blackstone was hospitalized for two days with carbon monoxide poisoning. After treatment she was charged with first-degree murder and held on $1 million bail, but she was released from custody on Wednesday of last week and the charges were dropped. Do not disturb: Public records reveal that Blackstone put the single story house in Studio City, in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, on the market in November for $950,000. It sold within a month for the full asking price. She had bought the house in 2007 for $930,000 but she has yet to move out . Police told Daily Mail Online the investigation into Wendy's death is still ongoing and would not comment on whether her money woes were part of the probe. Jill was spotted returning in tears to the home where her sister died on Thursday. The neighbor says she and others on the small cul de sac where many homes are being demolished and rebuilt are angry at what they believe to be Blackstone's actions. 'That was not the answer to her problems,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'She was trying to find a foundation that would help them and help financially take care of her sister, but I don't think she got very far. 'No-one had to die over money. There had to be other options.' The neighbor said the two women always looked depressed. 'You could see it in them whenever they were outside in the yard or walking the dogs. These were not happy women.' Papers entered in court in support of her bankruptcy showed Jill Blackstone was $1.4 million in debt when she filed in August 2012. Her total assets were listed at only half that figure. She claimed she was disputing a $300,000 debt owed to Mad Men hair stylist Lucia Mace and her husband from a 2010 injury claim. However, when Daily Mail Online contacted the three-time-Emmy winner, Mace said: 'I have no idea what you are talking about,' claiming she had never heard of Blackstone. She then hung up. They sisters continued to live in the home as new owners awaited permission to demolish and rebuild . The papers showed Jill Blackstone owed Wendy $122,126.33 for a 2010 loan. She also owed another relative $4,000. Her bankruptcy papers show that Blackstone was drowning in debt, constantly spending more each month than she was bringing in. She said she earned $7,431 a month after tax with a further $826 coming from her disabled sister's social security. Blackstone, who had produced episodes of the Sally Jessy Raphael Show and the Rosie O'Donnell Show as well as The Jerry Springer Show, listed total monthly expenses at $8,967 — $709 more than she earned. She said her cash in hand at the time came to just $40, with her two bank accounts containing a mere $904.31. And her debts, many from store credit cards, were mounting. She owed $520 on her Banana Republic card; $798 on her Barneys New York card; $103 on her Bloomingdale's card and $172 on her Gap card. But those debts were tiny compared to bank credit cards. She owed more than $27,000 on her Chase MasterCard, the court papers reveal, a further $3,850 on her CitiCard MasterCard, $1,800 on her Credit One MasterCard; $7,400 to GE Care Credit, and nearly $4,000 on two PayPal accounts. Medical bills too were piling up as she detailed more than $2,800 owed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, a further $13,000 to UCLA Medical Center, $4.300 to a New York orthopedic surgeon, $2,000 to a dentist and $400 to endodontist  along with a further $560 owed to the Jules Stein Eye Institute. Other debts included nearly $5,500 to her accountants, $12,000 for a loan on her 2010 Toyota Prius and more than $1,000 to her lawyer.

She owed more than $4,800 to the Northridge Animal Hospital and a further $4,300 to the Veterinary Medical Center in Studio City. The neighbor said the fact that Blackstone rescued pets and found them good homes made the decision to take her dogs' lives along with her sister's even more unexplainable. Through tears, the neighbor said: 'The dogs didn't have to die. 'That was the most selfish, evil things she could have done. Her neighbors are just furious. I'm so angry I'm spitting bullets. 'She loved her dogs desperately. They were her world. So why would she do that? It breaks my heart, it really does. It sickens me.' The court papers show Blackstone's bankruptcy was discharged on November 13, 2012, three months after she filed.","Money troubles may have been the motive behind what police and friends believe was a shocking suicide pact between Jill Blackstone and her sister .

"Charles Greene, 52, was charged with aggravated murder, murder, aggravated robbery and kidnapping . Ohio police have arrested a man they suspect killed an elderly woman he sometimes worked for by stuffing her into a wishing well and leaving her to die. Charles Greene was arrested by police in Columbus on Saturday and charged with killing Alyce Seff, 81, at a rental property she owned in German Village in July of 2008. Greene, 52, was charged in Franklin County Common Pleas Court with aggravated murder, murder, aggravated robbery and kidnapping. One of Seff's neighbors found the landlady stuffed upside-down into the wooden well on the unoccupied property. The decomposition of the body indicated Seff  slowly asphyxiated over the course of three or four days. There was blood splattered on a wall near the well, according to 10 TV. A search of the area did not turn up anything that could have been used as a weapon. Police think money was the motive for the murder as Seff was known to carry around a lot of cash. Alyce Seff, 81, was found in a wishing well at a rental property she owned in Columbus, Ohio, in July of 2008 . A neighbor found Seff's body stuffed into the wooden well and there was blood splattered on a wall nearby . Greene became a suspect after Seff's credit cards were found in his possession and her 1993 Ford Escort was discovered near his home after her death, the Columbus Dispatch reported. Columbus Sgt. Christ Holzhauser called it a 'sick death'. He said: 'She basically was left in a decorative well in the backyard and left there to die, and we have no idea how long.' 'She suffered.' Four detectives worked on the case, although two of them are now retired. Greene has a criminal record which dates back to 1981 and includes charges of burglary, theft and drugs, NBC4i reported.","Charles Greene was arrested by police in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday .

"Sheena Keynna appeared to be texting  as she walked around the crossing gates and was hit . A 27-year-old woman had a miraculous escape after walking into a moving freight train while texting on her mobile phone. Sheena Keynna was hit by the train on Monday afternoon as she walked around the crossing gates and into the path of the passing freight train in Lakeland in central Florida. Police Sgt. Gary Gross told the Ledger of Lakeland the woman 'wasn't paying attention.' She suffered a compound fracture to her right arm, and her right leg was injured. She was taken to a hospital, but no additional information was available.

"Sony has unveiled an Internet subscription TV service that includes live feeds from major broadcast networks, mounting a challenge to traditional cable TV firms. PlayStation Vue, a cloud-based TV service, will initially be available in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia to customers with the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 game consoles, and later to customers with Apple iPads. The offering from the Japanese electronic giant is one of a range of new TV services aimed at challenging the cable TV giants and their large bundled programming. PlayStation Vue, a cloud-based TV service, will initially be available in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia to customers with the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 game consoles, and later to customers with Apple iPads.) The service offers catch-up and on-demand TV. It makes the past three days of popular programming available without the need to schedule recordings, the company said. Base plan with CBS, NBC and Fox broadcast channels. Cable channels from Discovery, Fox, NBCUniversal, Scripps, Turner and Viacom. AMC channels coming in April. Additional sports and other channels for $10 or $20 more. More than 50 channels in basic; more than 85 in all. Sony's service will include both live and on-demand programming, combining features from both cable TV and streaming services like Netflix. Earlier this year, Dish Network announced a service called Sling TV which offers live sports through the ESPN channels and news from CNN and Bloomberg, among others. Apple is expected to launch a service later this year which features live feeds. On-demand services such as Netflix and Hulu have become popular but lack the live network shows that have been available up to now only with a cable or satellite subscription. 'The TV experience needs a revolution and PlayStation Vue changes the rules by embracing how today's viewers want to discover and enjoy content,' said Andrew House, head of Sony Computer Entertainment. 'PlayStation Vue modernizes the TV viewing experience, taking the best of live TV and on-demand content and bringing it to the PlayStation ecosystem in a way that gives control back to viewers and enables them to spend more time watching their favorite programs and less time channel surfing using outdated menus.' The service will be offered at prices ranging from $49.99 to $69.99 depending on the channels, with no long-term contract required. On-demand services such as Netflix and Hulu have become popular but lack the live network shows that have been available up to now only with a cable or satellite subscription. PlayStation Vue will offer CBS, NBC and Fox local channel feeds, essentially replicating the experience of cable. The ABC network however is absent from the deal.

"It may have been the slowest chase ever when a tortoise attempted to run down a television presenter who interrupted it having sex with its mate. Paul Rose - who hosts National Geographic's Pristine Seas - was on Assumption Island, north of Madagascar, when he heard an animal call, which he described as a 'blowing sound'. As he walked towards the strange noise, it soon became apparent Rose and his cameraman had stumbled upon a male and female tortoise mating. Scroll down for video . Television host Paul Rose was chased by a male tortoise after he interrupted it mating with a female tortoise . The pair were more than 180 metres from where the presenter initially heard the noise. As Rose and his cameraman stop and try to observe the ritual, the giant tortoises stop mating. The presenter said he did not know whether or not they had stopped because of their close proximity or they had finished. The animals are seen touching noses as Rose and his cameraman watch from behind bushes. He was on Assumption Island - north of Madagascar - when the incident happened during filming . Rose and his cameraman were there taping for his National Geographic show, Pristine Seas . The host heard a 'blowing sound' while he was walking the island and went towards, discovering the tortoises . Almost immediately the male tortoise spots them and slowly begins to turn himself around, pointing himself in the direction of the television crew. The animal then starts to make its way towards them, with as much gusto as it can muster. Rose is heard telling his cameraman, 'Don't move', as it becomes apparent the tortoise is after them. As the reptile gets closer and closer to the camera, he shows no sign of stopping and so the cameraman jumps back. What ensues is a very low speed chase where the tortoise tries to defend his territory and take a bite out of Rose. The male tortoise slowly turned around to start running after the pair who were startled by the move . Humouring the reptile, Rose continued to slowly back away from it instead of running, observing its behaviour . Rose said it was the male tortoise's way of protecting his territory and getting him away from the female . Later, the host said the tortoise had ended up chasing them for about 365 metres in a circle . 'This is the male saying, ""Hey I think you've interrupted my mating session"",' Rose told the audience as the tortoise inches closer. 'You can't blame him he's in the bushes over there mating on this beautiful, private island and I pitch up to take a look.' Rose continued to humour the tortoise instead of running away. He said it was completely relentless in his pursuit, chasing them around in a 365-metre-loop.","Paul Rose, from National Geographic, was chased down by a giant tortoise .

"A  couple's plans for a dream engagement on their luxury Mexican holiday were ruined - when the groom-to-be was hit by suspected salmonella poisoning. Joe Kilgannon, 24, and his fiancee Cezanne Bannon, 22, are suing Thomas Cook after  their romantic getaway to the five-star Mexican hotel was cursed by chronic food poisoning. The forklift truck driver fell ill just days into the break at the five-star Grand Bahia Principe in Riviera Maya - and had hospital treatment for salmonella poisoning back home in Britain. Joe Kilgannon, 24, and bride-to-be Cezanne Bannon, 22, are suing Thomas Cook after he fell ill on holiday . Mr Kilgannon, from Newport, told how he 'spent more time popping to the toilet rather than popping the question', ruining the romantic holiday. He said: 'Our trip to Mexico was meant to be a romantic break for us to celebrate our engagement together. 'But it was completely ruined after I became seriously ill. 'We were very disappointed with the standards at the hotel; especially at it was meant to be a five-star resort.' The couple were very disappointed with the standards at the hotel, which is 'meant to be a five star resort' The couple paid more than £2,000 for the stay at the plush holiday resort, back in December 2014. Mr Kilgannon said: 'Throughout our stay at the resort we noticed that some of the food was served only lukewarm and the burgers we were served in the restaurant were raw in the middle. 'But obviously we only spotted this after biting into them the first time. 'Nothing can turn back the clock and make amends for our ruined holiday but we hope that with the help of our legal team we will be able to find the answers we are seeking as to how I fell so seriously ill.' A few days into the holiday Mr Kilgannon began to feel unwell and his condition rapidly deteriorated . The couple also claim that there were insects  all over their original hotel room, necessitating a room change. Just a few days into the holiday Mr Kilgannon began to feel unwell in the middle of the night and his condition rapidly deteriorated. The couple's lawyer said he is investigating 'the cause of Joseph's illness and how he came to contract salmonella' He was hospitalised in Britain and after further tests he was diagnosed with Salmonella poisoning. The couple have instructed international personal injury experts to investigate the cause of the illness after Joseph began to suffer from abdominal cramps and diarrhoea. Their lawyer Jennifer Downing, of specialist firm Irwin Mitchell, said: 'This was meant to be one of the most romantic breaks of Joseph and Cezanne's lives but unfortunately the illness he suffered left them unable to fully enjoy the facilities at the hotel and they went home with awful memories rather than happy ones. 'Salmonella is a potentially fatal form of food poisoning that can leave some sufferers with permanent symptoms. 'We will now be investigating the cause of Joseph's illness and how he came to contract salmonella. 'We hope Thomas Cook the tour operator will co-operate fully with us during our investigations. 'We would ask anyone who has recently stayed at the resort to get in touch with us if they feel they are able to assist with our investigations.' A Thomas Cook spokesperson confirmed they were investigating 'serious and, at present, unsubstantiated allegations' about the hotel stay. The couple claim that food at the resort was served  lukewarm and the burgers were raw in the middle . Thomas Cook confirmed they are investigating 'serious and, at present, unsubstantiated allegations' She said: 'Thomas Cook would, of course, like to congratulate Mr Kilgannon and Ms Bannon on their engagement. 'Mr Kilgannon did not raise any concerns with our reps or the hotel management at the time. 'As it appears that his symptoms arose several days after his return to the UK, this would suggest that the illness was unconnected to his holiday in Mexico. 'Thomas Cook takes health and safety issues extremely seriously. We closely audit all the properties to which we operate to ensure that the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.'","Joe Kilgannon, 24, and  Cezanne Bannon, 22, are suing holiday company .

"Dodging the TV licence will remain a criminal offence for the foreseeable future, as Tory ministers gave up on trying to overturn it before the election. MPs had pushed for reforms to the system which sees those who do not pay the £145.50-a-year charge hauled before magistrates. Around 150,000 people a year are convicted. But the Government was accused of a u-turn yesterday after backing down on their intention to decriminalise non-payment before May. MPs had pushed for reforms to the system which sees those who do not pay the £145.50-a-year charge hauled before magistrates - but Tory ministers have given up trying to change it before the election . Licence fee evasion accounts for around one in ten cases heard by magistrates who can impose a fine of up to £1,000. Around 50 a people year are jailed for non-payment of the fine. In a historic vote last year, MPs from all parties backed the replacement of a criminal charge with a civil fine similar to those for not paying a gas bill. But last month, peers led by former BBC chairman Lord Grade of Yarmouth blocked any changes to the system until April 2017, warning that ‘dark forces’ were seeking to scrap the licence fee altogether. Lord Grade’s intervention reflected fears about among BBC executives that removing criminal sanctions would lead to a rise in evasion that could the broadcaster £200million a year in revenue. Downing Street and the culture department had insisted at the start of February following the House of Lords amendment, that they would try to overturn this deadline. Yesterday however, ministers dropped their opposition to it, claiming they now believe it should wait for the outcome of an independent review into decriminalisation by David Perry QC at the end of June. Chris Bryant, Labour’s culture spokesman said it was an ‘adroit about-turn’ by the Conservatives who had talked tough about the need to reform an outdated system without delay. Culture minister Tom Brake, a Liberal Democrat, confirmed to the House of Commons yesterday that any change to the licence fee, which generates £3.6billionn a year for the BBC, would be shelved until after the election. Chris Bryant, Labour’s culture spokesman, left, said it was an ‘adroit about-turn’ by the Conservatives, while Lib Dem culture minister Tom Brake, right, confirmed any change would wait until after the election . But he said the law would be changed to require the next government to respond to the findings of the review within three months (must keep). It is expected this will now happen as part of the renewal of the BBC Charter at the end of 2016, and not be implemented before the current licence fee settlement ends in April 2017. Mr Brake said: ‘The government is clear that this review is a high priority…We must not make any presumptions about the recommendations David Perry will make nor how the government of the day will decide to take them forward.’ Mr Bryant, who backs the continuation of the licence fee said: ‘Anybody would think that this has been a smooth path and everything they intended from the very beginning. The honest truth is that if the Government were to proceed too swiftly you would simply see a significant fall in licence fee take-up almost immediately of £200million or £250millon – that’s almost all children’s broadcasting. ‘That’s why we have to consider the timetable very carefully. The government is doing an adroit about-turn for which I am deeply grateful. Our argument has always been if you decriminalise the licence fee you have to do it as part of the Charter renewal process and licence fee settlement, otherwise it is like pulling a thread from a jumper, you pull apart the whole the jumper.’ Andrew Bridgen, the Tory MP who led the campaign for decriminalisation, called the delay imposed by the Lords a ‘cynical, eleventh hour attempt by friends of the BBC’ to stop vulnerable people being pursued by the courts. But he supported yesterday’s move to accept their timetable, as he said pushing the issue could have put the rest of the Deregulation Bill, which includes important measures about terrorism, at risk. Mr Bridgen pointed out that in Scotland where TV charges have been decriminalised, evasion has remained at around the same rate. He said: ‘Horror stories about the losses to the BBC, emotive closures of local radio and TV stations. We’ve heard it all before. ‘The fact is that the evasion rate in Scotland is very little different to what it is in England even though we criminalise 150,000 to 180,000 of our citizens a year whereas in Scotland they only criminalise around 30 people a year.’ A spokesman for the culture department said the Government did not wish to ‘make any presumptions’ about the outcome of the review, which will lay out the potential impacts on BBC revenue.","MPs have pushed for reform of system which takes non-payers to court .

"A police official called a drive-by shooting one of the worst mass shootings in Northern California's recent history after it took the lives of three people and wounded four others. Stockton police Officer Joe Silva said the area around Madison Market had a reputation for being a bad neighborhood, even before police responded Tuesday evening to find three killed. One woman was found fatally shot out on the sidewalk, while two other victims shot inside were taken to the hospital where they later died of their injuries, according to News10 ABC. Scroll down for video . Shooting: Emergency responders transport one of the victims of the shooting, which killed three and injured four others . On Wednesday, San Joaquin County officials identified the two women as 20-year-old Aliyah Taylor and 27-year-old Arniska Lofton and the male victim as 23-year-old Kabin Kennebrew. Four other men, ages 24, 25, 32 and 38, were taken to the hospital with injuries and are expected to survive. Some said they believed those who were shot did not have gang ties, including Kayla Sandoval, who said was upset by the fact that innocent people were caught up in the violence. 'It's a horrible feeling - a horrible feeling when you know these people and you know they didn't deserve what's going on,' Sandoval told KCRA. Police spoke with witnesses who reported that up to 40 shots had been fired, though no arrests have been made and police are still uncertain whether there were multiple gunmen. 'It (was like), ""pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,""' Allison Deneau said. Shooting: Stockton police confirmed multiple victims in the shooting at Madison Market, and said that one victim had died on the spot, while another two later died in hospital . Crowd control: Police tried to break up crowds that had formed after the shooting as ambulance crews tried to transport the wounded . Scene: The shooting occurred at the Madison Market, on the corner of Madison and Park Streets, in Stockton, California, on Tuesday night . Fox40 reporter Tia Ewing tweeted from the scene that police said it was a gang-related drive-by shooting. 'Saddest part in this was watching a mother learn her child was shot dead in front of the Madison Market,' Ewing posted online. Ewing also reported that the market was popular hangout for kids in the neighborhood. Violence is not foreign to Stockton, which saw 49 killings last year, an increase from the year before. The city hit record numbers with 58 homicides in 2011, and 71 in 2012. In comparison, Riverside, a similarly sized city of about 300,000 people in Southern California, had 13 homicides in 2011 and 16 in 2012. Stockton, which sits about 80 miles east of San Francisco and is a gateway to Yosemite National Park, was once an official ""All-America City"" before the collapse of the housing market. In the years that followed, Stockton twice led Forbes magazine's list of ""America's most miserable cities."" In 2012, it became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy before Detroit made the move in 2013. Stockton emerged from bankruptcy last fall after the judge approved its reorganization plan. At one point, the police union was so upset over layoffs and a record homicide rate that it posted billboards tracking the city's body count and disclosing the city manager's phone number. One blood-spattered sign read: 'Welcome to the 2nd most dangerous city in California: Stop laying off cops!' The city has tried to reduce violence. A program called Operation Peacekeeper uses street-wise people trained in conflict resolution, mediation, community organizing and mentoring to work in schools, parks, street corners and apartment complexes. Workers respond to areas where violent crimes have occurred in an attempt to talk with young people and prevent retaliations. On Wednesday, mourners had left candles, notes and flowers for the three victims killed in the shooting. 'Why would you be willing to take a life for something so senseless?' Sandoval said. The deceased 'had loved ones. We don't bring our kids out because of things like this.'","Police identified the three victims killed during the shooting as Aliyah Taylor, 20, Arniska Lofton, 27, and Kabin Kennebrew, 23 .

"Samantha Cameron said she is 'desperate' to see her husband win the May election at a fundraising event for Comic Relief (pictured) Samantha Cameron has appealed for voters to re-elect her husband, putting to bed rumours that she was fed up with life at No 10. The Prime Minister’s wife said her husband David would see out another five years at Downing Street if he is returned to power on May 7. Mrs Cameron told an interviewer: ‘I desperately want my husband to win the election. Obviously, it’s up to the British people. 'If he wins we will be here for another five years.’ Speaking to the Sun ahead of tonight’s Comic Relief, Mrs Cameron, 43, described herself as a ‘hands off’ political wife and gave new insight into their home life. She told the newspaper: ‘I don’t think he takes my advice about politics. I wouldn’t want him to. 'It would be too much of a responsibility for me. We talk about stuff when he gets upstairs.’ But she also spoke of the difficulties and responsibilities of moving into Downing Street - saying she had done her best to keep the family’s personal lives unchanged. Mrs Cameron, who was pictured alongside comic David Walliams in a publicity shot, said: ‘For the older children, when we came here it was very daunting. 'You feel very protective of your marriage and your children but the children go to the same school, and I go to the same job. And school is very supportive.’ She also praised the work of Comic Relief, especially their efforts to get rid of the stigma around mental and physical disabilities. The Camerons' eldest son, Ivan, died from complications of debilitating Ohtahara Syndrome in 2009 aged just six. Speaking about her home life with the Prime Minister, Mrs Cameron said they try to make as much family time as possible including having breakfast together each morning and taking the children to school . Speaking about her life in Downing Street, she added: ‘It does make a different living here, getting family-work balance. Dave is very busy but gets up at 5.30am to do his red box. ‘That means we can all have breakfast together on days he’s not travelling. It means he can pop up in the evening, say good night to the children. 'There’s nothing we don’t do. We go to the cinema, take the kids to the school, I take the children three or four times a week. 'We go to the school quiz night. Normally we do quite badly. I’m terrible at general knowledge. I get my husband to do history and politics. ‘We’re a bit further away from the children’s school friends. The children come back here for play dates and sleepovers but you are a bit further away from that network. 'All the parents get used to popping in and out. ‘He’s a very good cook. He finds that very relaxing. Nancy’s learning to cook. I’m trying to train them to tidy up as they go along but it’s slightly futile. 'I am quite tidy and he’s not very good at picking up his clothes. Newspapers lying everywhere. That’s the other one.’ Mrs Cameron made the comments during a fundraising event at the flat the family lives in above No 11 alongside comic David Walliams. The choice of celebrity will no doubt prove a slightly sore spot for the PM, because when Mrs Cameron was asked to name her favourite David, she chose Walliams. In a previous interview, Mr Cameron said: 'Samantha admitted to me the other day that her favourite David is David Walliams, which I thought was disappointing as she's married to me. 'She sat next to him at a charity function and said he was the funniest man she'd ever met so I'm going to have to learn to live with that.' Mrs Cameron added that while David is a very good cook, he is also messy, constantly leaving clothes and newspapers strewn around the house (pictured, she supports her husband after a run in his constituency) Mr Walliams has been a frequent visitor to Downing Street. In March 2012 the comic, writer and Britain's Got Talent judge posed on the steps of Number 10 with his supermodel wife Lara Stone. And in 2013 he led a UNICEF campaign with 100 schoolchildren, when he could not resist the temptation to touch the Prime Minister's hair. Mr Walliams said later: 'Because I'm taller than him, I offered to stand on a lower step so we wouldn't look odd together - he's a tall man but I'm ridiculously tall. 'He's the Prime Minister so he should be the one who is most powerful-looking. 'He told me not to flick my hair like my character Sebastian in Little Britain, who flirted with the PM relentlessly. Of course, I immediately did it. In previous interviews, Mr Cameron has revealed that he and his wife try to cook a meal or go out for a date together once a week 'when they have time'. The Prime Minister added: 'Everyone has their own keys to a happy marriage, but for us that has really worked.'","Samantha Cameron says David is a good cook, but is also very messy .

"He is one fifth of the biggest boyband on the planet, created by the X Factor in 2010. But today, as Zayn Malik is signed off the One Direction tour due to 'stress', many are beginning to question whether fame is beginning to take its toll on the singer. Indeed, there are some critics who suggest the 22-year-old - who arrived at Heathrow airport early today - may be looking to make an exit from the group for good. Scroll down for video . Zayn Malik has sparked concerns after he was signed off the X Factor tour for stress following the release of pictures of him holding hands with a woman who was not his fiance Perrie Edwards . The catalyst for  Zayn's departure from the Asia leg of 1D's On The Road tour was a series of photographs released earlier this week. In them, the singer is seen holding hands with a pretty blonde girl named Lauren Richardson, despite the fact that he is engaged to Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards. Clearly distressed by the release of the images, Zayn tweeted: 'I'm 22 years old... I love a girl named Perrie Edwards. And there's a lot of jealous f**ks in this world I'm sorry for what it looks like x' Lauren's friends have since come forward to defend her, and have said that there was nothing behind the intimate shots. A spokesman for the band revealed Zayn's decision to take some time out saying: 'Zayn has signed off with stress and is flying back to the UK to recuperate. 'The band wish him well and will continue with their performances in Manila and Jakarta.' This photograph of Zayn caused outrage as he is currently engaged to Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards . In this, it appears Zayn is holding hands with Lauren Richardson. Her friends have denied any wrong doing . It has since been reported that the singer is struggling with having his personal life so publicly scrutinised. But even from the early stages of his career, Zayn, who is known as the shyest member of the group, struggled with his fame - in particular, after he and his fellow bandmates Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Naill Horan were catapulted onto a worldwide platform. And as early as 2012, it appears that the cracks were beginning to show. In August of that year, Zayn caused concerns among the 'directioners' when he briefly quit Twitter. At the time he wrote: 'The reason i don't tweet as much as i use to, is because I'm sick of all the useless opinions and hate that i get daily goodbye twitter :)' However, he was back on the social media site 48 hours later saying: 'Sorry, I was getting some abuse on twitter but I dont want to let my fans down. So I am back!! :) x'. Zayn and Perrie, pictured here at DisneyLand have been dating since 2011, however, he has been accused of cheating on the Little Mix singer on more than one occasion . It was around this time that Zayn had been accused of cheating on Perrie for the first time. He was filmed through the keyhole of a hotel room looking like he was trying to take a girl back to where he was staying. Zayn and Perrie's relationship had been rocked, and the singer's personal affairs were been bought into the limelight, but it was only set to get worse. In February 2013, Zayn was accused of cheating on his fiance with an exotic dancer, Australian Courtney Webb. In pictures - which were featured in The Sun newspaper - the scruffy-haired singer was seen lying on a bed sleeping after allegedly having sex with the 23-year-old. According to Courtney, the pair met whilst out clubbing in London before the One Direction star took her back to his £2.2million north London home. Courtney said of the tryst: 'He's an absolute s**t. How dare he - not only to me but to Perrie?' She added: 'I definitely don't think it's the first time he's done this. I feel sorry for Perrie - she doesn't know this is going on. It's wrong and it has to stop.' Zayn is on fifth of One Direction with bandmates l-r Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Naill Horan . Zayn has been dating Perrie since 2011 with the pair becoming engaged in August 2013. The Little Mix singer is yet to comment on the recent stories but was spotted last night leaving the house she shares with Zayn, her engagement ring still on her finger. In November 2014, he again caused concern for his well-being when he failed to make a trip to America with his group. And as rumours of drug use flew around the internet, American Today show host Matt Lauer asked the rest of his bandmates: 'There have been rumours of substance abuse, what's going on?' Zayn told The Sun that he had been hurt by the accusations saying: 'I'm really angry and upset by what was said. I was really ill at the weekend, that's why I couldn't fly to America.' And Zayn has previously hinted that he would have never pursued a career in music it were it not for his bandmates. He once said: 'We all keep each other down to earth and there's defo no way I could have done this as a solo artist. 'I would have cracked up and given it all up and gone home by now. The lads keep me grounded and it's good to know you're not the only person going through everything. We're sharing every experience.' In a video obtained by the MailOnline last year Zayn was filmed smoking what looked like a 'joint' in the back of a car with his bandmate Louis Tomlinson . Of course, if Zayn was to leave the band, he wouldn't be the first person to quit when it all got too much. Indeed, many have been quick to draw potential comparisons between him and Robbie Williams. Robbie famously quit Take That for the first time in 1995 amid rumours that his drug use had spiraled out of control. Rumours which were later confirmed by Robbie when he admitted to having been addicted to cocaine, saying  there was a point in his life where he thought he might die. The singer said: 'I was so deep into addiction I knew I was probably going to die soon but I didn't care.' He added: 'I managed to escape by the skin of my teeth and I'm lucky. I was days away from dying quite a few times on all manner of substances. 'There could easily have been a Heath Ledger scenario. Unfortunately I've been in a place where I didn't care if I was on the planet or not. I do care now.' Although there is no evidence to suggest that Zayn has a drug problem, he has previously been accused of substance abuse - something which he has denied. And last year, in a video obtained exclusively by the MailOnline, Zayn was filmed smoking what appears to be a joint made of marijuana. In the footage, which is thought to have been taken by his bandmate Louis Tomlinson, the boys are driving through Peru in the back of a large car. Zayn singing on stage with One Direction, it is hoped that he will re-join the boys on tour next week . At one point they spot a police officer riding a bike alongside their car, Louis is then heard saying: 'One nil b***h! Look at this b***h! He's having a look. He's thinking, 'I'm sure I can smell an illegal substance in there.' And he's hit the nail on the head.' Louis also said: 'Zayn takes his job very seriously. He makes sure he goes through a two-hour intense warm-up before every show. Just to get himself in the zone for the show. 'One very very important factor of Zayn's warm up of course is Mary J herself. In fact I will present it to him now for some fantastic singing.' Mary J is a known nickname for marijuana. Then, after a half-hearted attempt to film 'a bit of the culture' with footage of the street beyond the SUV, Louis pans back to Zayn allowing the focus to drop to the smoking 'joint' in his hand and asks: 'How's that kind of culture?' Zayn replies: 'It's great. It's going to be even greater culture when we get to Jamaica.' At times, members of the band's team can be heard talking about 'chicken'. At the beginning of the journey Louis asks 'are we all right for chicken?' It isn't clear what is meant by 'chicken' as the guys joke and laugh in increasingly high spirits. Zayn and his One Direction bandmates found fame on the X Factor in 2010 and have since gone on to have huge global success . The boys have grown up a lot in the five years since their career first kicked off . On the first occasion that chicken is mentioned one of the band's support team can be heard saying 'we got a full chicken' just as the crew member seated in the front passenger seat passes something back and across to his colleague seated in front of Louis in the six-seater SUV. Later, a member of the team can be heard saying 'I've got an update. We got chicken in Chile.' Zayn and Louis chime in with much hilarity, 'We got Chile Chicken. Chile Chicken baby!' In underground slang the word 'chicken' has been used to describe quantities of cocaine. The term is derived from the term 'bird' which some people use as code for a kilogram of coke. Zayn is yet to make any further comment on his departure from the tour although it is hoped he will rejoin the band when they head to South Africa next week. He was today photographed touching down in the UK alongside one of the bands PR team and it has been reported that he will enter crisis talks during his time at home. MailOnline have contacted a representative for Zayn, who said they would not be making any further comment.","Zayn Malik was this week taken off the One Direction tour for stress .

"Thousands of people gathered in a small Texas town this weekend to watch rattlesnakes get cleaned, skinned, milked and more - some visitors even left their mark on the wall with bloody hand prints. The Annual Sweetwater Jaycee’s World’s Largest Rattlesnake Roundup hosts hunts, beauty and eating contests, demonstrations, vendors selling snake-skin products and more. Attendees could even buy fried rattlesnake, which apparently takes like chicken. Before the snakes are cooked, however, they are passed through an assembly line, where they are killed, decapitated, then cleaned and skinned as they hang from a wire. The roundup, which has been going on since 1958 and is the oldest and grandest in Texas, began to control the population of rattlesnakes in the area, according to the Odessa American, but now more people are drawn to the sheer awe of the event. Scroll down for video . Keith Willman adjusts snakes in a pit to keep them from suffocating during the 2015 World's Largest Rattlesnake Roundup on Saturday in Sweetwater, Texas. Willman said if they don't get stirred up, the snakes on the bottom of the pile could suffocate from the weight of the snakes on top of them .

The rattlesnakes are suspended in the air as handlers clean and skin the reptiles. Crowds gather as the handlers approach the snakes barehanded . The four-day event takes place in Sweetwater's Nolan County Coliseum, which is also used for the county fair, rodeos and other large events in the area. The event brings more than $2million into Sweetwater - a town with a population of 11,400 - and proceeds go toward community projects, youth sports and helping the disabled and disadvantaged. A hunt for snakes starts about a month before the roundup, and hunters are able to harvest about 5,000 pounds of snakes - which averages out into about 1,000 snakes. Hunters use a gassing technique, where they spray gasoline through copper tubes to lure the snakes from their hiding places.

Crowds came from all over to the 11,400-person town to attend the annual Rattlesnake Roundup, which has been held annually since the 1950s . Larry Martin prepares to milk a rattlesnake as a crowd watches the demonstration. The four-day event brings about $2million into the Sweetwater community . But the gassing method is controversial in Texas, as people fear it hurts other animals and habitats, and could be facing a ban, leaving an uncertain future for the roundup. Hunters use the gasoline to hunt in large volume in colder, wetter weather. If gassing is banned, they will potentially have to postpone the roundup. Though the Texas Wildlife Department has been looking into gassing for years and nearly banned it in 2013, the organization delayed making a decision until September so Sweetwater representatives and researchers could propose an alternative solution. Some opponents to the Roundup are concerned with the treatment and slaying of the rattlesnakes and suggested a no-kill roundup. Jaycees, however, told the Odessa American that it would be irresponsible to release such a dangerous creature back into the area after capturing it.
