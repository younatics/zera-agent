"Poorer families are more likely to eat chicken nuggets and chips for dinner, while wealthier households consume more salad and rice, new research has revealed. The latest figures from Roy Morgan  show that socioeconomic status and family income have a significant impact on foods consumed. At the top end of the scale, children eat more salad and rice, but as income decreases more chips, wedges, chicken nuggets and noodles are consumed. New research shows children from lower income families are more frequently consuming chips than they are salads . In the wealthiest households, 62 per cent of kids aged 6-13 will eat rice every week, while 55 per cent will also have salad at some stage. Less than half will eat hot chips, fries, or wedges, while just over a third will consume noodles. Around a quarter of these children will eat chicken nuggets during an average week. However at the other end of the spectrum childrens' eating habits change quite dramatically. With each successive drop in socioeconomic status, children in the household are less likely to eat rice or salad, and more likely to eat noodles or chicken nuggets. Kids from wealthier families will see more salad on the table, with 55 per cent consuming the greens in an average week . At the lower end of the scale 60 per cent of children will consume chips, wedges or fries, but only 44 per cent will eat a salad during an average week. Noodles are on the menu for 55 per cent of these kids, chicken nuggets are eaten by 40 per cent, and just half of these children will see rice on their table. 'While the food that parents buy and give to their children is heavily influenced by the affordability of groceries, there may be many other issues at play such as the number of children (and parents) in the household, working hours, accessibility of fresh produce in the local area, as well as underlying attitudes and tastes,' Michele Levine, CEO, Roy Morgan Research said. The presence of rice at mealtimes has increased, and 62 per cent of kids at the higher end of the spectrum have it each week . 'For example, price alone does not fully explain the inverse changes in popularity for rice and noodles among children across socio-economic quintiles.' The research also revealed that more parents are trying to make a conscious choice about purchasing additive-free food, which is up to 50 per cent from 45 last year. However figures in this section also show that as socioeconomic status declines, so does the amount of parents making the decision to buy additive-free foods. Noodles and hot chips are eaten more frequently than salads in lower socioeconomic households . Despite this, increasing numbers of parents are paying closer attention to what they put on the table for their children. 'More than five million Australians are parents with children under 16 in the home. Our research into health attitudes shows that over the last five years an increasing proportion of parents are mindful of their own calorie, fat, dairy, and red meat intake, but are slightly less likely to be trying to limit how much sugar their kids eat,' Michele Levine said. 'Our Single Source survey can connect parents' demographics and household status with their health attitudes, grocery shopping behaviours, exercise habits and food consumption rates to deliver a 360-degree view of the changing lifestyles of Australian families.' Noodles are on the menu each week more often for children whose parents earn a lower income, over wealthier families .","New research shows children from lower income families are more frequently consuming chips than they are salads .

"This is the shocking moment a woman was filmed hurling 'racist' abuse at two men on the London Underground and saying 'you can only speak in English while you're on my train'. Passengers said the woman took offence after hearing the men speaking in an Eastern European language and accused them  of  only using English to 'get something' in an expletive-laden tirade. She was filmed last night saying: 'You know English when you want a job. You know English when you want a flat. You know English when you want f***ing anything. 'But when you want to try and talk about us on the train you talk in your own lingo.' Scroll down for video . A woman was filmed hurling 'racist' abuse at two men on the London Underground and saying 'you can only speak in English while you're on my train' Jay, 24, who works in banking, captured the  'racist tirade' at around 11pm yesterday on the District Line between Mile End and Plaistow on his way home from the England match at Wembley. He said: 'It was a total shock to witness this racist abuse. You really don't expect to see it in this day and age. 'The woman overhead them speaking in another language and then started aggressively ranting at them. Everyone in the carriage was absolutely shocked.' Wearing a black leather jacket and dark trousers, the blonde woman first confronted the two men saying: 'Don't f***ing sit on my train and speak about me behind my back in your lingo. 'Do it to my face. I really ain't f***ing  shy. I don’t know what you’re talking about because you’re doing in behind my back.

'You want to a job, you want to live in our houses do it, but speak in English while you’re on the train. Nah you don’t have the b******s.' One of the men responded saying: 'You don’t even know what I was talking about.' 'If you want to argue with someone you have to listen to what they’re saying. Not everyone in here is speaking English.' Both men then got off the Tube and the woman said: 'Go away, goodbye. Go and sponge some more off the social.'

"The world is finally in the grip of a long-awaited El Niño event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected. Scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central Pacific Ocean and have started to alter wind patterns. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Niño will continue through the summer. The US National Oceanic and Atmosopheric Administration has detected warmer than average water surface temperatures around the equator of the Pacific Ocean (shown above) which indicates the arrival of El Niño . However, they say that the El Niño conditions are currently 'extremely weak' and come at a time of the year when the influence of El Niño on weather patterns usually declines. This means that while El Niño conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer, it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring. El Niño is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the Pacific Ocean around the equator. Usually the wind blows strongly from east to west, due to the rotation of the Earth, causing water to pile up in the western part of the Pacific. This pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern Pacific. However, in an El Niño, the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east. This causes the eastern Pacific to get warmer. But as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents, this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer, meaning the El Niño grows. This change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere. The NOAA said that it was unlikely the phenomenon would bring enough rain this spring to break the three-year record-breaking drought that is currently affecting California. Some meteorologists, however, have warned that this El Niño could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Decadal Osciallation (PDO). The PDO reached record levels in December last year and January this year, and should it stay strong, it may combine with El Niño to increase global temperatures. Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Centre, said: 'Based on the persistent observations of above-average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial Pacific Ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure, we can now say that El Niño is here. 'Many climate prediction models show this weak El Niño continuing into summer.' The arrival of this El Niño is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year, but the conditions failed to materialise. According to the Met Office El Niño conditions generally bring warmer temperatures to Europe during the Autumn and colder winter temperatures. The above diagram shows the sea surface temperature (SST) in the Pacific Ocean on 25 Feburary 2015 and it can be seen that around the equator the temperature was above average (marked by red) on that date . It can also make sourthern Europe wetter during the late summer and autumn. Perhaps the greatest impact is felt in the monsoon regions of south east Asia where the climate is usually drier than normal in El Niño years. El Niño is one of the most powerful climate altering phenonoma on the planet. It is the result of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the Pacific Ocean. This cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years. When the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months, the NOAA officially classes it as El Niño conditions. California is in the midst of the worst drought in 1,200 years and has caused severe drying of the Stevens Creek Reservoir (shown above). It is unlikely the El Niño will bring enough spring rain to ease the drought . The last El Niño, in 2009-2010, was a moderate to strong event. This brought freezing  weather to northern Europe in the winter of 2009/2010 and the UK was exceptionally cold. The Vancouver Winter Olympics also suffered a far warmer than average winter during the same event. Other recent El Niño’s  in 2002-2003,  2004-2005 and 2006-2007 have been weak to moderate in strength. The last very strong El Nino was 1997-1998 and was known for providing heavy rainfall in the west of the United States, especially California. The NOAA said that last week the sea temperature across much of the equatorial Pacific Ocean has been above average. They also found that unusually weak easterly winds have persisted across the eastern Pacific ocean. In Late January and February there were a couple of westerly wind bursts of over the central tropical Pacific and forecasts for March suggest these will continue. The NOAA said that this mean the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index, which is uses to monitor the El Niño, has been a negative value for the second month in a row. The above diagram shows the impacts of a typical El Niño on seasonal temperatures around the world . The above diagram shows how a typical El Niño is expected to change seasonal rainfall around the world . In a blog post on the onset of El Niño, the NOAA said: 'At this time, these are extremely weak El Niño conditions, during a time of year when the influence of El Niño on weather patterns in North America or other locations outside of the Tropics is weakening. 'From an impacts perspective, this is not particularly momentous, as El Niño impacts are weak in the spring and summer. 'Still, after months of hovering under the threshold, we can now say that El Niño conditions have arrived.' NOAA scientists are to continue monitoring the situation and will issue an update in April. However, Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist writing for New Scientist, warned that the arrival of El Niño could result in this year being especially warm. He said: 'El Niño transfers huge amounts of heat from the oceans to the atmosphere, and there are hints that this El Niño, combined with the already very warm global oceans, could bring about a new phase in global warming. 'An associated slow-moving indicator of Pacific Ocean temperatures, called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), reached record levels in December and January. 'A persistently strong PDO is associated with cold winters in the eastern US and drought in California – we've had both in abundance this year. 'Should the PDO stay strong, it will essentially join forces with El Niño and increase the odds that 2015 will rank as the warmest year on record globally.'","US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declares warmer than average water in Pacific Ocean signal the arrival of El Niño conditions .

"They are perhaps best known for being axe-wielding warmongers who brought terror to the countries they invaded. But despite their fearsome reputation, Vikings also had a love of jewellery and personal grooming, according to an exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in Cornwall. The bloodthirsty raiders even seemed to like 'cute and cuddly' teddy bears and - in contrast to their association with violence and destruction - were skilled tradesmen. Scroll down for video . Bloodthirsty? A new exhibition in Cornwall suggests Vikings were actually interested in personal grooming and jewellery . One of the displays at the National Maritime Museum shows a large bone comb with iron rivets dating back to the 9th or 10th centuries . Norse currency is also on display at the museum. Some of the exhibits show that the Vikings were keen tradesmen . The co-curator of the exhibition, Viking expert Gareth Williams, told the Guardian that although the Vikings' reputation was 'justified' their society was in fact 'so much more than murder and violence'. He said: 'It’s a bit like the English football hooligans in the 1980s. They attracted the headlines and some people began to think all English people were like that. Which obviously is untrue.' The museum, in Falmouth, has gathered artefacts from the British Museum, Ireland, Denmark and the Isle of Man for their exhibition Viking Voyagers. One of the exhibits showed bronze cloak and scarf pins found on the shoreline of the Isle of Man and coins from north Africa or the Middle East. Experts say the discovery shows a beach market would have been held there. The exhibition's centrepiece is a replica of a 14 metre trading ship named 'Walrus' which would have been used to transport loads of up to five tons up and down the coast . Warmongers: Although the Vikings have a reputation for death and destruction, the exhibition seeks to show other aspects of their society . Another display shows a large bone comb with iron rivets dating back to the 9th or 10th centuries. Mr Williams told the Guardian: 'Despite the popular image of Vikings as wild and shaggy looking, bone and antler combs are very common finds.' The display also shows toiletry sets for women that include earscoops for digging out wax. As well as artefacts showing the Vikings interest in personal grooming, the collection also includes a brooch complete with bear heads. Mr Williams added: 'Those look like teddy bears to me. They are cute and cuddly.' The exhibition's co-curator revealed that Viking society was 'so much more than murder and violence' The exhibition's centre piece is a replica of a 14 metre trading ship named 'Walrus' which would have been used to transport loads of up to five tons up and down the coast. Tehmina Goskar, the exhibitions registrar at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall, said the far west of Britain would have been an important point on a sailing route from Scandinavia to Brittany. 'We haven’t proved yet that they settled here but they raided and traded here,' she said. 'There are tantalising bits of evidence that begin to suggest they may have settled, too – why wouldn’t they? It’s a lovely place to be.' Viking Voyagers is open from 20 March 2015 to 22 February 2017.","Vikings had a love of jewellery and personal grooming, exhibition suggests .

"Nick Gordon's stepfather has revealed in a new interview that he fears for the life of Bobbi Kristina's troubled fiance. It has been reported that Gordon, 25, has threatened suicide and has been taking Xanax since Whitney Houston's daughter was found unconscious in a bathtub in late January. On Wednesday, Access Hollywood spoke exclusively to Gordon’s stepfather about his son's state of mind, asking him if he fears for Nick's life. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Nick Gordon's father (left and right) gave an interview about the 25-year-old fiance of Bobbi Kristina Brown, who reportedly had threatened suicide . Access Hollywood will air the complete interview Thursday . 'I fear... that if something happens to Bobbi Kristina, like, if she doesn't pull it through, then I will fear for my son's life,' the stepfather stated. Access Hollywood will air the complete interview Thursday. Speaking to Dr Phil McGraw Gordon, 25, said: ‘I lost the most legendary singer ever and I’m scared to lose Krissy. I want to let all you guys know I did everything possible in the world to protect them.’ Gordon’s impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by Dr Phil last week and due to air today. Weeping and wailing and at times incoherent, Gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by Dr Phil. Gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story. He has felt ‘vilified’ and ‘depicted as a monster’ since January 31 when Bobby Kristina, 22, was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub at the Roswell , Georgia home he and Bobby Kristina shared. Breakdown: With his mother, Michelle, by his side Nick Gordon struggles to stay coherent . Troubling preview: A trailer for the interview of Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon by Dr Phil McGraw was released Sunday night. Swinging from crying  to flying into a rage, the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by Dr Phil . But on learning of Gordon’s emotional, mental and physical state Dr Phil could not ‘in good conscience’ go on with the interview. According to Gordon’s mother, Michelle, who was by her son’s side during the highly emotional intervention, ‘Nicholas is at a breaking point. He cannot bear not being without Krissy, by her side. He’s dealing with it by drinking. I’ve begged him to stop.’ Dr Phil told Gordon, who admitted to having taken Xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting: ‘Nick, you’re out of control. You’ve threatened suicide. You deserved to get some help because if you don’t, you know you’re going to wind up dead.’ He added: ‘You’ve got to get yourself cleaned up. You got to man up and straighten up.’ Yesterday DailyMail.com revealed that, barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with Dr Phil, Gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk. The disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by Dr Phil as ‘exponential.’ In the show, due to broadcast Wednesday, a weeping and wailing Gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed: ‘I’m so sorry for everything.’ Asked if he still intended to kill himself he said: ‘If anything happens to Krissi I will.’ He said: ‘My pain is horrible. My heart hurts. I have panic attacks.’ In recent weeks Gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of Xanax, alcohol and prescription sleeping pills. Gordon had agreed to meet with Dr Phil believing that he was there to be interviewed. According to Dr Phil: 'He felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster.' Instead, on learning of Gordon's rapidly deteriorating mental, emotional and physical state, the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab. Dr Phil stated: 'I don't think he has any chance of turning this round. Left to his own devices he will be dead within the week.' Gordon's mother, Michelle, was by her son's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive – at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed. She described her son as 'at breaking point.' She said: 'He cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt. 'He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.' Leaning towards Gordon's mother, Dr Phil said: 'You and I have one mission with one possible outcome and that's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression, his guilt…and to get clean and sober.' He added: 'His life absolutely hangs in the balance.' Questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of January 31st that led to Bobbi Kristina, 22, ending up face down in her tub. Just two days ago Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Leolah Brown, made a series of explosive Facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had 'strong evidene of foul play' relating to Gordon's role in events. She posted: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!' Leolah made her claims in response to being invited onto Dr Phil's show. Tough to watch: The young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . In her message she wrote: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece….We have strong evidence of foul play.' Marks were found on her face and arms, marks that Gordon has explained as the result of CPR which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived. And speaking to Dr Phil, Gordon insisted: 'I did everything possible in the world to protect them [Whitney and Bobbi Kristina].' Railing against the decision by Bobbi's father, Bobby Brown, to ban him from his fiancée's bedside at Atlanta's Emory Hospital, Gordon said: 'My name will be the first she calls.' According to his mother, Michelle, Gordon cannot forgive himself for his 'failure' to revive Bobbi Kristina. His guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier. 'I hate Bobby Brown!' His tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend's father Bobby Brown, who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . 'Are you drinking?' The emotional man's anger only increases as Dr. Phil asks about Nick's sobriety . Refuses to go: The 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . Resigned: Ultimately, Gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . Then, on 11 February 2012, it was Gordon who tried to resuscitate Whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath-tub just hours before she was due to attend a Grammy awards party. Speaking to Dr Phil, Michelle said: 'Nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed Whitney. 'He administered CPR [to Whitney] and he called me when he was standing over her body. He couldn't understand why he couldn't revive her. He said, ""Mommy why? I couldn't get the air into her lungs."" Gordon has now entered a rehab facility in Atlanta. Meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma. It is now six weeks since Bobbi Kristina – Krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub of the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia. Unlike Whitney's death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Nick, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. In an interview with The Sun  a friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone. Sounding eerily similar to Bobbi's mother and father's drug-dependent relationship, the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on. 'Bobbi and Nick would spend a lot on drugs every day, it just depended on how much money they had. It wasn't unusual for them to spend $1,000 a day on drugs. 'There were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours, just lying there on the bed. There were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice. She was always covered in cigarette burns.' Their relationship was also very volatile. 'When Whitney died Nick was left with nothing, so he knew he had to control Krissi to get access to the money. She'd do whatever he told her. 'He was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her. They would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around.' According to Stepho: 'But Krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother. She was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her. Nick knew this and took advantage of it.'

"Scared for her life: Model Anna Duritskaya, 23, is under police protection in Ukraine after reporting a 'threat to her life from unidentified individuals' Ukraine has put the girlfriend of slain Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov under state protection after she received death threats. Model Anna Duritskaya, 23, is now under the guard of SBU secret services and the police. Kiev also said today that she would not return to Moscow over the probe into the death of the Vladimir Putin foe. 'We will not let her go back to Russia,' said Anton Geraschenko, an aide to the Interior Minister. 'If Russian investigators need to talk to her, they will have to come to Ukraine.' The announcement came as another of Russia's leading opposition figures vowed that he and his supporters will not be intimidated by as he walked free from a 15-day spell in jail. Alexei Navalny, who had been convicted of handing out leaflets calling for an opposition rally, said he would continue his staunch criticism of Vladimir Putin's government despite the Mr Nemtsov's murder seven days ago. Emerging unshaven from a Moscow detention centre this morning, Mr Navalny said: 'This act of terror hasn't achieved its goal, it will not frighten me or my comrades. We will not reduce our efforts, we will not step back.' A key figure in Boris Yeltsin's 1990s government, Mr Nemtsov was the most prominent figure in Russia's liberal opposition to be killed during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule. The 55-year-old was shot four times in the back by a gunman in a passing car as he walked hand-in-hand with Miss Duritskaya on a bridge across the Moskva River on Friday night, in the shadow of central Moscow's St Basil Cathedral. The Ukrainian woman - physically unhurt in the attack - revealed the death threats to police in Kiev, who said today they were providing her with protection. 'On March 5, Anna Duritskaya, who is a witness in the case in the murder of Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, turned to the Ukrainian police in the Kiev Region with a statement on a threat to her life from unidentified individuals,' said the prosecutor-general's office in Ukraine. The statement offered no information on who might have issued the threats, according to the Associated Press. The model was staying with her parents since returning to her home country. A relative in Ukraine said she was 'in a bad mental state'. In the aftermath of Mr Nemtsov's assassination, Miss Duritskaya was repeatedly questioned by Russian investigators, and she complained that she was held under armed guard and unable to leave the country. However, she returned to Ukraine last week. 'This act of terror will not frighten me or my comrades': Opposition leader Alexei Navalny said he would continue his staunch criticism of Vladimir Putin's government despite the Mr Nemtsov's murder . Gunned down: Boris Nemtsov, 55, (left) and 23-year-old Miss Duritskaya (right) were walking hand-in-hand through Moscow after having dinner on Friday night when he was shot four times in the back . As thousands gathered in Moscow to pay their last respects at Mr Nemtsov's funeral, Putin insisted the Russian law enforcement authorities would do 'everything' to solve the crime. However, Nemtsov's eldest child, Zhanna Nemtsova, 30, revealed that investigators had not spoken to a single member of his close family six days after the murder. They believe his 'cruel and barefaced murder' was because of his political opposition to the Kremlin. Yesterday a top Nato official suggested Putin was responsible for Mr Nemtsov's death as he accused the Russian president of silencing dissent at home while seeking to turn Ukraine into a failed state. 'We've seen that the victims are not just in eastern Ukraine, with the brutal murder of Boris Nemtsov last Friday,' NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow said. Speaking to members of parliament from EU countries at a conference in Riga, Mr Vershbow went on: 'While we don't know who pulled the trigger, we do know that Boris Nemtsov was a powerful voice for democracy and against Russia's involvement in Ukraine ... (and) was among those vilified as ""traitors"" and ""fifth columnists"" in Russia's official propaganda.' 'We will not let her go back to Russia': Anton Geraschenko, an aide to Ukraine's Interior Minister, said Miss Duritskaya would not return to Moscow over the probe into the death of the Vladimir Putin foe . Honoured: People  applaud as workers carry the coffin of Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov during a ceremony at the Sakharov centre in Moscow, where his body was laid in state after he was shot dead on Friday . Mr Nemtsov, a father of four, first gained an international profile after being spotted by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as a future leader of Russia. He was Russia's deputy prime minister from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency, but found himself on the fringes of the country's politics after a tanking economy forced Yeltsin's resignation. The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012. It has been reported that Nemtsov angered Putin's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, his hometown. In January 2011, he was sentenced to 15 days in jail after being arrested at a New Year's Eve protest rally for 'disobedience towards police'. Murder: Flowers lie at the scene of Mr Nemtsov's murder, while police divers search the Moskva River for the gun that was used to gun him down. He was a key figure in Russia's liberal, pro-West opposition . Pro-West in his ideology, Mr Nemtsov had told U.S. diplomats he wanted to take Russia on a pro-EU, pro-Nato course, including eventual membership of both organisations, according to a diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks. 'The key, Nemtsov argued, was to present this strategy as the only viable choice for Russia,' wrote a U.S. embassy attaché in the note dated February 2006. But, the diplomat continued, 'Nemtsov also realizes that his association with the Yeltsin era will probably limit support for any initiative with his name on it, and he is counting on the next generation of politicians to carry the liberal banner.' Putin has claimed Mr Nemtsov's murder - yards from the Kremlin - was a 'provocation'.","Anna Duritskaya, 23, told police she had received anonymous threats .

"From sitting lifeless to smiling and standing, this is the heartwarming moment an Alzheimer's patient undergoes a startling transformation as her musician son performs for her. Joe Fraley, 34, from Los Angeles, California, filmed the moment he played his guitar and sang for his 70-year-old mother Judy at her nursing home. As he  plays away, video footage shows his sole spectator suddenly getting into the swing of things. At one point she shakes her hands along to the rhythm and then at the end she stands on two feet to say 'bravo'. 'Isn't he good?' the senior says to other patients at the hospice. Fraley told Daily Mail Online that his mother is now in the late stages of Alzheimer's and it seems like she could 'go at any time'. He continued: 'Right now she's lost a lot of her basic motor functions. 'She doesn't understand how to do things like go to the bathroom, getting dressed, etc and needs assistance. She hasn't eaten in months.' However, when the singer-songwriter went to pay his mother a visit this week he was shocked to see the restorative effect his music had on her. He said the song he sung to her was about 'focusing on the things that make you feel good about yourself and make your life worth living.'

Empowering: As he plays away, video footage shows his sole spectator  getting into the swing of things . It's not the first time Fraley has filmed himself singing to his mother. Last fall, he captured a musical session at his parents' house on the veranda before the Alzheimer's had reached its end stage. Fraley said he wanted the melodies to trigger some king of memory. The clip went on to garner more than one million hits with many viewers applauding the singer's 'kind' and 'caring' actions. Touching on the impact his recent vocal jam had on his mother, he concluded: 'Alzheimer's is an odd disease, it's amazing how much things can go up and down.' Toe-tapping: At one point, Fraley's mother shakes her hands along to the rhythm and then at the end she stands on two feet to say 'bravo' Lasting memories: Fraley told Daily Mail Online that his mother is now in the late stages of Alzheimer's and it seems like she could 'go at anytime' Bravo: 'Isn't he good?' the senior says to other patients at the hospice . In a post on Reddit, Fraley previously noted that he felt guilty about releasing his videos to the public, because they show his beloved mother 'at her worst' and he felt, to a certain extent, as though he was exploiting her illness. 'Part of me felt like it would be exploiting my mom and letting strangers see her at her worst,' he wrote. 'She was a college professor and after she was let go from her job she was very self-conscious of people thinking she was stupid.' But in the end he said he was glad he posted the videos because 'people have said such nice things and it promotes awareness of such a horrible disease. 'My dad and three siblings are proud as well.' The Fraley family are currently raising money via the crowdfunding site GoFundMe to pay for Mrs Fraley's medical treatment. Any remaining funds  will be donated to the Alzheimer's Association in her name.","Joe Fraley, 34, from Los Angeles, California, filmed the moment he played his guitar and sang for his 70-year-old mother Judy at her nursing home .

"School children around the country will be watching tomorrow's once-in-a-decade solar eclipse on TV due to safety fears. Britain will be thrown into partial darkness around 9.30am tomorrow morning as the moon passes in front of the sun, blocking out up to 98 per cent of its light. But many schools are keeping children indoors when the phenomenon takes place because of fears they could damage their eyes by looking at the sun. The decision by head teachers has angered parents, who want their children to experience the rare celestial event without sitting in front of a screen. Pupils at a number of schools around Britain will be kept indoors tomorrow during the solar eclipse over fears they may damage their eyes by looking at the sun. File photo . Those living in some parts of Britain may not see the eclipse due to the cloudy weather which is forecast . Mother-of-two Jen Palmer, from Worthing, West Sussex, tweeted: 'Hands up who is rebelling against school rules tomorrow and sending their kids in late having watched the eclipse?' And Paul Towner, a father from Reading, Berkshire, wrote: 'Should I take my son to school late so he can watch the Eclipse? They are watching it on TV!' Isabel Stevenson, a mother-of-four from Glasgow, added: 'So not happy about secondary school my kids go to doing NOTHING for solar eclipse tomorrow! Livid and furious. I'm on a mission today.' She has set up a petition calling on her children's school, Greenfaulds High School in Cumbernauld, to do more to mark the occasion. The petition states: 'I have been told by the school that they are doing nothing for the event. 'Pupils who are absent from class will be penalised as normal, and the school has no plans in place for viewing the eclipse as it happens, either by video, or by projection. 'Pupils with solar viewing glasses will not be allowed to go outside and use them. '[The school] is dismissing the value that witnessing this rare astronomical event will have on many pupils and it goes against the idea that school is a place of education.' Parents in other areas say they have been left running around after schools only announced today that children would have to bring their own 'eclipse-viewing glasses'. The decision has caused anger among parents, who do not want their children to miss out on the event . Pupils around Britain also went online to complain after some were told the blinds in their classrooms would be closed during the eclipse and others said they would be shown a recording of the event in the afternoon. Oldway primary school in Paignton, Devon, is another one of those which has come under fire for keeping children inside, where they will watch it on computer screens. Parent Sophie Bertorelli said: 'It is a bit of a shame to watch it on a computer. I would have thought they would have maybe supplied some protective glasses.' Head teacher Jane Smythe said she had 700 children to look after and she 'could not guarantee that they would not look at the sun'. Ms Smythe said she understood if parents wanted to keep children at home for the first hour of school so they could watch it together. The school is not the only one to make the decision. The Penryn Primary Academy Cornwall says it is broadcasting the event for children in the school hall, Lasswade Primary School in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian are also keeping students indoors and Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Birmingham is screening it on TV in the afternoon to all but Year 7 students, who will be allowed outside. Oldway Primary School in Paignton, Devon, is keeping pupils inside. Its headteacher, Jane Smythe (left) says she cannot guarantee pupils will not look at the sun . Some parent's have back the decision. Fiona Bullman, in Paignton, told the BBC: 'It's too much of a risk. You can't risk 700 children potentially being blinded. Unless there's one adult to one child, you can't [risk it].' The Department for Education has said what schools do for the eclipse is a matter for individual head teachers to decide. Would you let your child watch the solar eclipse? Would you let your child watch the solar eclipse? Now share your opinion . Looking at the sun either with naked eyes or through unfiltered binoculars or telescopes  can permanently damage people's eyesight. Those who want to look at the occurrence are being advised to use pin-hole projectors or glasses with special filters. It is feared clouds could also ruin viewing of the eclipse, with overcast skies forecast for much of the south west of England. Northern cities such as Lancaster, York and Newcastle should have sunnier days and Scotland, where the eclipse will conceal almost 98 per cent of the sun in places, will be largely clear. A Met Office spokeswoman said: 'Forecasting exactly where cloud will break and reform is really not scientifically possible. But it's not as thick in the south as further north, so you're more likely to see breaks in the cloud the further south you are.' It is not unknown for a fleeting break in cloud to occur during an eclipse as the atmosphere cools. Another 'deep' partial eclipse visible in the UK will not occur until August 12, 2026, and the next total eclipse not until September 2090. Tomorrow's eclipse will produce a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crosses the North Atlantic and covers only two land masses, the Faroe Islands between Scotland and Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine . Do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse? 'It's all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening, but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes, binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight. 'That's not to say that you can't watch the eclipse on Friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection. 'Dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk. However, unless you already own one, know somebody who does or are looking to get into solar astronomy, they can be a massive investment of several hundred pounds. 'There are cheaper ways to observe the eclipse, though.' Are solar glasses fine to use? 'Many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse. These can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers. 'They work by employing a Mylar film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun's light, allowing you to view the eclipse safely. 'Before using them though, you should make sure that they are not damaged in any way and you should ensure that you have bought them from a reputable dealer. If you're in doubt, don't use your viewers at all.' How can you use a telescope to observe the eclipse? 'If you own a telescope, then there are several ways for you to observe the eclipse. 'If you don't own them already, it is possible for you to buy a solar filter, which covers the aperture of your telescope to ensure that you can observe the sun safely. The movement of the sun and moon means the eclipse will be seen at different times around the UK . 'They are found to be made of glass or as with the solar glasses, Mylar film. It is possible to make a solar filter using Mylar sheets but caution is advised while making your own solar filter - any scratches or pinholes will lead to dangerous amount of sunlight entering your eyes. 'You should also avoid relying on eyepiece filters - they cannot handle the sun's light. 'Telescope projection is also a safe way to observe the eclipse. By using two large, white pieces of card, you can project the eclipse's image onto one piece, while using the other to fit around your telescope's tube to act as a mask to shield your eyes from the sun. 'Focusing your telescope's eyepiece, while holding the second card away, which projects the image, will enable you to show the eclipse to a large group of people safely. 'You should not use a cheap, plastic telescope for telescope projection and ensure that your finderscope has its cap on. 'Never look at the eclipse whilst lining up your telescope with the sun and never leave your telescope unattended. You should also ensure that your instrument doesn't overheat.' Can you use household items to view the eclipse? 'If you don't have a standard telescope or have forgotten to buy a solar viewer, then there are several household items you can use so that you don't miss out on seeing this fantastic event. 'Using a piece of card, or anything that has small holes punched into it, you can project the eclipse onto another piece of card. This is certainly one of the safest ways of viewing the eclipse since you don't need to look at the sun at all. 'A washing up bowl or bucket can also be lined with a black bin liner and then filled with water to make a reflective surface to safely watch the eclipse. When and where will the eclipse be visible? 'The eclipse will begin in the morning. For observers in the UK, the eclipse starts at 8.30am, peaks at 9.35 am and ends at 10.41am, so you should make sure that you know where the Sun rises from your location. 'The total solar eclipse - that's 100 per cent of the Sun's surface covered by the Moon - is visible from the Faroe Islands and Svalbard but if you are unable to get to these locations, many are able to see a substantial partial eclipse - for instance, Scotland will see around 90 per cent of the Sun's disc covered by the moon.' How dark will it get in the UK? 'In London and even in places where there's 90 per cent sun coverage, we're not really going to notice any changes in brightness because there's still a portion of the sun's surface uncovered. 'It'll be like there's a cloud passing over the Sun - you know it's cloudy but it's still light.'

"Petty criminals were once held in chains within its walls before being sent to waiting prison ships docked on the banks of the River Thames and shipped to the colonies. Today, the 18th century former courthouse lying in the heart of old Chelsea, tucked away behind Cheyne Walk, is no longer a place fit for doomed footpads ,but a stunning £14.5million home. But if you're not sure whether you want to shackle yourself to the historic building - the only surviving local courthouse-jail in the capital - you can try before you buy for the sum of £10,000 a week. Scroll down for video . The Court House in Justice Walk, at the heart of old Chelsea in London is today on the market for £14.5million. The stunning restoration boasts seven en-suite bedrooms, as well as two additional family bathrooms . The property was built in the 18th century, at a time when Chelsea was transformed into a prosperous town across the River Thames from the city of London . Leading London property agents say more and more sellers are putting their properties on both the sales and lettings markets. Many are happy to let potential buyers let a property before deciding if they want to buy. Mark Tunstall, of 'ultra prime' specialists Tunstall Property London, said: 'The practice of 'try before you buy' is more prevalent with overseas purchasers who often look to rent a property before committing to a major financial investment. 'Someone from overseas, who is unfamiliar with areas of London and how London is as a city, often has a number of friends living in different neighbourhoods, each feeding back differing opinions on areas such as Mayfair, Knightsbridge, Kensington, Chelsea, Marylebone and so on. 'However, it is impossible to really get a feeling for an area without living or visiting there for a period of time and this, coupled with the increase in stamp duty which has made buying a property even more expensive, often leads overseas buyers to first rent a property to get to know a certain area, location or development before committing to a substantial investment in their property of choice.' Petty criminals were once held in chains within its walls before being sent to waiting prison ships docked on the banks of the River Thames and shipped to the colonies . Now the courthouse has now been restored from one of the oldest local courthouses in London, into a luxurious seven bedroom family retreat, available for rent at £10,000 per week or to buy for £14.5 million . The main house boasts five bedroom suites, each with en-suite bathrooms, as well as luxurious floor to ceiling wardrobes and full height bespoke doors. The grand master bedroom occupies the entire top floor, serviced by his and hers luxurious en-suite bathrooms, walk in wardrobes and private studies surmounted by vast skylights and partitioning doors . Legend has it a secret underground passage is located underneath The Court House, which was used to transport the old Court's most dangerous convicts to the prison ships moored on the nearby banks of the River Thames . 'In one particular instance I re-housed a young banker three times, each time in an increasingly expensive home. On the third occasion, having paid a year's rent of over £400,000 in advance (£8,500 per week) for an ultra-cool pad apartment in Knightsbridge, a stone's throw from Harrods, he decided within three days of moving in that he loved the house so much he'd like to buy it, so we approached the landlord and 4 weeks later we completed the purchase for just over £10 million.' In the 18th Century, Justice Walk gained its name, as it was a place where prisoners, many charged for similar crimes to the legendary highwayman Dick Turpin, were tried. Those found guilty were subsequently taken on the short walk down to prison ships, waiting to transport them to one of Britain's Penal Colonies. Legend has it a secret underground passage is located underneath The Court House, which was used to transport the old Court's most dangerous convicts to the prison ships moored on the nearby banks of the River Thames. Developed in the 18th Century, The Court House, which is being sold through agents Russell Simpson, is no longer the final place for petty criminals, but a lavish home that encapsulates the feeling of being in an oriental woodland retreat, giving the occupiers a sense of calm in one of the world's busiest cities.

The home also features a secluded walled garden, which connects the main house with a guesthouse . What was once the courtroom jail, has been transformed into a family room and study, as well as housing a recently refurbished Gaggenau kitchen and the fifth bedroom suite. Three centuries ago, the feeling around The Court House, with towering ceilings, would have been that of despair and despondency, as magistrates decided the fate of highwaymen, drunkards and tax dodgers. The dominance of these grand historical masterpieces remains, although they now have an ambience of luxury and comfort.

If its four walls could whisper, they would tell of trials held for highway robbers, petty thieves and drunks. The Court House was built in the early 18th century, and witnessed hundreds of trials of petty criminals. Most of the crimes dealt with inside its court rooms were for highway robberies committed by footpads along the dark lanes between Chelsea and the capital.

"Chinese tourists have been told to stay off commuter trains that run between central Paris and France’s largest international airport following a rash of robberies this year. The Chinese embassy in Paris issued the rare travel warning this week, saying that it is following up on the cases with investigators. Instead of taking RER trains the embassy is urging Chinese visitors to use buses, taxis or ‘other transport’ to travel between Paris’ tourist zone and Charles de Gaulle Airport north-east of the city centre. Chinese tourists have been told to avoid the RER B train between central Paris and Charles de Gaulle Airport . According to the embassy at least four robberies have occurred on RER B trains – which run almost 24 hours a day with frequent departures – since mid-February, the Hong Kong newspaper The Standard reported. It said one tourist missed a flight home to China after his or her bag was stolen during the 40-minute train ride. In other incidents, a young Chinese visitor suffered ‘a very huge loss’, and two tourists missed their flights home after they had property stolen. Working as individuals or in groups, thieves have been targeting holidaymakers on trains and using distraction thefts. China's embassy in Paris said at least four tourists have been robbed on RER trains since mid-February . In some cases one of the thieves will drop coins or other objects and the helpful holidaymaker has his or her property stolen while they help to pick them up. Some victims have had their bags snatched moments before the train’s doors close. Miramar Travel general manager Alex Lee Chun-ting told The Standard that tours to France and the rest of Europe remain ‘incredibly popular’ and thefts are nothing new. He said: ‘These types of thefts have been occurring for the past few years, but the Chinese government has only just decided to issue a travel warning.’ Thefts on the RER train system are not just limited to tourists, however. Late last year Paris police reported an eight per cent drop in muggings against tourists . According to The Local, the RER service has a reputation for being a crime hotspot, with a gang of about 20 thieves robbing numerous passengers in a planned attack last Sunday. It led to opposition politicians calling for heightened security measures at RER stations, including more CCTV. Late last year Paris police announced that they had seen an eight per cent drop in the number of muggings involving tourists. The French capital once said that it would bring in police from China to support a crime crackdown and assist Chinese tourists, but the plan has been put on hold.","Chinese embassy in Paris took the rare step of warning holidaymakers .

'To get to my speed it did take quite a lot of practice. 'I used to practice for a few hours a day, until I got a bit older and started to focus on university and jobs.' The challenge was one of several World Cube Association events contested by participants from 14 countries. Oliver added: 'The techniques for memorizing something like a Rubik's Cube or even other things like packs of cards or numbers have stayed the same for thousands of years. 'Everyone is capable - it just requires a bit of patience.' The Rubik's cube was invented by Hungarian architect Erno Rubik in 1974. He created the puzzle because he wanted a working model to help explain three-dimensional geometry. It won Toy of the Year in the UK in both 1980 and 1981, despite the fact most people could not solve the riddle. Labour leader Ed Miliband is a fan of the toy and once boasted that he can do a Rubik's cube in 90 seconds.

"Ben Cooper, controller of BBC Radio 1, said yesterday that he 'wouldn't expect members of his family to put up with such treatment at work' The BBC is facing mounting pressure not to let Jeremy Clarkson off the hook if its investigation concludes that he did punch a Top Gear producer. Ben Cooper, controller of BBC Radio 1, said yesterday that he wouldn't expect members of his family to put up with such treatment at work and that the allegations must be 'dealt with in a very serious way'. 'If my son or daughter went to a place of work where they were shouted at, abused and someone threw a punch at them, then I would want there to be an inquiry and I would want that to be dealt with in a very serious way,' he said. Tory MP John Whittingdale also waded into the row last night, warning that the BBC should not make any special allowances for Clarkson, pictured yesterday on his bike, regardless of his show's popularity. Mr Whittingdale, chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee, said: 'Jeremy Clarkson should be given no special dispensation. He should be treated like any other employee at the BBC and the same disciplinary rules should apply to him as to anyone else.' He added that it would be 'hard to see the case' for keeping Clarkson if he is found to have punched producer Oisin Tymon. Ben Cooper, controller of BBC Radio 1, has said the allegations against Jeremy Clarkson, pictured on a bicycle in West London yesterday, should be 'dealt with in a very serious way' Clarkson was suspended by the BBC two weeks ago, following allegations of a ‘fracas’ with producer Oisin Tymon (left) over hot food . Top Gear is sold in more than 200 countries, bringing in around £50million a year for the BBC. Clarkson was keen to stress his commercial clout in next month's Top Gear magazine, which was written before the latest row erupted and will go on sale on Friday. He warned against Top Gear becoming boring, saying: 'We could talk about fuel economy. And hire purchase plans. But, if we did, we'd be left with almost no viewers in the UK, and no foreign sales.' Clarkson allegedly punched Mr Tymon when he was offered cold cuts instead of a hot steak after a long day of filming. He is also said to have called the producer a 'lazy Irish ****', during what the BBC described as a 'fracas'. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director-general, is expected to deliver his verdict on Clarkson's future as soon as today.","Ben Cooper said allegations must be 'dealt with in a very serious way'

"The probe into an alleged paedophile network at the heart of the British Establishment took an explosive turn last night with the revelation that Enoch Powell’s name has been passed to police. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the late Tory MP, one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of the 20th Century, has been named to Scotland Yard by the Bishop of Durham. The claims relate to ‘ritual satanic abuse’. And in a further development to the sex-ring investigations, police are to be given access to secret files held on MPs in the House of Commons archives as they hunt for evidence on suspected abusers, including former Liberal MP Cyril Smith. Scroll down for video . Historic: Enoch Powell's name was first linked to sex abuse claims in the 1980s . The Bishop of Durham, Paul Butler, contacted police after Powell’s name was passed to him by a former Bishop of Monmouth, Dominic Walker, who first heard the allegation when he was a vicar counselling young adults in the 1980s. The claim is being examined by Operation Fenbridge, one of a number of police probes into ‘Establishment paedophile rings’ – including an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into claims that officers dropped their inquiries under pressure from powerful individuals. A Church of England spokesman said: ‘The name of Enoch Powell was passed to Operation Fenbridge by one of our safeguarding team on the instruction of Bishop Paul Butler.' Mr Walker is believed to have warned the Right Rev Butler that at the time he was told of the claims against Powell, unsubstantiated allegations of satanic rituals – often involving the abuse of children – were widespread. In 1994, an investigation by the London School of Economics into 84 alleged cases of ‘satanic abuse’ in the UK between 1987 and 1992, including notorious cases in Rochdale and the Orkneys that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids, found no convincing corroborative evidence. Report: Paul Butler, the Bishop of Durham, passed the name to Scotland Yard after hearing it from the former Bishop of Monmouth . However, the ongoing scandal over how serial paedophile Jimmy Savile was able to evade detection for decades has led institutions to take a safety-first approach, so the Church felt it had no option but to pass on the information to police. Enoch Powell’s frontline political career ended abruptly in 1968 after he made his infamous ‘rivers of blood’ speech warning about the dangers of uncontrolled immigration. Tory leader Edward Heath sacked him from the Shadow Cabinet the following day, although Powell remained an MP until 1974. Shortly after he died in 1998, aged 85, it was revealed he had admitted to a friend, Canon Eric James, that love poetry he had written as a youth had been intended for a man – but that he did not want the fact revealed while he was alive. Although Powell became a hero of the Right, his intellectual and oratorical skills earned him admirers on both sides of the political divide. A devout member of the Church of England, he had two daughters with his wife Pamela. Sources close to one of Scotland Yard’s sex-ring investigations say officers contacted Lawrence Ward, the Commons Serjeant at Arms – the Commons’ most senior security official – earlier this month to ask him to search the files kept on all MPs. It is understood that no information was uncovered implicating MPs in abuse, sparking fears at Scotland Yard that some of the evidence might have been shredded. Now Mr Ward is believed to have told officers that, if they produce a warrant, they can enter the Commons to investigate the files themselves on a ‘case by case basis’. Last night, Simon Heffer, Powell’s official biographer and former confidante, branded the allegations ‘absolute nonsense’ and without foundation.","Bishop of Durham Paul Butler names late Tory politician to Scotland Yard .

"Islamic State has accepted a pledge of allegiance from Nigerian terrorists Boko Haram who killed 10,000 people in the country last year. The audio message entitled 'kill and be killed' and released through the militants' vast social media channels was allegedly read by an ISIS spokesperson. As well as welcoming Boko Haram's loyalty, the speech also threatens further violence against Christian and Jewish communities according to News Week. Scroll down for video . Deadly allies: An audio message released in the name of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (left) accepted the pledge of allegiance offered by Boko Haram's Abubakar Shekau (right) Terrorist: The audio message released by ISIS calls on Jihadi's who can not join the fight in the Middle East  (pictured) to join the conflict in Nigeria instead . Command: ISIS currently has territory in Iraq, Syria and a vast support structure across the Middle East and northern Africa - and its alliance with Boko Haram gives them access to north-east Africa too . Threat: As well as accepting Boko Haram's request, the recording also promises more violence against Christian and Jewish communities . Speaking for his leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the man in the recording says: 'We announce to you to the good news of the expansion of the caliphate to West Africa. 'Our caliph  has accepted the pledge of loyalty of our brothers of Boko Haram so we congratulate Muslims and our jihadi brothers in West Africa.' He urged Muslims who could not join the fight in Syria to enter the conflict in Africa instead. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan claims Boko Haram insurgents have already traveled to the Middle East to train with ISIS militants, according toVoice of America. In an interview with VOA he said: 'So we know the links are there. But even now, we may not know the degree of linkages as to how much funds are coming in from them, the kind of volume of weapons coming in from them, the nationalities coming from them. 'But the training, because some of the Boko Haram members go to have their training in the ISIS camp and come back.' He refused to name the countries where the fighters were trained but said he has long suspected Boko Haram of already having links with other extremist groups globally. Brutality: Just last week, Boko Haram burned down a school (pictured) in the north-eastern village of Chibok from where they kidnapped 276 teenage girls in 2014 . Massacre: The tens of thousands of Nigerians that have been killed in Boko Haram attacks included the 28 people who died in this Christmas Day bombing at two churches in 2011 . Partnership: After Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS, Nigeria's president revealed he has had suspicions that the militants have already traveled to the Middle East to train with Islamic State fighters . Request: Boko Haram pledged its allegiance to ISIS' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi over the weekend in their own audio message (pictured) His country has brought in hundreds of mercenaries from South Africa to aid Nigeria in its fight against Boko Haram, according to regional and military sources. The foreign 'soldiers of fortune' were allegedly pictured on Twitter riding armoured vehicles through Maiduguri - the regional capital of Nigeria's north-east which has been besieged by terrorism. A Reuters reporter with knowledge of the city was able to verify the location of the photo as  Bama road, leading south-east out of the city. On Wednesday, President Goodluck Jonathan said two companies were providing 'trainers and technicians' to help Nigerian forces. The Nigerian terrorists first offered their allegiance to ISIS - who command territory in Syria and Iraq - over the weekend in their own audio message. It said: 'We announce our allegiance to the Caliph... and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity, in hardship and ease.' The insurgents have killed thousands in bomb attacks and violent sieges on villages in the remote north-east, and are now feared to be spilling over into neighbouring Cameroon and Chad. Reinforcements: The UN has called on the international community to supply Nigeria with arms and support but there have already been reports of hundreds of South African mercenaries in the country (pictured) Armed support: These pictures emerged on Twitter and appear to show 'soldiers of fortune' - in the north-east's capital of Maiduguri - who have been recruited to take on Boko Haram in Nigeria . Cavalry: On Wednesday, President Goodluck Jonathan said two companies were providing 'trainers and technicians' to help Nigerian forces . Members of the UN Security Council have called on the international community to supply money, equipment, troops and intelligence to the five-nation African coalition fighting them. A draft resolution between the countries authorises the use of force against Boko Haram and Chad believes it will be approved as early as next week. Boko Haram killed an estimated 10,000 people last year and took responsibility for last April's abduction of more than 275 schoolgirls. The resolution demands the immediate release of anyone abducted by Boko Haram which it calls 'one of the most serious threats to international peace and security'. The United States, Britain, France and the European Union are backing the formation of a multinational force of 8,750 troops led by Nigeria and Chad with contingents from Cameroon, Niger and Benin. The militants have been waging a six-year insurgency to impose strict Shariah law in Nigeria and earlier this year it launched attacks across the border on Cameroon - before striking Niger and Chad.","Recording was released earlier today after Boko Haram's original request .

"When Avery Wallace was born, doctors told his parents: 'It's a girl'. But from a very young age, the youngster from Los Angeles knew it simply wasn't the case. The transgender 15-year-old knew he was a boy from the age of two, setting his physical 'parts' aside. Writing for CNN, he has described how he knew he was male long before he discovered the terms 'gay' and 'sexuality', and the difficulty he encountered with other people's perceptions growing up. He also urges parents to let children set out their path - no matter their gender. Avery Wallace (right) poses for a picture with his sister Riley in 2002 at the age of three. He claims he knew he was a boy when he was two . His parents let him cut his hair short for his preschool graduation, even though he was wearing a dress . Describing life as a toddler, he said: 'I was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind - not yet distorted by biology, other people's confusion, or fear. 'No matter how many times I was told differently, I was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too, for the most part.' He said he first heard the term 'gay' in second grade, even after he had his first 'girlfriend', and remembered how one year 'a penis' was at the top of his Christmas list. However he feared people may perceive him as 'different' when he learned homosexuality was considered by some to be abnormal. 'I knew I liked girls and I was technically a girl, biologically, but I was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings. I was not gay - but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over.' At the age of seven he started to prefer wearing boys clothes and by eight, he was playing baseball . Avery was elected class president in the fifth grade by his peers. He strongly stated that he was a boy and the 'people that mattered knew it too, for the most part' He is pictured at age 10 with short, curly hair. By now he was living the life of a boy, but the word transgender hadn't formed part of his vocabulary . Avery described how he was able to become the boy he wanted, because he grew up in a house that taught him to 'love anyone I wanted to.' 'That said,' he added. 'I knew being gay wasn't a bad thing, but I also knew it didn't describe me. I was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that, either.' When he entered middle school, he grew out his hair and started to wear dresses as to avoid the 'emotional torture'. But in 2012, when he was 12, he told his parents he was transgender. He is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment after attending a number of group sessions, and has urged people to consider categorizing people into boys and girls more carefully. 'I cannot stress to the world enough, gender and sexuality are two completely different things, and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight,' Avery said. He added: 'Whether I'm a boy or a girl, white or black, rich or poor, gay or straight, it's completely irrelevant. What truly matters is the fact that I'm Avery Wallace and I've always known exactly who I was.' Avery wore a suit and lavender waistcoat for his fifth grade graduation, but from then on he grew out his hair and some times wore a dress to avoid the 'emotional torture' of middle school . In 2012 he told his parents he was transgender and is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment .","When Avery Wallace was born, doctors told his parents: 'It's a girl'

"Rona Fairhead should resign or be sacked as chairman of the BBC Trust, a leading MP demanded yesterday. Margaret Hodge said Mrs Fairhead, who is also a director of HSBC, had been either ‘incredibly naive or totally incompetent’ over the tax evasion scandal at the bank’s Swiss division. The 53-year-old was criticised by MPs on the powerful Public Accounts Committee as they grilled her over allegations that the embattled bank helped wealthy clients to hide billions of pounds from the taxman. Scroll down for video . Rona Fairhead faced a call to resign as chairman of the BBC Trust after being grilled about her time as a non-executive director on HSBC's board . Mrs Fairhead claimed repeatedly that she had not been aware of any wrongdoing and that she had relied on various committees and structures to flag up problems. But MPs said her performance at the bank was not good enough – raising serious questions over whether she is suitable for her BBC role. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: ‘I really do think you should consider your position and consider resigning and if not, the Government should sack you. Either you knew or you didn’t know – and I think in that case that you are either incredibly naive or totally incompetent. ‘I don’t think that the performance you’ve shown here, and your record as a guardian of HSBC give me confidence that you should be the guardian of the licence fee.’ Labour MP Mrs Hodge added: I’ve met you once and I like you but I don’t think you are fit for the job… I’m afraid you’ve lost my trust.’ Mrs Fairhead has already come under considerable pressure over potential conflicts between her multiple jobs, since she started as chairman of the BBC Trust last September. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said Ms Fairhead had lost her trust, but Tory committee member Stephen Hammond disagreed with the call for her to resign . In addition to the £110,000-a-year position, on which she spends three days a week, she is a non-executive director of Pepsi and HSBC. Last year she received more than £513,000 in fees and benefits for her work at the troubled bank, including a £334,000 fee as non-executive chairman of HSBC North America Holdings. Yesterday, MPs marvelled at the fact that she is paid so much, but did not do more to find out about HSBC’s alleged efforts to help tax evaders. Mrs Fairhead was one of a panel of HSBC bosses hauled in front of the committee who spent the session trying to blame others for the tax evasion scandal at its division in Switzerland. Leaked files showed that more than 1,000 people from the UK had secret accounts at HSBC’s Swiss bank, including a number of Tory donors. The Public Accounts Committee of MPs was taking on Tax avoidance and evasion: HSBC in Parliament . But she argued that the chief culprits were those who had evaded tax and people on the front line, rather than the non-executive directors. ‘We relied on three layers of board oversight and multiple layers of executive oversight to raise issues of material importance to the audit committee,’ Mrs Fairhead said. ‘We were reliant on [reports from] specialists… It wasn’t flagged so you’ve got to ask, “What more can you do?’’’ MPs responded that the BBC Trust chief sounded too ‘passive’, and accused the wider HSBC board of ‘extraordinary’ blindness. Last week Mrs Fairhead told a conference that she would prioritise her job at the BBC Trust over her other positions, and that she was keeping her roles on the HSBC and Pepsi boards ‘under review’. She also took the unusual step of recommending that the BBC Trust should be abolished. It was time for oversight by a tough external regulator, she said.","Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge urges resignation .

"With its riverbank setting in the upmarket Buckinghamshire village of Bourne End, this Victorian house could hardly have a more peaceful location. But its history tells a different story – of revolutionary social change and financial despair. Platts Dell, whose garden the meandering River Thames sleepily caresses, is where the formative years of frontline suffragette Kate Parry Frye were spent. It was here that her father, Frederick Frye, a businessman and Liberal politician, saw his firm collapse, resulting in his family having to auction the house that they had lived in for 22 years, as well as its contents. The four-bedroom Victorian house where suffragette Kate Parry Frye lived is  on the market for £945,000 . The details of her family's travails – and Kate's conversion into a leading light of the suffragette movement – are documented in her diaries, which she kept from the age of eight until three months before her death at 81 in 1959. The diaries were discovered in 2013 and edited into a book, Campaigning For The Vote by historian Elizabeth Crawford. They tell of how she joined the suffragettes in 1906, how she criss-crossed southern England and set up camp in the East End of London on her mission to win for 'Votes for Women', and how she helped see through the suffragettes' partial victory in 1918 – when women were allowed to vote from the age of 30 – and the full victory in 1928, when the age limit was lowered to 21, the same as for men. And last year, marking the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War, ITV told how women's fortunes changed during the war through Kate's eyes, in the series The Great War: The People's Story – with Romola Garai playing the suffragette. Platts Dell in the upmarket Buckinghamshire village of Bourne End has a riverside garden, 39ft mooring and large bay windows . 'We weren't aware when we bought the property that a famous suffragette lived here until we read the history of the house in our local library,' says John Fleming, who moved into Platts Dell with his wife Chris in 1992. 'Since then we have enjoyed researching the history of Kate and the suffragettes.' Price: £945,000 . Location: Bourne End, Buckinghamshire . Bedrooms: Four . Unique features: Private riverside garden with 39ft mooring, turret, former home of suffragette Kate Parry Frye . For most of Kate's formative years, her parents were well-to-do. Her mother was a member of the Gilbey family, who had a wine and spirits empire, and her father was a successful businessman and, for three years, an MP. Although not needing to work, Kate wanted a career in the theatre. She trained as an actress and went on tour with a rep company. When the play wasn't a success she returned to the family home. She joined the suffragettes and founded the Bourne End and District Suffrage Society, later taking a paid job as organiser of the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage. John and Chris live in one half of the house, which was divided into two in 1989. The property has a private mooring on the Thames and is on a private no-through road. Frontline suffragette Kate Parry Frye (left) spent her formative years living at the house, and was played by Romola Garai (right)  in The Great War . The village centre, with its train station, is only a few hundred yards away. 'We loved the house from the moment we saw it,' says John, who works as a finance director for a financial services company. 'Chris and I love sitting out and watching the boats go by.' Platts Dell, which has four bedrooms, is laid out over three floors and has a circular turret, and large bay windows in the living room and dining room with views over the front garden. From most of the upper floors in the house there are views of the river. The Flemings, who have three children and five grandchildren, are selling, for £945,000, because the other half of the house has become free. 'It became available when our neighbour passed away – we've always had our eye on it,' says John.","Four-bedroom Victorian house Platts Dell is on the market for £945,000 .

"Rayhanur Choudhury has been jailed for theft after he was believed to have swallowed a diamond ring . A thief has been jailed after he is believed to have swallowed an £8,500 chunky diamond ring when arrested by police. Officers said they saw Rayhanur Choudhury with a silver 'glint' in his mouth when they went to arrest him after being called to Exclusive Jewellery in Brighton. The 22-year-old was fed five or six meals a day in a police cell with no flushing toilet in a bid to get him to pass the ring, which was fully set with emerald-cut diamonds. However nothing has been found. He was convicted of theft and jailed for nine months, following a hearing at Brighton Crown Court. Police were called to the store in November last year after Choudhury started trying on rings while staff were distracted. Lilly Jordan, a shop assistant, suspected he had swapped the 18-carat white gold ring for a fake alternative. She told the court: 'I counted the rings and there were five but one seemed out of place. 'It stuck out like a sore thumb.' Sabina Palermo, the manager of the store, said at the time: 'The missing ring is very chunky and certainly not something you would want to swallow.' CCTV footage showed Choudhury tilt his head back during the struggle with police. PC English said: 'He opened his mouth wide and I saw briefly the distinctive glint of something inside. 'I believe I saw something silver, an object that shouldn't have been there.' Choudhury, of Newhaven, East Sussex, denied the theft and the ring was never found. The ring was taken from Exclusive Jewellery in Brighton as Choudhury browsed the jewellery on display . He told the court he had explained to officers he was unwell so he could have an X-ray at hospital to prove he had not swallowed the ring. Alec Williams, prosecuting, said: 'It's a straightforward, not particularly sophisticated con trick, a switch.' Choudhury was also ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge.","Rayhanur Choudhury was trying on rings in Exclusive Jewellery, Brighton .

"A ski lift operator and his employer have been charged with involuntary manslaughter over the death of a British teenager after a school trip to the French Alps. Kieran Brookes, 14, was strangled when the straps of his backpack became entangled as he tried to get off a ski lift in the Alpine resort of Chatel in February 2011. Richard Cettour, 50, of Bonnevaux, France, who was supervising the lift at the time of the tragedy, and operator SAEM Sports et Tourisme a Chatel, will face a criminal trial in October accused of a series of serious health and safety breaches. Kieran Brookes (pictured), was strangled when the straps of his backpack became entangled as he tried to get off a ski lift . The 14-year-old was on a school skiing trip in the Alpine resort of Chatel (pictured) in February 2011. Kieran's parents, Nick and Cindy Brookes, have said they want to establish the sequence of events that led to his death so no other family will suffer a similar tragedy. They hope the trial will provide answers to lingering questions surrounding their son's death. Mr Brookes, 50, an NHS manager from Bovey Tracey, Devon, said: 'All this time after Kieran's death we are still not sure of exactly what happened. 'Not knowing the events which led to his death is something which holds back the healing process. 'We have some information about what went so dreadfully wrong but not all the details. We have a jigsaw but with some of the pieces missing. 'We're hoping that through the trial in France we will soon get those questions answered.' Lawyers representing SAEM Sports et Tourisme a Chatel confirmed the firm and Cettour will face trial this year. Kieran (pictured) was one of the brightest maths prospects in the country after scoring 96 per cent in a national test. He was on a six-seat ski lift when the tragedy struck . They are accused of failing to enforce a rule banning skiers from boarding the lift while wearing backpacks, not carrying out daily checks on equipment and not ensuring a safety device which could stop the lift was properly installed. Cettour is also accused of a number of failings, including not being at his post at the time of the accident and not reacting to other skiers' calls to hit the emergency stop. Kieran, a pupil at Torquay Boys' Grammar School, who was one of the brightest maths prospects in the country after scoring 96 per cent in a national test, was on a six-seat ski lift when the tragedy struck. It is believed his backpack got stuck on the lift chair as he tried to climb off at the top of the slope. Kieran was suspended by his clothing for around four minutes before he was released, according to witnesses. First aiders battled for eight minutes to revive him before he was taken to hospital in Annecy with a severe brain injury. He was transferred to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital intensive care unit where he died nearly a month later on March 17, 2011. Mr Brookes said: 'It feels so very fresh because we are still going over the events in our mind. Nick and Cindy Brookes, the parents of Kieran (pictured), have said they want to establish the sequence of events that led to his death so no other family will suffer a similar tragedy . 'I think it is natural as parents to ask the questions: could more have been done to save Kieran, did he suffer, what went wrong and what can be done to prevent this from ever happening to another family? 'It is like we have an open wound that we cannot close because we don't have the resources at our disposal. 'The hole in our life left by Kieran will always be there - all the future we would have had together is missing. 'It's so difficult not being able yet to point at something positive to come from this tragedy - some safety improvements that we can say were made as a result of what we learned from Kieran's death. 'Hopefully, the trial will help us understand.' Mrs Brookes, 52, also an NHS manager, said: 'He was academically bright but also loved to be physically active and was a member of the army cadets. 'Kieran dreamed of becoming a doctor and helping people. He wanted to be a GP. We couldn't bury Kieran for six months because of the police investigation. 'We also couldn't donate his organs which was something that would have given us some comfort. The comfort that we're looking for now is that we can say that something good came of this, that lessons have been learnt from this which will make things safer.' The family's lawyer Mark Montaldo, of Slater and Gordon, said: 'The French prosecutor has enough evidence to bring two charges of involuntary manslaughter in this case against the pilot of the ski lift and the company which employed him. 'It has been devastating for Kieran's family to lose a much-loved son in these circumstances. But they are determined that the full facts of what happened are revealed and any safety failings exposed so that no other family has to suffer a similar tragedy again.'

"Valerie Trierweiler was reported to police over the incident at the Paris café . Valerie Trierweiler was yesterday reported to police for slapping a man who asked her ironically: ‘How’s Francois Hollande?’ The 50-year-old former first lady of France, who is nicknamed ‘The Rottweiler’, was last year unceremoniously kicked out after President Hollande started seeing another woman behind her back. Ms Trierweiler claimed she went into a severe depression over the affair between Mr Hollande and the TV actress Julie Gayet, 42, before writing a kiss-and-tell book. Yesterday she was having a coffee in a café in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, where she once shared a home with her ex-boyfriend. She got into a heated argument with the owner of the café, who adopted an ‘ironic tone’ as he asked Ms Trierweiler for ‘news’ about Mr Hollande. The President is still seeing Ms Gayet, and is said to have stopped communicating with Ms Trierweiler because of the unpleasant things she wrote about him in her memoire. RTL radio reported that the café owner had been discussing ‘Thank You For This Moment’, in which Ms Trierweiler portrays Mr Hollande as a lying philanderer. She also says the Socialist politician is a champagne left-winger who secretly mocks the poor when he is with his rich friends. Scroll down for video . When the café owner refused to apologise for his remarks, Ms Trierweiler is understood to have slapped him in the face. He reported the attack to police, complaining he was the victim of assault. Ms Trierweiler was never married to Mr Hollande, and was said to have destroyed his earlier relationship with Segolene Royal, the mother of Mr Hollande’s four children. Francois Hollande (right) and Ms Trierweiler together in happier times, when Hollande was running for president . Mr Hollande is still seeing TV actress Julie Gayet. His affair with her ended his relationship with Ms Trierweiler . There are also well documented claims that Ms Trierweiler once shared Mr Hollande’s affections with a right-wing politician, Patrick Devedjian, who was married at the time. Ms Trierweiler is also notorious for her short temper, and has been accused of using violence in the past. In September, the divorcee was seen slapping the face of the ex-wife of Finance Minister Michel Sapin, after scratching her face and pulling her hair in a late night bar. Ms Trierweiler was also rumoured to have gone on a rampage in the Elysee Palace after learning of Mr Hollande’s infidelity with Ms Gayet, smashing up more than £2.5million worth of vases, clocks and paintings, all part of France’s national heritage. Ms Trieweiler, a Paris Match political affairs writer who is said to have earned more than a million pounds for her book, denied the vandalism accusations, but had no immediate comment on today’s revelations. Since leaving the Elysee she has been working extremely hard to improve her public image, but remains extremely unpopular in France. Many have accused her of using her position as a former presidential consort to make as much cash as possible.","Former first lady of France Valerie Trierweiler is nicknamed The Rottweiler .

"A mother of three got an an unexpected surprise while taking a shower Wednesday morning. Brittany Young of Des Moines, Iowa was having intense pain that day, so she decided to lay down until it subsided, but when it struck again, she decided to jump in the shower. That is when, just five minutes later, she suddenly gave birth to a healthy baby girl. She named the child Miracle. Brittany Young (above with daughter Miracle) gave birth in the shower on Wednesday . The Des Moines Register reports that while Young did know she was pregnant, she did not know just how far along she was with her new baby, thinking she was only 12 weeks along at the time. As for the speedy labor, that is likely due to the fact that Young has had three other labors in just the past few years. 'I've been in shock for the last couple of days, because I didn't expect a full-term baby,' Young said. 'With my other kids, I had like three or four pushes. And with her it was just one and she was there.' Little Miracle meanwhile could not have done better in the situation. 'This baby's eyes were open; she was just sitting there staring at me. She didn't cry or anything,' Young said. 'I was in shock. I was like, there's a baby here.' A friend called an ambulance, and Miracle was treated and released back to her mother. Young, who has three other children (L to R: Nijaya, Andre and Jahanna) thought she was just 12 weeks pregnant . Now however, Young has to deal with providing for a new child she thought she had months to get ready for. 'I don't have clothes. Diapers. Nothing,' said Young. Bethany Christian Services Stronger Beginnings is assisting Young with diapers and other items to care for a newborn, and anyone willing to donate may contact the program at  515-270-0824. As for Miracle's new siblings, Andre, 4, Nijaya, 2, and Jahanna, 1, Young says they could not be more exited about their new baby sister. And the same goes for mom. 'I'm happy that she's here,' said Young.","Brittany Young of Des Moines, Iowa was having intense pain on Wednesday so she got into the shower .

"George and Amal Clooney have had to re-think their plans to secure their privacy at their Grade II-listed manor house in Berkshire after allegedly being told to remove a fence. Builders working on the Clooneys' home in Sonning on Thames is said to have been told to remove a lattice fence as it is not the required eight feet from the riverbank. Last week, the couple's plans for their nine-bedroom £10million mansion, which they bought last year, were revealed. Scroll down for video .

"Scientists wanting to develop a spacecraft carrying a nuclear device to blow up asteroids are preparing to seek funding this year. Called the Hyper Velocity Asteroid Impact Vehicle (HAIV), their system would be able to launch and reach an Earth-bound asteroid within 100 days or so, destroying it before it reached our planet. But the unmanned spacecraft relies on one crucial aspect - tracking and finding an asteroid, before it is too late to stop it impacting Earth. Scroll down for video . Boom! A Danish NGO is planning to develop an Earth-saving spacecraft called the Hyper Velocity Asteroid Impact Vehicle (HAIV). In the diagram above, NED stands for nuclear explosive device. The front of the spacecraft would create a small crater, which the nuclear device would then travel in to and explode . The  concept was created by the Emergency Asteroid Defence Project (EADP), based in Denmark. They are seeking to find a way to protect Earth from destruction when all other methods have failed. Ranging from £340 million to $1 billion ($500 million to $1.5 billion), the cost of the mission would depend on how large the incoming asteroid that needed to be destroyed was. Called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle, or HAIV, the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space. It consists of a fore body (a leader spacecraft), which would hit the comet and create blast crater. A few seconds later, an aft body (a follower spacecraft) carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times. Once an asteroid had been located, the HAIV would be launched on one of several possible rockets, including a Delta IV or Atlas V. The HAIV would then align itself such that it would impact the asteroid, by matching its orbit. The concept works using a ‘leader’ and a ‘follower’ spacecraft. After the launch, the former would separate and impact the asteroid, forming a crater in its surface. The follower, carrying a nuclear warhead, would then enter the crater and explode, blowing the asteroid to pieces. These pieces would either be deflected from Earth, or would be too small to cause any considerable damage. This diagram shows a simulation of the area affected if something the size of Halley’s Comet, with a diameter of approximately 6.2 miles (10km), hit the US - a possible global extinction event . This simulation shows the area that would be affected, if a medium  asteroid 330ft (100 metres) in diameter hit London. The EADP team says there is a significant threat of an asteroid hitting Earth . Shown is a diagram of how the spacecraft might look, with the nuclear device in the middle. Sensors at the front direct the spacecraft towards its target, before it impacts . Last year, the privately-funded B612 Foundation discovered that Earth is up to 10 times more likely to be hit than previously thought. While the majority of the impacts occur either high up in the atmosphere, or in unpopulated areas including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the danger was still ever-present. The findings were based on information released from the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation. This operates a network of sensors that monitor Earth around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations. But what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions, but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale. Between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on Earth ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons - all caused by asteroid impacts. It relies upon near-Earth objects (NEOs) being tracked, so that the threat of one hitting Earth can be measured in advance. If a potentially dangerous object is identified, the spacecraft can then be launched and sent on its mission to blow it up, before it has a chance to threaten Earth. ‘The mission of preparing humanity for a potential asteroid collision is something that should have done a long time ago,’ the team writes on their website. ‘We, as an advanced species, have had the basic technology for about half a century. ‘Events like the one in Chelyabinsk, in 2013, could have been avoided if adequate detection and deflection missions had been developed.' Launching a nuclear device into space may not be as easy as the team thinks, as there are a number of legal issues to do so. However, they say there are no safety issues with launching a nuclear device and, as the HAIV will be hitting an asteroid so far into space, ‘no nuclear material, radiation or shock wave will reach Earth.’ They continued: ‘Legal complications or not, we do however believe that if, say, a sizeable asteroid is headed towards a city like New York, Moscow or Beijing, we will as a team be able to gather the global support to get a mandate to act regardless of otherwise existing legal obstructions, if needed in order to save the lives of millions!’ And on whether it is illegal to send nuclear explosives into space, they said: ‘Probably not, as long as it is not a weapon.’ Last year experts warned that we must do more to track asteroids, as one could cause widespread damage to the planet. Most notably, in February 2013, hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia - the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century . On the left is a typical journey for the HAIV vehicle to intercept an asteroid that could dangerous to Earth. In this instance it would take 121 days to stop the asteroid before it hit, illustrated right . In the 1998 movie Armageddon, pictured, Bruce Willis must save Earth from an asteroid by flying to the space rock and blowing it up with a bomb . The team is now looking to raise £675,000 to £6.75 million ($1 million to $10 million) in the next year or so, through crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter. By 2018, they want to build a version of HAIV that could destroy an asteroid 165ft (50 metres) across. And by the end of the decade, they want to be ready to stop asteroids up to 985ft (300 metres) in size - which account for 99.9 per cent of asteroids near Earth. They note that their method, using a nuclear device, should be considered a last resort and only used if other methods have failed. Such methods could include hitting an asteroid with laser to deflect it, or rebounding solar rays into it to have the same effect. ‘However, in extreme cases with less than one year warning time and when all non-nuclear methods fail, we believe the HAIV system is the only and most appropriate technique currently available to defend Earth,’ the team said in a statement.","A Danish NGO is planning to develop Earth-saving spacecraft .

"Waist training is all the rage these days, with stars such as Kim Kardashian, Jessica Alba and Nicki Minaj all giving it a go. But one woman has taken taken the fad to extreme levels. Curvy Aleira Avendano achieved an eye-watering 20-inch waist - wearing a corset 23 hours a day. The busty model, from Caracas, Venezuela, has been wearing the waist-shrinking garment for the last six years and even refers to it as her second skin. Scroll down for video . Aleira Avendano has a tiny 20-inch waist after wearing a corset for 23 hours a day for the last six years . And despite doctors' warnings that the corset poses seriously health risks, Aleira continues to turn heads with her extreme shape. Aleira said: 'I am completely obsessed with belts and corsets - I even sleep with them on. 'I love the feeling of pressure and only take it off for an hour a day to rest and to wash myself.' The 25-year-old model began waist-training while still in her teens and now with her enhanced 34DD breasts she draws stares wherever she goes. She said: 'People stop what they're doing and stare - everywhere I go I get attention. 'People shout at me in the street - they can't believe that my figure is real. But wearing a corset took some getting used to - at first it was terrible and uncomfortable. 'After a while it became a necessity and when I'm not wearing it my skin would itch. But it's not pain - it's more pleasure, I like the pressure. I don't feel a thing, it doesn't bother me at all.' Aleira's doctors have said that her extreme waist-training could lead to complications later in life . In this shot it is clear to see how much smaller Aleira's waist is to the rest of her body . But Aleira's doctor fears that her stringent regime could lead to complications later on in life. Dr Andrés Ruiz, said: 'In my medical opinion she should stop this immediately.Thank God she has not done any damage so far but she should stop before it's too late. 'It happens because the floating ribs at the bottom of the rib cage are easier to mold - it's definitely possible to achieve this waist without surgery.' Along with the waist training, Aleira tries to keep her hourglass shape by eating right and dieting. She added: 'I only eat very small portions mainly egg whites, pineapple, lots of fruit and a little bit of meat - I have a very balanced diet. I do crunches, weights and whatever I can to stay in shape.' But a strict corset regime and a healthy lifestyle can only go so far in gaining a cartoonlike body. Aleira hopes she will become famous because of her tiny waist which she shows off her in a sequin jumpsuit . Aleira regularly wears tight fitting clothes which show off her tiny waist . Wherever she goes Aleira attracts stares from on-lookers who are confused by her figure . She added: 'I have to admit that I have had some surgery. I've had my nose done and my breasts three times. I've also had buttock implants and some liposuction - so quite a bit.' Unsurprisingly she draws both adulation and criticism whenever she hits the streets of Caracas in Venezuela - with people even comparing her to an alien. She said: 'They say that I've had too much surgery, that I don't have ribs and that I'm a man. It is totally false - people even say that I am an extraterrestrial and a transsexual.' But she considers wearing a corset for 23 hours a day a small price to pay for the happiness it brings her. She added: 'This is the best thing that has happened to me. I would like to be known for my waist, not for having the smallest waist in the world but rather for my waist and my entire body. 'That would be one of my ambitions, to be very well known for the shape of my body. Other than having a small waist I also want to be considered sexy.' Recently Cinderella star Lily James came under fire for having worn a corset during the filming of the new film. Actress Lily James has come under fire for wearing a corset in the new Cinderella film which has given her a tiny waist . Many have commented that the characters waist is too small and gives young viewers unrealistic expectations of how they should look. Lily even admitted that she couldn't eat properly during filming saying: 'When [the corset] was on we would be on continuous days, so we wouldn't stop for lunch or a lovely tea like this. You'd be sort of eating on the move. In that case, I couldn't untie the corset. 'If you ate food it didn't really digest properly, and I'd be burping all afternoon in [Richard Madden's] face, and it was just really sort of unpleasant. I'd have soup so that I could still eat but it wouldn't get stuck.' In another interview she admitted: 'I have naturally a quite small waist...And on top of that I have a corset that was pulled me [within an] inch of my life… And then the skirt is so big that the perspective and the proportions make it look smaller than it is.'","Aleira Avendano has been wearing a waist trainer for six years .

"Environmentalists involved in Prince William's China tour warned British diplomats not to let him visit a park where elephants perform circus tricks two months ago, The Mail on Sunday has learnt. But the advice – given to officials at Britain's Chongqing consulate as the Prince's itinerary was drafted in January – was brushed aside, one of the ecologists said yesterday. The Prince's tour – on which he was accompanied by four press officers – ended in a PR disaster when he visited a rescue centre at Wild Elephant Valley, only a few yards from an arena where elephants play football, dance and do tricks for tourists. In the spotlight: Prince William surrounded by his support team in China during his royal tour . The degrading performances at Wild Elephant Valley that happen just yards from the rescue centre visited by Prince William . Last month The Mail on Sunday revealed the Prince would be visiting the park and informed the Palace of the cruel conditions, but Royal sources claimed Prince William wanted to visit regardless so he could 'shine a spotlight' on the issue. However when the Prince was at the park, and was asked by Sky TV if he knew elephants were performing nearby, he seemed wrong-footed, hurrying away in silence as journalist Mark Stone called after him: 'The Chinese are using elephants to play football, your Royal Highness.' Ecologist Alice Hughes, an associate professor based at Xishuangbanna Botanical Gardens, said: 'When the British consulate told us 'We might take Prince William to Wild Elephant Valley', we all said unanimously, 'Don't take him there. It's basically a circus.' We warned the British consulate off but I think some of them are very, very naïve.' She added: 'I don't believe our concerns were filtered through to any higher levels. If Prince William had known what was going on there, I don't think there is any possibility he would have gone. I think he must have been assured they really were doing conservation work.' Both Buckingham Palace and the Foreign Office declined to say if the concerns had been passed on to the Prince. But yesterday one of his aides insisted: 'Prince William absolutely knew what was happening.' Another aide said: 'Our view is, this wasn't embarrassing. It was an essential thing for the Duke to do and one of the key reasons he went is to encourage conservation efforts and that comes in complex packaging.' Both Buckingham Palace and the Foreign Office declined to say if the concerns had been passed on to the Prince, pictured during his visit . A Kensington Palace spokesman added: 'It goes without saying the Duke does not condone the performances, but he recognises the incredible work Wild Elephant Valley has done to protect the elephant population.' But Louise Rogerson, from the Elephant Asia Rescue and Survival Foundation, said: 'Tourists will flock to Wild Elephant Valley now. Prince William is indirectly supporting cruelty to elephants forced to take part in these circus performances.'","Ecologists warned British diplomats not to let Duke visit park months ago .

"An American teacher has won a $1million prize recognizing educators around the world. Nancie Atwell from Edgecomb, Maine, received the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize from former President Bill Clinton during a presentation ceremony in Dubai on Sunday. The 63-year-old mother-of-one, who began teaching in New York in 1973, was selected over nine other finalists - including three compatriots from the United States. The writing teacher told The Daily Mail Online she plans to celebrate when she returns, but is more interested in getting back to her children at The Center for Teaching and Learning. Scroll down for video . Nancie Atwell from Edgecomb, Maine, received the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize from former President Bill Clinton during a presentation ceremony in Dubai on Sunday .

She revealed she will not be spending any of the prize money on herself, and hopes the check will be sent 'straight to her school' - where her 29-year-old daughter is also a teacher. After accepting the award, she thanked her colleagues and said: 'I love my teaching life - the intellectual, social, and personal challenges of working with young people and the satisfaction of developing methods that transform their lives and give them perspective on the lives of others. I am grateful to the Varkey Foundation for shining a light on teaching as a powerful profession, one of fulfillment, creativity, and lasting worth.' During an interview last week, Atwell said she's 'convinced that teaching language arts is one of the great careers', because it's 'demanding', but also 'meaning-filled' and 'interesting'. Atwell, 63, began teaching in 1973 . She said: 'I get to demonstrate what is possible, teach what is useful, establish conditions that invite engagement, support the hard work of literary reading and writing, and enjoy the kinds of relationships with adolescents that drew me to education in the first place. 'Because my students select the books they read and the subjects they write about, I'm able to help them discover what reading and writing are good for, here and now and in their literate lives to come. 'There is nothing more important than putting the right book in a child's hands at the right time.' Atwell founded the Center for Teaching and Learning in 1990, which uses experimental teaching methods on students in kindergarten through eighth grade. She built an 'excellent classroom library',  in hopes of letting her own students discover what they wanted to read on their own. 'I worry that educational bureaucrats have a problem with pleasure,' she told USA Today, 'that if kids are enjoying what they're doing, it can't be rigorous or worthwhile.' The other American finalists Naomi Volain and and Stephen Ritz. Volain said when she heard about the $1million prize, she told herself, 'Forget it. There are all of these teachers who are presenting internationally and doing big, big things'. But her own colleagues were inspired by Volain and her desire to have her students take part in lab work and go outside. She has spread her environmental education knowledge into as many classrooms as she can. 'I love teaching, and teaching science, because it allows me to learn and work along with my students,' she said. Stephen Ritz, 52, is an elementary school teacher in New York City's South Bronx area. He created a low-cost and portable gardening and nutrition program which led him and his students to install more than 100 gardens throughout New York to help families that have limited access to fresh produce . 'It's the shared experience that is so meaningful to me. Science is curiosity based - finding out why - with eyes, hands and mind. Science is collaborative, science communicates, and science is just so cool.' Ritz, who calls himself the 'Chief Eternal Optimist' of Bronx County, was originally a high school special education teacher but moved into urban gardening after the September 11 attacks. He and his students planted 15,000 daffodil bulbs across the city and now his gardening program grows 37 different vegetables, fruits and herbs. With a goal of sending students home with 100 bags of produce every week, he has established a food production business that focuses on maintaining 'food security' for families in neighborhoods that have limited access for fresh produce. He is currently converting a library at Public School 55 into a 2,000-square-food greenhouse and library. 'I love teaching because every day I get to do something great. Every day I get to lead children and colleagues on a new quest, we get to do something new, we practice, we dream, we learn and we work together,' he said about his program. 'I'm also the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet; inherently, I too am very curious and easily excited - it's a perfect storm,' he added. The top ten finalists were chosen from 50 shortlisted candidates that came from a pool of more than 5,000 nominations from 127 countries including the United States, UK, Italy, Kenya, Uganda, India, Afghanistan, Australia, Argentina, Mexico and Jordan. The remaining finalists come from the United States, UK, India, Haiti, Kenya, Cambodia, Afghanistan and Indonesia. The United States is the only country to have more than one finalist in the top ten. Sunny Varkey, Founder of the Varkey Foundation and the Global Teacher Prize, said: . 'I want to congratulate Nancie Atwell for being the very first recipient of the Global Teacher Prize. Your incredible story will shine a light on the tireless work that teachers do all over the world. 'We all need to find ways of collectively celebrating teachers, of saying to a celebrity-obsessed world that teachers are important and worthy of respect. 'Right now we need teachers more than ever. We need great teachers to grow great minds or we will never tackle the problems facing the world, from global poverty to climate change. 'Of course, more will be needed than the Global Teacher Prize to raise the status of the profession worldwide. But my hope is that it starts many conversations around the world about the role of teachers - from families around the dinner table and teenagers on social media to education ministries around the world.'","Nancie Atwell received the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize .

"A foetus at 24 weeks. New advice from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists rules against so-called souvenir scans before 10 weeks . Souvenir scans of the unborn baby should not be carried out in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, say doctors. Such keepsake images are shown off by proud parents-to-be, who can buy special wallets and photo frames to mark every stage of pregnancy. But new advice from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists rules against the growing trend when there is no medical reason for doing an early-stage scan. A new scientific review says ultrasound – which uses high-frequency sound waves to provide images of the foetus – could expose it to unknown risks. Although there is no evidence of harm, the ‘precautionary principle’ should apply, it says. Dr Christoph Lees, Reader in Obstetrics and Fetal Medicine at Imperial College London and lead author of the paper said the review looked specifically at the first 10 weeks in the womb. Normally a scan would be ordered only for a potential problem identified by a clinician and in those circumstances it was perfectly safe, he said. But an increasing number of clinics were offering keepsake images from as early as six weeks, he said. He said: ‘Ultrasound scanning in the embryonic period is an invaluable resource in several important scenarios where the embryo is at possible risk. ‘There are presently no grounds for questioning the safety of diagnostic ultrasound in this context. ‘However, ultrasound imaging is increasingly being used without obvious medical justification and we have to be aware of the possibility of subtle long-term adverse effects, particularly in the first weeks of gestation when the embryo is potentially the most vulnerable.’ A pregnant woman looks towards a scan of her unborn baby. An increasing number of clinics are offering keepsake images from as early as six weeks . Dr Christoph Less of Imperial College is the lead author of the paper which advises against scans of foetuses during the first 10 weeks in the womb unless they are done for medical reasons . The review was produced by the Scientific Advisory Committee at the RCOG to provide doctors with up-to-date information about the issue. The US Food and Drug Administration issued similar advice in December, saying excess ultrasound at any stage in pregnancy should be avoided. Dr Lees said one of the possible harms might come from the slight heating effect produced by ultrasound which was more easily dissipated by the placenta after 10 weeks of pregnancy. He said the safest period for taking souvenir scans was 20 weeks of pregnancy and beyond. The review highlights the various types of ultrasound, including B-mode – the most commonly used form of ultrasound in obstetrics – colour and pulse wave Doppler. Colour and pulsed wave Doppler involve greater average intensity and power outputs than B-mode and are not recommended at all during the first 10 weeks. Additionally, there has been a move to perform 3D and 4D ultrasound scans earlier in pregnancy, states the paper. Colour and pulsed wave Doppler scans have such intensity and power output they are not recommended at all during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy . 4D ultrasound is ‘real time’ scanning and involves higher power outputs as the scanning time is longer, typically by several minutes, and should not be the sole purpose of souvenir images or video recordings in early pregnancy. Dr Sadaf Ghaem-Maghami, chair of the RCOG’s Scientific Advisory Committee, said ‘B-mode ultrasound used for clinical reasons from conception to 10 weeks of gestation is safe and the benefits outweigh any theoretical risks. ‘We are adopting a precautionary approach and are highlighting the small but possible risks to women so that they can make informed choices. ‘We also emphasise that any healthcare professional involved in the use of ultrasound is aware of the safety principles of ultrasound.’","Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists rules against trend .

"For desperate Chinese families whose children suffer from debilitating brain conditions such as cerebral palsy, there is only one place to go. Those who have little or no money to pay for treatment flock to a ramshackle village in Changsha, one of China's fastest-growing cities, which has sprung up in the shadow of a specialist hospital. The community has become known as the 'brain paralysis village', as families from around the country set up home there in the hope of receiving crucial treatment than can improve the quality of life for their children, according to a report on People's Daily. Father and daughters: Village resident Zhu Dongwen (middle) and his twin daughters, who were born in 2011 . Hundreds have moved there - spending upwards of ¥100 (£10.6) per month on rent - because the treatment at the nearby Xiangya Bo'ai Rehabilitation Hospital is completely free, as it is funded by a government scheme. Roughly 10 kilometres from the Changsha Railway Station, the village has formed spontaneously, as desperate families arrive to seek medical advice from the largest rehabilitation hospital in central China. The free service is only open to parents who have run out of money and no longer have any other way of getting help for children who suffer from serious brain problems. Zhu Dongwen, 43, is one of the many parents living in this village. Both of his twin daughters, born in 2011, suffer from brain paralysis. 'I never found out what that really meant, or why it happened, although I spent all my savings looking for an answer and looking for a cure,' said Mr Zhu. 'In the end we were turned out on the street and in desperation in April last year I managed to get taken in here. I had almost run out of hope, but the community gave me back my hope.' Mr Zhu came to the village with ¥1,000 (£106) in his pocket in April 2013. Although the treatment is free-of-charge, the families still need money to live off. Now a full-time carer for daughters Zhu Sihui and Zhu Siying (not their real names) without any stable income, Mr Zhu is spending around ¥3,000 (£318) to support the family's life in the village. He took out a loan of more than ¥250,000 (£26,422) from various sources, which was spent on seeking care for his daughters, according to another report onChina Daily. Road to recovery: Both of Mr Zhu's daughters are recovering slowly. In the picture, Mr Zhu is dressing his  Zhu Siying while Zhu Sihui is warming up her hands near the fire . Inside hospital: Mother Wang Qun is helping her daughter Xiang Liping with rehabilitation . Under the intense treatment being carried out at the centre, the first of his daughters recovered enough control over her body to be able to walk. A month later his second daughter followed suit, and now they are able to interact with him and carry out many tasks that would have been impossible a year ago. Mr Zhu said: 'I am finally starting to believe that my girls will now be able to live relatively normal lives and even if something should happen to me they will be able to look after themselves one day. It is an impossible dream come true and all thanks to the chance I had to come here.' The project is unique to the area and it is not clear where the funding comes from, but children get rooms and care on-site. And with his daughters' care in hand, Zhu Dongwen is even able to do some work locally to start to save again and build a future for them all outside of the village once they are well enough to leave. He said: 'I have hope again and it is this place that has given us that hope.' Treatment in demand: A governmental report suggested that there are around 20,000 children with some form of 'brain paralysis' in Hunan Province in southern China . The village: Housing around 100 families, the neighbourhood is located close to a major hospital offering a scheme which gives free treatment to children with brain paralysis. According to People's Daily, the scheme plans to help 9,000 such children under seven years old in Hunan. All of the children are classified as critical when they arrive, and most of them are unable to do anything for themselves. A government report suggested there are around 20,000 children in Hunan Province who are diagnosed with some form of 'brain paralysis', but only a small portion of them can afford to be treated properly.","Village is in the city of Changsha and houses more than 100 families .

"The Black Student Union at UC Berkeley wants to honour convicted murderer Assata Shakur (above) by renaming a university building after her . A student group has demanded that a university building is renamed after a convicted murderer. The Black Student Union at UC Berkeley wants to honour Assata Shakur, the first woman on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists, with the name change. Shakur was found guilty of shooting New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1977. The 67-year-old former Black Panther activist escaped from prison two years later and is thought to be hiding in Cuba. The union believes she represents an 'icon of resistance within oppressed communities', Fox News reported. Cori McGowens, a junior at the university, said: 'We want the renaming of it to [go to] someone, Assata Shakur, who we feel represents us as black students.' The students have also asked the university to hire two black admissions officers, two black psychologists and two black advisers. They are  hoping an African-American resource center will be created. Their request for a building, thought to be Barrows Hall, to be renamed has split reactions on social media. One user @Ilianerrz wrote on Twitter: 'WHY DO STUDENTS AT UC BERKLEY (sic) WANT TO NAME A BUILDING AFTER ASSATA SHAKUR?!??' And Janine Simone said: 'What is this world coming to? #police #PoliceLivesMatter.' But some people supported the idea.

"The FBI is investigating after several websites in the US were hacked by someone claiming to be from ISIS. Websites including a racecar speedway in the state of Ohio, a cocktail bar in Massachusetts, a Goodwill center in Missouri and a church in Canada were defaced with the radical group's black flag. Attacks against similar low-profile websites were also recorded in Montana, New York, Massachusetts and Minnesota, NBC reported. Hacked: The ISIS imagery started appearing on various websites including the Southwest Montana credit union . The hacking has spread to Europe with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in Ireland the latest site to have its homepage topped by a picture of the black ISIS flag and the words 'hacked by ISIS, we are everywhere.'

Evan Kohlmann of Flashpoint Intelligence, told NBC: 'There are no indications that the individuals behind these latest hacks have any real connection to ISIS, and these defacements have taken place amid a spate of recent attacks where ordinary hackers have cynically used far-fetched references to ISIS as a means of attracting media attention.' Southwest Montana Community Federal Credit Union's site has remained down, with the message 'Under Construction.' Chief executive, Tom Dedman, said the site was offline so a security specialist could investigate. The hacks over the weekend appeared on websites with little or no link to one another, fueling speculation the terrorist organisation was not responsible. Silver Bow County Sheriff Ed Lester told station KTVM of Butte that no account information was compromised. He said: 'I don't think ISIS agents would be interested in a hack like this,' Lester said.

"A former Fortune 500 executive is facing a wrongful death lawsuit for fatally crashing into a pregnant woman, her fiance and their fetus in what New Hampshire authorities called a failed suicide attempt. The estate of 24-year-old Amanda Murphy sued Robert Dellinger February 20, the day after he pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the deaths of Murphy and Jason Timmons, 29, of Wilder, Vermont. Dellinger also pleaded guilty to assault for the death of their unborn baby. Murphy was eight months pregnant at the time of the crash. Sued: Former Fortune 500 executive Robert Dellinger, 54, was hit with a wrongful death lawsuit last month, a day after he pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the deaths of a young couple . Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 . The lawsuit, which lists five counts, seeks damages for Dellinger's 'wanton, reckless and grossly negligent' conduct, according to The Valley News. Investigators say Dellinger was trying to kill himself when he drove through the median of Interstate 89 in December 2013. The lawsuit was filed by Murphy's mother, Tammy Langlois, who oversees her daughter's estate. Timmons mother, Deborah Blanchard, is also expected to sue Dellinger. Dellinger has not been served with the suit yet. Dellinger's lawyer said he was not attempting to end his life, but rather suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of medications. Dellinger, 54, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was initially charged with manslaughter, but that was later upgraded to second-degree murder. 'I’m extremely remorseful to the families, and to my own family, as well. I wish I could have that day over,' Dellinger said in court. Negligent homicide is a lesser charge. Dellinger will be sentenced in April. He could face 12 to 24 years in prison. Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median . Dellinger's attorneys claimed that the former high-powered executive was suffering from Ambien withdrawal, the effects of a psychiatric drug overdose and Prozac, and the advanced symptoms of multiple sclerosis . Dellinger, who held high-level posts at PPG Industries Inc., Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co., told investigators he was trying to kill himself on December 7, 2013, when he steered his pickup across a highway median in Lebanon, New Hampshire. His truck became airborne and sheared the top off of the victims' SUV, causing injuries so severe that the medical examiner said the couple looked like they had been in a plane crash. The Vermont couple, who had met while working at a home for the elderly, were killed instantly. Dellinger, who suffered cuts on his head and face, was initially charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter. Miss Murphy, 24, was excited to be a mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their unborn baby girl Reagan Elizabeth. A week before the crash, the residential center where the couple worked together hosted a baby shower for them. Catherine Amarante, executive director at the facility, described the couple as 'very loving'. Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, 2013, a few days after the crash . Excited: Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons, pictured with one of his three children from a previous relationship, were looking forward to the arrival of their baby girl . Mr Timmons, 29, was also a father to three children from a previous relationship. According to prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his . medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, . however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a . 'productive and exemplary life.' The married father had served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Fortune 500 company PPG Industries Inc. He . took a severance package worth more than $1million in cash plus stocks . when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents . filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

"Joel Tuck is devastated after two men who were arrested for burglarizing his home allegedly threw away the ashes of his daughter Whitney . A father has been left devastated after it was revealed two men who were arrested for burglarizing his home allegedly threw away the ashes of his daughter, who died 10 years ago. Joel Tuck arrived at his Franklin, Tennessee home on Monday to find that his back door was wide open and it's glass window had been broken. Two flat-screen TVs, several checkbooks and a bottle of liquor were stolen. But it was when Tuck realized a pink purse was missing that his heart dropped. The pink purse belonged to his daughter Whitney, who died in 2005 at the age of 19 after losing her battle with leukemia. Her ashes were kept in a box inside the purse, which had been her favorite. Franklin police arrested Jwyanza Weaver and Christopher Gengler in connection to the burglary. They are currently in custody. Both men are convicted felons and Weaver was on probation at the time of his arrest, according to the Tennessean. According to police, the two men drove to a gas station after burglarizing the home.

"Horses played a crucial role ferrying supplies to Australian troops during World War One and carrier pigeons kept commanders in touch with soldiers fighting on the front lines. But did you know domestic cats and dogs, kangaroos and even glow worms were enlisted by Australian troops in their efforts to win the war? New research has uncovered the extent to which a range of animals helped our troops in amazing historical photographs. Of the 130,000 horses sent to battle in WWI only one horse, named Sandy, made it back to Australian shores . Ben Mercer, Content Director at genealogy organisation Ancestry.com, said a renewed interest Australia's war-time history prompted him to start researching the role of animals in the Great War, which led him to the discovery of a rich photographic history. Mr Mercer said horses played a vital role in WWI with around 130,000 sent overseas to support Australia’s war effort. Originally intended to play a cavalry role, it was soon realised the horses were not suited to the terrain and the men would have a better chance fighting on foot. ‘The horses went from being cavalry-based to assisting with transport and communication. They became very important to moving supplies and men from behind the lines to the battlefield.’ Horses usually drink about 30 litres of water a day but when resources were stretched at the height of the the animals often went 60 hours without life-sustaining fluids while carrying over 130 kilograms each of equipment, food, water and supplies. At war's end, just one horse, named Sandy, made it back to Australian shores. The rest were put down or handed off to British units and used in Palestine. Horses usually drink about 30 litres of water a day but in the height of the war when resources were stretched, horses often went 60 hours without water carrying over 130 kilograms of equipment, food, water and supplies. Camels were also the perfect candidate for long haul trips where it was required to pull heavy loads across long distances with very little food and water . With a lack of water in the field camels were prime candidates for long haul trips where it was required to pull wounded men and heavy loads across long distances as they are genetically equipped to survive on little food and water. Man’s best friend also found his way on to the battlefield, not only as a war-time companion, but to to carry important messages and sniff out explosives or injured soldiers. Their superior strength, agility, territorial nature and trainability made them the perfect candidate for their jobs on the field. Dogs strength, agility, territorial nature and trainability gave them the edge on the battle field . ‘Very often the phone lines on the Western front would be destroyed in artillery barrages. Men who acted as runners would be shot so dogs were used when all else failed to carry those really important messages.’ Dogs became such an important part of life on the battle field that soldiers made specialised gas masks to ensure the pooches weren’t affected by deadly gas released on the field. Another species also played a vital role in battlefield communications, and was the first animal to be awarded a medal of honour: the humble pigeon. Carrier pigeons were the first animal awarded a medal for their contribution to the war . Carrier pigeons were used by troops to send important logistical information to their commanders when phone lines were damaged or it was difficult to send a runner. They were silent, quick and weren’t affected by the gas that hung over combat zones at ground level. ‘Men would go forward during battle carrying cages of pigeons so they could talk to their commanders if all else failed,’ Mr Mercer told Daily Mail Australia. Carrier pigeons were used by troops to send ‘important logistical information’ back to their commanders when the phone lines were damaged or it was difficult to send a runner. Carrier pigeons were the first to be awarded the animal equivalent of a Victoria Cross - the Dickin Medal. It was presented after an animal displayed gallant devotion to serving the men and women on the field. Mr Mercer said this only testifies to the importance of the messages the pigeons carried. The medal was presented to 32 pigeons, 29 dogs, three horses and one cat. Kangaroos were taken to hospitals to become companions for injured soldiers and played an important role in reminding soliers of home . One of Australia’s most iconic animals also made it across the globe to support our injured soldiers. Kangaroos were taken to hospitals deep in the war zone to raise the morale of wounded soldiers. ‘They would take care of them, pat them and feel better about the difficult time they were facing. ‘I think it also reminded the men of Australia, of home,’ he added. Donkeys stamina in the heat and cold made them the perfect candidate to carry soldiers and equipment . The story of Simpson and his donkey became a part of the ANZAC legend but there were many other donkeys and mules who’s stamina in the cold and heat contributed to their ability to perform while transporting soldiers and equipment throughout WWI. ‘They were also used to tow field ambulances and were very important in battles like Gallipoli where it was difficult to move men and supplies from the front line.’ ‘In the trenches of the Western Front there were serious problems with rats. As you could imagine wherever you have food, and unfortunately decaying bodies, there were rats and it was the cat’s job to keep them at bay’ Mr Mercer said, like in any farming household, cats were also kept on boats and in trenches to take care of rodent problems. Glow worms provided the soldiers with light, even in the darkest hour . ‘In the trenches of the Western Front there were serious problems with rats. As you could imagine wherever you have food, and unfortunately decaying bodies, there were rats and it was the cat’s job to keep them at bay.’ Mr Mercer said Australians were known for their innovation in the trenches. Even in the darkest of hours they found an interesting way to use glow worms that would bring light to the battlefield. ‘They adapted very quickly to very difficult situations and when they were in action, being asked to perform roles in the dark, they used glow worms to give themselves a bit of light where they needed it.’ After collecting the worms, soldiers would place them into jars so they were able to examine maps or intelligence reports, even read letters from home. Cramming ten glow worms into a jar could reportedly provide as much light as a modern day roadway light and didn’t require the same kind of back up or fuel that other lights did. Mr Mercer said he's seen a strong interest from Australians who want to get a better idea of who they are and how their family history fits into the 'Australian story'.

"Carissa Yip from Andover, Massachusetts earned the title last month and became the youngest to ever to defeat a grandmaster, Alexander Ivanov, during the New England Open in 2014 . An 11-year-old girl has become the youngest U.S. female to reach master level in chess. Carissa Yip from Andover, Massachusetts earned the title last month and also became the youngest to ever to defeat a grandmaster, Alexander Ivanov, during the New England Open in 2014. The sixth-grade student at Doherty Middle School picked up her first piece of chess five years ago, and since has been raking in accolades including becoming the youngest female expert in 2013. And in February, she was ranked the 50th best female chess player in the country by the U.S. Chess Federation (USCF), 36th among U.S. born players, according to the Valley Dispatch. 'I'm really happy about breaking the record,' said Carissa. Previously, Annie Wang held the title as the youngest female master, who broke Irina Krush's decade-long record in 2014, but Carissa has secured the top spot by four months, according to Andover Patch. The young girl first learned chess after her father, Percy, an IT architect taught her until she began beating him within a year. And it was only two years ago when Carissa had set a goal of reaching a rating of 2,100 - an expert is anyone over 2,000 and a master is anyone over 2,200. However, now she is aiming to reach 2,300 later this year. In the tournament that gave her the title as master during the February 21 Legends of Chess Tournament in Cambridge where she (Carissa pictured right) played against chess master, Chris Williams (left). While she was debating whether to even compete against Williams, in the end she listened to the advice from her father who said 'listen to your heart' Carissa said she loves chess because it is a challenging game, according to the Boston Globe. 'I prefer to play with someone who's actually good,' she said. But sometimes when she defeats opponents older than her, they do not always take the loss in stride. Carissa said during one of her first tournaments, she beat a competitor at seven years old, who threw a tamper and said he did not like playing against kids. As she strives towards her ultimate goal of becoming a world champion chess player, last month, she finished with a national rating of 2,203 which placed her with the best 1.5 per cent of all players in the USCF. Magnus Carlsen, 24, of Norway has a rating of 2,863 and is the highest-ranked chess player in the world, according to the World Chess Federation. In order to secure the title as grandmaster, she would have to have a rating of 2,500 on the international scale as well as having top results, which with her history is certainly attainable. In February, she was ranked the 50th best female chess player in the country by the U.S. Chess Federation (USCF), 36th among U.S. born players (above Carissa with her Official Citation by the State Senate in recognition of her commitment to chess in 2013) Her success in tournaments are due to the fact that she keeps her focus two to ten moves ahead of her opponent, as well as her ability to improvise - she can quickly adapt, finding a way to win.

The sixth-grade student at Doherty Middle School picked up her first piece of chess five years ago, and since has been raking in accolades including becoming the youngest female expert in 2013 . She said: 'After two wins, I was very tired, and planned to withdraw after two games as I normally do. However, I wasn’t sure this time. I knew that I would become a master if I could win this game. I would get more than 40 rating points. 'But I never beat Chris  before. He is a very strong master. I talked to my dad, and my dad told me not to think too much about ratings. He told me to listen to my heart.' This month, the USCF announced that Carissa was a record-breaker along with a chess master. While she loves chess, Carissa has plans to also become a professional golfer and a policewoman.

Charlotte Mensah, current British Hairdressing Awards, Afro Hairdresser of the Year and owner of award-winning salon Hair Lounge (charlottemensah.com) shared her top tips for not over-processing Afro hair with FEMAIL. She said: 'If you’re experiencing hair damage and loss, the only option to minimise this is to begin a strict weekly regime of deep conditioning treatments.' She also recommends following a balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables that provide the body with the natural and necessary vitamins and minerals that are the basis for healthy skin and hair. 'You need to balance the topical products you are using with a healthy lifestyle including the right foods, 6-8 glasses of water a day and enough sleep to help from the inside out as well,' she said. Avoiding products heavy in mineral oils, which block pores, is essential, as is gentle combing and regular trims.

Jourdan, who is currently the face of Burberry, has picked up some quirky beauty tips during her time in the industry. Her favourites? 'Hold a credit card behind your lashes when you apply your mascara. If you press against the card you get a wide-eyed, curled effect without getting lots of product on your eyelid,' she advised. She also swears by using lip balm as an eyeshadow to give a 'glossy' finish (her favourite is Maybelline Baby Lips Lip Balm), and she often uses the pink tinted ones as blusher. When it comes to beauty, 24-year-old Jourdan, an accomplished cook who runs her own cookery YouTube channel, believes it's all about what you put in. 'I like to eat healthy,' she said. 'I love good greens and fish and I'm not really a snacker. 'Luckily the backstage catering at fashion week has improved.

Charlotte Mensah, current British Hairdressing Awards, Afro Hairdresser of the Year and owner of award-winning salon Hair Lounge (charlottemensah.com) gives her top tips for not over-processing Afro hair: . Weekly Conditioning . If you’re experiencing hair damage and loss, the only option to minimise this is to begin a strict weekly regime of deep conditioning treatments such as the MIZANI Fiberfyl in-salon Strengthening Treatment, which contains filloxane technology to instantly penetrate the hair fibre, filling into weak areas, giving stronger, fuller results. Supplement Haircare with Diet . I’d also recommend following a balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables that provide the body with the natural and necessary vitamins and minerals that are the basis for healthy skin and hair. You need to balance the topical products you are using with a healthy lifestyle including the right foods, 6-8 glasses of water a day and enough sleep to help from the inside out as well. Use Natural Oils . Avoid products that are heavy in mineral oil as this can block the pores. There are natural oils that do the same job and yield great results. You can massage natural oils into the hairline where breakage is happening to stimulate the blood circulation in these areas and promote regrowth. Let Hair Breathe . While it’s understandable why women may want to wear a wig to cover up hair loss or breakage, I’d highly recommend taking it off when indoors and overnight to allow the scalp to breathe. Colouring Afro Hair . Colouring any hair type can be damaging to condition, however ammonia-free formulas like L’Oréal Professionnel INOA are much gentler on the hair. These formulas also tend to amplify shine, which gives the appearance of healthier hair. Gentle Combing . When your hair is weaker or suffering from breakage, make sure you choose combs that have wide teeth and no seams, which can snag the hair. Kent Handmade Combs, which are made from a single sheet of cellulose acetate, a non-petroleum based plastic derived from plants that has been found to create less static in the hair. They are then hand polished and buffed to create soft, rounded teeth that will not damaged the hair or scalp. Due to the way the teeth are cut rather than moulded, they are much less likely to snag causing split ends, but instead stimulate the natural oils inside the hair cuticle encouraging each strand to lie flat, creating healthy, strong and shiny hair. Regular Trims . Ensure you are coupling your deep condition treatments with regular trims every 6-8 weeks to encourage healthy hair. While hair loss often happens around the hairline, a lot of damage occurs through the mid-lengths and ends, so ensuring they are in the best condition will give the illusion of an all-over healthier, fuller head of hair.","Jourdan, 24, wears wigs to give her natural locks a break .

"Nasa had chosen the ambitious mission that will visit a comet and pluck a boulder from its surface to create an orbiting base for astronauts.

The so-called Asteroid Redirect Mission is estimated to cost . about $1.25 billion not including launch costs and is targeted . for liftoff in December 2020. It would be followed five years . later by a human expedition to the space rock, a modification of . a plan proposed by President Barack Obama in 2010. Scroll down for video . Nasa plans to pick up a boulder from a large asteroid (shown) using a robotic ship . It will then be taken to lunar orbit, where it would be studied by astronauts . Nasa also considered bagging a smaller asteroid and . relocating the entire body into a high orbit around the moon. After extensive studies, Nasa opted to collect and move a . boulder, a mission that will cost about $100 million more, but . which better prepares the agency for the ultimate goal of . landing astronauts on Mars. 'They're the kind of things that we know we're going to need . when we go to another planetary body,' NASA Associate . Administrator Robert Lightfoot told reporters on a conference . call. NASA plans to study the asteroid for about a year and test . deflection techniques that one day may be necessary to save . Earth from a potentially catastrophic collision. An asteroid or . comet smashed into the planet about 65 million years ago, . leading to climate changes that killed off dinosaurs and most . other life on Earth then. So far, NASA has three candidate asteroids, but does not . expect to make a decision about where to fly before 2019. The mission involves flying a robotic spacecraft, powered by . solar electric propulsion, to an asteroid for an extensive . survey. Once a target boulder was selected, the probe would . hover down toward the surface and deploy a pair of robot arms to . grab hold of a 6.5- to 13-foot (2- to 4 meter) wide boulder. The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean - likely the Pacific - 10 days later. The mission is seen as an important step towards eventually sending humans to Mars and returning them safely. 'I'm going to have multiple targets ... We can assess which . one we want to go after and I then have three- to five tries to . get it, or I can move on to a different one,' Lightfoot said. The captured boulder, which would remain attached to the . probe, would then be nudged into an orbit circling high around . the moon, a maneuver expected to take about six years. The probe would include a docking ring so a NASA Orion . spaceship, carrying two astronauts, could reach the asteroid, a . mission targeted for around 2025. Nasa's ultimate goal is to send humans to Mars, and they say the Asteroid Redirect Mission (Arm) will be an important stepping stone towards getting there. A number of new spaceflight capabilities will be tested in the 2020s as part of the mission, which will involve redirecting an asteroid to orbit the moon and sending humans to explore it. Astronauts aboard Nasa's Orion spacecraft, launched from the upcoming Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, will then explore the asteroid in the mid-2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon . Nasa plans to launch an Arm robotic spacecraft to rendezvous with, capture and redirect an asteroid by the end of this decade. The spacecraft will redirect it to a stable orbit around the moon called a 'Distant Retrograde Orbit' - one that orbits the moon very widely, coming quite close before extending out much further away. Astronauts aboard Nasa's Orion spacecraft, launched from the upcoming Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, will then explore the asteroid in the mid-2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon. Within the papers, authors explain the current work taking place across the country to examine options for these robotic and crewed missions. This includes advanced Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) - one of the critical technologies needed to send larger payloads into deep space and to the Mars system. SEP - or ion propulsion - creates thrust powered by solar arrays, which transforms sunlight into electromagnetic fields that accelerate and expel charged atoms (ions). This is a very efficient way to power a spacecraft and significantly cuts down on the amount of fuel a spacecraft needs to carry, which can be heavy and expensive to launch from Earth. An asteroid named Itokawa photographed by the Hayabusa probe. The agency plans to announce the specific asteroid selected for the mission no earlier than 2019, approximately a year before launching the robotic spacecraft. Before an asteroid is considered a valid candidate for the mission, scientists must first determine its characteristics, in addition to size, such as rotation, shape and precise orbit. NASA has identified three valid candidates for the mission so far: Itokawa, Bennu and 2008 EV5. The agency expects to identify one or two additional candidates each year leading up to the mission. Returning asteroid samples will help Nasa develop  tools and techniques for future space exploration. This early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space. Rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air, drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel. There also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future. With this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which Arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids - namely collecting resources for use back on Earth or in space. Current studies at Nasa detailed in the papers are examining ways SEP will be used to power the Arm robotic mission. Nasa was also working on a mission concept that would fully enclose a large asteroid using an inflatable system and the other would capture a smaller boulder from of a much larger asteroid using robotic arms. The Arm crewed mission, in which astronauts will explore the redirected asteroid around the moon, provides unique opportunities to test human spaceflight capabilities as well. The papers detail current work underway at Nasa to upgrade spacesuits in preparation for the first spacewalks in deep space since the 1960s and farther from Earth than ever before. Concepts for new hardware to dock the crewed and uncrewed spacecraft together are also in development. This will allow the crew aboard Orion to attach to the Arm robotic spacecraft and study the asteroid. This could be later used to connect Orion with a deep space habitat or 'stepping stone' on its way to Mars, or even station cargo and fuel depots in strategic places such as lunar orbit. Astronauts returning home with samples from Mars will hold a treasure trove of research scientists will study to unlock new knowledge about Mars and the solar system's history. Various techniques for deflecting a potentially hazardous asteroid could be tested on Arm to enable planetary defense capabilities. These techniques include Ion Beam Deflection, Enhanced Gravity Tractor, and kinetic impactors. In Ion Beam Deflection, the plumes from the thrusters would be directed towards the asteroid to gently push on its surface over a wide area. A thruster firing in the opposite direction would be needed to keep the spacecraft at a constant distance from the asteroid. The Ion Beam Deflection approach is independent of the size of the asteroid, and it could be demonstrated on either mission option. In the Enhanced Gravity Tractor approach, the spacecraft would first pick up a boulder from the asteroid's surface as in mission Option B. The spacecraft with the collected boulder would then orbit in a circular halo around the asteroid's velocity vector. The mass of the boulder coupled with the mass of the spacecraft would increase the gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and the asteroid. By flying the spacecraft in close formation with the asteroid for several months the very small gravitational forces would produce a measurable change in the asteroid's trajectory. A kinetic impactor could also be launched as a secondary payload with the spacecraft or on a separate launch vehicle, and it would collide with the target asteroid at high velocity while the spacecraft observed the impact. As well as this, returning asteroid samples will help Nasa develop  tools and techniques for future space exploration. This early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space. Rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air, drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel. There also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future. With this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which Arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids - namely collecting resources for use back on Earth or in space.","Nasa robot ship will pluck a large boulder off an asteroid .

"Malaysia's transport minister on Thursday vowed to take stern action against an air traffic control supervisor if it is confirmed that he was asleep on the job when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared a year ago. An interim investigation report last Sunday contained transcripts of conversations between air traffic controllers in the region and the airline that revealed confusion in the hours after the Boeing 777 dropped off radar with 239 people aboard while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. In one conversation four hours after the plane disappeared, a Kuala Lumpur air traffic controller told a Malaysia Airlines official that he would need to wake up his supervisor when pressed on the exact time of the last contact with the plane. The controller came on duty after the plane vanished. Malaysia's transport minister on Thursday vowed to take stern action against an air traffic control supervisor if it is confirmed that he was asleep on the job when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared a year ago . Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said his department viewed the matter seriously and was conducting an internal probe. 'The work is on rotation. ... If he is on a working shift, this is serious. We will definitely take action if there is any misconduct,' he told reporters. Liow said the ministry didn't investigate the matter earlier as they were waiting for Sunday's report by the independent safety investigation team. The ministry's probe will be 'very fast,' he added, without saying when it would be completed. An interim investigation report  contained transcripts of conversations between air traffic controllers in the region and the airline that revealed confusion in the hours after the Boeing 777 dropped off radar. Pictured is the plane that's disappeared flying over Poland in February 2015 . Despite an exhaustive search in the southern Indian Ocean where the plane was believed to have crashed based on analyses of transmissions between the aircraft and a satellite, no trace of wreckage has been found. In late January, Malaysia's government formally declared the plane's disappearance an accident and said all those on board were presumed dead. The report Sunday also showed that the battery of the underwater locator beacon for the plane's data recorder had expired more than a year before the jet vanished March 8, 2014, because of a computer data error and went unnoticed by maintenance crews. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the hunt for the plane would continue even if searchers scouring a 60,000-square-kilometer (23,166-square-mile) swath of the seabed off Australia's west coast do not find it by May. Liow said a tripartite meeting involving ministers from Australia, Malaysia and China — where most of the passengers are from — would take place in Kuala Lumpur next month to discuss the next step.

"A ruthless commander fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq has been ridiculed by activists online after a photograph emerged of him wearing camouflage that made him look like a doner kebab. The photograph shows notorious ISIS commander Abu Wahib standing next to a black van somewhere in Iraq's Anbar province while wearing distinctive brown military fatigues. The rotund 28-year-old general's stance and unusually-coloured outfit was immediately compared to a doner kebab by members of Raqqa is Being Slaughtered, the anti-ISIS activist group based in the terrorist organisation's de facto capital.

Notorious: Abu Wahib is one of the Islamic State terror group's most recognisable commanders thanks to his thick black beard and single eyebrow . Taking to Twitter to mock the Islamic State commander, RIBSS' Abu Mohammed shared the photograph of Abu Wahib alongside an image of a large doner kebab cooking on a rotating spit. He captioned the photograph '#same', much to the amusement of the followers of his anti-ISIS activist organisation. It is far from the first time Abu Wahib has been mocked on social media. Since rising to prominence for the sickening filmed murder of three Syrian lorry drivers in Iraq's Anbar province in the summer of 2013, the militant became one of the terror group's most recognisable commanders thanks to his thick black beard and single eyebrow. Anti-ISIS satirists have subsequently edited images of the hirsute Sunni extremist to make it look as if he is the star of shampoo commercials or appearing on a dating website. Leader: Despite only being 28-years-old, Abu Wahib (centre) is the long term commander of a militia known as the Al-Anbar Lions (pictured), who control vast swathes of territory in central Iraq on behalf of ISIS .

Abu Wahib was held by US forces at the Camp Bucca detention facility in southern Iraq until 2009, when he was sentenced to death and moved to Tikrit Central Prison in Saladin Province. A prison riot led by members of Al Qaeda in Iraq - the forerunner or ISIS - led to Abu Wahib and 109 other Sunni extremists escaping and seeking sanctuary among the terror group's leadership. The following year Abu Wahib was filmed leading a group of militants as they pulled over three Syrian lorries travelling through Iraqi desert. He was filmed accusing them of being Shia Muslims before brutally executing them at the side of the road.","Notorious militant Abu Wahib was ridiculed for his choice of camouflage .

"Interest rates are unlikely to rise until the middle of next year as the Bank of England tries to stave off a deflationary spiral, economists said last night. Official figures revealed the inflation rate fell to 0 per cent last month – the lowest level since 1960. Experts warned Britain is now just one month away from deflation as food and petrol prices continue to tumble. The dramatic fall in the cost of goods is likely to push back the timing of an interest rates hike by the Bank of England. Delaying a rates rise would mean continued rock-bottom interest rates for mortgage borrowers, but more misery for savers. The base rate has been held at a historic low 0.5 per cent for six years but the Bank of England has admitted that, far from raising rates, it could even cut them further to avoid prolonged deflation. Lower rates would encourage people to spend, rather than save, stimulating demand and pushing up prices. Ben Brettell, senior economist at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘It appears interest rates will be stuck at 0.5 per cent for some time yet – I don’t see them rising until mid-2016 at the very earliest. The Office for National Statistics found the Consumer Prices Index between February 2014 and February 2015 stood at 0 per cent . With wages rising by 1.6 per cent while prices are flat, it means families should see their money going further each month . ‘The Bank raises rates to curb inflation, but that is obviously not a problem at the moment, so they will keep them on hold.’ John Hawksworth, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the Bank was now ‘under no immediate pressure to raise interest rates’. Andrew Haldane, the Bank’s chief economist, suggested earlier this month that rates could be cut to zero because inflation had ‘dropped like a stone’. Low inflation, and even deflation, over a short period can be good for the economy and boost family finances, but a continuous fall in prices is harmful. By ALEX BRUMMER . THE GOOD NEWS . ... AND THE BAD NEWS . Bargain prices in shops could be used by employers as an excuse to keep wages low, while workers could delay big purchases in anticipation that costs will fall further – triggering a downward spiral. Yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron seemed unconcerned by predictions that prices would fall further, saying Britain did not ‘face the dangerous deflation that some other parts of Europe may potentially have a problem with’. He welcomed the lowest inflation rate in 55 years, saying it was ‘good news for family budgets’, while Chancellor George Osborne declared that ‘prices are frozen’. Estimates released by the Office for National Statistics show the last time inflation was below 0 per cent was March 1960 – when Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister and The Beatles had just formed in Liverpool. The last major bout of deflation came during the Great Depression from 1929 to 1932. It did not end until Britain abandoned the gold standard which the then Chancellor Winston Churchill embraced in 1925. Before that, in the late 19th century the prices of goods, property and shares fell sharply provoking a banking crisis similar in scale and danger to that of 2007 to 2009. In the early 18th century the value of the pound was fixed against gold and prices were flat and falling until the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. Inflation measures the rise and fall of 700 goods and services, from energy prices to clothing. But it is the plummeting cost of petrol, diesel and food that has dragged down the rate to zero. In the past year, there has been a huge fall in the cost of global wholesale oil, causing prices at the pump to tumble by almost 17 per cent. An aggressive supermarket price war has also dragged down the inflation rate, as major stores have been forced to compete with budget rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. The ONS reported that food prices had fallen by more than 3 per cent in February compared with a year earlier. Economist Vicky Redwood, at Capital Economics, said: ‘The UK is now within a whisker of deflation. ‘It looks odds-on that inflation will turn negative in March, when the recent cut in gas prices by British Gas show up in the inflation figures for the first time. We still think that deflation in the UK will be a “good” development, giving households’ incomes a welcome boost and supporting the economic recovery this year.’ Rob Wood, of Berenberg Bank, said there was ‘a good chance inflation could turn negative next month’. Economist Chris Williamson, at Markit, said: ‘Rather than being a concern, the drop in inflation is a boon to the economy, providing households with greater spending power at a time when pay growth remains frustratingly weak.’ Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as pay rises pull ahead of price increases, people had more money in their pockets, helping ‘millions of families’. But Shadow Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson said it was external factors that had brought down inflation, rather than the Government’s economic policy. She said: ‘A few months of falling world oil prices won’t solve the deep-seated problems in our economy.’ Since 2010, we've been working through our long-term economic plan to turn Britain around. It hasn't been easy – we inherited a country on the brink of bankruptcy – and I know many of you will have made huge personal sacrifices to support our plan to mend the broken economy and secure a brighter future for this great nation. But it's been worth it. That plan is working. Day by day, month by month, Britain's getting stronger: jobs are on the rise, the deficit's down, the economy's growing and wages are going further. And there's more good news for family budgets, with the inflation figures announced today at a record low of zero per cent. David Cameron told MailOnline the figures were 'more good news for family budgets' and proof the government's economic plan is working . At a time when the world economy is increasingly unstable, these latest figures are a reminder that we're on the right track – and that doing things differently would put it all at risk. It's a reminder that only the Conservatives have a plan to build a stronger economy, improve living standards and make families across Britain more financially secure. We want to help hardworking people keep more of the money they earn. It is individuals – not governments – who know best how to spend their money. That's why, in Government, we've cut income tax for 26 million by raising the personal allowance to over £10,000 – and we will go further in the next Parliament. That's why we've frozen fuel duty for the longest time in 20 years, saving a typical family £10 each time they fill up. That's why we've secured the biggest ever cash rise in the state pension, which will be £950 higher than it was in 2010. That's why we're introducing tax-free childcare – helping out parents with hefty childcare bills. That's why we provided funding to freeze council tax bills, putting more money in hardworking taxpayers' pockets. Don't just take me by my word. Judge me by my record in Government: we've delivered 2 million quality apprenticeships in the past five years, and will deliver 3 million more in the next five – giving young people the skills to go out and get a well-paid job. We're backing business, industry and enterprise – creating 1,000 jobs a day and driving down unemployment - now at its lowest level since 2008. We're getting Britain building again, helping young people to own their own home. We've already announced 200,000 cut-price homes for first-time buyers under 40. And we will now help first-time buyers save for a deposit. A strong economy is the backbone of a strong nation. And a strong nation is built on people who work hard and want to get on life. Mums and dads working round the clock to put food on the table and do the best they can for their children; grandparents who've saved hard all their lives to support their loved ones in times of need; sons and daughters who want to get on with their lives, get a job, get a home, and make something of themselves. A Conservative Government after May 8 will carry on working through our plan to secure a brighter future for you, your family and for Britain. Step by step, milestone after milestone. Last week it was a record increase in the minimum wage, today it's the rate of inflation. This Government has a long-term plan – and we're determined to make it work for you.","Consumer Prices Index falls to 0%, meaning prices did not rise in a year .

"Where there is muck there really is brass with scientists claiming that millions can be made by extracting gold from human waste. In fact as well as gold, faeces contains platinum, silver and other metals along with rare elements such as palladium and vanadium. Researchers now hope to 'mine' sewage reducing the need to mine raw metals from the ground, while reducing pollution by recycling human waste. Scientists have discovered a literal goldmine of precious metals in human poo.The US researchers are investigating ways of flushing out the valuable minerals, including gold, silver and rare elements such as palladium and vanadium. Pictured are microscopic gold-rich and lead-rich particles in human waste . Taking a lesson from industrial mining, the scientists are experimenting with chemicals called leachates that are used to pull metals out of rock. Some of these chemicals have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment. But in controlled conditions, they could safely be used to recover metals from treated solid waste, Dr Smith claims. In the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum, silver and gold observing microscopic-sized metal particles in biosolids. Previous research estimated the waste from one million Americans could contain as much as $12 million (£8.7 million) worth of metals. In 1999 the UK produced over 1,130,000 tonnes of sludge dry solids, which averages to about 20kg generated by each person. If Britain's waste was mined it could be worth $762 million (£510 million) a year. Dr Kathleen Smith of the US Geological Survey said: 'If you can get rid of some of the nuisance metals that currently limit how much of these biosolids we can use on fields and forests, and at the same time recover valuable metals and other elements, that's a win-win. 'There are metals everywhere. They are in your hair care products, detergents, even nanoparticles that are put in socks to prevent bad odours.' Yet all end up at the sewage works and many metals end up in the leftover solid waste. At treatment plants, wastewater goes through a series of physical, biological and chemical processes and the end products are treated water and biosolids. In the US alone seven million tons are leftover each year with half used as fertiliser on fields and in forests and the other half incinerated or sent to landfills. Dr Smith added: 'We have a two-pronged approach. 'In one part of the study, we are looking at removing some regulated metals from the biosolids that limit their use for land application. If Britain's waste was mined it could be worth $762 million (£510 million) a year. Previous research estimated the waste from one million Americans could contain as much as $12 million (£8.7 million) worth of metals. 'In the other part of the project, we're interested in collecting valuable metals that could be sold, including some of the more technologically important metals, such as vanadium and copper that are in cell phones, computers and alloys.' The study aims to use the same chemicals, called leachates, which the mining industry uses to pull metals out of rock. While some of these leachates have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment, in a controlled setting, they could safely be used to recover metals in treated solid waste. In the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum, silver and gold observing microscopic-sized metal particles in biosolids using a scanning electron microscope. 'The gold we found was at the level of a minimal mineral deposit' meaning if that amount were in rock, it might be commercially viable to mine it. Dr Smith added that 'the economic and technical feasibility of metal recovery from biosolids needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.' The study presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) involved collecting samples from small towns in the Rocky Mountains, rural communities and big cities. For a more comprehensive picture, they plan to combine their information with many years' worth of existing data collected by the Environmental Protection Agency and other groups at the Geological Survey.","Scientists looking for ways to flush out the valuable minerals from waste .

"An aspiring transgender hip-hop artist who bragged of carrying out black-market 'body sculpting' on thousands of women has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed a British dancer. Padge-Victoria Windslowe's testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose was 'a walking billboard' for her work. However, the former 'Black Madam' had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from the overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service. Today, she was found guilty of third-degree murder after one of her 'patients', Claudia Aderotimi, 20, a London break-dancer and college student, died from an illegal silicone injection in her buttocks. Scroll down for video . Conviction: Padge-Victoria Windslowe (left), who bragged of carrying out black-market 'body sculpting' on thousands of women, has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed Claudia Aderotimi (right) Former madam: Windslowe, a former 'Black Madam' (pictured) had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service . Miss Aderotimi, who paid $2,000 to be injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died just a few hours later. It was later revealed the silicone in her buttocks had moved to her lungs and stopped her heart. During her murder trial, Windslowe said of her 'body sculpting': 'I was the best, and I don't mean that to be cocky,' explaining why celebrities would have sought her out over a licensed plastic surgeon. The 45-year-old described herself as a serial entrepreneur who once ran a transgender escort service, as well as a Gothic hip-hop performer who called herself 'the Black Madam.' Last week, her trial was halted for several days after she was hospitalized with chest pains. She has been in prison since 2012 after an 18-month inquiry led to a homicide ruling and an arrest warrant. The jury got the case Friday. They were choosing between third-degree murder - not premeditated but involves malice - and involuntary manslaughter, involving reckless disregard for a person's life. Aspiring hip-hop artists: Today, the defendant (pictured left and right) was convicted of third-degree murder after Miss Aderotimi, 20, a London dancer and college student, died from a silicone injection in her buttocks . Tragic death: Miss Aderotimi (pictured), who was injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in the city in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died a few hours later . In addition to third-degree murder, Windslowe was also convicted of aggravated assault for injuries to a Philadelphia woman who became seriously ill after paying for one of the injections. And the jury found her guilty of two weapons counts - the weapon in question being the industrial-grade silicone. Windslowe faces 20 to 40 years in prison on the murder conviction alone. Miss Aderotimi's family in England chose not to attend the trial. The long-time friend who accompanied her to Philadelphia to celebrate her birthday also declined to make the trip. The friend's 2012 testimony, read aloud in court, described the meeting as 'a touch-up' after their prior visit to the woman they knew as 'Lillian.' Windslowe name-dropped the likes of rappers Nicki Minaj and Kanye West and athlete Serena Williams during her testimony. She also claimed to have been baptized 'Genevieve' by the late Roman Catholic Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua. Amber Rose's agents did return messages seeking comment about the claim she was a client. The evidence showed that Windslowe traveled to hotel rooms and 'pumping parties' with her tools of the trade stuffed into a shiny pink purse: a water bottle filled with silicone, a red plastic cup, needles and syringes, and Krazy Glue to close the injection sites. Claims: Windslowe's colorful testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose (pictured) was 'a walking billboard' for her untrained work . There have been several similar deaths nationwide involving underground buttocks injections. A mother of three who died in Texas after having work done at a tile store died in April 2011. A Columbian couple is serving up to eight years in prison for manslaughter in that case. Windslowe, who went on the run after Miss Aderotimi's death, lowered her head during the closing arguments Friday as a prosecutor described her victim as 'a regular girl' who had asked if the injections could interfere with her ability to have children. When Miss Aderotimi began having chest pains afterward, Windslowe 'kept up that ruse' of being a physician's assistant, Assistant District Attorney Bridget Kirn told the jury last week. 'She put her hand on this young lady's chest as if she were doing an exam,' Kirn said. 'But there was no exam.' Addressing the court, defense lawyer David Rudenstein said the potential dangers of her injections were not clear to his client, Windslowe, because she only knew of satisfied customers. 'Clearly with all the information from this case, we know it shouldn't be done, it's too risky,' Rudenstein told the court. 'We know that now. But we didn't know that then.'","Padge-Victoria Windslowe convicted of third-degree murder by jury today .

"The Australian businessman accused of masterminding an international paedophile ring has spoken from behind bars to 60 Minutes' Tara Brown, claiming that he has remorse for crimes that have been labelled by authorities as the most horrific they've ever seen. Peter Gerard Scully, 51, was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, and killing another young girl, leading to calls for the reintroduction of the death penalty. 'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Tara Brown told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Peter Gerard Scully, 51, was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old . Ms Brown went behind bars to face Scully in a prison in Cagayan de Oro in the country's south, where Scully is currently being held, and will be tried at the same location, facing life in prison if found guilty. Relaxed and in control throughout the interview, Scully kept referring to 'a journal' that he kept and that the reasons for his horrific actions could be explained in it only by a psychiatrist. Scully was evasive, non-committal and vague throughout the 60 Minutes interview. 'I don't want to get into any of that... Are we almost done? Because we seem to be going round in circles,' he said at one stage. Asked by Ms Brown if he had any remorse for his actions he replied: 'That's a good question. There's different degrees of remorse when you finally realise what you have done.' When pressed on why he did what he did his only answer was to 'ask the psychiatrist that question'. Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The father-of-two slipped out of Melbourne after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences and fled to Manila in 2011 where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. Videos seized in the Philippines last week, including one called 'The Destruction of Daisy', allegedly show a 13-year-old girl being forced to perform 'horrific' acts of whipping and torture with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. The 60 Minutes team was on the ground when Scully was arrested after the remains of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon and authorities, who had been keeping the 51-year-old under surveillance, swooped on his house. 'We went inside his house of horrors, right into the heart of darkness to understand exactly why it was so important that he was taken off the street,' said Ms Brown. Scully is accused of feeding a global market of paedophilic videos, charging up to $10,000 for footage of children being tortured and abused by other underage victims. 60 Minutes Tara Brown went behind bars in the Phillipines to speak to the alleged paedeophile . Scully was arrested in February on charges of sexually abusing 13 children and causing the death of another . Ms Brown claimed that several of the young girls who were groomed by Scully became partners in his video ring, falling 'into his net, manipulated to become girlfriends and later accomplices', including Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. 'Part of me feels sorry for them, but I can't understand taking it to the next step into torture and possibly murder,' she said. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, allegedly approached two cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie. She offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. 'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened,' Scully said earlier in the week . 'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Tara Brown . Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other. 'You don't want to overuse the word monster, but that is what he is. He is the face of global perversion' said Ms Brown. 'This story is so confronting, it's a story about all lines being crossed, not just once, but repeatedly. We are talking about the sexual abuse of an 11-month-old, and the misery and lead up to the alleged death of another,' she said. Ms Brown said that Scully, a father of two grown children, claims to have remorse for his crimes. 'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened. That is something to talk about in the court which is the proper forum. There's nothing I can do to change what they [the girls] said,' Scully told The Sydney Morning Herald earlier in the week. Ms Brown said that as a mother of two young boys she is very aware of how 'innocent and trusting young people are'. 'It adds to the tragedy. It's almost beyond belief that there is something so dark within some people and when they act on that it's the most innocent that are their victims,' she said. Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme . Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . 'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Scully said that he isn't concerned about being sentenced to life in prison. 'If I get sentenced, I get sentenced. That is something out of my control,' he said. 'I get bigger than Ben-Hur and people get interested. There is nothing I can do about it, so why worry about it?' Scully said. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said.

"As political grillings go, it was not exactly Jeremy Paxman. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg today faced a grilling from TOWIE star Joey Essex, who seemed a little confused about the Liberal Democrats’ name, and what the election was all about. Mr Clegg had to patiently explain that the party was not called ‘Demo-cats’, after Essex wondered why it had such a ‘weird’ name.’ In tribute to the star's blunder, the party changed the logo on its website from the yellow bird to a yellow cat. Scroll down for video . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg today faced a grilling from TOWIE star Joey Essex, who seemed a little confused about the Liberal Democrats’ name, and what the election was all about . The unlikely duo appeared to hit it off, and later posed for a selfie at the event at the National Liberal Club in London . In tribute to the star's blunder, the party changed the logo on its website from the yellow bird to a yellow cat . On the second day of the election campaign, Mr Clegg launched the Lib Dem manifesto for mental health. But amongst the journalists and broadcasters in the audience was the 24-year-old reality TV star, who is said to be making a documentary for ITV 2 on the election. Essex questioned why every party thinks they are right about everything, what is the point of voting Lib Dem and told Mr Clegg that being Deputy Prime Minister must be ‘sick’. The unlikely duo appeared to hit it off, and later posed for a selfie. But the most bizarre exchange came when the unlikely interviewer asked about the party’s name. ‘Why are they called Liberal Democats? It’s a long word innit?’ Essex asked. Mr Clegg tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988. ‘There used to be a Liberal Party. And then used to be a party called the Social Democrats. ‘This was before my time, they got together and created the Liberal Democrats.’ ‘Oh so you teamed up?,’ said Essex. 'I wondered that because it’s a weird word, innit? It’s got cats in it.’ Laughing, Mr Clegg tried to put him right. ‘It’s not “cats”, it’s “crats”.’ The penny finally dropped. ‘Oh it’s “crats”. I thought it was “cats”. Oh wicked.’ Mr Clegg tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988 which saw the creation of the Liberal Democrats . The conversation moved on to the merits of power, and just how much Mr Clegg wields. ‘You are basically like, you rule this country right?’ ‘I’ve been Deputy Prime Minister for the last five years,’ Mr Clegg replied. ‘That’s sick. I sort of rule Essex. I was going to say, someone else will be Prime Minister next? Are you going to be Prime Minister?' The Lib Dem leader, currently on around 8 per cent in the polls, had to admit this was unlikely. ‘I would love to be Prime Minister but I’ve got to be open with you Joey, I don’t think I am going to win this election outright. ‘I do think that like last time the debate will be about which mixture of parties in government. If you speak to Ed Miliband and David Cameron they will say they are going to win outright, they won’t do. ‘Everybody knows they are not going to win outright.’ Essex is due to interview Labour’s Ed Miliband and Tory leader David Cameron during the election campaign. Mr Clegg said that he should challenge them both on the idea that either of them can win outright. ‘When you speak them, they will tell you both that they will win. Everyone knows they are not going to win outright. ‘The question is who do you want making decisions who have got the right values and instincts and feelings about stuff. I think the Liberal Democrats - not “cats” - have shown in the last five years have got good instincts.’ Joey Essex was in the audience for the Lib Dem leader's morning press conference on mental health and NHS funding . Essex is due to interview Labour’s Ed Miliband and Tory leader David Cameron during the election campaign . Somewhat stating the obvious, Essex admitted that he does not ‘really know much about all the politics’. It was only his second day in his job as a roving reporter on the campaign trail and so far ‘at the moment to me everyone just seems to want to win’. ‘Everybody is fighting for the same position. I don’t really get it,’ he said, telling Mr Clegg: ‘You’ve taught me a lot about Liberal Democrats. At least I know the name now.’ Pointing to his all-white outfit, he added: ‘I was meant to be wearing a suit today but they didn’t tell me I was meeting a leader.’ Essex later said he thought was a 'nice bloke, to be fair', adding: 'He was honest, he told me he weren't going to win - I think honesty is the best policy. 'If - not saying I'm going to be Prime Minister - I was going to lose something and genuinely thought I was going to lose, I would be honest and say I was going to lose. I think that was quite a nice thing of him to say. He was a nice guy.' He added that he was 'excited' about meeting the Labour and Tory leaders: 'David Cameron is the Prime Minister. 'But to be fair, to me, they are all prime ministers. They're all on TV, they're all doing good things, they're all trying to make people happy, so in my eyes they're all nice people really - like, at the moment anyway, until I maybe meet one of them and he's not nice. 'But they're all sweet at the moment.' Asked if there were any words politicians should use, Essex laughed as he replied: 'They could use reem. No, I'm joking. They could use that, but they won't.'","TOWIE star interviews Lib Dem leader on second day of campaign .

"The special bond between a severely disabled boy and his dog has been recognised at Crufts. Rescue dog Miracle beat off 200 other entrants to scoop the prestigious Friends For Life award. The crossbreed was saved from Thailand's illegal dog meat trade a couple of years ago and adopted by Amanda Leask from Strathglass, Scotland, and her six year old son Kyle. Scroll down for video . Six year old Kyle has developed an incredibly close bond with his canine companion Miracle . Miracle was snatched from the streets of north east Thailand and loaded onto a truck with hundreds of other stolen dogs, all destined for the dog meat restaurants of Hanoi in Vietnam. Luckily for Miracle, the truck carrying him to his death was intercepted by agents working for the Phuket-based animal welfare charity Soi Dog Foundation. The dogs were taken to a purpose-built shelter in Thailand, where they were then put up for adoption. Amanda Leask spotted Miracle’s photo shortly after he’d been rescued on a Soi Dog Facebook post. Crossbreed Miracle (seen here hanging over the crowded pet cages) was destined for dog meat restaurants in Vietnam when he was saved by the animal welfare charity Soi Dog Foundation . Devastated by his plight and the hopelessness of his situation, she enquired about adopting him. Already an owner of three rescue dogs from Soi Dog, Amanda very soon had her fourth. And while Miracle quickly got to work returning the favour to his new owner by creating a powerful bond with her son Kyle that transformed the young boy's life. Kyle was born with cerebral palsy, and was later diagnosed with autism. His condition means that it is incredibly difficult for him to communicate with his family. After learning that autistic people can develop extremely close relationships with canine pets, Amanda decided to adopt some dogs. Kyle and Miracle have since developed a close bond, which Amanda says reveals an unspoken mutual understanding. Amanda (pictured here with Miracle and Kyle) says there is an 'unspoken language' between the hound and her disabled son . She said: 'They’ve both faced so much hardship in their lives, it’s like there’s an unspoken language between them. 'When Kyle gets upset because he can’t convey what he wants to, Miracle will go and lay at his side for Kyle to touch and stroke. 'Miracle seems to automatically know when Kyle needs him.' 'If Kyle simply wants some attention, Miracle will go over and shower him with kisses, and it works the other way too.' Amanda adopted Miracle after seeing his photograph on a Soi Dog Facebook post - he has now made a full recovery . She continued: 'Kids can build up confidence in dogs where they seek solace, and Miracle gets this in abundance from Kyle.' The unique bond between man and dog is still yet to be explained fully but Amanda says the amount it has helped Kyle is unlimited. She said: 'He seems so much happier in the presence of Miracle. 'It’s like they’re soul mates.' Miracle won £1,500 for his Crufts Eukaneba Friends for Life award, and Amanda will share the money between Soi Dog and the Autistic Society.","Crossbreed Miracle was destined for the dog meat restaurants of Hanoi .

"These are the horrific scenes where a teenage girl was grabbed at a bus stop, dragged into a garden, beaten with a rock, and then brutally raped. Detectives are hunting for the attacker who pounced on the 18-year-old girl last Friday. Officers described the footage as 'harrowing', but released it in an effort to identify the attacker, who struck at a bus stop on the outskirts of Leeds in the Beeston area of the city. The attacker drags the young 18-year-old girl from the bus stop into the front garden to begin his attack . The man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to  pummel her with a large stone . The attacker, is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, and is in his early 20s, with receding black hair. He is of slim build. The footage shows the man drag the girl onto an area of grass behind the busy bus stop. Detectives believe that several motorists passed the scene during the attack and fear that the man will strike again if not caught. Officers said the man hit the defenceless girl with a large stone to subdue her before subjecting her to a serious sexual assault. The unidentified man then left his victim for dead. Superintendent Nick Wallen from West Yorkshire Police warned the assault 'could happen again'. He said: 'This is a completely out of the ordinary event and there seemed to be no pre-cursor. 'We are urging residents to take more care and avoid walking alone at night were possible. 'We thought very long and hard about releasing this footage due to the dramatic nature of it. 'Securing the consent of the victim and her family was the main consideration and it is their express wish that we do this to assist in bringing the offender to justice. 'We felt it was important to give people a first-hand insight into the nature of this offence in the hope it will encourage them to think very carefully about anything they may have seen in the area around the time or if they have any suspicions about someone they know.' He added: 'This is no time for family loyalties. If you suspects something about a family member or someone you live with, I urge you to come forward.' At the end of the attack, the man left his victim for dead before escaping the scene on foot . Police have released this E-Fit of the suspect who is in his 20s, slim build and with receding black hari . The girl was attacked at this bus stop in the Beeston area of Leeds on Friday night last week . The detective described the footage calling it 'harrowing in nature', but said police hoped its release may jog the memories of anyone in the area when the attack happened at 11.50pm last Friday. 'The moment the footage was played to officers, you could have heard a pin drop. It is absolutely appalling', he said. 'We have understandably edited out the more graphic and disturbing moments when the victim is subjected to an appalling level of violence before being left for dead. 'It does however show the victim struggling with the man as she is dragged into a nearby garden from the bus stop on Beeston Road. 'The next clip shows the man walking calmly away as the victim lies motionless. 'Although the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect directly it may be that something about the general size, shape or movement of the suspect means something to someone out there when put together with the e-fit image we have released. 'The description remains of him being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, aged in his earlies twenties, slim, with receding black hair. 'He was wearing dark clothing and possibly a light blue top with a hood.'

"A beach hut that was described by a luxury lifestyle magazine as 'too lush for words' has gone on sale for £1.25million, despite attracting bitter complaints from local residents. The property, which is located in Coldingham Bay in the Scottish Borders comes with four double bedrooms with sea views and terraces, an entrance hallway and open plan kitchen, dining and living area with sliding doors. Since it was constructed it has received praise from fans of modern architecture, with Luxe magazine calling it 'too lush for words' in a July review. Scroll down for video . Picturesque: The beach hut sits on top of a hill in Coldingham Bay, in the Scottish Borders, and has four double bedrooms all with sea views . Stunning: The property has an open-plan dining, living and kitchen space with doors that open out on to a balcony overlooking the Noth Sea . Controversial: The home was described by luxury lifestyle magazine Luxe as 'too lush for words', but has caused fury among locals who say it is out of character with other beach huts, some of which are 100 years old . Luxury: Each of the four bedrooms has its own terrace, and the property sits in landscaped gardens which extend up and down the hill . However, as the property was built on the site of an old wooden beach hut, and is surrounded by other wooden huts some of which are 100 years old, it has attracted the ire of locals who say it is 'out of keeping' with the area. One Tripadvisor review of the area by Sandra L reads: 'This lovely spot is overlooked by an absolute monstrosity of a building - a carbuncle is the only suitable description. 'How this ever got planning permission is a mystery! My memory is of the chalet belonging to the Haven, a wooden building with a corrugated iron roof. I know we must move with the times, but I think this building is a big mistake and spoils the whole beach area.' However, spokesperson for property management company Sanderson Young, who are dealing with all enquiries called the property ‘one of the most unique, rare and impressive beach houses available within the United Kingdom’. The home is set into landscaped grounds which extend up and down the hillside. The property can also be rented out for £3,000 for seven nights during peak holiday season. Pricey: According to the estate agents handling the sale, at peak season the owners of this house could collect £3,000 per week in rent . Problems: One Tripadvisor review of the bay brands the property a 'carbuncle', adding: 'How this ever got planning permission is a mystery' Anger: The building used to be on the site of an old wooden hut that served as accommodation for staff at a nearby Haven hotel . Holiday rental website coastalretreats.co.uk still have the property advertised to rent and describe it as:'An extraordinary piece of landmark architecture using glass, steel, welsh slate and iroko wood in a stunning location'. A local business owner added: 'Just generally I hear that most people don’t like it. It’s totally different to everything else in the bay. A lot of tourists come in and say they don’t like it but there are a small group who say it’s stunning. 'It used to be an old wooden hut, I believe it was the living quarters for the maids at the Haven hotel. Now it’s an invasive piece of modern architecture. 'I believe that a gentleman owns it and it is on the market, though I’m not sure if it was built to sell or to let. It sits empty for much of the time but every now and then guests do come to stay.' Fury: Sandra L left this review of the bay on Tripadvisor with a three star rating, the lowest rating the location has ever received, saying the property 'spoils the whole beach area' Complaints: Others have protested the new addition to the sea front by saying it is out of keeping with the other buildings .","Four bedroom home with open plan kitchen, diner and living space built on site of old wooden beach hut .

"Homeopathy is no more effective than a placebo, a national medical review has found. The National Health and Medical Research Council recently conducted a study into evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy for treating health conditions, concluding that this method of therapy is ineffective. It further warned that those who choose homeopathy treatments over others 'may put their health at risk'. Yet the Australian Homeopathic Association has criticised the NHMRC's 'biased' review, saying homeopathy is one of the most used medical systems in the world - among them being about one million Australians. Homeopathy is a type of alternative and natural form of medicine, which is based on the notion that substances that may cause illness in a healthy person can treat those symptoms in a person who is unwell. Consequently about $10 million is spent on homeopathy by Australians, according to the World Health Organisation. Scroll down for video . The National Health and Medical Research Council recently conducted a study into evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy for treating health conditions, concluding that this method of therapy is ineffective . The study further warned that those who choose homeopathy treatments over others 'may put their health at risk' The NHMRC's conclusion, released on Wednesday, is based on the findings of more than 1800 papers. Although there were some studies which showed that homeopathy was effective, the NHMRC states they were assessed as being 'small or of poor quality'. 'These studies had either too few participants, poor design, poor conduct and or reporting to allow reliable conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of homeopathy,' it states. From the research, the NHMRC further warned that homeopathy should not be used as an alternative to treat health conditions that are chronic or serious. 'People who choose homeopathy may put their health at risk if they reject or delay treatments for which there is good evidence for safety and effectiveness,' the study states. 'Those who use homeopathy should tell their health practitioner and should keep taking any prescribed treatments.' About $10 million is spent on homeopathy by Australians, according to the World Health Organisation . NHMRC's CEO Professor Warwick Anderson says all medical treatments should be supported by reliable evidence. 'NHMRC's review shows that there is no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy works better than a placebo,' he said. Homeopathy is a type of complementary and alternative medicine, according to the National Health and Medical Research Council. It is based on two main ideas: . Homeopathic medicines include pellets placed under the tongue, tablets, liquids, ointments, sprays and creams. 'From this review, the main recommendation for Australians is that they should not rely on homeopathy as a substitute for proven, effective treatments.' But in an open letter to Professor Anderson, the Australian Homeopathic Association  accused the authors of the NHMRC review of being biased. 'Homeopathy is one of the most used medical systems in the world, with an estimated one million Australians choosing homeopathy as part of their health care,' the association said in a statement. 'In Europe over 30 million people use homeopathic medicine, in India over 100 million people depend solely on homeopathic medicine.' The association says homeopathy is not ideally suited to systematic reviews such as the NHMRC's as the therapy is 'a holistic system of medicine that focuses on the unique situation of each individual's overall health'.","Medical study found there is 'no good quality evidence' that homeopathy is effective in treating health conditions .

"Facebook  must face a nationwide class-action lawsuit seeking to . force the social media company to provide refunds when children . spend their parents' money on its website without permission, a federal judge has said. U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, .

The judge also said the plaintiffs could not pursue refunds . as a group under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, because any . refunds would vary from case to case, but could still seek . individual refunds. A California judge said a class of plaintiffs estimated in the hundreds of thousands may press their claim that Facebook should change how it handles online transactions by minors . The lawsuit was brought by two children and their parents. One child said his mother let him spend $20 on her credit . card toward the game 'Ninja Saga,' but was later charged several . hundred dollars for purchases he thought he made with 'virtual, . in-game currency.'

In opposing class certification, Facebook said the . plaintiffs' claims were too disparate, and an injunction would . not address them. But Freeman said state law protects parents and their . children when those children 'occasionally use their lack of . judgment' and buy things they should not. 'Though some minors undoubtedly may wish to continue making . purchases through credit or debit cards they do not have . permission to use, such a desire cannot prevent the named . plaintiffs from bringing suit to demand that Facebook's policies . comply with the law,' she wrote.

"Missouri's oldest death row inmate was executed on Tuesday for murdering a sheriff's deputy, after the U.S. Supreme Court and the governor declined to spare the 74-year-old whose attorneys said he had a diminished mental capacity because of a sawmill accident decades ago. 'They brought me up here to execute me,' Cecil Clayton uttered before he was put to death by lethal injection after Governor Jay Nixon denied a clemency request. After a final meal of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, corn, green beans and a cola, he was executed at the correctional center in Bonne Terre at 9.13pm and was pronounced dead at 9.21pm. Clayton was executed despite repeated attempts by his lawyers to spare his life, claiming he had an IQ of just 71 after suffering a traumatic brain injury decades before he killed the officer in 1996. Put to his death: Cecil Clayton, 74, was executed by lethal injection at 9:13 p.m. on Tuesday for the 1996 murder of Deputy Sheriff Christopher Castetter. He was pronounced dead at 9:21 p.m. The nation's high court turned aside appeals after the Missouri Supreme Court, in a 4-3 ruling, also declined to intervene. The court's majority concluded last weekend that there was no evidence Clayton - despite his brain injury - wasn't capable of understanding his circumstances. The U.S. Supreme Court was also divided, with four judges saying they would have granted a stay. Mike O'Connell, spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections, said in a statement that Clayton was executed at 9.13pm and pronounced dead at 9:21 p.m. The claim of diminished mental capacity stemmed from a 1972 sawmill accident that Clayton's attorneys argued cost him about eight percent of his brain, including 20 per cent of the frontal lobe portion governing impulse control and judgment. Combined with his reported IQ of 71 and reading skills of a fourth-grader, Clayton's attorneys insisted psychiatric evaluations over the past decade concluded that the inmate didn't understand the significance of his scheduled execution or the reasons for it, making him ineligible to be put to death under state and federal law. In their 11th-hour appeals, Clayton's attorneys had argued that his deteriorating mental health left him convinced his conviction was a plot against him and that God would rescue him from a death sentence at the last minute, 'after which time he will travel the country playing the piano and preaching the gospel.' The appeals were ultimately rejected. 'Cecil Clayton had - literally - a hole in his head,' said Elizabeth Unger Carlyle, one of his attorneys, following his death on Tuesday night. 'Executing him without a hearing to determine his competency violated the Constitution, Missouri law, and basic human dignity... The world will not be a safer place because Mr. Clayton has been executed.' But the victim's family were in support of his killer being put to death. Missing: A brain scan shared by his lawyers show a significant section of his brain is missing . At a press briefing on Tuesday evening, James Castetter thanked authorities for convicting Clayton for the 'senseless murder' of his brother, Chris Castetter. 'We know this execution isn't going to bring Chris back,' he said. 'But it destroys an evil person that would otherwise be walking this earth. 'There is no doubt in my mind that Cecil knew what he had done... The Great State of Missouri did not kill an innocent man. Cecil Clayton's actions is what put him to death.' Clayton was convicted of gunning down Christopher Castetter, a sheriff's deputy in rural southwest Missouri's Barry County. Castetter was 29 and a father-of-three when he went to a home near Cassville on Thanksgiving Eve 1996 to check on a suspicious vehicle report. Authorities said Clayton shot Castetter once in the forehead while the deputy was in his car, which was found against a tree, its engine racing and wheels spinning. Clayton's brother had testified that the sawmill accident led to Clayton's breakup from his wife, alcohol abuse and violent outbursts. The lethal injection, Clayton's attorneys said, was 'sure or very likely to cause excruciating or tortuous pain and needless suffering' in light of his dementia. 'If Missouri proceeds with its scheduled execution of Mr. Clayton, it will be conducting an unregulated experiment on a human subject, as there are no studies that support (the prison system's) use of Missouri's lethal injection protocol on an individual suffering from severe brain damage,' the appeals on Clayton's behalf argued. Killed: Barry County Sheriff's Deputy Christopher Castetter, pictured left, was shot dead by Clayton, pictured right in an old mug shot, as he responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle in 1996 . At the weekend, when the Missouri Supreme Court issued its decision, three of the seven judges agreed that Clayton was entitled to a competency hearing. Mental health professionals who examined him agreed that he was mentally impaired and had mental health issues, including dementia. His most recent IQ test had found him to have an IQ of just 71, which is 29 points below average. 'He is not simply incompetent legally; he would be unable to care for himself or manage basic self-care, were he not in a structured environment that takes care of him,' according to a doctor who examined him, the Kansas City Star reported. 'He can shower, groom, eat, walk; it is his comprehension, judgment, memory, limited intelligence and social deficits that plague him.' In Missouri, the director of the Department of Corrections is the only one with the authority to order a competency hearing, and last year, he called on a doctor to examine Clayton. Dr. James Reynolds of the Missouri Department of Mental Health had concluded that Clayton was mentally ill, but could not be certain that he didn't understand his death sentence. But Clayton's lawyers said, while he had conversations in which he understood he was about to be executed, he would later forget that conversation ever happened. His family also called for a fair hearing on the issue. Execution: He was put to death at the state prison in Bonne Terre, pictured, on Tuesday night . Death: His family and lawyers had argued that he was child-like and did not understand the significance of his death penalty. They had called for his execution at Bonne Terre (pictured) to be stopped . 'He is brain-damaged, and talking with him is like talking to a child,' Clayton's daughter, Jena Clayton, said during his clemency petition, the Kansas City Star reported. 'I do not believe we are the kind of country that executes the disabled.' At the execution, Department of Corrections Director George A. Lombardi read a statement from Governor Jay Nixon, in which he praised the work of Castetter. 'Our state is safer because there are brave officers, like Deputy Castetter, who are willing to sacrifice their own safety for that of others,' he said. 'As the sentence of his murderer was carried out this evening, I ask Missourians tonight to honor Deputy Castetter, who gave his life in service to our state, and to remember him and his family in their thoughts and prayers.' The execution was Missouri's second this year after the state's record 10 in 2014. It was also the first Missouri carried out in the evening after decades of having them just after midnight.","Cecil Clayton was executed by lethal injection at 9.13pm on Tuesday for the 1996 murder of Deputy Sheriff Christopher Castetter .

"A former ISIS captive has described how the extremists enjoyed watching Teletubbies and Game of Thrones to relax and sometimes struggled to justify their barbaric acts. French former captive Nicolas Henin has said they watched 'everything' on TV, and also claimed they were 'fragile people' who could not turn back after initially committing violent crimes. Mr Henin, aged 39, and fellow captive Pierre Torres, 30, were kidnapped in Raqqa, Syria in June 2013 and released 10 months later. French journalists Nicholas Hénin (left) and Pierre Torres (right) spent time with Briton David Haines as ISIS captives . When it came to time off from waging jihad, Henin said in an interview with the BBC placed on the Spiegel website in Germany: 'They watched everything, from Teletubbies to Game of Thrones. 'The recruits are fragile people - once pushed to commit a crime when they arrive there is no way they can turn back.' He refused to talk specifically about Kuwaiti-born Briton Mohammed Emwazi on the grounds that fellow prisoner, British journalist John Cantlie, is still held hostage by the group. He added that he and fellow released captive Mr Torres played a game at night devised by doomed Briton David Haines. Haines was beheaded on camera by the Islamic executioner now revealed to be Kuwaiti-born Briton Mohammed Emwazi. A Russian engineer, Sergey Gorbunov, who was killed during Henin's time there, was remembered in a small ceremony by the rest of the prisoners, he says. French former captive Nicolas Henin said his ISIS captors watched 'everything' on TV, and also claimed they were 'fragile people' who could not turn back after initially committing violent crimes . 'Everyone paid tribute to him. John Cantlie spoke first and then we held a minute's silence.' Talking to some of his captors during his 10 months as a hostage, he says he saw flickers of doubt 'and a lot of bad faith, because they had to justify it to themselves, and some of their acts were impossible to justify'. 'I remember with a couple of the captors, we had discussions that showed their convictions were a bit fragile and that they maybe even had regrets about what they were doing. 'A bit of chat might help, but no pity for sure because they are totally closed to pity. 'Asking for pity is the worst thing you can do. It's stupid. Never try it.' Henin was interviewed upon the publication of a children's book he wrote in captivity with Torres based on the game devised by Haines. The book, Will Daddy Hedgehog Ever Come Home?, was written for Henin's five-year-old daughter, and is published this week.","Former ISIS captive Nicolas Henin said jihaidi captors watched TV to relax .

"Ex-Fashion Police writers have revealed that many industry insiders believed the demise of the popular E! series was inevitable after the death of the show's former host Joan Rivers, because its current stars can't unapologetically get away with the comedian's no holds barred brand of humor. While many blame the show's recent hiatus - and the abrupt departures of Kathy Griffin and Kelly Osbourne - on the scandal that erupted after Giuliana Rancic joked that Zendaya Coleman's dreadlocks at the Oscars made her look like she smelled of 'patchouli oil' and 'weed', others say Fashion Police was always destined to fail without the legendary comedian. 'Joan isn't there to make it all work,' Todd Masterson, a former Fashion Police writer told Cosmopolitan.com during a phone conversation. 'She had decades of saying the most offensive things under her belt. Now the pressure was on everyone else to make provocative jokes.' Original star: Joan Rivers sat poised in her chair during a taping of Fashion Police . Old friends: Tony Tripoli, the former head writer of Fashion Police, can be seen showing the late Joan Rivers something on his phone during a break on set in 2014 . Industry insiders: Tony (L) and former Fashion Police writer Todd Masterson (R) weighed in on the future of the show after it was announced that the series will be on hiatus until September . Mr Masterson, who left the series in 2013 to go on strike with a majority of the show's writers, said that he remembers Giuliana would often read from teleprompters, noting that the controversial comment was mostly likely reviewed by multiple people and passed through video editing before it found its way on air. Tony Tripoli, former head writer of Fashion Police, also came to Giuliana's defense. 'Giuliana was probably exhausted after spending 12 hours on the red carpet and getting very little sleep,' he said. 'I don't think she meant to sound racist or cause anyone harm.' The 40-year-old red carpet interviewer inevitably apologized for the ill-advised and racially loaded joke - which is something both writers insist Joan would never have done. ‘That was her act,’ Mr Masterson said of Joan. 'I think she knew an apology was a floodgate.' Happier times: Brad Goreski, Kelly Osbourne, Kathy Griffin and Giuliana Rancic only filmed seven episodes of Fashion Police together . Controversial comment: Giuliana came under fire last month after she said that Zendaya Coleman's dreadlocks at the Oscars made her look like she smelled of 'patchouli oil' and 'weed' during an episode of the show . Truly offended: Zendaya, who can be seen posing at this year's Oscars, slammed Giuliana for her 'outrageously offensive' comment. She later accepted Giuliana's apology . Kelly Osbourne, who is friends with Zendaya, was the first to quit the show last month after five years with show. Then Kathy announced her exit last week on Twitter after hosting only seven episodes of the show. While she maintained that making fun of women's bodies was against what she believed in as a feminist, TMZ claimed that producers were discussing firing her from the show. On Tuesday, E! announced that the show would be on hiatus until September, cancelling three episodes in the meantime. 'We look forward to taking this opportunity to refresh the show before the next awards season,' the network said in a statement. 'Our talented co-hosts Giuliana Rancic and Brad Goreski, along with executive producer Melissa Rivers, will continue their roles as we evolve the show into its next chapter for the legions of fans around the world.' Mr Tripoli, who is currently working on and upcoming E! talk show about plastic surgery called Good Work, told Cosmopolitan.com: 'Joan would absolutely want the show to continue.'","Tony Tripoli and Todd Masterson worked on the series with the legendary comedian .

"Two particularly hungry, exotic termite species have apparently found love halfway around the world, causing concern for scientists. Asian and Formosan subterranean termites, two of the most destructive termite species on the planet, are could be mating in South Florida. They are producing hybrid colonies of 'super termites' that are growing at twice the normal rate. Asian (pictured) and Formosan subterranean termites, two of the most destructive termite species on the planet, are could be mating in South Florida.They are producing hybrid colonies of 'super termites' that are growing at twice the normal rate . Together, Asian and Formosan subterranean termites, are responsible for much of the estimated $40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually. The Formosan termites originated in China but now are established throughout the Southeast and blamed for roughly $300m in property damage each year in New Orleans alone. Asian termites normally found in tropical south-eastern Asia have spread to Brazil, the Caribbean and south Florida. Asian termites are not expected to spread farther north in the US than south Florida because they do not tolerate colder weather/ . However, a hybrid might be able to thrive in a greater range than either species alone. Their habitat ranges overlap in lush south Florida, already home to a daunting number of invasive plant and animal species thriving where they should not. Each termite invaded Florida several decades ago, but experts believed the colonies didn't mingle because their above ground mating swarms launched in different months. That is, until University of Florida researcher Thomas Chouvenc noticed something unusual about the termite swarms in his Fort Lauderdale neighbourhood two years ago. The two species were flying around looking for mates at the same time – and they were giving each other that look. The research is preliminary and leaves many questions unanswered, but the idea of a hybrid termite carrying the destructive capabilities of two invasive species worries experts. 'That's big news,' said Matthew Messenger, an entomologist at the US Department of Agriculture. 'They're two bad ones, too.' Chouvenc is the lead author of a study published this week i the journal Plos One detailing observations of Asian and Formosan termite swarms in downtown Fort Lauderdale. In the field, including Chouvenc's own yard, researchers documented the two species swarming at the same time and in the same places. The same behaviour was documented again last year, and Chouvenc said he is seeing again this spring. 'What we didn't expect to see was when they're in the same place at the same time, we saw the male Asian subterranean termites looking for the female Formosan termites in the field,' Chouvenc said. Together, Asian and Formosan (pictured) subterranean termites, are responsible for much of the estimated $40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually . 'When we put them in vials and brought them back to the lab, to our biggest surprise they started laying eggs and the eggs started growing.' The resulting 'hybrid' colony in the lab grew more vigorously than colonies produced by either species alone, researchers said. Genetic analysis confirmed they were looking at a hybrid species. Similar hybridisation has been documented in invasive bee and fire ant species, but not in termites. The two termite species also are found together on the island of Oahu in Hawaii and in Taiwan, but the simultaneous swarms and hybridisation found in Florida appear to be a new phenomenon. It is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in Fort Lauderdale, or whether the hybrids bred in the lab can reproduce. It is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in Fort Lauderdale in the south of Florida . Female termites can lay millions of eggs, but it takes five to eight years for a colony to produce the mature adults that fly in the mating swarms. 'Let's keep our fingers crossed that they're not able [to reproduce] and that they're donkey termites,' said Messenger, who reviewed the data but did not participate in the University of Florida study. Even if hybrid termites cannot reproduce, they could cause damage over many years. Alone, each species is a challenge to control. Their below-ground colonies are bigger than those of native termites and can be hard to find. Liquid insecticides injected into the soil or baited traps are effective ways for homeowners to fight back against Asian and Formosan termites, and those methods should work against any hybrid, Messenger said. The termite species are found together on the island of Oahu in Hawaii and in Taiwan, but the simultaneous swarms and hybridisation found in Florida appear to be a new phenomenon.

"An 'over-eager' father has ruined a primary school disco after charging onto the dance floor to break up a fight between two children - and then calling the police to report an assault. The 'angry and intimidating' dad forced the event at St Andrew's and St Mark's Church of England Junior school to be cancelled mid-way through on March 19. He 'pulled the children apart' and then started 'shouting and swearing' before calling 999 to say the children at the Surrey school 'assaulted' each other. 'Intimidating': The parent who called the police to report a scuffle at a primary school disco 'shouted and swore' in front of the children . Children at the 280-pupil school which has been rated 'outstanding' were escorted out of the disco while police spoke to the 'upset parent', but no action was ultimately taken. The school's parent-teacher association (PTA) wrote a letter to parents saying: 'A parent of one of the children was on site when the incident happened and took it upon themselves to resolve the situation despite the PTA trying to step in. 'This was inappropriate behaviour on behalf of the parent and it came across as angry and intimidating. 'The parent also took it upon themselves to call the police who did attend the school. Unfortunately the children in the hall witnessed this behaviour.' A mother who asked not to be identified, said: 'I heard about this from my son who said this guy just flew onto the dance floor and pulled these two children apart. 'He was shouting and screaming about one hitting the other and then he pulled out his phone and called the police and reported one of the children for assault. He ruined it for everyone.' Angry: The school wrote a letter to parents following the incidents in which described the parent who called the police's behaviour as 'inappropriate' While a spokesman for Kingston Council said: 'We take these matters extremely seriously, and the school has written to all the parents assuring them that the disco was constantly supervised. 'It is such a shame that a lovely event, usually enjoyed by all, was marred by the actions of one parent. 'We understand that this incident will have been very stressful for the children who witnessed it and the school will support them in any way needed.' A spokesman for the school declined to comment.","The parent 'shouted and swore' in front of children before calling police .

"You've heard of wedding crashers. Joey DiJulio is a bachelor party crasher - of sorts. For weeks, the father-of-one from the Seattle suburbs found himself getting emails from people he didn't know about a bachelor party 2,800 miles away in Philadelphia and a groom he's never met. He saw names of the city's landmarks like Reading Terminal Market thrown around in the emails but couldn't put his finger on where they were located until he searched the names online. The wrong guest: Joey DiJulio of Burien, Washington, started receiving emails from people he had never met about a bachelor party. He then came clean about the mistake, but the groom decided to invite him anyway . 'I had no idea what any of these places are,' said DiJulio, 31, who's never been to the Northeast. 'After Googling them, everything was pointing to Philadelphia.' It turns out DiJulio, an information technology worker and a married father of one in Burien, Washington, had been mistaken for a friend of the groom with a similar last name. He sat as a 'fly on the wall' for much of the email chain until Monday, when he broke the news after the groom's brother wanted a headcount of people attending the party. But it didn't end there. Groom Jeff Minetti, 34, figured: Why not still invite him? The Philadelphia real estate agent asked him to attend both the bachelor party March 28 and his wedding May 2 in New Jersey. 'This is the city of brotherly love,' Minetti said, even telling DiJulio he could be his best man. 'Any and all are welcome.' The groom: When those who were invited to the bachelor party saw a picture of Joey DiJulio they said he could actually be related to the groom - Jeff Minetti . DiJulio went online and set up a GoFundMe page to tell his story and raise money to cover his travel. In less than a week, he's already hit his goal of a little more than $1,200 and is putting any more money raised toward Minetti's honeymoon. The groom promises the bachelor party will be a low-key affair at some bars, maybe a casino, to watch March Madness unfold. And while he won't actually get to be the best man — that's reserved for Minetti's 11-year-old cousin — DiJulio has his plane ticket ready to go for next weekend to see a city he's never been to and hang out with a group of guys he's never met. He set up a GoFundMe page when he learned he was invited, and has since raised more than $2,000 . From the groom Jeff Minetti: . People, . Has anyone else noticed now that Jeff has been rocking the beard for a while - he looks like a middle aged Pavarotti? At times, he also has ventured into a bit of hipster phase. In addition to publicly questioning his fashion choices, his bachelor party will be a good time for us to celebrate him leading up to his wedding. Joe DiJulio finally comes clean: . Hi All, . So, I have no idea who any of you guys are, but I have been enjoying being a fly on the wall hearing about the plans for this bachelor party over the last few months. I'm assuming my E-Mail address was added to the list by mistake (perhaps a typo of someone else?). I live out in Seattle, WA and although for a moment I thought it might be funny to just show up and be that guy nobody knows but everyone wonders ""who is that guy?"", buying a plane ticket for a cross-country flight just to crash a bachelor's party might be a bit over the top (although it would be epic!). Nonetheless, I do hope you guys have a great time and I'd like to take a moment to wish the best of luck in life to the groom! Cheers! Joey DiJulio . Seattle, WA . Members of the party start to reply . I say everyone forks up an extra $20 and we get Joey a plane ticket to Philly! and . I just facebooked Joey DiJulio in WA, and if this is you - you actually look like you could be related to groom. MIND BLOWN . Mr DiJuio replies about the picture on Facebook . Haha... Yes, that is indeed me with my (now 2-year old, she was about 3-months there) daughter, Kaylee. Speaking of bachelor parties, weddings, and the like, that shot was actually taken at a wedding for a buddy of mine who also, coincidentally, happens to now live out on the east coast (Boston). Small world! Indeed, I think I recall seeing a picture of the groom over the last few months, and noticed this as well. I'm of course glad to know he's a studly guy - His soon-to-be-wife is a lucky woman! PS: Still kind of a mystery to me how I got on this thread, as I've never been to PA or anywhere in the NE part of our country for that matter. But, you guys seem like a cool bunch nonetheless. Perhaps I'll have to drop you folks a line if I ever make it out there for tips on tourist-type things to check out. The groom Joe then replies . Joe, . I'm overnighting you a wedding invite. You show up at the bachelor party and ill make you my best man. You can give the toast even . Jeff . He then posted an update based on the news on Facebook. A number of his friends told him to go.

"Israeli police say they have shot a man suspected of carrying out a terror attack that left at least five female officers suffering serious injuries this morning. The suspect  is believed to have driven a car in to a crowd of female police officers who were standing outside a border police station between the line separating the east of the city from the west. Photographs on social media suggest the suspect was left with serious injuries after being shot by officers who moved to incapacitate him when he got out of his vehicle and began attacking onlookers with a meat cleaver. There has not yet been an official confirmation of the man's condition. Down: Photographs on social media suggest the suspect (pictured on the ground) was injured after being shot by officers who moved to incapacitate him when he got out of his car began attacking passers-by . Crash: The suspect is believed to have driven a car in to a crowd of female police officers who were standing outside a border police station between the line separating the east of the city from the west . Israeli medics and a policeman evacuate an injured person from the scene of the Jerusalem attack . The attack took place at a border police station on Shimon Ha'Tsadik Street, which marks the line between east and west Jerusalem, according to Micky Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the local force. The suspect is believed to be a Arab man in his early 30s who hails from east Jerusalem. Paramedics said they administered first aid to at least five people, all female police officers. Three of the women are in a serious condition, while the other two escaped with only minor injuries. Witnesses on the ground claimed that after ploughing his car into the officers, the man got out the vehicle and attacked Israeli onlookers with a knife, although that report has not been confirmed. The same border police station was subject to a hit and run attack in November that killed one police officer and left 13 other people suffering serious injuries. An Israeli policeman and medics evacuate an injured person at the scene of this morning's Jerusalem attack . After ploughing in to the female officers the attacker is understood to have crashed into a cyclist . 'The incident was apparently a deliberate attack,' police spokeswoman Luba Samri said, adding that the driver had been taken to hospital in a serious condition. The incident took place on the Jewish holiday of Purim, when the streets are busy with pedestrians. Last October and November, there was a spate of similar attacks, with Palestinian drivers ramming their vehicles into people waiting at the city's light-rail stops. Those attacks killed three people and wounded around a dozen. Tensions flared in Jerusalem last year, both before and after the Gaza war, but the city has been relatively calm in recent months. On Thursday, the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed to suspend security coordination with Israel in the occupied West Bank, which officials are concerned could have a knock-on impact on security throughout the territory. The Palestinians seek a state in the West Bank and East Jerusalem -- which have been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war -- and in Gaza, a strip of land on the Mediterranean coast that is separated from the West Bank.

Chaos: The suspect is believed to have driven a car in to a crowd of female police officers who were standing outside a border police station between the line separating the east of the city from the west . The attack comes just one week after the Mayor of Jerusalem Nir Barkat instructed his bodyguards to apprehend a Palestinian man who had just stabbed an ultra-Orthodox Jew in the stomach in the middle of a busy street. Mr Barkat said he and his staff were travelling in a car when he noticed the 'terrorist' with a knife. He and his bodyguard leaped from their car to stop the attacker. The bodyguard drew his firearm and wrestled the 18-year-old attacker to the ground and held him until police arrived. The 27-year-old victim suffered a stab wound to the stomach and was only 'lightly injured' according to police.","Man ploughed vehicle into group of female officers outside a police station .

"A mother-of-two who raided a lonely bachelor's £56,000 inheritance money so she could fund her craving for online shopping and betting machines has been jailed for 18 months. Malcolm Hibbert had been single for many years when he met Karen Hughes, 50, in December 2011 while he still was living with his widowed mother Ruth, in Burnley, Lancashire. Burnley Crown Court was told the couple never lived together but would see each other several times a week and she had keys to his property. But within months of his mother dying and leaving him £56,000 inheritance, the majority of the money was gone after Hughes callously seized control of her boyfriend's finances and splashed £20,000 of it on herself. Malcolm Hibbert had been single for many years when he met Karen Hughes, 50, in December 2011 while he was living with his widowed mother Ruth, in Burnley, Lancashire.  In September 2012, Mrs Hibbert, 84, passed away and left him with an inheritance of £56,000 - the majority of which Hughes plundered . In September 2012, Mrs Hibbert, 84, passed away and left him with the inheritance which she built up with her late husband Alan who died aged 74 in 2003. Despite living on state benefits, Hughes splashed out on a string of 'staycation' seaside holidays in the UK for herself and 60-year old Mr Hibbert while secretly pocketing almost £20,000 of the legacy for herself. In one three month period it is believed Hughes spent £16,462 playing fixed odds betting terminals - dubbed the 'crack cocaine of gambling' - at her local bookmakers, and used Mr Hibbert's cash to pay Wonga loans and set up internet accounts with Argos, Littlewoods and Next. Mr Hibbert, an only child, had lived with his parents for his whole life and knew little about finance. He told court he had only discovered the money was missing when he went to his bank to ask why transactions had been blocked - and was told there was only £10,000 left of the nest egg. The court heard that Hughes ended their relationship when she was asked about the money. Despite living on state benefits, Hughes splashed out on a string of 'staycation' seaside holidays in the UK for herself and 60-year old Mr Hibbert while secretly pocketing almost £20,000 of the legacy for herself . Mr Hibbert, a delivery driver, condemned his former girlfriend as she was jailed for 18 months. He said: 'I was taken for a ride in the cruelest way possible. 'I had only just lost my mum but Karen suddenly got more involved in my life and was arranging the funeral and everything. She became my rock. I am normally very cautious with money but she wormed her way in and virtually spent the lot. I went into the bank one day and when I couldn't get any money, they told me there was lot of unusual spending habits and showed what was left. It knocked me for six. 'I just didn't have a clue what she was up to. I thought we would have been sweethearts for life but it looks like ultimately she was only after me for my money. I feel like I've been taken for a mug.' Stephen Parker prosecuting said Mr Hibbert was not a wealthy man but even before the inheritance became available in March 2013 Hughes had 'very quickly' taken control of her boyfriend's finances and set up an online bank account for him. In one day alone £1,300 was taken out of Mr Hibbert's account. On the day the inheritance money was paid, Hughes paid herself £5,760 followed by payments of £1,000 and £1,450. She also set up accounts with Wonga, Argos, Littlewoods and Next on the internet using his name and made purchases . The couple went to Blackpool six times as well as Scarborough, the Lake District and Cornwall where they went to football matches, restaurants on railway trips and even and a speedboat jaunt. She would book the holidays then pay for them with his money after he asked her to action his bills for him. But Hughes also used his cash to make card payments to William Hill and took out loans with Wonga to cover the transactions. In one day alone £1,300 was taken out of Mr Hibbert's account. On the day the inheritance money was paid, Hughes paid herself £5,760 followed by payments of £1,000 and £1,450. She also set up accounts with Wonga, Argos, Littlewoods and Next on the internet using his name and made purchases. Mr Parker said: 'Mr Hibbert is a man who had always lived with his parents.. His parents had always done his accounting and taken care of his finances. He had always lived with his mother. His father died several years... 'The defendant herself said he didn't have a clue of finances or computers. 'He had little or no understanding of banking and how it worked because his mother had control in relation to his finances. In terms of monies, he had somewhere between £10,000-15,000 of his own money in savings other than the inheritance that he received, held in various accounts. She claims said she was never told to not spend the money - and would show him receipts after withdrawing from the cash point. She also said Mr Hibbert would ask her to marry him on a daily basis . 'She didn't consider her actions dishonest and said he would probably have let her take the money if she asked. This was more than just a breach of trust because of his vulnerability He was heavily dependant on her, the degree of trust was higher.' The money went missing between January 2013 to July 2013 before Hughes was arrested. She admitted that she had dealt with his financial matters and bills and said that the transactions were both for her sole use and for their joint use. But she claims said she was never told not to spend the money  - and would show him receipts after withdrawing from the cash point. She also said Mr Hibbert would ask her to marry him on a daily basis. In a victim impact statement Mr Hibbert said he felt 'frightened' and often had trouble sleeping and would 'sit around the house for days end, crying on a daily basis'. He added that he had been grateful when Hughes had helped him after his mother's death but as a result of what happened felt 'hurt and betrayed'. He no longer enjoyed life and was struggling to focus on anything else and had made him 'sink further into his shell'. Santander have since refunded him all the money. Hughes, from Lancaster, who showed no emotion in court, admitted theft and fraud. She had previous convictions for chequebook fraud and served a nine month prison sentence in 1993. In mitigation defence lawyer Anthony Parkinson said Hughes had 'significant gambling issues' and said her habit began during a previous relationship as 'some sort of escapism from that daily life'. He added: 'These offences would not have been committed had that money not been readily available. This gambling problem has always been in her life and was the whole motivation. Essentially she doesn't have £2 to rub together, she never did. She is not a lady who lived a lavish lifestyle. She is remorseful and bitterly regrets her actions.' Passing sentence the judge Mr Recorder Stephen Riordan QC told Hughes: 'Whether or not you knew that inheritance was coming I do not know. 'But you began plundering his bank account on a regular basis even before the inheritance arrived in his account. He trusted you to look after his affairs for him and you knew perfectly well he was not ever going to check on what you were doing. 'I have little doubt if it had not been discovered you would have gone on plundering his account until it was empty. The affect on him was devastating. He'd had no effective relationship for many years if at all, naturally enough he became dependent on you. You have let him down. 'You have mercilessly stolen from him over a period of time.'","Malcolm Hibbert was single for many years when he met Karen Hughes .

"Fired: Sergeant Richard Evans, 46, was sacked today after being accused of having sex with a woman suspect in the cells . A police officer was sacked today after being accused of having sex with a woman suspect in the cells. Sergeant Richard Evans, 46, was dismissed by Gwent Police for 'disgraceful' sexual behaviour towards women in custody - and against his own colleagues in the police force. Evans, an officer with 25 years experience, denied having sex with women suspects and fondling their breasts and was cleared in a subsequent court case. But a police misconduct hearing today heard there were 41 complaints allegations against Sgt Evans - 32 of a sexual nature - and he was dismissed for gross misconduct. Evans was accused of kissing one woman in a police van before later having sex with her in the sluice room at the police station. One woman held in custody told how she was 'flattered' and boasted to her daughter: 'You're not going to believe it, but I s****** a policeman'. A second woman alleged he kissed and fondled her after she was arrested and taken to Ystrad Mynach police station near Caerphilly, South Wales. And a third woman said that while she was getting dressed he pulled a blanket off of her so he could see her breasts. He denied all charges and a jury found him not guilty of two counts of misconduct in public office and three counts of sexual assault. But Evans, of New Inn, near Pontypool, South Wales, faced an internal misconduct hearing by senior officers at Gwent Police who upheld 41 against him involving inappropriate sexual behaviour towards female detainees and colleagues. Deputy Chief Constable Craig Guildford said: 'Richard Evans' attitude and behaviour was disgraceful, he abused his authority when dealing with female colleagues and female detainees. 'He failed to treat them with courtesy and respect, and failed to have regard to the equality and diversity duty in the workplace. 'His immediate dismissal was the only appropriate course of action. 'The police officers, police staff members and members of the public who provided accounts and came to the hearing to give evidence demonstrated admirable courage, dignity and integrity.' During his trial in August last year a mother-of-three told a jury that Evans had a 'five minute fumble' with her after spending a night in cells sleeping off a drinking session. But Evans denied the misconduct on duty after being accused of having sex with her up against a sink in a sluice room in the cell block. The woman told the court: 'I just let it happen, I wanted it to happen. It was flattering - you've got a man in uniform and he fancies you. 'I felt a bit cocky - not everyone can say they've had an affair with a policeman.' The woman was taken to Ystrad Mynach police station in Caerphilly, South Wales when she was 'worse for drink'. Allegations: One of the complainants woman alleged he kissed and fondled her after she was arrested and taken to Ystrad Mynach police station near Caerphilly, South Wales, pictured . She was 'extremely' thirsty the next morning and asked Evans for a drink of water, the court heard. He allegedly took her into the sluice room, before shutting the door and having unprotected sex with her. The woman said: 'He put his arms around my waist and started kissing the back of my neck. Then he was undoing my jeans and pulling them done and then my underwear and we had sex. 'He had an orgasm then he pulled his trousers up and walked back up to the desk. He said nothing to me afterwards, like it was one of those things that had happen but so what? 'There was no feeling, it was just a quick bunk up and be done with it, there was no love. She said that when she was released home she told her daughter: 'You won't believe it but I just shagged a cop.' The woman told the court  she first met Evans in 2003 when he gave her a lift back home. He allegedly took her into the back of the van before kissing her and touching her breast. She claimed he was aroused and wanted to 'go further' - allegedly asking her for oral sex. A court heard that didn't report the kiss in 2003 or the sex in 2006. The allegations only emerged when Evans was investigated after allegedly sexually assault two other women at the police station. He denied misconduct in a public office and three charges of sexual assault and was cleared in August last year. IPCC Commissioner Jan Williams said: 'Sergeant Evans displayed wholly inappropriate behaviour towards both vulnerable female detainees while in custody, and to female colleagues, and I am pleased he is no longer able to abuse the position of trust he held. 'I give credit to Gwent Police for their diligent and determined investigation into his behaviour, and for reaching this fitting conclusion where he can no longer be a part of the police service. 'The dismissal should send a message to any police officer that the sort of behaviour shown by this sergeant is utterly unacceptable, and bring confidence to colleagues who witness anything like it to report their concerns.'","Sergeant Richard Evans, 46, accused of having sex with woman in cell .

"Newly elected Afghan President Ashraf Ghani admitted to his love of corned beef sandwiches from Katz's Deli in New York on Wednesday as he addressed Congress in Washington, D.C. at a formal dinner in his honor. 'I was another beneficiary of America’s wonderful generosity,' president Ghani said. 'I ate corned beef at Katz’s, New York’s greatest, greasiest, pickle-lined melting pot,' he added as the room erupted in unanimous laughter. Katz's, established in 1888, is the oldest delicatessen in New York City. Peaceful meeting: President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani  delivered an address to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday where he expressed his love for Katz's Deli in New York . The establishment is open daily staring at 8:00am and is open all night on Friday and Saturday. For 18.75 a patron can scoop up Ghani's favorite Corned Beef creation. 'Our secret ""dry cure"" pickling formula requires a full month to be ready to serve,' says Katz's website of the delicacy. 'The secret to finishing is to pace yourself,' adds the New York staple's page. Ghani also thanked Congress for slowly but surely helping to rebuild his country following the Afghanistan war in 2001. He expressed his gratitude for the millions of American tax dollars and vowed his war-wracked country will be self-reliant within this decade. 'We're not going to be the lazy Uncle Joe,' he said. President's favorite: 'I was another beneficiary of America’s wonderful generosity,' president Ghani said. 'I ate corned beef at Katz’s, New York’s greatest, greasiest, pickle-lined melting pot,' Ghani said on Wednesday . In a speech to a joint meeting of Congress, Ghani moved to mend U.S.-Afghan relations that were frayed under former President Hamid Karzai. Lawmakers have been critical about the lengthy U.S. troop presence in America's longest war, wasteful spending in Afghanistan and were stung by Karzai's anti-American rhetoric. Ghani humbly thanked Congress for the nearly $107 billion it has appropriated for Afghanistan so far. He paid homage to the 2,200 U.S. servicemen and -women who lost their lives in the war and the thousands more who were wounded, and thanked the U.S. aid workers who built schools, wells and cured the sick. 'At the end of the day, it is the ordinary Americans whose hard-earned taxes have over the years built the partnership that has led to our conversation today,' he said to applause in the House chamber packed with hundreds of lawmakers, dignitaries and guests. Ghani, wearing a gray western suit, peppered his speech with anecdotes about the time he's spent in America, noting that he graduated from Columbia University in New York and was in his World Bank office in Washington when the first plane smashed into the World Trade Center on 9/11. He touched on themes he hoped would convince lawmakers that he will be a reliable U.S. partner. Oldest Deli: Katz's, established in 1888, is the oldest delicatessen in New York City and is home to their famous corned beef sandwich . He admitted that decades of war have resulted in high levels of fraud and graft in Afghanistan and promised to eliminate corruption. Ghani also voiced support for women's rights and said he would emphasize law and justice and focus on self-reliance and economic development. 'We don't want your charity. We have no more interest in perpetuating a childish dependence than you have in being saddled with a poor family member who lacks the energy and drive to get out and find a job,' Ghani said. That's a tall order for Afghanistan. The national unity government that Ghani runs with chief executive Abdullah Abdullah has not yet seated a full cabinet, and some of the country's 30-plus provinces are still run by acting governors. The country recently had a $500 million budget shortfall and domestic revenues missed targets by 26 percent, forcing the U.S. to step in in recent months to help cover the fiscal gap. More than a third of Afghans live below the poverty line and the nation's vast mineral resources remain virtually untapped. Afghanistan also is not at peace, and Ghani's efforts to lure the Taliban to reconciliation talks have not yet been fruitful. Just hours before he spoke, at least six people were killed and more than 30 were wounded in a suicide car bombing near the presidential palace in Kabul. Ghani is untested as a leader, yet he received a warm reception from both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. The reason: He's not Karzai. Expressed Gratitude: Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani expresses his country's gratitude for America's fiscal commitment, military sacrifices, and last but not least corned beef from Katz's Deli . House Speaker John Boehner issued a statement after the speech calling Ghani a 'trusted partner.' And just before Ghani stepped from the chamber, he and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, embraced in a bear hug. Obama said the U.S. would leave its 9,800 troops in Afghanistan in place rather than downsizing to 5,500 by year's end. The size of the U.S. footprint for next year is still to be decided, Obama said, but he brushed aside any speculation the withdrawal will bleed into 2017. That means the slowdown won't jeopardize his commitment to end America's involvement in Afghanistan before leaving office. Obama slowed the pace of the withdrawal because of deficiencies in the Afghan security forces, heavy casualties in the ranks of the army and police, the need for the Ghani-Abdullah government to gain traction and fears that Islamic State fighters could gain a foothold in Afghanistan. Ghani said IS militants, also known as Daesh, pose a 'clear and present danger' to Afghanistan, and he challenged Muslim leaders and intellectuals who believe that Islam is a religion of tolerance and virtue to speak out against Islamic extremism. 'If al-Qaida was - with all due respect to Microsoft - Windows I, Daesh is Windows 5,' Ghani said. 'It's fast. It is brutal, but it is extraordinarily quick.' Ghani's speech drew much applause, but his appearance didn't create as much buzz in the Capitol as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did when he spoke to Congress earlier this month. Some Democrats skipped the Israeli leader's speech, in which he warned the U.S. that an emerging international agreement the U.S. was trying to reach with Tehran would pave Iran's path to developing nuclear weapons.","Newly elected Afghan President Ashraf Ghani admitted to his love of corned beef sandwiches from Katz's Deli in New York .

"Britain's FBI has launched its cybercrime 'strike week', arresting 57 suspected hackers in a series of 25 raids including a member of the notorious Lizard Squad. The 16-year-old from Leeds was held by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on suspicion of targeting approximately 350 websites. It is claimed he may be a member of the Lizard Squad hackers who say they brought down the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox Live networks as well as Facebook and Instagram. Scroll down for video . Arrest: A suspected malware developer in Aldbourne, Marlborough was taken into custody by the National Crime Agency as part of 57 nationwide arrests . Footage: Officers, who need to be muzzed to protect their identities, search a safe and take away computer equipment . The 16-year-old from Leeds was held by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on suspicion of targeting approximately 350 websites, and may be a member of the notorious Lizard Squad gang . The NCA also arrested 56 others for cybercrimes including stealing data, fraud and virus development across the UK. One suspect was held in connection with an alleged cyber attack on the United States Department of Defence (DoD) - and may have been a bitter Lizard Squad rival. The 23-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday  on suspicion of offences linked to data stolen from a messaging service used by DoD employees around the world. Contact information for around 800 people including name, title, e-mail addresses and phone numbers, as well as details for around 34,400 devices were obtained during the attack last June, the NCA said. Following the attack, the hacker posted screenshots taken from the dashboard used to control the database as well as a bizarre message on the text storage website Pastebin. It read: 'We smite the Lizards, LizardSquad your time is near. We're in your bases, we control your satellites. 'The missiles shall rein upon thy who claim alliance, watch your heads, ** T-47:59:59 until lift off. We're one, we're many, we lurk in the dark, we're everywhere and anywhere. 'Live Free Die Hard! DoD, DISA EMSS : Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services is not all, Department of Defense has no Defenses.' Campaign: NCA officers force their way in to another property during a string of raids they are calling 'strike week' Message: The NCA, considered Britain's FBI, has been working with counterparts from the Department of Defense in the United states . Lizard Squad's Facebook page after claiming it hacked Sony Playstation and Xbox . The Lizard Squad took credit for bringing down the Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation online networks, hitting users on Christmas Day. The hacking group said it wanted to expose the two firms' poor security. The consoles rely on an internet connection for many functions. One of the most popular features of the consoles, for example, is the ability to play against friends and other users. While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up. Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack. A message on the Xbox status page at the weekend said its core services were 'up and running'. Sony engineers then confirmed its core services were also back online, but heavy traffic might continue to cause problems, as thousands of users log back on. The stolen data was used as part of an international satellite message dissemination system known as Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services. It also included IMEI numbers, which are the unique codes used to identify a mobile device. No sensitive data was obtained and none of the data obtained could be used to personally identify anyone or threaten US national security, the NCA added. More than 40 arrests have been made this week by the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit at more than 20 separate locations across England, Wales and Scotland as part of a week of activity targeting cyber crime. Another man was held on suspicion of involvement in a 2012 hack on Yahoo. Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: 'Behind this week's activity is the message that all of us, as individuals, businesses or law enforcement agencies, have a role to play in making the UK a safe place to enjoy the huge opportunities provided by the internet. 'Awareness of the type of cyber crime dangers which are out there is vital, whoever you are, as is collaboration between organisations across different sectors, regions and countries to develop the most effective ways of combating those threats. 'We will continue to work with partners to pursue and disrupt the major crime groups targeting the UK, but also, crucially, to make the UK as difficult as possible a target for cyber criminals in the first place.' Jeffrey Thorpe, special agent in charge, at the US Department of Defence criminal investigative service (DCIS), said: 'This arrest underscores DCIS commitment and the joint ongoing efforts among international law enforcement to stop cyber criminals in their tracks. DCIS special agents will use every tool at their disposal to pursue and bring to justice those that attack the Department of Defence.' Revealed: Alleged hackers and cyber-criminals held in the UK . - 21-year-old man arrested on suspicion of a network intrusion attack committed by ‘D33Ds Company’ hacking group, which stole over 400,000 email addresses and passwords from Yahoo! and published them online in 2012. - 23-year old man arrested on suspicion of offences relating to a network intrusion in June 2014 on the US Department of Defence (DoD).

Lizard Squad is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective Anonymous and is described as 'vocal, taunting and bit obnoxious'. The group seeks to cause mayhem online 'for a laugh' and has called itself the 'next generation Grinch' after the children's character that hates Christmas, often using Twitter to boast of upcoming attacks. Some reports say it mainly operates from Russia but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world, communicating using the 'dark web'. Lizard Squad has a history of targeting computer game companies, particularly Sony. In August it sent a bomb threat to Sony chief executive John Smedley, the same month in which it attacked Playstation just to cause 'havoc'. Dan Holden, of online security company Arbor Networks, said: 'If they're coming after you, you're going to have a bad day.'

"Church treasurer Mark Conway-Wilcox (pictured) has admitted four counts of theft after stealing £20,000 from St Wilfrid's Church's renovation pot . A trusted church treasurer who stole £20,000 from a renovation pot to fund his gambling habit has narrowly avoided jail. Mark Conway-Wilcox, 30, of Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle, admitted four counts of theft after stealing from St Wilfrid's Church's - but claimed the amount he had taken was closer to £15,000. Yesterday he was branded 'unchristian' for leaving the Newcastle church on the brink of closure after stealing the money and blowing it on gambling. Newcastle Crown Court heard Conway-Wilcox also failed to pay various bills, had creditors chasing the church and even left it potentially uninsured. The court heard Conway-Wilcox became treasurer at St Wilfrid's in May 2013 and was responsible for making sure money was put in the bank and invoices were paid. After receiving complaints about unpaid bills Reverend Sarah Miller initially gave Conway-Wilcox the benefit of the doubt. But matters came to a head in May last year when Ecclesiastical Insurance rang up and told her they had not been paid and that the church and its contents were potentially uninsured. An investigation began and it was discovered Conway-Wilcox had transferred £10,098 from the church's refurbishment account into his own between November 2013 and May 2014. A further £550 had been moved from church bank accounts to his account and Conway-Wilcox failed to bank more than £10,000 in cheques. Prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw told the court the total amount misappropriated was £20,856.78. The church has since been paid back £10,000 by the insurance company. St Wilfrid's Church in Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle, was left in danger of closure after Conway-Wilcox failed to pay various bills, had creditors chasing the church and even left it potentially uninsured . Paul Caulfield, defending, told the court: 'He had a horrendous gambling problem, referred himself for help and has attended 20 sessions. 'Since this matter came to light he has not been involved in gambling. 'He is mortified by his conduct and apologises publicly, having apologised privately previously.' Recorder Nicholas Lumley QC told Conway-Wilcox: 'This church serves one of this great city's less fortunate areas and it has a small but committed congregation. 'The church, its fabric and its good work was placed in jeopardy by you. 'And why? Well, because of your greed. You saw them as a soft target and a ready source of cash for your own frailties and you plundered what money they had. 'You took advantage of your position of trust by stealing from various bank accounts and when it was queried you stalled, prevaricated and lied. 'Not only is it unchristian it is thoroughly dishonest.' Newcastle Crown Court heard Conway-Wilcox left the Newcastle church on the brink of closure . Martin Sheppard, of the Diocese of Newcastle, said: 'It's been a very sad story for Martin, for his family and the church family at Newbiggin Hall. It's been a very difficult time for the congregation. 'We don't understand why he did what he did. Everyone feels great sorrow and regret. 'As I understand it, the money that was taken was money that people had been collecting for the renovation work for a church hall facility in the Newbiggin Hall area. 'The money was collected by faithful members of the church and now they have been set back in their project to serve the community where they live,work and worship.' Conway-Wilcox was handed an eight month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £5,000 compensation to St Wilfrid's.","Treasurer Mark Conway-Wilcox, 30, stole £20,000 to fund gambling habit .

"In the much-loved Road Runner cartoons, it seemed that anything was possible – but the mayhem on the screen was born from writers that had incredibly strict rules to abide by. A former animator for Warner Brothers, which made the show, revealed in his autobiography that there were nine rules every cartoon had to follow. The star of each one was the Road Runner and his nemesis - Wile E. Coyote. A desert predator obsessed with catching and eating the Road Runner, he often used a bewildering and hilarious array of contraptions to snare his quarry. Scroll down for video . In the much-loved Road Runner cartoons, it seemed that anything was possible – but the mayhem on the screen was born writers that had incredibly strict rules to abide by . Rules included the Road Runner never being able to harm the coyote, except by saying ‘beep beep’, 'no dialogue', and ‘all materials, tools, weapons, or mechanical conveniences must be obtained from the ACME corporation’. The writers also had to try and ‘make gravity the coyote's greatest enemy’ and ensure that he ‘is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures’. The rules come from the 1999 autobiography of former Looney Tunes animator Chuck Jones, called Chuck Amuck: The Life And Times Of An Animated Cartoonist. The star of each show was the Road Runner and his nemesis - Wile E. Coyote. A desert predator obsessed with catching and eating the Road Runner, often using a bewildering and hilarious array of contraptions . They were posted on Twitter by director Amos Posner and have since generated considerable excitement on social media. One Reddit thread has been dedicated to a discussion about the rules, and whether they have ever been broken. One rule – ‘the road runner must stay on the road, otherwise, logically, he would not be called road runner’ – was broken many times, with the creature often appearing on rocky outcrops and once even pushing coyote along as he drives a speedboat. The cartoon first appeared in 1948, with 48 made altogether, along with one half-hour special. The Road Runner cannot harm the coyote except by going 'beep-beep!'

"Vladimir Putin honoured the man Scotland Yard believes poisoned dissident Alexander Litvinenko (pictured) with polonium in London . Vladimir Putin yesterday honoured the man Scotland Yard believes poisoned dissident Alexander Litvinenko with polonium in London. Andrey Lugovoy, 48, was given a medal for 'services to the motherland' as the UK holds a public inquiry into the 2006 killing of Mr Litvinenko. Putin had blocked the extradition of Lugovoy, a former secret-service operative who is now an MP with the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party. The Russian president also gave the Order of Honour to Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya. The award came as Kadyrov admitted knowing the man who has confessed to killing Putin critic Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. Kadyrov appeared to defend the suspect Zaur Dadayev by calling him a 'true patriot' and a 'deeply religious man'. Opposition politician Ilya Yashin said Putin was sending a signal: 'These are my people, do not touch them.' Kadyrov received his state award for 'work achievements, strenuous social activities and long conscientious service', but it comes amid claims that even some senior Russian officials are worried about the sway held by the Chechen. Lugovoy holds the post of deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's security and anti-corruption committee. He is chief suspect in the murder of former secret agent Mr Litvinenko, who from his death bed accused Putin of ordering his killing. Putin revealed yesterday that he held an all-night conclave of his defence and secret services cardinals ahead of his order last year to restore Crimea to Russia. In a trailer for a new TV documentary, he admitted calling his security chiefs to the Kremlin for a secret meeting to order them to save the life of deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Andrey Lugovoy (pictured), 48, was given a medal for 'services to the motherland' as the UK holds a public inquiry into the 2006 killing of Mr Litvinenko . The Russians allege the West was complicit in the toppling of pro-Moscow Yanukovych so threatening Russia's national security. 'I invited the leaders of our special services and the defence ministry to the Kremlin and set them the task of saving the life of the president of Ukraine, who would simply have been liquidated,' said Putin. 'We finished about seven in the morning. When we were parting, I told all my colleagues, ""We are forced to begin the work to bring Crimea back into Russia"".'","Russia honours the man believed to have poisoned Alexander Litvinenko .

"The Conservatives have moved into their strongest poll position for almost five years. As David Cameron prepares to go to Buckingham Palace to mark the formal start of the general election campaign, ending the long phoney war between the political parties, an exclusive ComRes poll for the Daily Mail and ITV News shows the Tories have opened up a four-point lead over Labour. Tory jitters about the party's campaign will be eased by the survey, which suggests Labour has slipped back since last week's bruising TV encounter between the two main party leaders and interviewer Jeremy Paxman. Scroll down for video . The poll puts the Conservatives up one point on last week with 36 per cent - the first time since February 2012 that they have recorded the same share of the vote they got at the last election - ahead of Labour on 32 per cent, down three points. It is their best vote share since George Osborne's so-called 'omnishambles' Budget, which included taxes on hot pasties and caravans, which prompted a Tory slump. The party has to reach even further back - to September 2010 - for the last time it enjoyed a four-point lead with ComRes. Ukip is on 12 per cent, well down on last year's peak of 19 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats showing signs of a modest recovery, on nine per cent. The Greens have slipped back to five per cent. The poll is the mirror image of a YouGov survey over the weekend, which put Labour on 36 per cent and the Tories on 32 per cent. An Opinium poll, meanwhile, yesterday put the Tories ahead, on 34 per cent to Labour's 33 per cent. Tbe ComRes poll finds Mr Cameron has extended his lead over Mr Miliband over which of them is best suited to lead the country . An exclusive ComRes poll for the Daily Mail and ITV news puts David Cameron and the Conservatives up one point on last week with 36 per cent, while Ed Miliband's Labour is on 32 per cent, down three points . The survey comes after last week's bruising TV encounter between the two main party leaders and interviewer Jeremy Paxman (pictured) Following Thursday’s television grilling by Mr Paxman, half of all adults in Britain think Mr Cameron would make a better Prime Minister -- 50 per cent -- compared to three in ten -- 29 per cent -- who back Mr Miliband. This represents a fall of four points for the Labour leader on the last ComRes poll, conducted last week before the TV clash. Incredibly, 18 per cent of Labour voters think that Mr Cameron would make a better Prime Minister than Mr Miliband, suggesting even some of his party's own supporters are unconvinced. This compares to just one per cent of Conservative voters who think that Mr Miliband would be the better Prime Minister. With a seven-way television debate, featuring Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and the leaders of the Liberal Democrats, Ukip, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens looming this Thursday, voters are around twice as likely to associate Mr Cameron than Mr Miliband with being 'good on television', by 64 per cent to 31 per cent. Just 29 per cent back Mr Miliband as Prime Minister, which represents a fall of four points for the Labour leader on the last ComRes poll, which was conducted last week before the TV clash . Mr Cameron also has a big lead on which of the two is considered a strong leader, with 60 per cent of voters choosing him versus 33 per cent for Mr Miliband. However, it is not all good news for Mr Cameron: he is significantly more likely to be viewed as arrogant than Mr Miliband, by 52 per cent to 35 per cent. The Labour leader has narrower leads on which of the two is seen as more genuine and understanding of the real world. When given a straight choice between a Labour-led government and a Conservative-led government after the next election, the poll finds voters' preference is too close to call, with 41 per cent wanting the former and 42 per cent the latter. However, in the event of a hung Parliament, there is a clear preference for the current coalition to continue. Presented with a decision between a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition and a Labour–SNP arrangement, 45 per cent of voters say that they would prefer the Con-Lib option, compared to just 33 per cent who prefer Lab-SNP. Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said:'It is too soon to attribute any movement in the polls to the Paxman effect. While this is bound to be a volatile election with both Labour and the Conservatives running each other close, the longer term trends points towards the Conservatives beginning to dig in and strengthen their position. 'Cameron’s ratings as a strong leader will serve him well through the coming seven-way debate as the challengers attempt to bring him down.'","Tories are up one point  with 36%, while Labour is down three points to 32% .

"Wayne Rooney celebrated a goal with a boxing routine as the England captain made light  of reportedly being knocked out in his own kitchen by a former team mate. Pictures emerged on Saturday night appearing to show the Manchester United player being floored during a playfight in his £3.5million home with Stoke City defender Phil Bardsley. After scoring the third goal in the Reds' match against Tottenham Hotspur yesterday, Rooney poked fun at the incident when he scored, celebrating by throwing fake punches before falling to the ground. Wayne Rooney celebrated a goal with a boxing routine as the England captain made light of being knocked out in his own kitchen by a former team mate . Rooney falls backwards to the Old Trafford turf, mocking pictures reportedly showing him being knocked out in his kitchen, as Ashley Young laughs in the background . Pictures emerged last night showing the striker wearing boxing gloves as he and Bardsley - a former Manchester United player - went up against each other in a bout. During the jovial night-in last month at his Cheshire mansion, Rooney found himself on the receiving end of a heavy punch. The England player was said to have been visibly shaken by the blow during the incident and footage appeared to show him falling backwards after being struck. Although the England forward could face a grilling from Manchester United chiefs, who are said to pay the striker £300,000 per week, Rooney seemed to be treating the incident as nothing more than a bit of light-hearted fun. After scoring the third goal in yesterday's match in Manchester, Rooney ran to the crowd before pumping his fists. He then closed his eyes before falling backwards to the Old Trafford turf. After scoring the third goal in the Reds' match against Tottenham Hotspur yesterday afternoon, Rooney threw fake punches before falling to the ground . Even referee Mark Clattenburg appeared to see the funny side of the Manchester United and England striker's celebration . Speaking of the kitchen playfight, a source told The Sun: 'Wayne had everybody worried when he hit the floor like that. He made such a thud when he went down and he was just on his back with his eyes closed, not moving. Rooney was playfighting with Phil Bardsley, who plays for Stoke City . 'People were scared he had really banged his head and done some lasting damage. Everybody realised it was a stupid thing to do, but they just got carried away.' The incident is said to have come the day after United suffered defeat at Swansea, while his wife Coleen and their children Kai and Klay were on holiday in Barbados. The clip is said to last around a minute and shows pair trading blows and friends laugh and joke. According to the Sun, the pair's bout intensifies before Bardsley delivers the knockout punch, which leaves Rooney lying flat out on the kitchen floor. The incident could leave Rooney with some uncomfortable questions to answer from Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal. Mr van Gaal is unlikely to be impressed with the 29-year-old for partaking in such dangerous activities prior to matches and training. This is due to most footballers having clauses in their contracts banning them from taking part in certain activities to prevent the risk of them being injured. Bardsley is a former team-mate of Rooney's with the pair having played together at Manchester United before the Scotland international left and signed for Sunderland in 2008. He moved to Stoke City last year and his wife Tanya has also recently found fame, starring in ITV reality show The Real Housewives of Cheshire. Mrs Bardsley, 33, said the video was just a joke. ‘Clever edit’: Phil Bardsley’s 33-year-old wife Tanya said on Twitter yesterday that the video was just a joke . Reality star: Mrs Bardsley has recently found fame, starring in ITV show The Real Housewives of Cheshire . She claimed on Twitter that the clip was a ‘clever edit’, adding: ‘Two mates having a laugh - video doesn't show Wayne jumping up and laughing with Phil.’ Rooney comes from a big boxing background and is often photographed at ringside during high-profile bouts. Speaking seven years ago, Rooney said his boxing training as a youngster helped his football career. 'I think my boxing training was beneficial in my development as a footballer, especially breaking through to the Premier League at such a young age,' he said in 2008. Wayne Rooney, a big boxing fan, posted this picture on his Instagram with professional boxer Paul Smith Jnr . The incident happened at his £3.5million home while his wife Coleen, pictured, was on holiday in Barbados with their children . 'I needed that extra bit of strength that the boxing training had given me. It made it easier to play than it might have been and it's helped me with the way my game is now. 'All through my life - from the ages of six, seven and eight - when big fights were on television, I used to stay up with my dad to watch them. 'I've always loved watching boxing and I went boxing training for about three or four years when I was younger. It's a sport I've always been involved in. 'I was doing both boxing and football training at one stage when I was about 15. But Everton, who I was with at the time, said I had to concentrate on one of them - and I opted for football.'","Wayne Rooney made light of boxing controversy with a goal celebration .

"A spectator has been killed during a horror crash at the infamous Nurburgring circuit in Germany after a British racing driver's car flipped over the safety barrier and into the crowd. Driver Jann Mardenborough was cresting a hill in the northern part of the track when the car flipped upright, travelling 100ft before slamming into a barrier, sending it spinning into the air. It cleared the 12ft wire mesh surrounding the circuit and landed in the crowd, fatally injuring one spectator, who has yet to be identified. Scroll down for video . A spectator was tragically killed at the Nurburgring in Germany today after a British racing driver's car flipped over on the crest of a hill before plouging into a safety barrier . The racing Nissan travelled 100ft with its nose pointing into the air before hitting a crash barrier, sending it flipping over the protective fencing and into the spectator area . The Nurburgring is notorious for driver fatalities as most of its corners are blind and there is no run-off area, meaning most cars are only stopped when they crash into something . Following the crash the race was abandoned, and officials are now investigating what caused the car to flip . Mardenborough is a 23-year-old who is currently competing in the  World Endurance Championship . The Nurburgring is well known for its fatal crashes, with track regulars estimating that anywhere between three and 12 people a year die on the 12.9 mile Nordschleife, or 'Northern Loop' section. As of 2010 a total of 68 professional drivers had been recorded as killed on the track, with many more dying on popular open days during which members of the public are invited to drive the circuit. A vast majority of the corners are blind, often involve hills, and have few run-off areas, meaning drivers are usually stopped only when they hit crash barriers. Part of the track was used to hold Formula 1 races until 1976 when Niki Lauda was left in critical condition following a crash which saw his car burst into flames before being hit by two other drivers. The track also has several sections in which spectators are allowed close to the track. Despite this, accidents involving fans are rare, though exact figures are not widely available. Jann Mardenborough was competing in the VLN1 event  when his Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3 flipped up in the air as it crested a rise in the circuit. A VLN statement read: 'The opening round of the VLN Endurance Championship at the Nurburgring was marred by an accident on Saturday which injured several spectators. While there are no official figures on deaths at the Nurburgring, track regulars estimate the between three and 12 people die there every year . From the time the track opened until 2010, 68 racing drivers have died there during events. Part of the track was used for Formula 1 racing, until Nikki Lauda was nearly killed during a crash there in 1976 . 'One of the spectators died, despite the immediate actions of the rescue crew in the medical centre at the circuit. The other injured spectators have been taken to hospital for ongoing medical care. 'The race was stopped to give emergency crew quick access to the circuit, and wasn't restarted. 'The accident occurred in the Flugplatz part of the circuit, with a competitor leaving the circuit for a yet unspecified reason and finishing up behind the safety fencing. 'The VLN and the organisers are deeply saddened by the accident, and their thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims.' Mardenborough emerged from the car seemingly unscathed, although has since been taken to a local hospital for routine checks following an initial examination at the circuit medical centre. A statement from Nissan read: 'Today's events have been a tragedy. 'We are all deeply shocked and saddened by these events and our immediate thoughts go to the deceased, those injured and their families and friends. Following the crash, which left debris scattered throughout the viewing area, Mardenborough was taken to hospital for routine checks, but is believed to be unhurt . Mardenborough is seen leaving the car after his terrifying collision in Germany . 'The team is fully co-operating with the race organisers to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into this incident.' Mardenborough is renowned for his epic rise into motor racing just four years after winning Nissan's 'gamer-to-racer' project. In 2011, the 23-year-old from Cardiff won the GT Academy, a scheme run by Nissan and Sony that turns armchair gamers into professional racers. Over the past few years Mardenborough, son of former professional footballer Steve, who played for Wolves, Coventry, Cardiff and Darlington, has competed in sportscars and single-seaters. Mardenborough in action at Brands Hatch last August while racing in the  British GT Championship . In mid-February, Nissan confirmed Mardenborough would take part in a full season of the World Endurance Championship, which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3 car has a top speed of around 200mph and can go from 0-60mph in under three seconds. The Nurburgring was also the scene of three-time Formula One world champion Niki Lauda's crash during the 1976 German Grand Prix when his Ferrari burst into flames after hitting a barricade.","Horror rash at Nurburgring during endurance race kills one spectator .

"A second suspect is facing the death penalty after being arrested in connection to the February 12 shooting that left mother-of-four Tammy Meyers dead . Police arrested Derrick Andrews, 26, on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, and charged him with murder, attempted murder, firing a weapon from a vehicle and conspiracy. Erich Milton Nowsch Jr, 19, is now facing the same charges following his arrest last month. Scroll down for video . Derrick Andrews (left) and Erich Milton Nowsch Jr (right) have been charged with murder, attempted murder, firing a weapon from a vehicle and conspiracy after their alleged involvement in a shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada . Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers was shot during what police thought was a road-rage incident on February 12 . Prosecutors allege Nowsch fired the shots from a vehicle while Andrews was at the wheel. Andrews' arrest came about an hour after he was named with Nowsch in an indictment. The trial is scheduled for May 26 and the defendants could get the death penalty or life in prison if convicted. District Attorney Steve Wolfson said: 'If you're a getaway driver, aiding and abetting another to commit a crime, you're equally guilty,' Nowsch pleaded not guilty on March 12 to the murder, attempted murder and weapon charges during an appearance at Clark County District Court. He is expected to plead not guilty to the conspiracy charge. The conspiracy charge stems from allegations that Andrews and Nowsch tried to erase their cellphone records to prevent police from linking them to the shooting. The 44-year-old (left) was hit in the head by a bullet and she died at a hospital two days later on Valentine's Day . Andrews is accused of positioning his car so Nowsch could unload what Prosecutor David Stanton said police now believe to have been 24 shots at Meyers and her son Brandon. One bullet struck  Meyers in the head and she died at a hospital two days later on Valentine's Day. Stanton characterized Nowsch as a neighborhood marijuana and anxiety medication dealer who hung out at a park where he encountered schoolchildren and sometimes Meyers. Las Vegas defense lawyer Martin Hart said he had spoken with Andrews in recent days but hadn't been hired to defend him. Hart said he might be appointed to the case when Andrews and Nowsch appear for arraignment next Thursday. He declined to comment on the case or the indictment. Nowsch's attorney, Augustus Claus, declined to comment about the indictment or the arrest of Andrews. Prosecutors allege Nowsch fired 24 shots from a vehicle at Meyers and her son while Andrews was at the wheel . Police initially suspected Meyers was shot in a road rage incident. But days later, investigators revealed she had enlisted her adult son and his gun for a late-night prowl to confront a driver who threatened her on the way home from a mother-daughter driving lesson in a school parking lot. In obtaining a no-bail warrant for Andrews' arrest, Stanton told Clark County District Court Judge Linda Marie Bell that Andrews responded in his silver Audi to a phone call from Nowsch. Nowsch feared that a green Buick Park Avenue sedan with tinted windows driving slowly back and forth in a nearby school parking lot was following him, Stanton said. The prosecutor said: 'He believed the people in the car meant to do him harm.' He said it was a coincidence that Meyers' 15-year-old daughter Kristal was practicing driving in the lot. February 13 - Las Vegas police reveal a mother-of-four is shot during an alleged road rage incident. She was later identified as Tammy Meyers. She was teaching her 15-year-old daughter Kristal to drive at the time. February 15 - Her devastated husband, Robert Meyers, vows to find whoever did this to his wife. He turned off her life support after she failed to recover from her injuries sustained in the incident on Valentine's Day. February 16 -  CCTV of the incident is released by police as they hunt for the alleged killer and his accomplice. Police also disclose a sketch of the suspect and say he is 6ft, mid 20s and 180lbs. February 18 - Questions are raised over whether Nowsch acted in self-defense amid claims Mrs Meyers drove back to her home, dropped her daughter off, grabbed her son Brandon and hunted down the car in question. In response, Mr Meyers insists his son is a hero and not a vigilante. February 19 - Following a tense stand-off with police Eric Nowsch is arrested. Mr Meyers claims he knew the suspect and said he knew the kid was bad. After the incident he claimed he wasn't aware who shot his wife. Added that his wife consoled the youngsters for hours and tried to teach him how to be a man. February 23 - Nowsch is arraigned on murder charges in Las Vegas. March 12 - Nowsch pleads not guilty to murder, attempted murder and weapon charges during an appearance at Clark County District Court. March 20 - Prosecutors unveil an indictment which names Derrick Andrews and Nowsch. It charges them both with murder, attempted murder, firing a weapon from a vehicle and conspiracy. Andrews is arrested an hour later. The prosecutor has characterized Nowsch as a neighborhood marijuana and anxiety medication dealer . The coincidences mounted when the mother and daughter were driving home and encountered an angry driver in a silver vehicle who blocked their path, got out of his vehicle, and, according to Kristal, threatened them. Frightened, Meyers dropped Kristal off at home and instructed her 22-year-old son to come with her to find that driver, Stanton said. The prosecutor said the mother and son encountered Nowsch and Andrews in Andrews' silver sedan. Stanton said the cars Meyers encountered that night were similar in color and design but 'from the evidence presented, Mrs. Meyers was mistaken'","Derrick Andrews arrested Friday in connection to February 12 shooting .

According to media representatives in Tikrit, the Shiite militias chanted slogans as they stood over the ISIS fighters body in the back of the pick-up truck. The photographs emerged as it was revealed the US-led coalition would begin offering air support to the Iraqi Army and their allied Iran-supported Shiite militias at the request of Iraq's government. The unnamed official refused to say whether the air support extended to airstrikes and bombing raids on Islamic State targets in central Iraq. The U.S. has previously said the Iraqi government did not ask them to participate in the campaign. This morning the foreign ministers of Syria and Iraq met in the Syrian capital Damascus to discuss ways to tackle militant groups operating in their countries. Iraq also called for greater international cooperation to combat the violence, Syrian state TV said. Removal: Members of the Iraqi security forces take the dead body of an Islamic State fighter for burial after overnight clashes in Tikrit, 80 miles north of the capital Baghdad . Taken away: According to media representatives in Tikrit, the Shiite militias chanted slogans as they stood over the ISIS fighters body in the back of the pick-up truck . Iraq's Shiite-led government in Baghdad, together with Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, have been important allies for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Shiite militias have fought on Assad's side against the insurgency spearheaded by Sunni Islamists. Iraq's armed forces are also the main partner on the ground for a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State militants in Iraq but Washington and other Western governments have dismissed the idea of cooperating directly with Syria in the same fight. This morning's high-level discussions 'focused on the fight against terrorism and common dangers that threaten our countries,' Syrian state television said, citing a joint news conference by the foreign ministers at Damascus airport. It did not specify which groups the discussions were referring to. Talks: This morning the foreign minister of Syria, Walid al-Moallem (left), and the foreign minister of Iraq, Ibrahim al-Jaafari (right), met in the Syrian capital of Damascus to discuss ways to tackle militant groups . United: This morning's high-level discussions between the foreign ministers of Syria and Iraq 'focused on the fight against terrorism and common dangers that threaten our countries,' Syrian state television said . Iraq has acted as a go-between for information about the U.S.-led strikes on ISIS in both countries. Iraq's Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari is also due to meet Assad himself, Jaafari's office said today. Jaafari's visit comes ahead of an Arab League meeting in Egypt scheduled for the weekend. Syria's seat has been left vacant since its membership was suspended in November 2011 after the government's crackdown on protests. 'Terrorism is not just a danger that faces both countries but one that will affect all countries if there is not cooperation,' Jaafari said, according to Syria's state news channel. His Syrian counterpart Walid al-Moualem said the two countries 'stand in the same trench against terrorism,' state news agency SANA said. In September Iraq's national security adviser briefed Assad on efforts to counter Islamic State, in the first such meeting since the United States launched air strikes on the group in Iraq. Territory held by Islamic State in Syria includes most of Deir al-Zor province, which borders Iraq.","Shiite militias celebrated jihadi's death by waving assault rifles in the air .

"They are known as some of nature's most reclusive predators, and it seems this owl was keen to live up to that reputation when it was spotted by a photographer in a park in the Czech Republic. Peeking out from behind a tree, the huge bird of prey appeared to play hide and seek with senior engineer and photographer Jiri Michal as he tried to capture it on film. The amusing game of peek-a-boo took place in Vysoka, a small village in the country's hilly east, while the seven-year-old male owl was out hunting. Surprise: A great grey owl pokes it head out from behind a tree as Jiri Michal, 34, a senior engineer and photographer, captures the bird of prey on film . Playing games: Mr Michal, who spent three hours trying to photograph owls before spotting this one, said he wasn't sure what the bird was doing, but it appeared to be playing a game with him . Mr Michal, 34, of Pilsen, Czech Republic, said: 'I wasn't sure what this mischievous owl was doing, however it kept poking its head out from behind this tree as if it was playing a game with me. 'Owls are definitely my favourite birds. They have amazing eyes and are always pleasure to photograph.' Mr Michal said he had been photographing the birds for three hours when he spotted this one roughly 20ft away. He added: 'This owl was not in the mood to play for too long, and straight after I took these pictures he flew off. 'I'm forever thinking up new ideas for what to photograph and I love nature as a whole. From the smallest insects to the larger birds and mammals, they must all be protected.' The great grey owl is the largest species of owl, measuring up to two and a half feet in length, and lives in northern America, Canada, and northern Europe. Despite owl's reputation as night hunters, great grey owls often seek out prey during the day, perching high in branches and using their excellent hearing and eyesight to track down prey. Now you see me: The great grey owl is the largest species of owl, measuring up to two and a half feet in length. Despite the animal's reputation for being nocturnal, this species often hunts during the day . Youngster: Mr Michal believes the owl was a male, and was around seven years old, making it relatively young. Captive birds have been known to live up to 27 years old . Their large face, and two disc-shaped plumes of feathers around their eyes, act as satellite dishes, filtering sound into two highly sensitive ears under the feathers. Their hearing is so acute that, during the winter months, the owls often hunt by swooping low over snow drifts, listening for the sound of voles or gophers moving around underneath. Their large, soft feathers and slow, deep wingbeats mean they are nearly silent as they move, so as not to scare their prey away. Once they have locked on to a target underneath the snow, they will use their sharp talons to plunge through the ice and drag their meal out. While the birds are not migratory, they will roam for miles around their usual hunting grounds if prey becomes scarce.","Jiri Michal, 34, spotted owl while walking in park in west Czech Republic .

"A 19-year-old man has been charged with murder and aggravated assault in Philadelphia stabbings that killed his mother and left his grandmother clinging to life, after what neighbors have described as years of mistreatment. Zachary Pritchett was arrested following the deadly incident early Friday at a home in the Bridesburg section of the city. A police spokeswoman said officers responded to the home shortly after 6am Friday and found 53-year-old Melizza Wiley dead of multiple stab wounds to the face, neck and upper torso. Scroll down for video . Crime scene: Zachary Pritchett, 19, was arrested following the deadly incident early Friday at a home in the Bridesburg section of Philadelphia . House of horrors: Officers who responded to the family's residence found deplorable conditions inside, including no running water, no cooking gas and human feces smeared on the floor . Pritchett's 73-year-old grandmother, Joan Wiley, was taken to Aria Torresdale Hospital in critical but stable condition. Police said Pritchett, who suffered a laceration to his hand, initially blamed the attack on three unknown men in hooded sweatshirts who he claimed had broken into their home, reported Fox29, but his version of events did not add up. According to the family's neighbors, the 19-year-old was very troubled and the violent domestic attack was years in the making. Area resident Kelly McGrath told 6ABC Melizza Wiley seldom allowed her son out of the house, and most nights he could be heard screaming from the back room. Another neighbor, Stephanie Carbonaro, said on the eve of the killing, she and her house guests overheard Zachary Pritchett screaming at someone in the house, 'Please, leave me alone. Don't do this. Let go.' Officers who responded to the family's residence found deplorable conditions inside, including no running water, no cooking gas and human feces smeared on the floor. Throughout the day Saturday, investigators were seen coming in and out of the house wearing full protective gear and surgical masks. Melizza Wiley died after sustaining multiple stab wounds to the face, neck and upper torso, while her mother was critically wounded. Neighbors say the attack was years in the making . Melizza Wiley was found stabbed in the living room and was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.27am. Joan Wiley was discovered wounded in a hospital-type bed. Police said they have a history with the family and have responded to the home no fewer than a dozen times within the past year alone. Neighbors said they have contacted the Department of Human Services multiple times because they were concerned for Zachary Pritchett’s welfare. Kelly McGrath also reached out to the local school board to inquire about the 19-year-old’s education because Melizza Wiley was supposed to be home-schooling her son, but the neighbor was convinced she was not doing it.","Zachary Pritchett, 19, charged with murder and aggravated assault .

"New pictures have emerged which show the devastation caused by Cyclone Pam after it tore through Vanuatu destroying towns and villages and killing at least six people.. The country's president, Baldwin Lonsdale, has estimated the cyclone, which struck on Saturday, has destroyed or damaged 90 per cent of the buildings in the capital of Port Vila. An RAF plane carrying aid has flown out today to help relief efforts following the devastating tropical cyclone which has wiped out much of the island nation which is in the South Pacific . Scroll down for video . Cyclone Pam has destroyed or damaged 90 per cent of the buildings in Vanuatu's capital of Port Vila . This photo taken today shows the widespread devastation caused by the cyclone which struck on Saturday . This aerial picture shows the trees which were uprooted on cyclone-ravaged Vanuatu . Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 people spread over 65 islands. About 47,000 people live in the capital. Structural damage across Port Vila is extensive with the majority of homes severely damaged or destroyed. With power lines and phone circuits down, officials have no way of knowing the scope of the damage and injuries on the hard-hit outer islands. Hannington Alatoa, head of the Vanuatu Red Cross Society, said flyovers by New Zealand and Australian relief teams showed much of the country had been 'flattened.'

'No trees, no foliage, no iron structures standing on the western part of Tanna (island),' Alatoa said. 'People are in great need of water.' The archipelago found itself in the path of the category five storm after it unexpectedly changed direction. The RAF package, containing 1,640 shelter kits and 1,900 solar lanterns with phone chargers, comes after the UK Government announced a £2m donation towards UN humanitarian aid efforts. A C-17 transport plane flew out from RAF Brize Norton this morning bound for the Royal Australian Air Force base at Amberley, Australia, before linking up with international agencies. A humanitarian expert from the Department for International Development has also been deployed to offer advice and assistance on field assessments, while the RAF crew will carry out support flights over several days.

I term it as a monster, a monster. It's a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu. After all the development that has taken place, all this development has been wiped out.' 'So it means we will have to start anew again.' In Port Vila smashed boats litter the harbour and sodden piles of household belongings are tangled among twisted tree branches where homes once stood. Many of the city's residents are spending today clearing away downed trees and cleaning up what was left of their houses. UNICEF spokeswoman Alice Clements said access to food and water is an urgent concern. Much of the city's water supply has been tainted, so many residents are boiling water to drink. Residents contend with storm damage in Mele village as they begin the clean up operation . Many boats were damaged and destroyed by the cyclone, with some flung on to Port Vila's harbour .

She said she spoke to a woman who is nine months pregnant and lost her home in the storm. The woman's situation, along with many others, is growing desperate, Clements said. 'She has no water, no food, no power,' she said. 'This is an incredibly dangerous time.' The UK's International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'The terrible effects of Cyclone Pam are now clear and many people are in urgent need of relief. 'The Royal Air Force's swift and invaluable support will ensure victims of the cyclone get the help they need to start putting their lives back together. 'Families' homes have been destroyed and power supplies are down. Our emergency shelter kits and solar lanterns will help meet people's basic needs and Britain stands ready to assist further.' Paolo Malatu, coordinator for the National Disaster Management Office, said 'The damage to homes and infrastructure is severe,' he said. 'The priority at the moment is to get people water, food and shelter.' He said there was major damage to many government buildings, and bridges were down outside the capital, making travel by vehicle impossible even around the main island of Efate. UNICEF has estimated that 54,000 children are among those affected by the cyclone. The small island nation, located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, has repeatedly warned it is already suffering devastating effects from climate change with the island's coastal areas being washed away, forcing resettlement to higher ground and smaller yields on traditional crops. The cyclone has already caused damage to other Pacific islands, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands. Some homes were evacuated in New Zealand Monday to escape flooding as the weakening storm moved past the North Island's East Cape region.

A C-17 Globemaster leaves RAAF Base Amberley bound for Vanuatu to assist in disaster relief efforts . Dr Steven Godby, an expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'Vanuatu highlights the vulnerability of people living in isolated regions to natural hazards. 'Cyclone Pam is the largest storm to impact the islands since Cyclone Eric in 1985 and a World Bank report in 2006 highlighted that in years when a disaster struck, economic losses in Vanuatu averaged 30 per cent of their GDP. 'The largest challenge facing aid efforts will be the relative inaccessibility of the islands and the damage caused to the infrastructure by the incredibly high winds. 'So far, reports of fatalities and damage are incomplete because of the lack of communications with outer islands in the archipelago. 'The logistical challenges will be significant, particularly in terms of communications, transportation and needs assessments.'","Cyclone Pam has battered the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu .

"Wild cats could be introduced into the UK countryside for the first time in 1,300 years, it emerged yesterday. Experts want to release lynx, which prey mainly on deer, into woodland in Norfolk, Cumbria and Aberdeenshire as part of an ambitious ‘rewilding’ scheme. Although the animals would be introduced onto privately owned estates, the woodland would be unfenced, meaning the 70lb animals could roam free around the countryside. Lynx could be introduced into the UK countryside for the first time in 1,300 years, it emerged yesterday . Scientists argue that introducing lynx will benefit the ecosystem, by helping control the 1million UK deer population, as well as boosting the tourist economy. But the move is controversial and likely to be opposed by farmers worried about the animals savaging their livestock and game birds. Under the plan, devised by the Lynx Trust, four to six cats would be released at each site. Around the size of a large dog and with powerful claws for climbing, they will be released into areas rich in deer and trees and each will wear a tracking device so their movements can be monitored. Experts want to release lynx, which prey mainly on deer, into woodland in Norfolk, Cumbria and Aberdeenshire as part of a ‘rewilding’ scheme . The Trust said it would be launching a public consultation this week, before applying to the Government via Natural England and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) for formal permission. Paul O’Donoghue, a science adviser to the Lynx Trust, said: ‘The lynx is a magical animal that last roamed Great Britain [at least] 1,300 years ago. ‘It is one of the most beautiful cats on the planet and its absence makes Britain a poorer place.’ But a spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union said money could be better spent elsewhere. ‘We would be concerned about the reintroduction due to its high cost and failure risk,’ he said. ‘We believe budgets are better focused on developing existing biodiversity.’ While Ron Macdonald, policy director of SNH, who would have to licence the reintroduction, said they also had concerns. ‘There are pluses and minuses to reintroducing any species,’ he said. ‘Lynx could help reduce deer numbers in Scottish woodlands but some land-use organisations have concerns about the impact of a reintroduction on livestock.’","Experts want to release lynx in woodland in Norfolk, Cumbria and Scotland .

"Married biology teacher Kenneth Topham (pictured) got close to the ‘naive’ girl in after-school study sessions at Worksop College . A private school teacher has been jailed for having a year-long sexual relationship with a teenage pupil under the noses of senior staff. Married biology teacher Kenneth Topham, 51, got close to the ‘naive’ girl in after-school study sessions at Worksop College. He began grooming the girl, who can’t be identified for legal reasons, in March 2013, while she was a pupil at the £9,000-a-year school in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. Last night the school was condemned for failing to act despite reports of inappropriate behaviour from several pupils and fellow teachers early on in the affair. Topham was finally arrested after scores of ‘sex texts’ sent by him to the girl were found on her phone in May 2014 and headmaster Gavin Horgan called the police. A former pupil accused the school of a cover-up, saying: ‘They knew what was going on, but refused to do anything about it. 'It is shocking that he was allowed to continue teaching and behaving like this when so many of us complained.’ Topham, a father of two who was also a foster carer to several children over the past decade, would meet the victim after school in his classroom. There they repeatedly engaged in sexual activity which fell short of full sex, Nottingham Crown Court heard yesterday. The teacher – a housemaster who would stay overnight at the school – admitted five offences of wrongful sexual activity and four of incitement by a person in a position of trust. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison yesterday. Suspicions were first raised in the summer of 2013, when the girl was spotted arm-in-arm with Topham and wearing his jumper. Afterwards, a school housemistress had an ‘informal discussion’ with Topham reminding him of boundaries and also spoke to the girl. They received another warning that November after being seen with their arms around each other at a school prom. He began grooming the girl, who can’t be identified for legal reasons, in March 2013, while she was a pupil at the £9,000-a-year school (pictured) in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire . The private school teacher has been jailed at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) for having a year-long sexual relationship with a teenage pupil under the noses of senior staff . At Christmas Topham told the victim he loved her and in January 2014 a teacher saw them bouncing on a trampoline together. The school’s deputy head then spoke ‘in detail’ to Topham about the relationship and the victim’s parents were informed. The teenager, who was described by her housemistress as ‘a very quiet girl and not worldly-wise’ is now at university. ‘I feel let down, hurt and stupid for allowing him to use me,’ she said in a brief statement to the court, adding that he had ‘ruined’ what should have been ‘fond memories of school’. Judge Michael Pert QC told Topham he had ‘exploited a naive teenager’. A spokesman for the school said that because of the legal proceedings it could only share ‘very little information’ with parents, adding: ‘We have always taken our safeguarding responsibilities very seriously and ‘while the College acted swiftly when it became aware of the issue.. we have undertaken a review... of every aspect of our practice’.","Kenneth Topham got close to the girl during after-school study sessions .

"Killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was living ‘on the edge’ because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot’s licence, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Investigators believe his eyesight problems – coupled with a breakdown in his relationship with his long-term girlfriend – triggered the ‘madness’ that ended in mass murder. Lubitz , 27, masked his true condition – described by police as ‘severe burnout syndrome’ – from his employers and was aided by German confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was. Scroll down for video . Madness: Lubitz was 'on the edge' over his deteriorating eyesight, fearing it would cost him his pilot's licence . Health issues: Lubitz , 27, pictured masked his true condition from his employers and was aided by German confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was . But police still don’t know whether his vision problems, which are understood to have begun several years ago, were caused by his psychological condition or whether, as one officer said, he was in fact ‘slowly going blind’. It is understood he once planned to marry pretty blonde teacher Kathrin Goldbach, 26, but she called time on his increasingly erratic and controlling behaviour which made her fearful for her own safety during his rages. One friend said: ‘He tried to order her what to wear, what men she could speak to, even the length of her skirts. He was a control freak of the highest order.’ Another friend added: ‘She said he was very kind and attentive, but that he had problems with mood swings. And I think we sensed that she became more fearful over time.’ The break, according to friends, came just weeks ago. She still lived with him but it is understood she was on the lookout for a bachelor-girl flat. Frantic that he would lose her, Lubitz splashed out thousands of pounds buying two Audi cars. He took delivery of one vehicle just five days before Tuesday’s horror. Break: Kathrin Goldbach still lived with Lubitz in his Dusseldorf flat (pictured) but was looking for a new place . His obsessive need to be in charge extended even to fast food. Habib Hassani, who runs a pizza restaurant near Lubitz’s Dusseldorf home, said: ‘He was extremely particular about pizza toppings. He wasn’t interested in what was on the menu. It was often paprika, ham, onion and broccoli. He had to have it his way. He was compulsive about it.’ Yesterday, it was revealed by police that Lubitz suffered from a ‘severe psychosomatic sickness’ that required the care of several neurologists and psychologists. Police said they took away a plethora of medicines from his apartment in Dusseldorf and from his parental home in the small Rhineland town of Montabaur. Police have moved to seize the confidential medical records of the mass killer hitherto protected by labyrinthine privacy laws in Germany. Desperate: Frantic that he would lose her, Lubitz splashed out thousands of pounds buying two Audi cars . They particularly want to know if his blurred vision was a contributing factor to his catastrophic psychological collapse which led him to pilot his A320 Airbus into a French mountainside, killing himself and 149 innocent passengers and crew. On Friday, it was revealed that his illness was so chronic that he had multiple sick notes from doctors, including one issued to him for the day of the disaster, discarded and ripped up in his home. The disintegration of his eyesight, according to investigators, fuelled his chronic anxiety that his flying career – the career he lived for since he was a teenager – was coming to an end. As the jigsaw puzzle of his complex and disturbed personality was reconstructed by investigators, the agony of his murder-suicide mission struck at the heart of his home town of Montabaur, for ever changed because of the actions of a Jekyll and Hyde figure whose warped personality made him lead two lives. Recovery: Rescue helicopters continued to search the French Alps today for further signs of wreckage . On the surface, he projected stability, confidence and calm: the cool pilot who turned up at his grandparents’ home wearing his crisp Germanwings uniform. He was a fanatical runner, and he liked discos, cars, cooking and music. But his insecurity demanded constant attention – which led him to betray Kathrin with a five-month fling with a Germanwings stewardess conducted in cheap hotels where they stayed while working. ‘He was always seeking assurances about the way he looked and the way he was viewed by others,’ said the former lover, identified only as Maria, 26. She painted a portrait of a ‘tormented and erratic’ man who would wake up from nightmares screaming: ‘We’re going down, we’re going down!’ She added: ‘He once told me he would do something to change the whole system, that the world would know his name and remember him.’ He lived up to the macabre promise when he smashed his aircraft into a mountainside on Tuesday when the emotional volcano within him finally erupted. His mind disorders, despite treatment, could no longer be restrained. Last morning with my love, my Prince... heartbreaking tribute to British victim . Anguish: Anneli Tiirik with boyfriend Paul Bramley in a previous photograph . The grief-stricken girlfriend of a British student killed in the Alps plane tragedy has revealed a poignant last photo of the young couple together. Anneli Tiirik took to Facebook to post the image of her final morning with Paul Bramley, 28. Alongside, she wrote: ‘Last morning with my love, my best friend, my protector, my prince.’ The photo emerged as Mr Bramley’s father made an emotional appeal for the 150 dead not to be forgotten and demanded airlines be more ‘transparent’. Yesterday, a distraught Philip Bramley visited the monument erected near where the Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed. His son was one of three Britons who lost their lives. Fighting back tears in Digne, close to where his son perished on Tuesday, Mr Bramley said: ‘What is relevant is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever. I don’t want it to be forgotten, ever.’ He added: ‘I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly. We put our lives and our children’s lives in their hands. I want to see this cloud over this town lifted and the natural beauty be restored and not to be remembered by the action of a single person.’ Many people took to Facebook to offer Ms Tiirik condolences in response to the photo she posted, with one friend saying ‘he was the best guy you could ever meet’. Ms Tiirik, who is from Estonia, replied: ‘Thank you! He was. It is a big loss for everyone. How it can [sic] be that the most lively and positive person there ever was can be taken from us in this way... I just don’t understand.’ Mr Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with Ms Tiirik. He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days’ holiday with friends. Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family.","Andreas Lubitz feared deteriorating vision would cost him pilot's licence .

"Barack Obama today took a chance to boast about healthcare reform to a group of six-year-old girls - though admitted that Obamacare is not as impressive as a device for turning the pages of a book. The president, put on the spot by a crowd of Oklahoma Girl Scouts to name something he'd come up with to match their device, plumped for his much-touted healthcare reforms. Obama, who was touring exhibits at the annual White House Science Fair, made the jokey exchange before pledging $240million in federal dollars to boost the study of science and technology. Scroll down for video . 'What have I done?': President Barack Obama said that he came up with healthcare reform in a brain-storming session when asked to name an achievement by six-year-old Girl Scouts . 'Heard of healthcare.gov?': Obama admitted his five-year-old shakeup of the healthcare industry was 'not as good' as a device the girls had made to help arthritic people read books more easily . He seized on the Lego page-turning device, which was being exhibited by Emily Bergenroth, Alicia Cutter, Karissa Cheng, Addy Oneal, and Emery Dodson. The girls, all aged six, are members of a Girl Scout troop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and developed their contraption to help those who are paralyzed or arthritic read more easily. When the Commander-in-Chief asked how they had come up with the device, one answered that 'a brain-storming session' was the answer, then asked whether he had any to his name. Obama conceded: 'I have had a couple of brain-storming sessions, but I didn't come up with anything this good.' Announcement: Obama also used the annual fair, held at the White House, to announce $240million of funding for science, technology engineering and math . Whizzes and bangs: The Commander-in-Chife marveled at the devices on display, including this robot built by Sergio Corral (left) and Isela Martinez (center) from Phoenix, Arizona . 'See, you guys are already better brain-stormers than I am.' The persistent Girl Scout followed up her question, asking: 'What did you come up with?' He replied: 'I mean, I came up with things like, you know, health care. 'It turned out OK, but it started off with some prototypes.' His flagship health legislation is five years old today. The girls were among 35 young science fair winners who came to the White House to show off their inventions, which ranged from spinal implants to computer password technology. Favorites: Obama lingered at the display by the so-called 'supergirl' team, who had made their invention partly out of Lego . Learning: Corine Peifer, from Wallenpaupack, Pennsylvania, shows Obama how to  make waves to illustrate her solution to generate electricity from docks bobbing in the water . He later announced the hefty new government investment into so-called STEM subjects, an acronym for science, technology, engineering and math. The pledges the president announced include a $150million philanthropic effort to encourage promising early-career scientists to stay on track and a $90million campaign to expand STEM opportunities to underrepresented youth, such as minorities and girls. Altogether, the new STEM commitments have brought total financial and material support for these programs to $1billion. 'It's not enough for our country just to be proud of you. We've got to support you,' Obama said later, addressing students and scientists in the White House East Room. Talking it up: The president said that his Educate to Innovate strategy is a way to 'support' science rather than just be 'proud' of it . More than 100 colleges and universities have committed to training 20,000 engineers, and a coalition of CEOs has promised to expand high-quality STEM education programs to an additional 1.5million students this year. Obama launched 'Educate to Innovate', his effort to encourage the study of science, technology, engineering and math, in 2009. Obama said the fair is one of the most fun events held annually at the White House. He said: 'Every year I walk out smarter than when I walked in'. Another one to try out: Obama is pictured here testing a modified wheelchair made by Kaitlin Reed, 16, of Dover, Massachusetts and Mohammed Sayed, 16, of Cambridge, who is originally from Afghanistan . Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, joined the president during the tour of the displays, introducing himself to the young inventors and researches. He said: 'Amazing - these kids are so much more advanced than when I was in school.' At each of the 12 display stations, Obama quizzed the participants about their projects.

"Jennifer Lopez has revealed how the murder of famed Latino singer Selena twenty years ago inspired her to launch her own music career. In an interview with Billboard magazine, she said that finding out about the 23-year-old star's death encouraged her to leave the chorus behind and try out as a solo pop artist in New York. Touching on her career choice, the 45-year-old continued: 'It made me realize... Life is short, and you don't know what's going to happen. Go for your dreams and don't let anyone hold you back.' Selena - nicknamed the 'Mexican Madonna' for her provocative dress sense - was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, the president of her fan club on March 31, 1995 in Corpus Christi, Texas.

Tomorrow marks the 20th anniversary of her death, for which Saldívar is serving life for. Lopez, who actually went on to play Selena in a 1997 biopic, added that the young artist was 'special' and 'moved the world in a different way.' She continued: 'That's why we're still talking about her 20 years later.... People like that don't come along every day. 'There is never going to be another Selena.' Just two years after playing Selena, Lopez successfully managed to convert herself from a film star to a pop star.

Making an impression: Lopez, who actually went on to play Selena in a 1997 biopic (seen above), added that the young artist was 'special' and 'moved the world in a different way' Selena began performing as a child, singing in Los Dinos, a band formed by her father that featured her brother A.B. on bass and sister Suzette on drums. She went on to win a Best Mexican-American Album Grammy for Live, had several hits in the U.S. and was about to cross over to the English-language pop market when she was murdered weeks before her 24th birthday. Her posthumous album, Dreaming of You, which was mostly recorded in English, topped the Billboard 200 chart and stayed atop the Latin charts for nine months. In recognition of Selena's passing two decades ago, the Latin world will remember her with concerts, lookalike contests, dances and a massive festival.

The festival will feature performances from Los Lobos and other Tejano stars as well as a screening of Selena, starring Jennifer Lopez in her breakout role. The two main Spanish-language TV networks in the U.S. will also air special Selena programming over the weekend. The late singer's father, A.B. Quintanilla, insists Selena's music has not dated, citing the hit 'Tecnocumbia.'

"A Hong Kong man has been found guilty of murdering his parents before chopping their bodies and cooking them in a microwave. Nine members of the jury found Henry Chau Hoi-lueng, 31, guilty by a 8-1 majority although his co-accused Tse Chun-kei, 38, was acquitted. Both men had previously pleaded guilty to charges of preventing the lawful burial of Chau's father Chau Wing-ki, 65, and his mother, Siu Yuet-yee, 63. Henry Chau Hoi-lueng, pictured, has been found guilty of the brutal murder of his parents in Hong Kong . Chau's parents, Chau Wing-ki, 65, right,  and Siu Yuet-yee, 62, left,  were chopped up and cooked with rice . Tse was handed a one-year jail term for the unlawful burial charges but was released from custody due to the length of time he has already spent on remand. However, Henry Chau will be sentenced on Monday. The South China Morning Post said Judge Michael Stuart-Moore described Henry Chau as an extremely dangerous man who was a complete failure in life. Judge Stuart-Moore added that the killer blamed everyone except himself for his current problems. Both men denied murdering the couple on March 1, 2013. The court heard that Henry Chau's parents went with him on the morning of their murder to see his new home in Tai Kok Tsui. Several days after they disappeared their eldest son Chau Hoi-ying wanted to raise the alarm, but Henry Chau said the couple had travelled to mainland China on a visit. Eventually the eldest son went to the police with the killer to report their parents missing. The court heard that Henry Chau sent a Watsapp message to friends admitting killing his parents. Chau Hoi-Leung will be sentenced on Monday after a jury found him guilty by a majority verdict of 8-1 . Tse Chun-kei (pictured), was cleared of the murder charge but admitted preventing a lawful burial . Police found the heads of Chau's parents inside these refrigerators removed from Tse's apartment . One of the friends reported the message to police who arrested Henry Chau and his friend Tse Chun-kei. Searching Tse's flat, forensics officers recovered the couple's heads stored in two large refrigerators. Several plastic lunch boxes containing chopped flesh and organs were also found. A further three plastic boxes containing salted body parts were found in a different room. The missing body parts are believed to have been cooked and eaten. A pathologist reassembled the skeletons, which had same parts missing. He testified that the couple were stabbed in either their chest or neck before being dismembered. Henry Chau told investigators that he wanted to kill himself six months before the attack, but was convinced to take revenge on his parents instead by Tse. Police believe that the couple were murdered and dismembered in Tse's flat, although he denied taking any part in the killing. Police show the weapons used by Chau to kill his parents after he invited them round for dinner . Prosecutors claimed that Henry Chau and Tse discussed a range of methods of disposing of the bodies - including mixing the remains with cement and throwing them away as bricks. Other plans included cooking the remains and throwing them into the sea. Tse said the only reason he helped Henry Chau is because he was afraid that his friend would kill his mother. Henry Chau first claimed that he did not kill his parents but only helped his friend dismember the remains. He later tried to plead guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility.","A Hong Kong man killed his parents before dismembering their bodies .

"Horrific footage has emerged of the moment a Sydney teenage girl is tackled to the ground by police and dragged in a headlock before she is knocked unconscious. ABC's 7.30 program aired CCTV footage, showing Melissa Dunn with a group of her friends on a night out in January 2012. The 16-year-old Aboriginal girl is chased by an officer after she punches a police van. She is then caught by her hair and arrested. Melissa was charged with resisting and hindering police but was later found not guilty as the magistrate said officers had used an 'inordinate amount of force' in the arrest, the ABC reports. But just three days after the trial in August 2012 the then 17-year-old committed suicide and now her mother says she will be taking legal action against NSW Police over her daughter's arrest.

The teenager's mother, Judy Timbery, told the ABC 'couldn't believe' how the police treated her daughter during the arrest and will be lodging a civil claim. 'I was appalled,' she said. 'Seeing how he handled my daughter, we're supposed to trust the police, and when you see something like that, who can you trust?' An internal police investigation later found the arrest of Melissa and her friend Noeleen Kane were unnecessary and that they should have been issued court attendance notices instead. Ms Kane, who was 16 at the time, was arrested for swearing but was later released. Redfern Legal Service lawyer David Porter told the ABC: 'the force used was not only unnecessary but the situation in which the police officer used force was created by himself failing to use his powers of arrest properly'. Days after the trial ended, Melissa was found dead in a park in Maroubra, Sydney's south. Her friends, who described Melissa as 'happy' and 'friendly', said she had an argument with her boyfriend before her tragic death.

"Shantanu Starick has spent almost three years traveling the world - and it hasn't cost him a cent. The 26-year-old from Byron Bay has managed his globe-trotting adventure by trading his skills as a photographer for everything he needs, from food to shelter and transport. 'If someone told you that you can get around the world without spending a cent, they would tell you it's not possible. Unless, that is, if you can change your perception and allow yourself to create different rules and a different way of thinking,' Mr Starick told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Shantanu Starick has travelled across 6 continents over 33 months without spending a cent . Mr Starick trades his photography skills for life's basics- food, shelter and transport to his next trade. A breathtaking shot of the Brooklyn Grange's Rooftop Farms which are giving new life to on an old navy yard . Before he started out, he was told it wasn't possible to travel the globe using only the 'bartering economy.' But he set off anyway, with no currency and contracts - just a camera and 'an eager smile.' Starting his career as a freelance photographer, Mr Starick said modern day workplaces tended to funnel creative people like himself into specialties, where what was he was looking for was diversity. He decided to take off on the journey of a lifetime taking money out of the conversation and allowing his creative pursuits to take precedence. 'Money can really hinder creativity,' Mr Starick said. 'Anything can seem possible without applying that restriction,' he added. Mr Starick claims that by eliminating money from his travels he's been able to connect on a different level creatively with his clients. 'The real gem that comes from trading is how we can start to do more creative work with others, without the conversation focusing on money.' Mr Starick likens his philosophy to that of companies like Uber and Airbnb where there is no cash exchange between clients and more focus on personal interaction. 'Really, an uber driver is no different to a taxi driver. The huge difference is, that at the end of the day, you are being dropped at the airport like a relative is dropping you off. It's like being dropped to a restaurant by a friend.' Diversity is exquisite: Mr Starick's unofficial mantra leads him to photograph a diverse range of subjects . With 197 trades under his belt Mr Starick's travels have spanned 6 continents with Antarctica in his sights . Mr Starick, who often stays in the homes of his clients, has become accustom to the nomadic lifestyle. He says after almost three years of house hopping, it takes longer for his host to get comfortable than he does. 'People often tell their guests to make themselves at home and I think I put them at ease by being so comfortable.' 'It takes me about two minutes to be drinking milk out of the carton, even if I have just met you two minutes ago. I walk into a home, and I am home,' he added. The nomadic photographer insists that by taking money out of the equation we can allow ourselves to make a genuine human connection . Mr Starick said he doesn't ask for much and has never discussed the details of exactly what he would receive in a trade, leaving it up to his clients to pay with what they can. 'I don't have any expectations apart from hoping it's good food and a comfortable bed,' he said. With 197 trades under his belt Mr Starick's travels have spanned 6 continents. He is adamant he will make it to Antarctica at some stage but at the moment he is inundated with requests for his services. Mr Stanick said he has spent a lot of time in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the USA . His portfolio has no limits as he dabbles in shooting food, weddings, travel, landscapes and cities . 'Sometimes I find it overwhelming. There are days or weeks where I don't answer emails because I just can't. You could spend hours every day on email but I don't want to get caught up in that every day. Some days I just want to shoot or explore and interact with people.' Mr Starick was surprised to find weddings to be some of his most enjoyable projects. '[The wedding] industry was very one dimensional, in my opinion, but luckily these days people are wanting a lot more from their wedding day.' Initially finding the wedding industry 'one dimensional' Mr Starick said his perception couldn't have changed more over his journey . Mr Stanick started to see the raw human connection people have through celebrating a couples special day . 'You end up celebrating your friend's wedding, but they have only been your friend for a few days, it becomes quite intimate.' Mr Starick said his journey has given him the opportunity to meet ' so many amazing people who have effected me in very different ways,' but  Matt and Lentil's wedding changed everything for him. Matt and Lentil, the beautiful couple from Victoria who changed Mr Starick's perception on weddings . Anything but traditional: Lentil relishes in the beautiful day that was planned by her closest family and friends . Matt and Lentil make their vows standing barefoot on delicate yellow flower petals . Two days before the wedding he stayed with a group of their friends and prepared for the big day. This gave him the chance to become a part of the wedding instead of just taking record of it. 'When the wedding day came they were like brother and sister to me. 'They were the most open minded, beautiful people and I got to celebrate the two of them having their big love day, around their equally incredible friends and family.' After spending two days with the couples closest friends and family Mr Starick says he became an organic part of the wedding . Mr Starick is currently in Brazil photographing for a not-for-profit group who send American school leavers on a gap year to undertake community projects and live with local families. 'There's a real diversity in subject matter for me here. We go from farms, to schools, to beaches,' he said. To Mr Starick diversity was the reason he ventured out into the world and after photographing cook books, weddings, dancers, farms and cityscapes, he really has achieved it. 'Diversity is exquisite, it really is.'

"Mohammad Al-Sharif, a 22-year-old Saudi Arabian student, was banned from driving after he admitted driving his father's supercar after smoking cannabis . A 22-year-old Saudi student was caught driving through Hyde Park in his father's custom made McLaren supercar, after he had been smoking cannabis in the early hours. Mohammad Al-Sharif was stopped by police as he drove through the London park and confessed to having taken drugs at 7.30am that morning, when officers found he was unsteady on his feet and slurring his words. The 22-year-old had been driving his father's limited edition McLaren car, which is worth around £168,500. The supercar, which goes from 0mph to 60mph in 2.8 seconds had been given a makeover to make it even more powerful. It was also a previous winner of 'best supercar' in the Middle East's Car of the Year awards. Business student Al-Sharif, who lives off a family allowance, admitted driving while in unfit through drugs and was fined £400. He was also disqualified from driving for a year. Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard that he was stopped at about 10.40am on December 11 last year because he was seen driving 'erratically.' Mr Gill said: 'He was spoken to and there was a strong smell of cannabis coming from the car, he was the sole occupier. 'He was unsteady on his feet, his speech was slurred when he spoke and he appeared intoxicated. 'He was asked if he had been smoking cannabis and said he had at 7.30 that morning. 'He was arrested and taken to Paddington Green Police Station and searched and a small amount of cannabis was found that he admitted was his.' A blood test found Al-Sharif had used cannabis and another drug, which is believed to have been prescription drugs. He was found to be driving on a Saudi Arabia-issued International Driving Licence, which ironically was not valid in his home country. Al-Sharif had been driving the supercar, which had been modified to make it even more powerful . Al-Sharif admitted having taken cannabis when he was stopped by police who spotted his 'erratic driving' The car, which belongs to his father, had been extensively modified to make it even more powerful. Al-Sharif denied the claim his driving was 'erratic', the court heard. He had been studying in London since 2012, attending Birkbeck College, the London School of Business and Finance to improve his English and career prospects in the finance sector. He has no income and survives with the financial support from his family in Saudi Arabia. Al-Sharif was spotted driving a McLaren MP4-12c 3.8 litre twin-turbo V8 Velocita Wind Edition. In the Middle East’s Car of the Year awards the vehicle won ‘Best Supercar’ and overall ‘Car of the Year’ for 2012. The car was priced at £168,500 when launched onto the market in 2011. The Velocita Wind Edition was inspired by a mystery Saudi enthusiast, who demanded an alternative custom design to the McLaren MP4-12c. It can reach 60mph in just 2.8 seconds. Modifications included increasing the output from 592 hp and 442 lb/ft of torque to 660 hp and 502 lb/ft. It also includes a new spoiler lip for the front bumper and an added rear wing. The McLaren MP4-12C has a 592 hp and can reach speeds of 60mph in just under 3 seconds. It has seven gears.

"Jeremy Clarkson is 'confident' he will be able to return to the BBC . Jeremy Clarkson is ‘confident’ he will be able to return to the BBC, but he may be given an executive minder to keep him on the straight and narrow. The manager would sit above Andy Wilman, Top Gear’s longstanding executive producer, who has known Mr Clarkson since they were children, when they both attended the £10,500-a-term Repton School in Derby. The two men have been inseparable for years, but BBC executives are concerned that Mr Wilman cannot keep Mr Clarkson in check, following a string of scandals. ‘I think that people do see a way to resolve this, and that is by putting someone strong in to manage the show and manage Clarkson. He is a brilliant broadcaster, everyone can see that,’ a senior BBC figure said. According to sources close to the Top Gear host, he is keen to return to the Corporation after he was suspended last week for a ‘fracas’ with his producer, Oisin Tymon. Mr Clarkson, 54, is said to be furious with the way the BBC has treated him, and is particularly angry that a high level BBC executive compared him to the serial paedophile Jimmy Savile. He has instructed lawyers to demand a retraction and demanded a full investigation into who spread the smear. Both he and Mr Tymon have now given evidence to an internal investigation into their ‘dust up’, and a verdict is expected within days. Mr Clarkson allegedly split Mr Tymon’s lip with a punch after a long day of filming, when the Top Gear host was offered cold cuts instead of the hot steak he wanted. However, friends of the Top Gear presenter deny that he punched the producer, and claim that tensions flared over the steak because of another problem with Mr Tymon. The executive minder to keep Clarkson on the straight and narrow would sit above Top Gear's longstanding executive producer . ‘Jeremy did report it himself to Danny Cohen [the BBC’s director of television]. He feels that the BBC has gone too far with smearing him over it, but the aim is to come back to Top Gear.’ BBC bosses are also likely to be keen to find a way to keep him on Top Gear, given its £50million-a-year- contribution to the Corporation’s balance sheet. Clarkson was suspended last week for a ‘fracas’ with his producer, Oisin Tymon, pictured . However, introducing a new executive minder between Mr Wilman and Mr Clarkson would help it avoid what a source described as some of their most embarrassing ‘excesses’. It would also go some way to battling the tide of criticism over the Corporation’s ability to manage controversial talents like Mr Clarkson. Last week, Noel Edmonds, himself a former Top Gear host, accused BBC bosses for being ‘out of touch’, ‘out of control’ and ‘incompetent’ when it comes to dealing with larger-than-life broadcasters. A senior television source added: ‘It’s entirely a management issue. Or non-management. The BBC has no strong managers so Clarkson and Wilman were left to do what they wanted.’ The two men have been certainly been caught in a string of scandals, after Mr Wilman allowed his friend to use racist language and make other offensive remarks on the show. Last year, the TV host was forced to apologise after he was filmed using the N-word in the old-fashioned rhyme ‘eeny, meeny, miney, moe’. Then, the host and his crew had to flee Argentina last year when locals objected to a Porsche on the show with the number plate H982 FKL, taken to refer to the 1982 Falklands War. The BBC ordered a review to see whether racist language was seen as acceptable behind the scenes, after Mr Clarkson used the racist term ‘slope’ in a programme about Burma. Mr Wilman admitted it was a mistake, but has made it clear that he thinks the Corporation comes down too heavily on Mr Clarkson. He told the television industry magazine, Broadcast, in January: ‘They don’t trust us at heart.’ ‘The BBC likes Top Gear when it is naughty but still all under control…it says: “You can be naughty under these conditions”. We walk a tightrope most of the time, sometimes we’re going to fall off it and if you do, that’s when the BBC…. I’m not a fan of their reaction.’ The BBC would not confirm that it is considering a new executive minder for Mr Clarkson. ‘We have an investigation under way to establish the facts, so we wouldn’t comment,’ a spokesman said. ----------------------------------------- . This article originally included a claim that the incident involving Mr Clarkson and producer Oisin Tymon may have been caused by Mr Tymon failing to turn up for filming the previous day.

"One in three Britons are regularly missing out on breakfast, a survey of 2,000 adults found (picture posed by model) It is known as the most important meal of the day. But one in three Britons are regularly missing out on breakfast, a survey of 2,000 adults found. This can leave them tired and moody and lower the quality of their work, oat producer Flahavan's said. While two in three people are eating breakfast every day, the study found one in 13 never had a morning meal. Of those who are regularly missing out, two-thirds said they found it difficult to eat early in the morning, with other reasons including not considering breakfast important, not having time, preferring to stay in bed and having too many chores. The results showed more people were regularly missing the first meal of the day, compared with the 20 per cent who were skipping it three years ago. The time taken to eat the meal is also lower, now at just over nine minutes compared to almost ten in 2012. What the nation is eating for breakfast appears to be constantly changing, too. While cold cereals, porridge, fruit and toast remain the staple morning fuel for the majority of breakfasters, the fry up has now become an occasional treat with only 1.5 per cent of respondents saying they started the day with a traditional breakfast most days of the week. John Noonan, of Flahavan's, said: 'Our findings show a shift in the number of people having breakfast - the eating occasion renowned for being the most important meal of the day.

"Crippling cuts to defence spending have left Britain unable to defend itself or stand up to Russia, according to the former head of the Army. General Sir Peter Wall said the 'consequences' of the squeeze on funding is now 'playing out' in the UK's approach to dealing with Vladimir Putin. He joins a growing chorus of criticism of the refusal by any of the main parties to protect defence spending from cuts after the election, despite a pledge to increase foreign aid budgets being enshrined in law. General Sir Peter Wall said the 'consequences' of the squeeze on funding is now 'playing out' in the UK's approach to dealing with Vladimir Putin . A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of the forces face redundancy over the next parliament. David Cameron has repeatedly refused to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP. The 2013-14 defence budget was £34.3billion, down from £35.9billion in 2010-11, when the coalition took over. Sir Peter, who retired as head of the army last summer, warned the West has been 'caught napping' amid increasing threats from the Russian Federation and Islamic State. He criticised the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) and said funding reductions were based on the assumption that there would be a 'reasonably benign security environment for this decade' following the drawdown of combat troops from Afghanistan. 'It was acknowledged that we would have less capability in an unexpected crisis than we would wish, and our political choices would be constrained,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'We can now see those consequences playing out in our reticence to counter Russian expansionism, and her interference in our airspace and offshore waters.' Sir Peter called on the Government to meet the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence. He wrote: 'In an era of moral and physical disarmament the West has been caught napping.' It comes after a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it was inevitable that Britain's defence spending would drop below the Nato target in the face of continuing austerity cuts. Up to 30,000 service personnel could go - with the Army likely to bear the heaviest cuts - leaving the armed forces with a combined strength of just 115,000 by the end of the decade, it predicted. Prime Minister David Cameron is under growing pressure from Tory MPs and peers to make a manifesto commitment to the target to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence . Prime Minister David Cameron is under growing pressure from Tory MPs and peers to make a manifesto commitment to the target. The leadership is braced for significant criticism over its position when a backbench business motion comes before the Commons on Thursday. Nick Clegg has claimed Mr Cameron will fail to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence because he is ideologically wedded to shrinking the state. Labour has also refused to commit to the figure, with the party's Treasury spokesman, Chris Leslie, telling the BBC: 'I know it will be difficult to keep that level of 2 per cent of GDP, but I can tell you it is absolutely impossible under the Conservative trajectory.'","Sir Peter Wall says consequences of budget cuts are now 'playing out'

"One of Britain’s swankiest casinos has come up with a revolutionary way of getting round the smoking ban – by putting gaming tables on its new roof garden. The multi-million-pound development at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, Central London, will enable clients to enjoy a cigarette and gamble at the same time, and is expected to be particularly popular with wealthy clients who find the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces irksome. The move will see a return to the days of Dr No, when Sean Connery as 007 meets the voluptuous Sylvia Trench at Le Cercle club, languidly puts a Morland cigarette to his lips and introduces himself with the immortal line: ‘Bond. James Bond.’ The name's Bond - James Bond: Sean Connery, as 007, lights up a cigarette in a casino in 1962's Dr No . Today, the suave spy would be liable for prosecution for breaking the smoking ban – the reason why a roof garden extension is being added to the hotel’s Park Lane Casino for its aptly named ‘high rollers’. David Mills, the hotel’s operations director, said: ‘Many of our clients come from countries where smoking bans do not apply. We want to provide them with a relaxing and enjoyable experience.’ Gaming tables will be placed on the terrace so that roulette, blackjack, baccarat and three-card poker can be played under the stars, although Westminster Council has banned live and recorded music in case it disturbs nearby residents. The multi-million-pound development at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane (pictured), Central London, will enable clients to enjoy a cigarette and gamble at the same time . A gambling industry source said: ‘It’s no secret that casinos have been looking for ways to get round the smoking ban since it was introduced in 2007 and this is one of the solutions they have come up with.’ London is a favoured destination for international gamblers, many of whom are from the Middle East, and bets totalling millions of pounds are placed at casinos each night. Earlier this year, Mariam Aziz, the former wife of the world’s richest man, the Sultan of Brunei, described in court how she went on ‘reckless gambling sprees’ in Mayfair. Among the clubs visited were Les Ambassadeurs, Aspinalls and Rendezvous, and she confessed to blowing £500,000 in a single night. The Park Lane Casino opened at the Hilton last November, and membership costs £1,000 a year. The terrace on a new second-floor extension is due to open in April.","Outdoor casino earmarked for Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, Central London .

"A troubled socialite who pleaded guilty to dealing drugs from her Range Rover in wealthy suburbs says there wasn't ‘anything difficult about it’ as she hit back at reports she may face up to 10 years behind bars. Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs. The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story recounting her double life as a drug dealer. Scroll down for video . Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs . 'I want to make one point very clear: 1000 pills + 94g of cocaine + $33,000 does not = 10 year gaol,' she wrote on Facebook. 'On averages, what I'm looking at is a 4 year head sentence with probably 2 years parole and 2 years gaol time... minus my 8 months served.' A Current Affair re-enacted the 'sophisticated drug ring' Stockbridge had set up and confronted her on the street for a segment that aired on Wednesday night ahead of her sentencing next month. The program recreated a series of drug deals one day in November 2013 where she collected $5,750 between 4.40pm and 7.30pm from nine deliveries across Sydney. 'The money they're quoting that I made on the night re-enacted is gross of course, not profit,' Stockbridge wrote. 'I'm not sure how anyone could run a sophisticated drug ring from the front seat of their car? And besides, there really isn't anything difficult about it whatsoever.' The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story about her drug dealing . Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society . Stockbridge was arrested at her Darlinghurst home in December 2013 and police found more than 380g of a substance containing MDMA, under 95g of a substance that contained cocaine, a cutting tool for cocaine, resealable bags, 10 mobile phones and $33,620 in cash. Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers she had saved in her phone and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society. The court was also told she sent messages to customers with special deals, including 'buy two grams and get the third half price'. Police started recording evidence of the transactions by bugging her car in September 2013 - a fact Stockbridge says she knew and was careful about.

Stockbridge, who started Urban Society in 2010, revealed in her lengthy post that she turned to dealing drugs to help keep her company afloat. 'I believed so much in the concept I had developed with Urban Society, that I made the decision to liquidate everything I owned and worked for my whole life to fund the business,' she wrote. She said in the first year of business, it ended up costing her just under $250,000 - a sum she hadn't factored and ended up borrowing money from a friend. 'I then needed to pay that money back. One thing led to another and I had two choices: a) find a way to pay back the money or b) fold the company,' she said. 'After all the blood, sweat and tears and my whole life's work in this company, I wasn't about to loose (sic) everything so I did what I had to do to get myself out of a situation where I felt I was trapped.' Stockbridge, who started Urban Society in 2010, revealed in her lengthy post that she turned to dealing drugs to help keep her company afloat . Stockbridge said the people closest to her weren't aware of what she was doing and claims it wasn't anything to do with greed. She hit back at comments made by Daily Mail Australia that her staff were left high and dry when she was arrested in 2013. 'Naturally, because I was arrested, I couldn't pay them. There was no-one who could have done this for me as it would have involved chasing money. They took everything else off me,' she wrote. 'I’m sick of hearing comments insinuating that I didn't pay them on purpose. I do intend to pay them back that last week's pay and I am chasing outstanding money and getting into trouble for it. 'It was never my intention to hurt anyone. I was just trying to fix a bad situation and I didn't do a very good job of it.

"This is the moment a sailor was pulled from the Pacific Ocean after he  survived 100 minutes in the freezing water, which left him hearing voices and close to death. Andrew Taylor was swept overboard and battled 66ft waves in conditions he described as 'like being in a washing machine'. He was uncertain his crew had even noticed he was missing but was determined to survive because 'it would be unfair on mum to die on her birthday', he said. Mr Taylor was thrown in the sea eight months into the Clipper Round the World Race and watched the yacht disappear over the horizon. Fearing his legs were both broken after being hit by the rudder, hypothermia then set in and he began hallucinating and hearing voices. But he had activated  his emergency beacon and the boat returned almost two hours later to rescue him - and a doctor on board saved him by packing him in a sleeping bag filled with hot water bottles. Scroll down for video . Extraordinary: Andrew Taylor is pulled aboard from the Pacific after spending almost two hours in the water . Determined: The sailor was hallucinating and close to death when his team returned to find him during a round-the-world race . Survivor: Mr Taylor, from Oxford, recovered on board and went on to complete the round-the-world race (pictured speaking afterwards) Incredibly Mr Taylor, from Oxford, recovered on board and went on to complete the round-the-world race. He has now turned his diary entries from the trip into a book and will donate the profits to charity. 'It was like being in a washing machine,' he said, recalling the dramatic March 2014 rescue. The 47-year-old continued: 'I thought I was going to die but decided, ""It would be unfair on mum to die today"".' He described the lead up to the incident which took place eight months into the race. 'The conditions were rough and storms were coming in,' he said. 'Our sails were too big for the weather and the boat had become difficult to handle. 'We had to change the sails.' While Mr Taylor was doing this, a wave crashed on board and dragged him overboard. He said: 'It took a fraction of a second and I had no time to react. One minute I was on board, the next I was in the water. 'I tried to take a breath but it was too cold. I waited for my safety line to snag then realised it wasn't attached to the boat. 'Then I was hit by the rudder, which, at 15ft high and 6in thick, ran over me. I thought my legs were broken as I watched the boat disappear. 'I swore as it went over the horizon and thought about my last conversation with the skipper, Sean McCarter, about going to get a tool. 'I wondered if my crewmates had seen me fall off the boat.' On the horizon: Mr Taylor floats in the sea after he was thrown in and battered by the boat's rudder . Grabbed: A member of the crew  swings in to the water to grab the stricken sailor, who took three attempts to get back aboard . Saved: Mr Taylor was stripped and warmed up using large amounts of hot water bottles packed into a sleeping bag . Mr Taylor said at this point he was sure the yacht would return for him soon. He said: 'We'd trained in 'man overboard' so I activated the AIS beacon, attached to me, which I knew would show my location on a screen on the boat. 'I thought the boat would stop, turn round and pick me up. 'I pulled the pin out of my beacon and it started flashing. 'I checked the straps on my life jacket were tight and it was fully inflated, then I waited for the boat. 'I thought it would be back in around 15 minutes. 'I was confident the boat would return. 'For a long time I saw the boat in the distance and thought it must have stopped. 'I saw the mast but only a glimpse of the deck and thought, 'If I can't see the deck, they can't see me'.' Mr Taylor said he began to wonder if his beacon had worked and alerted the crew to his disappearance. He continued: 'I was constantly under the waves. The water was white. It felt like I was in a washing machine. 'With time I realised I was in a bad place. I was suffering with the cold. I started to drift off as I struggled to stay conscious. 'I felt relaxed, comfortable, euphoric and knew these were signs of hypothermia. 'I knew going to sleep would mean game over. I had to focus on myself, my job was staying alive. 'So I turned to face the wind hoping to get cold and stay awake. I talked to myself about family and friends and I remembered my mum's birthday. 'I was annoyed and disappointed that I hadn't messaged her yet that day. I decided it was unfair to die on mum's birthday and that gave me strength. 'That was the biggest thing that kept me going.' Then he began to hear voices. Mr Taylor said: 'I thought my mind was playing tricks on me but I focussed on them and they seemed to be getting louder. 'Suddenly the boat was bearing down on me. It was enormous. 'I saw some people and made eye contact. My friend Jason Middleton was already in the water in a harness.' Journey: Mr  Taylor was on board the Derry Londonderry Doire yacht, pictured leaving the dock in London, at the Clipper 13-14 Race start last year . Celebrating:  Andrew Taylor is second left here on a stopover in China before he was thrown overboard last March . Conditions: But later the boat was being hit with huge waves in the Pacific, which in the end swept off Mr Taylor and nearly killed him . The team on board tried to grab hold of Mr Taylor, attach him to Mr Middleton's harness and haul him up out of the water. It took three goes. He said: 'By the third attempt I wondered if I had the energy and would get on the boat. I was cold inside me, my face was sore and my body was aching. 'It felt like I was being run over by a bus. I couldn't get my breath. I felt like I could drown.' Turnaround: Mr Taylor's legs were bruised and swollen and after he had six days intensive physiotherapy he then decided he wanted to carry on with the race . Finally, with the whole crew forging together, Mr Taylor was pulled out of the water almost two hours after he'd gone overboard. He said: 'It felt like a lifetime, everyone was working hard. I don't know where I got the strength to get back on board. I collapsed face first.' Mr Taylor was taken below deck and put in a sleeping bag which was packed with bottles filled with hot water, to warm him up. He said: 'For the next four hours my muscles ached and I was in and out of consciousness. I was treated for hypothermia and Susie Redhouse, the medic, monitored me for the next 48 hours.' Mr Taylor's legs were bruised and swollen. He had six days intensive physiotherapy then decided he wanted to carry on with the race. He said: 'It's called round the world for a reason and I planned to get back on board. It was intensely difficult and I was physically sick beforehand. 'But the last four months of the race were tremendously enjoyable, and we finished fourth.' Mr Taylor has now turned his experience into a book. He called it 179W – One Seven Nine West, named after the exact coordinates where he went overboard. Proceeds from the sale of his book will go to Mr Taylor's chosen charities – The Ellen Macarthur Cancer Trust and The Newmarket Day Centre.","Andrew Taylor was thrown overboard by 66ft waves in the Pacific .

"Three Chinese separatists who were involved in an a knife attack that killed 31 people at a train station last year have been executed. The three men, Iskandar Ehet, Turgun Tohtunyaz and Hasayn Muhammad were all put to death for their role in the attack at Kuming railway station, which also saw more than 140 people wounded. The Supreme People's Court confirmed that the executions had taken place after the men were convicted of 'leading a terrorist organisation and intentional homicide' in September. A police investigator inspects the scene at Kunming railway station in the aftermath of a mass knife attack, which killed 31 people. Three men have now been executed for their role in the attack . The attack also left 141 people injured and Chinese state run media dubbed the incident as 'China's 9/11' China uses both lethal injection and firing squad for executions, but the method used this time was not specified. The attack in Kunming, in the south western province of Yunnan, was dubbed as 'China's 9/11' by state-run media. Dressed in black and wielding long knives and machetes, several assailants stormed the station on March 1, 2014 seemingly hacking at anyone in sight. Distressing photos circulating online showed bodies, pools of blood and abandoned luggage scattered across the terminal floor in the wake of what authorities termed an 'organised, premeditated, violent terrorist attack'. A female attacker, Patigul Tohti, was pregnant at the time of her arrest and was sentenced to life in prison. Chinese policemen patrol the area outside the station after the attack. Beijing blamed the attack on 'separatists' from the resource-rich far western Xinjiang region . Police shot four other assailants dead at the time of incident. Beijing blamed the attack on 'separatists' from the resource-rich far western Xinjiang region, where at least 200 people have died in attacks and clashes between locals and security forces over the last year. The remote autonomous region, which borders Central Asia, is home to the mostly Muslim Uighur minority. But campaign groups have accused China of preventing the men from having a fair trial.

'The defendants did not get a dignified trial and China used this event to incite discrimination against Uighurs.' However, China has vowed to step up punishment of 'violent terrorists', and is drafting its first-ever anti-terrorism law. Chinese courts convicted 712 people on terrorism-related charges last year, an increase of more than 13 per cent, according to chief justice Zhou Qiang. The country executes more people than the rest of the world combined, according to rights organisations, and put an estimated 2,400 people to death in 2013.","Iskander Ehet, Turgun Tohtunyaz and Hasayn Muhammad were executed .

"A drugs raid was carried out on the 'pot club' of the Alaskan reporter who quit her job live on air to fight for legalized weed, after reports surfaced of illegal marijuana sales on the premises. Charlo Greene's Alaska Cannabis Club was raided by Anchorage police who served search warrants on Friday afternoon. The police took marijuana and impounded a Dodge Dakota and a Jeep Liberty, according to a report from KTUU. Scroll down for video .

Greene, a former television reporter gained notoriety when she quit her job on live TV in September with an expletive and announced she was becoming an advocate to legalize marijuana in Alaska. The former newswoman, whose legal name is Charlene Egbe, told KTVA that the club was a medical marijuana dispensary only and denied that any sales had been carried out. 'We don't sell any recreational marijuana. We don't sell any medical marijuana. This is a place for cardholders to come and share their own cannabis,' she said. Greene said that the residence was home to multiple medical marijuana cardholders, as well as the club. And she appears to have received celebrity support  from rapper Snoop Dogg (Snoop Lion) who was pictured wearing a top with Alaska Cannabis club' emblazoned on it on her Facebook page. Greene said during the raid: 'I saw [police] uproot a couple of marijuana plants. They took some bongs and pipes and phones and computers, and that's pretty much it.' However, despite the raid, Greene reopened the club on Saturday.

'By opening back up bright and early, less than 24 hours after the local police department's failed scare tactic, we, at the Alaska Cannabis Club, have made it clear that the will of the people is stronger than any force they have — and we aren't going anywhere,' she told the Associated Press. Greene said she was 'incensed' the police executed a search warrant on her instead of focusing on a stabbing and shootings that happened nearby just a few hours before. Alaska voters last year approved a ballot measure legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. But it's still illegal to sell the drug. Guidelines for the regulation of the marijuana trade are under consideration by the Legislature. Anchorage Police Department spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said it's 'very important that people don't try to jump the gun until the state sets our other rules and protocols for the sale and commercialization of marijuana.'

"Luke and Anne Owens married this year despite a 22 year age gap and celebrated their nuptials with a Beatles themed ceremony . A pair of Beatles super-fans are proving love is all you need having got married despite a 22-year age gap. Luke Owens, 27, and Anne, 50, met in 2010 at the secure unit where they both work as mental health nurses. Four years later, the couple married in a Beatles-themed ceremony and are preparing to jet off on their honeymoon to a Beatles festival in Kentucky, Louisiana, in May. Anne says that for her it had been love at first sight. 'I'd worked at the hospital for 20 years when I first met Luke, and I knew he was the one as soon as I met him,' she said. 'He'd just started at the medical centre, and when I first saw him I thought he was dead cute. 'I initially thought he was about 30, but he actually turned out to be 22 - I was 44.' Anne said she is often mistaken as much younger than her years, whereas Luke looks older for his age. And so despite a 22-year age gap, Anne decided to pursue Luke. She said: 'I wasn't sure whether he was interested or not at the start because he seemed a little shy, but I always used to make a beeline for him. 'I used to go out of my way to get shifts swapped with friends so that we could work together. 'One day, I hinted at a little date and gave him my number. We started texting and it went from friends to flirty, and then one night I decided to just give him a kiss and see what happened.' Luke says that he was glad that Anne had made the first move as he would never have had the confidence to. 'It was Anne that asked me out. I wouldn't have done it myself because of the age gap,' he said. 'I knew she was a bit older than me, but I was a bit worried at the start because I didn't know how old she was - you get told not to ask women her age so I waited a couple of months to find out.' Anne and Luke married on September 6 last year at the Hard Day's Night Hotel and every aspect of the wedding was devoted to the couple's favourite band . The couple met in 2010 at the secure unit where they both work as mental health nurses and say it was love at first sight . The Beatles super-fans wedding included a John Lennon Rolls Royce . While Luke and his groomsmen wore Beatles-themed suits Anne opted for a traditional wedding dress . The theme was complete with a 'All You Need is Love' wedding cake . Although the pair suffered a little backlash at the beginning of their relationship Luke eventually received kudos for pulling an older woman. 'People laughed a bit at the start, but most people thought it must be good to be with an older woman,' he said. 'I got a few high fives off my mates - I think it earned me a few brownie points.' Anne said that although Luke was 'slow on the uptake' age gap relationships have benefits. 'Luke is quite romantic for his age. He's caring, thoughtful and funny. He doesn't take life too seriously, which is just so much more fun and makes me feel younger. Luke, 27 had been too scared to ask Anne, 50, out and so she made the first move after Luke began working in the same hospital and five years later they were married . 'Fifty year-old men seem so serious, but Luke's happy and carefree,' she said. 'He doesn't take life too seriously which is so much more fun. It rubs off on me and makes me feel younger.' Despite the pair sharing a love for the Beatles, Luke is the most dedicated fan of the two, and even organised a Beatles themed wedding. Now the Beatles fans are flying to Kentucky in May for their Honeymoon and Luke has even launched an online campaign to get Paul McCartney's autograph so he can get it tattooed on his body . Anne and Luke married on September 6 last year at the Hard Day's Night Hotel and every aspect of the wedding was devoted to the couple's favourite band. They walked down the aisle to John Lennon, cut their own Love is All You Need themed wedding cake, and arrived at the venue in the famous John Lennon Rolls Royce. Luke and his groomsmen even wore Beatles themed suits at the ceremony, while Anne opted for a classic fishtail bridal gown. Luke has seven Beatles tattoos which took 11 and a half hours to complete . The couple are flying to Kentucky in May for a late honeymoon, where they will go to Beatles festival Abbey Road on the River. Luke has even launched an online campaign to get Paul McCartney's autograph so he can get it tattooed on his body. Luke has seven Beatles tattoos, including a Penny Lane-themed sleeve, as well as the full band tattooed on his back, which took 11 and-a-half hours to complete. Anne said: 'I thought Luke's tattoos were a bit weird at first, but I like them now. I think The Paul McCartney on his arm is my favourite. 'He tried to persuade me to get one - but I'm not so sure for now.'","Luke and Anne Owens celebrated their nuptials with a Beatles-themed wedding .

"The devastated family of a 29-year-old Australian woman who died after undergoing ‘simple’ cosmetic surgery in Mexico are desperately trying to find what happened to their ‘beautiful and gracious’ loved one. Evita Nicole Sarmonikas was admitted to a hospital in Mexicali, the capital city of the Mexican state of Baja California, on March 20 while on holiday with her boyfriend. She died on the same day, after reportedly suffering a heart attack. Her distraught family are at a loss to understand why she could not be saved. They highlight how Australian Medical advice shows that ‘even in the case of cardiac arrest a healthy young body can often be brought back to life when surrounded by a fully equipped hospital and a competent medical team’. Ms Sarmonikas’s family has set up a Facebook page in tribute to the ‘perfect and whole soul’ and to also help fundraise up to $20,000, which is needed to bring her body back home to Australia. They have also urged other woman not to 'risk death to improve on perfection'. Gold Coast woman Evita Nicole Sarmonikas has died in a Mexican hospital after undergoing surgery . ‘The autopsy showed Eva went into cardiac arrest following surgery. The hospitals' only response was to cling to their waiver, removing themselves from any liability,’ a family member wrote on the Facebook group. ‘There have been no answers and their only offer of “cooperation” was an urgency to return her to us in the form of ashes. The Australian Embassy has strongly advised we do not allow this to happen.’ Ms Sarmonikas’s family have been advised to travel to Mexico as soon as possible to request an independent autopsy – not carried out by the hospital where she died – and to bring her home. They say she 'did not have travel insurance and we were never prepared for a situation of this magnitude'. ‘Evita as we knew her on earth would be devastated at the amount of attention she is receiving at the moment, as she was extremely private and worked very hard to never be a burden on anybody,’ her family wrote. ‘However the abundance of love that we all hold for her is propelling the action that needs to be taken before she be laid to rest, and she deserves that.’ A Facebook tribute page has been set up for Evita to share advice and support and to help fundraise to bring her body home to Australia . One friend on Facebook described Eva as a 'shining light in the dark and unforgiving world' Her family are also asking for help in gaining legal and medical representation as advised by The Australian Embassy. Ms Sarmonikas’s family have not said what procedure Evita was undergoing before she died but they explained: ‘As beautiful as Evita was inside and out. She was still filled with certain inadequacies. As almost every woman on earth does.’ ‘Her perfect and whole soul was not strong enough in light of a world that constantly bombarded her with an urgency to demand more from herself and her body,’ they explained. ‘She never demanded anything from anybody, but was always out giving her people. These near perfect graphic comparisons our young women are bombarded with from get go are too much for innocent hearts to battle, and the consequences are fatal when not conducted by adequate professionals. Ms Sarmonikas’s family have been advised to travel to Mexico as soon as possible to request an independent autopsy . ‘These doctors promised her more perfection to fill an emptiness that began developing early in our childhood. This emptiness further expanded with traumatic experiences in her adult life and the constant social boarding of a false beauty illusion,’ they Facebook post continued. Her sister Andrea has urged others not too risk their lives in the pursuit of what they perceive as beauty. ‘This was not the way to go home, no woman should risk death to improve on perfection,’ they said. ‘Tomorrow morning when you look in the mirror say to yourself ""I am enough, I am worthy, I am perfect just the way I am"". ‘Don't listen to a world that is hungry to fill your insecurities with poison. Stop feeding an industry that hates humans, especially women in the natural state and their perfect birth bodies. Do it for Eva, do it for you.’ Tributes have poured in for the 29-year-old. One friend wrote 'she was such a gorgeous girl physically and emotionally' Friends have promised to help bring Evita,  'a truly beautiful soul', home anyway they can . There has been an outpouring of love and messages of condolences on the page set up to remember Ms Sarmonikas. Ashleigh Carvell said: 'So sad she was such a gorgeous girl physically and emotionally. She seemed to be so confident in herself. Such a sad thing to happen my heart aches for u all. My deepest condolences.' Sugah Kimba wrote: 'She is a beautiful soul!!! Eva is the type of person to make the world a little more beautiful!!!! That's just who she was!!!' Sasha RPaki said: 'How do you improve on perfection? Eva was perfect, just as God made her and no man should ever have adulterated His masterpiece. The world is poorer for having lost her.' 'This news is devastating! All my memories of Eva, Sarah and I as little girls playing in the street have flooded back! I remember bumping into her a few years back and was amazed by her beauty.. Inside and out! I'm so sorry for your loss, it's always the good ones that are taken too soon!,' Elise O'Donnell wrote. Helen Pearce added: 'Eva was a shining light in this dark and unforgiving world. Beautiful inside and out, gracious, sensitive, caring and giving, who lived by her moto of laugh, live, love. Eva you will be so sadly missed.'","Evita Nicole Sarmonikas, 29, died on March 20 in Mexicali, Mexico .

"A 28-year-old blind woman has had her confidence shattered after a bus driver laughed in her face and refused to believe she qualified for a disabled fare. Megan Johnston, from Newtown, Wellington, in New Zealand, has a degenerative eye disease that has left her with just five per cent vision. Megan uses a walking cane to assist her in getting around with her extreme tunnel vision and when she boarded the bus on Wednesday afternoon she had folded the stick under her arm. ‘When the bus pulled up I went to get on after a few people and, like I usually do, I folded up my cane and showed the driver my card,’ Megan told Daily Mail Australia. Megan Johnston, from Wellington, in New Zealand, was shocked when a bus driver refused to believe she was blind despite showing him her concessions bus pass and cane . The bus pass, issued by NZ Bus, clearly states ‘blind person’ on it. ‘It just gets me a dollar off my fare which I thought I may as well use,’ Megan said. As she handed over her $2 fare the driver refused to take her money as she explained the pass simply gets her a concession fare. ‘He said “yeah but you are not blind are you?” and started laughing,’ Megan said. ‘I said “are you kidding me” and he said “well how did you get on the bus, you can obviously see things”,’ she recalled. Megan’s hereditary condition, Retinitis Pigmentosa, means her eyesight is approximately 170 degrees worse than a person with perfect eyesight and leaves her with no peripheral vision. Shocked by his assumption that she was lying about being blind, Megan told the bus driver she has ‘five per cent vision’ and he responded: ‘That’s not actually blind is it.’ Megan's bus pass, issued by NZ Bus, clearly states 'blind person' on it but the driver simply laughed at her . The 28-year-old has a degenerative eye disease that has left her with just five per cent vision . ‘I was really shocked. I took my money and got off the bus… I should be able to get on the bus without being questioned,’ Megan said. ‘I was just devastated. I was on my way into town to meet a friend and it’s taken a long time for me to be confident using my cane and be not judged.’ Upset and in tears, Megan fired off a message on Twitter to the bus company and was told to call their generic customer service line. ‘I said “hey your bus driver just laughed at me and said I wasn’t blind despite having a cane and a card”. They gave me the general Metlink number .’ When Megan rang the company in tears she was told they would get back to her in two to three weeks. Since her story was first published in the Dominion Post, the Go Wellington bus company has been in touch to apologise. Megan, a talented artist who drew the above illustration of herself, uses a walking cane to assist her in getting around with her extreme tunnel vision . Retinitis Pigmentosa is an inherited, degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment and often blindness. It dramatically effects peripheral vision and is often described as extreme tunnel vision. The degeneration is progressive and has no known cure. But Megan believes there needs to be more awareness around the fact there are varying degrees of blindness. ‘I am constantly confronted by people who think blindness is black and white. But there is a big variation,’ Megan explained. Megan has had her cane for around a year and a half and it isn’t known at what rate, or if, her eyesight will continue to deteriorate. ‘I haven’t been on a bus since then and I definitely don’t feel comfortable. I also have a card for half price taxi fares so I feel more comfortable using that now,’ she said. Since becoming legally blind Megan, a talented artist and designer, has battled with not only her difficulty in seeing what’s around her but also people’s perceptions of her disability. ‘I’ve always had artistic tendencies but people find it hard to deal with because it’s such a visual thing. It took her a long time before she began feeling confident enough to use her cane (pictured) in public . ‘The fact of the matter is I do have intact middle vision and it’s there and fine and it’s more than I need to draw illustrations. It also means I can work from home and don’t have to go out,’ she said. Megan inherited her Retinitis Pigmentosa, which cannot be cured, from her father and is considered legally blind. In an article she wrote for the website On The Left, Megan described how ‘getting around in public became increasingly hard a few years ago’. ‘I was constantly getting in people’s way. People were in a hurry and were huffing and puffing and occasionally swearing at me. They weren’t to know, but it made me feel horrible. If I bumped into just one person, it would rattle me and ruin my entire day,’ she wrote. The illustrator reasoned: ‘Blindness comes in many, many forms and just because we can’t see one thing, it doesn’t mean we can’t see another.’","Megan Johnston, from Wellington, New Zealand, is legally blind .

"The 18-year-old baby-faced Australian who is believed to have fled to the Middle East to join Islamic State was an 'outcast' who was bullied at school, his former classmates say. The young man - identified as 'Jake' from Melbourne - is a former Craigieburn Secondary College student who converted to Islam in Year 10. Ulus Shefket, who was in the same year as Jake at school, said he was an outsider. 'He was quiet and barely had any friends. Whenever you tried to joke with him he would react aggressively,' Mr Shefket told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . The photograph of a youthful fighter posing with an assault rifle has been identified as Melbourne teen 'Jake' Jake pictured in a school photo from Year 10 - the year he converted to Islam, according to school friends . 'He left Craigieburn Secondary College for another school because I think he felt like an outcast there. Mr Shefket said Jake was bullied by others at the school. 'Verbal bullying, but nothing too serious, things that a normal person would shrug off easily,' he said. Mr Shefket said Jake converted to Islam in 2012. 'He came to school one day late in year 10 and just told us that he converted to Islam, but when we asked him why he would give us very vague answers,' he said. '""That's none of your business"" and ""I think I made the right choice.""' Another former classmate, Josh Green-Mercier, said: 'He always looked depressed and was always looking down. 'He never communicated unless it was to do with culture and beliefs or math, he always listened to our conversations. Mot many people knew him and he never opened himself up. But Mr Green-Mercier said reports about his links to IS came as a 'surprise'. 'I didn't think he could join something like that,' he said. Jake appeared in a photo on Twitter in December holding an assault rifle in front of the Black Standard flag of IS as he sits flanked by two armed extremists. When the picture first emerged on social media, the youthful fighter was suggested as  British or Australian, while there were unconfirmed comments that the  jihadi's name was Jonathan Edwards. But Fairfax Media reports Jake, who now goes by the Islamic names Abdur Raheem or Abu Abdullah, was a maths genius from Melbourne who fled  to the Middle East to join Islamic State. Counter-terrorism authorities accompany the two teenage boys through Sydney Airport after they were stopped from boarding a flight to an undisclosed location in the Middle East . When Jake converted to Islam, he attended a number of mosques where he prayed with worshippers before disappearing. Worshippers at the Meadow Heights Mosque claimed they recall Jake's family were not impressed over his new religious beliefs at the time, according to Fairfax Media. A school friend, who wished to remain anonymous, told Fairfax Media Jake 'was not pushed into IS and was not pushed into Islam'. 'People can make their own decisions and this was one of his - he felt that it was right for him. He had done sufficient research to believe it was the right step in life,' the friend said. 'He was obviously a believer in Islam and wanted to fulfil what he believed was his duties to the religion.' Ginger Jihadi Abdullah Elmir gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in a YouTube video . Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar posted photos of himself holding up decapitated heads on Twitter . Jake told his family he had a 'journalist' job lined up in Istanbul after communicating online with an American journalist from the BBC. But it has now emerged the reporter was an Islamic State recruiter, according to Fairfax Media. The revelations come after two teenage brothers were detained at Sydney Airport by counter-terrorism authorities on Friday night. The two siblings, aged 16 and 17, from south west Sydney were trying to leave Australia to fight in a conflict zone and were reportedly brought home by their mother after being detained. The pair had reportedly booked flights to an unidentified country in the Middle East and their luggage were searched while matters remain under investigation. Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Federal Police for his activities in Syria . Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said the western Sydney brothers, who were stopped at the airport on Friday night, will be put on to a watch list. 'The authorities will be working really hard with the families,' he told the Seven Network. 'On the advice I've got, the mum and dad had no knowledge of what was going on.' Mr Dutton said the online 'radicalisation' of Australian youth was a threat to society. 'We take it very, very seriously,' he said, . 'It's a warning message to a lot of parents, you work with your kids, understand what they are looking at online.' Mr Dutton also praised the move by NSW correction authorities to ban terror suspects in maximum security prisons from communicating in Arabic. 'This is a really good move,' he said. 'We need to make sure authorities are on top of any threat.' Former immigration minister Scott Morrison, commenting on the case of the Melbourne boy 'Jake', said indoctrination was happening in unexpected places. 'It's very hard to make assumptions on who's going to fall prey to the death cult,' he told Sky News. The government needed every available tool to stop people joining the fight overseas, he said. Elmir (front centre) wants to see a 'black flag on top of the White House' in a notorious YouTube video . Sydney jihadists Mohamed Elomar, Khaled Sharrouf, and teenager Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadist - are so far the most high profile Australians to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State. Elmir, a former Condell Park High student, was filmed on the banks of the River Tigris in Iraq last October. The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video . While Elomar and Sharrouf have appeared regularly in Islamic State videos. One of which included a beheading of a prisoner. Convicted terrorist Sharrouf served three years and 11 months in prison over his role in the 2005 Pendennis terror plot. He left Australia illegally last year and is believed to be fighting with ISIS. Up to 40 Australian women were also known to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to become 'jihadi brides' or work with terrorists. More than 100 Australians are thought to have travelled overseas to fight in Iraq and Syria.","The young man who appeared in a photo holding a gun has been identified .

"When Kyesha Smith Wood dropped her daughters off at a Cinderella screening, she trusted they would be on their best behavior. But when they returned, her 16-year-old son admitted his sisters had been rude and obnoxious to a mother inside the theater. He explained how the woman approached the girls at the end of the screening in Bessemer, Alabama, and told them her husband had just been laid off and it was the last time she would be taking her daughter  to the movies for a while - and they had ruined it. A devastated Wood tried to track down the woman, by sending out an apology on Facebook and offered to pay for her next trip out of her children's allowance. Scroll down for video . Kyesha Smith Wood (pictured with her husband Damond) called out her 'disprectful' children on Facebook after she found out they were rude to a mother who was watching Cinderella with her daughter . She wrote this lengthy Facebook post in a bid to track the mother down, and it was subsequently shared thousands of times . The post was shared by thousands of people, prompting the mother in question, Rebecca Boyd, to write her a message. Since the message was uploaded, her husband has received job offers and others have offered to fund the next visit. Wood told AL.com she was 'devastated and ashamed' after learning of the way her girls behaved after Boy tried to correct their behavior. So she took to social media in a bid to track her down. The lengthy Facebook post read: 'This is a long shot, but I'm looking for a woman that was at Tannehill Premier tonight seeing Cinderella at 7pm. I dropped my teenage daughter, step daughter, and son off at the movie. 'My son later told me, much to my humiliation and embarrassment, that my girls were rude and obnoxious during the movie. The woman I'm looking for addressed them and asked them to be quiet and they were disrespectful. The woman in question Rebecca Boyd (left and right) got in touch with Wood and said she was 'touched' by how she cared about her children's behavior. Her husband has also received job offers following the publicity . 'After the movie she approached my girls and told them that her husband had been laid off and this was the last movie she would be able to take her daughter to for a while and my girls ruined that for her. If you are this woman, please message me. 'I can assure you that these girls are being strongly dealt with and appropriately punished. This rude, disrespectful, and awful behavior is unacceptable and they owe you an apology. 'My husband and I are having them write your apology letter tonight and we would like to pay for your next movie and snacks out of their allowance. Please message me if this is you. I apologize profusely for their disrespect.' After seeing the post, Boyd said: 'I was touched that she cared how her kids behaved. You don't see that a lot these days. Despite all the attention  Wood insists the 'real hero' in the situation is Boyd, who she calls a 'great mom.' Boyd added: '[I've learned] that as parents we need to support each other. The girls are not bad, they made bad choices. 'I am overwhelmed by all the love and support! This is something my daughter Ashley and I will never forget.'

"Forget going away for a romantic getaway with your partner, it seems Britons are more likely to watch TV or read than frolic between the sheets in hotels. Despite results from a global study showing that hotel guests like to sleep naked  on holiday - it seems romantic liaisons are not top of the agenda in hotels. Of the 39 per cent of people who say they are happy to sleep in the nude on holiday, the nationality most likely to wear their birthday suits in bed is the the French - followed by Britons and Norwegians. Brits on holiday prefer to watch TV or read than have sex whilst in a hotel on holiday, according to a survey by Hotels.com . 1. Watching TV 67% . 2. Reading 47% . 3. Sex 46% . 4. Surfing the internet 40% . 5. Eating from the room service menu 20% . The recent survey asked over 250,000 guests about their holiday habits to surprising results. For Britain, catching up with TV or a movie was the best loved bedroom activity with 67 per cent of people grabbing for the remote when they hit the sheets. Even reading was preferred to romance, with 47 per cent of people enjoying books, and only 46 per cent opting to have sex when they are away. Even if it is not our top pastime time, it does still beat  surfing the internet (40 per cent) and only a fifth of us would rather order a snack from room service. Carolina Annand, of Hotels.com, said: 'It seems on a global scale a lot of us are more than happy to strip for the sheets, yet it is interesting to see in the UK that we prefer to watch TV on a hotel bed rather than any other activity. 'With such a variety of hotel rooms to discover across the globe, both international and domestic, we encourage travellers to really make themselves at home whenever they travel!' A third of us enjoy sleeping in the nude, which is said to have many health benefits including lowering blood pressure . France 51% . UK 24% . Norway 24% . Sweden 20% . Australia 19% . Finland 19% . Denmark 18% . Canada 17% . Netherlands 16% . Ireland 16% . Russia 16% . Brits may love watching TV over making love, but we came in joint second place for the countries who sleep in the nude, with 24 per cent admitting they ditch their pajamas. Norwegian and Swedish travelers similarly enjoyed to bare all with a fifth or more people admitting to sleeping in just a sheet. The benefits of sleeping naked have been promoted by many medical professionals. 'The advantage of sleeping naked is it's easier for the body to cool and maintain the lower temperature the brain wants to achieve,' says Dr Chris Idzikowski, director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre and author of Sound Asleep: The Expert Guide To Sleeping Well. 'If anything prevents that decline in temperature, the brain will wake itself up to see what's going on, meaning you'll struggle to get to sleep or you'll have disturbed sleep,' he said. Marilyn Monroe was famously not a fan of wearing pajamas and said she only wore Chanel No 5 between . The survey also revealed the calming impact holidays have on our dreams. 42% of Brits said dream differently while on holiday with over a quarter (26%) saying their dreams are more relaxing, while 50% of those in Mexico also had calmer dreams, topping the global list. This was closely followed by Colombia (48%) and Taiwan (45%) in 2nd and 3rd place respectively.","More Brits would rather watch TV than make love while on holiday .

"A wife has lost her £2million divorce battle with her property tycoon ex-husband - who is worth £38million – because she had signed a 'post-nuptial agreement'. A judge heard William and Caroline Hopkins, who had lived together near Wincanton, Somerset, married more than three decades after starting an affair, but separated after less than three years. The High Court in London heard the couple, who separated in the summer of 2011, had signed a 'post-nuptial' agreement under which Mrs Hopkins would receive two properties, £350,000 and a share of her ex-husband's pension. But Mrs Hopkins, 62, complained that the agreement had been breached after she was put under 'undue pressure' and exploited - and argued that she should be awarded a further £2million. A High Court (pictured) judge rejected Caroline Hopkins claim for £2million after she signed a 'post-nuptial' agreement, which already entitled her to two properties, £350,000 and a share of her ex-husband's pension . Deputy High Court Judge Nicholas Cusworth QC, in a written ruling, said that he preferred Mr Hopkins's evidence - and added Mrs Hopkins had 'sought to underplay' the agreement and had 'dramatised' what happened. He rejected her claim of 'undue influence' and cleared Mr Hopkins of 'badgering and harassing' her. Mrs Hopkins had claimed her ex-husband was worth £54.3 million, although he put the figure at £38.4 million. She also accused her former husband of 'bullying' her into signing up to the deal. Mr Hopkins, 66, described by lawyers as a multi-millionaire property developer, disputed her claim and offered another £200,000. She said that when she had questioned the fairness of the agreement, he had become 'uncontrollably angry', raising his fist and tightening her clothes around her neck. But Mr Hopkins denied there was any such incident, but accepted there may have been 'some physical tension' between them during an 'extremely fraught' time as their marriage broke down. The court heard Mr Hopkins and Mrs Hopkins had written lists of 'how things could change' to each other shortly before separating. Mr Hopkins had written at the top of his list: 'I would like to be listened to' but Mrs Hopkins added 'listening' third on her list. The couple, now in their 60s, met in the 1980s while both were married with young children. They had a child together after what was described as a 'clandestine affair', but only married in 2009. After moving in together in Wincanton in 2001, they married after Mr Hopkins had begged her to give him 'one last chance', the court heard. But just over a year after their wedding, Mrs Hopkins went to see a divorce lawyer to seek advice about her entitlements – and the post-nuptial agreement was signed in August 2011. Under the deal, Mrs Hopkins got the family home - 'Lynwood', in Wincanton, which is valued at more than £530,000 as well as an investment property worth about £250,000. She also received a 50% stake in her husband's pension, worth more than £200,000. Deputy High Court Judge Nicholas Cusworth QC (pictured) said Mrs Hopkins had 'sought to underplay' the agreement . However, Mrs Hopkins had claimed liabilities, including legal costs bills, and said she would be left with less than £430,000, before pensions. She sought £2million, claiming she would need every penny to meet her reasonable needs. But the judge ruled it would simply be 'unfair' to Mr Hopkins if his ex-wife was not held to the terms of the post-nup. He found Mr Hopkins had done nothing which undermined her ability to 'form her own mind' about the agreement and what it meant. Mrs Hopkins, at the time, 'was rational, thoughtful, saddened by her situation, but certainly capable of independent thought'. 'She knew her own mind and was keenly aware of her own objectives', the judge added. Although Mr Hopkins had 'confessed to bullying behaviour' in some letters he wrote, Judge Cusworth concluded: 'I reject the wife's case that she was operating under any undue influence, duress or improper pressure when she entered into the post-nuptial settlement'. 'I do not find it to be a dishonest document. I find that it was entered into freely by the wife, and with full appreciation of its implications.' She had received 'copious volumes of legal advice' before signing her name on the dotted line. Mrs Hopkins had never contended for more than a 'needs-based award' following her divorce, and the judge said that was what the post-nup gave her. Lamenting the titanic expense of the case, the judge said the pair had run up lawyers' bills of more than £750,000 fighting over money. Even after receiving the £200,000 lump sum, Mrs Hopkins would still owe over £120,000 in legal costs. The cost of the case to Mr Hopkins came to £638,097 - including the lump sum awarded to Mrs Hopkins.","William and Caroline Hopkins married in 2009 after an affair in the 1980s .

"Dallas Mpala attacked his ex-girlfriend Gemma Holland (both pictured) at her home and left her with a broken vertebrae and horrific bruising . A violent thug who beat the mother of four of his children so badly he broke her back has been branded a 'lazy, violent parasite' by the judge who jailed him. Jealous Dallas Mpala, 30, of Tunstall, Staffordshire, attacked his ex-girlfriend Gemma Holland, 29, and left her with a broken vertebrae and horrific bruising. As he jailed Mpala for three years, Recorder Nigel Daly told him: 'You do not work and spend your time drinking and taking drugs while sponging off your current partner. You are a lazy, indolent, violent parasite.' The couple had known each other for 13 years but their relationship broke down in 2009 after Mpala was jailed two years for punching her, slapping her and whipping her with a belt. But on Sunday, April 20 2014, Ms Holland arrived at a children's party to find Mpala already there. He threw a can of beer at her head so she left - only to find Mpala waiting for her outside her house when she got home from a nightclub. Worried about making a scene, Ms Holland let him inside and turned him down when he asked to sleep with her. But she was then was woken up by Mpala punching her head. Prosecutor Richard Davenport told Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court: 'He was shouting and screaming. 'He accused her of sleeping with other men and punched her to her head. She felt incredible pain. He was so angry she feared for her life. 'He launched himself at her like a wild animal and bit her cheek. 'She was crying and begging him to stop. He said he wanted to kill her.' Gemma Holland (pictured) shows the injuries she sustained after being beaten by her ex Dallas Mpala . This x-ray of Ms Holland's back shows the temporary screws which were inserted after Mpala broke it . Ms Holland, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'At first I thought it was a dream - but then I woke up and he was still hitting me. 'He smashed up my phone, kept punching, kicking and biting me, he smacked my head against the wall and dragged me along the floor. 'I begged him to stop, and when he let me out to go to the toilet I just ran down the stairs and drove to my friend. 'If I hadn't told him I loved him he wouldn't have let me out, he would have killed me.' The attack has left her with short-term memory loss. She added: 'My friend thought I had been in a car crash. 'When he kicked me in the back and told me I couldn't leave, I thought I was going to die. 'It was the scariest moment of my life.' 'I thought he was leaving me for dead and that I would never leave that room - it's a miracle that I manage to escape.' Ms Holland and Mpala - he fractured her vertebrae in three difference places during the brutal attack . She was left with a bruised and swollen right eye which she could not open, a bruised nose, swollen left cheek, marks and bumps on her head and a sore back. She was later found to have three fractures of her vertebrae. Mpala pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was jailed for three years. He was also made the subject of an indefinite restraining order preventing him having any contact with Ms Holland. Now Ms Holland, 29, is warning other victims of domestic violence to seek help. She said: 'If there are any women going through what I suffered then they need to leave straight away and not look back.' 'When he turned up and said he had nowhere to go I let him in out of pity, but I didn't think it would end with me in hospital. 'I couldn't walk for a month afterwards because the injuries were so bad. I've still got a lot of back pain, and I'm on codeine to deal with it, but my memory's getting better. 'Now I'm just looking forward to a happy life for me and my family, without him.' Now Ms Holland is warning other victims of domestic violence to seek help as soon as possible .","Dallas Mpala, 30, attacked ex-girlfriend Gemma Holland at her home .

"An Episcopal minister at one of New York City's most iconic churches has been arrested after she allegedly swerved through lanes while intoxicated, and was found with an open container of alcohol and hundreds of prescription pills. Diane Reiners, 53, was taken into custody on March 13 after witnesses alerted police that her orange Toyota struck the Holland Tunnel's curb around 6pm and stopped in the middle of the road. Reiners was charged with driving while intoxicated, possession of a controlled substance in a motor vehicle, disobeying traffic and reckless driving, police said on Saturday, according to CBS.

Reiners, who is an assisting clergy for the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, had bloodshot eyes, smelled of vodka and had slurred speech, according to authorities. St. John the Divine is the fourth largest Christian church in the world and has one of the most iconic in the city of New York. It also remains unfinished - despite construction started in 1892. The responding officer found in her car an open bottle of Absolut vodka in the center console, a plastic water bottle filled with vodka, 31 anti-anxiety pill prescribed to someone else and more than 200 pills of potent painkiller, tramadol, according to the New York Post. The Port Authority cop had her take a field sobriety test which she failed. Reiners, who lost her husband to tongue cancer, was driving from Manhattan to New Jersey through the tunnel when an officer pulled her over for her erratic driving (above the Holland Tunnel where she reportedly struck a curb and stopped in the middle of the road) In 2012, Reiners was ordained as an Episcopalian minister, following her husband's death, and she is also an assistant priest at the Morningside Heights cathedral. She has worked in Emergency Management and Pastoral Care for over a decade, beginning with the 9/11 relief effort in which she coordinated the effort at St. Paul's Chapel, according to her LinkedIn account. It also said that her work has included responding to more than 25 nationally declared disasters. Reiners' car was impounded and she was released Friday night with a summons.

"Sarah stares at the camera, her pupils large and black, and her gaze unfaltering. Her soft skin is peppered with freckles and the corners of her mouth are turned, just slightly, at the corners. Though she is not quite smiling, she is beautiful in the dim light of the hospital room. She has a terminal illness and has accepted that she will soon die. She is one of 20 people photographed by American photographer Andrew George, who  spent two years in hospitals taking pictures of people like Sarah, who are preparing for the end of their life. ‘At least I got to see the black president,’ reads Sarah’s page in Mr George’s new book, Right Before I Die. Mr George, who lives in Los Angeles, wanted to explore perspective and what people value in their final moments, saying he admired the ‘brutal honesty’ displayed in his subjects’ testimonies. He decided to leave out their former professions, or the disease or condition that was killing them, calling these things ‘the least relevant facts’. Instead, as well as the haunting pictures, he gathered stories from their lives, vignettes of experience and fragments of how they would advise others. Here, in an extract from his book, he shares some of the photographs and accompanying words... Sarah, in her hospital bed. She said: ‘Time is so precious. God, it's precious. Life is definitely not infinite. You never know what is going to come up and you really have to take risks. I can’t really think about what’s fair – fair doesn’t make any sense. Things are not fair or unfair, it’s just the way life is. Things happen – or they don’t. You take opportunities – or you don’t’ Josefina, pictured in hospital, said she has never been afraid to die: ‘If you’re dead, you’re dead. That’s it. It doesn’t come back and I don’t think we reincarnate. I know The Bible says otherwise and I don’t want to contradict it, but to me, I don’t believe that. When we die, we die and we go to nothing. Dust to dust... I think the end of the world reaches you when you die’ René said his biggest regret is not being in touch with his daughter in El Salvador. He said: ‘I didn’t give her the right to be part of my life.’ He adds that there is ‘no such thing as happiness in life’. ‘What we call happiness are contributions; all we have is what we are and what we have given at that moment. The meaning of life is the search for it’ Joe wrote just these brief words to accompany his photo. He said: ‘I feel like I am the luckiest man in the world. I have a wonderful wife, son and daughter, grandchildren and great grandchildren. No one could ask for more than that' Sally said she was taking care of her sick brothers and sisters when she developed cancer. She said being in love is the greatest happiness in life: ‘Being in love is like being in a different world. You can take anything that’s dished out because there’s someone who cares for you. Happiness to me is when you feel good and you make somebody else feel good. You don’t even know what you’re doing and you’re making someone happy’ Kim said people should take the opportunity to tell others how they feel. She said: ‘I’ll be remembered by my mom and kids for how much I care about everybody. And I show it a lot because I think you should. I don’t think you should hold something like that back because we don’t know how long we’re here and if you love somebody you should tell them. They don’t have to love you back but I think that if you love somebody that they should know it because you never know – you don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow’ Nelly said although she has suffered hardship, she has no regrets. She said: ‘With my first husband I chose someone not knowing that he was a bad guy. I had never been with a man before and from day one throughout all six years of that marriage I had been hit... to the point where I had to go to work with bruises all over my body, raped many, many times and everything else. The day after my second son died, I came home and my husband punched me in the forehead, there was blood all over the place. A week after that, I left with my other son and we went to California. I went on with my life, I went to school and I never asked for child support or anything. I never looked back. I am very happy, actually, and I don’t have regrets even though I’ve been through hell. As far as I know, I’ve accomplished what I’ve had to accomplish in my life’ Sara said being loved makes people offer love to others. She said: 'I think growing up with love makes people give love back. And you have to five love to receive love, you have to be good without expecting anything in return. You do it because it comes from within you to do it. I’ve always fought to improve myself and risen to the occasion. It’s what I was taught growing up and was very ingrained in me. I think that’s what I’ll be remembered for when I pass on’ The exhibition, Right Before I Die, is being held at the Musea Brugge, Belgium, until 28th June 2015.","American photographer Andrew George spent two years in hospitals taking pictures of people who are terminally ill .

"It may only be a throwaway line in a recent patent, but Apple has further hinted at plans for a range of electric cars. In the patent, called 'Power management for inductive charging systems', Apple details a system of wirelessly charging 'portable electronic devices.' And within the list of examples, alongside phones and tablets, is reference to 'electric vehicles'. In the patent, 'Power management for inductive charging systems', Apple details a system of wirelessly charging (illustrated) 'portable electronic devices.' And within the list of examples alongside phones and tablets is reference to 'electric vehicles'. This is the only mention of cars in the patent . This is the only mention of cars in the patent and it could simply be that Apple is hoping its charging technology works with various types of devices. But it follows weeks of rumours that the firm is developing a fleet of either electric of self-driving vehicles. Apple first toyed with an in-car system at its Worldwide Developer Conference in 2013. At that point it was known as 'iOS in the Car' but following changes in the design team the system was unveiled at last year's Geneva Motor Show, under the moniker CarPlay. Google used its own annual developer I/O in June to unveil Android Auto, a key feature of its latest operating system Android Lollipop. Android Auto works with any Android Lollipop phone to show information on the dashboard. Google has signed up more than 28 car makers including Abarth, Acura, Alfa Romeo, Audi, Bentley, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Jeep, Kia, Maserati, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Ram, Renault, Seat, Skoda, Subaru, Suzuki, Volkswagen and Volvo. The first wave of Android Auto cars are 'coming soon' - expected to launch this year. The first car to be sold with CarPlay was Ferrari's FF in September. Other partners include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Citroen including its DS branch, Dodge, Fiat, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Jeep, Kia, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, Renault, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. And by 2016 all new Ford models are expected to have  Android Auto or CarPlay. 'Many electronic devices include one or more rechargeable batteries that require external power to recharge from time to time, said Apple in the patent. 'Often, these devices may be charged using the same or similar connection type, for example via USB. 'However, despite having common connection types, multiple devices often require separate power supplies with different power outputs. These separate power supplies are burdensome to use, store, and transport from place to place.' Apple added that charging cords are unsafe in certain circumstances including when 'a driver of a vehicle may become distracted attempting to plug an electronic device into a vehicle charger.' Apple's Watch is fitted with a form of inductive charging, for example, but the patent takes this technology a step further. The tech giant proposes an 'adaptive power control system' that can detect the weight or 'load' of the portable device that has been placed on it. It will then change the power supply accordingly based on which device is being charged and how much energy it requires. Recent reports claimed Apple has several hundred employees developing its own electric car at a secret lab. Speculation was rife last month when an Apple-owned car was spotted driving around California fitted with Street View-style cameras. Further cars were spotted in Florida and Hawaii. If Apple was developing such technology, it would would rival Google's self-driving cars. Google's head of self-driving cars recently said he expects people to be using them on public roads in two to five years.

Similarly, Apple is said to be working on a release date of 2020 for its own range of vehicles. These reports followed an email from an unnamed Apple employee that hinted the firm was developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' It described 'vehicle development' at the company but didn't reveal further information. In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range or a self-driving car that would ultimately also rival Google's autonomous project. The cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop self-driving software, for example.

"Accused: Ryen William Wilson has been accused of having sex with two students and pursuing two others at Wayne High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana . A male science teacher has been suspended after allegations that he had a threesome with two of his high school students in his classroom. Court documents have claimed that Ryen William Wilson also attempted to seduce two other pupils at Wayne High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, via text message. Wilson is accused of having sex with two students and pursuing two others. The 30-year-old is now facing two counts of child seduction. It has been claimed that 'Student One' told her friend 'Student Two' that she had been sleeping with Wilson in the academic year of 2013/14. The pair then claim they had a threesome with him, and 'Student One' later told police she had slept with Wilson a total of five times. It is understood the threesome happened only once. On March 13, police then spoke with a third student who said she was good friends with 'Student One' and let her her phone to text with Wilson until she got her own mobile phone. But 'Student Three' then said that Wilson continued to text her separately with comments such as “You know you want this"". She also told told police that she was then receiving so many texts from Wilson that she eventually had to change her phone number. According to court documents, the boyfriend of 'Student Three' later spotted the messages, got jealous and confronted Wilson via text. Police then spoke with a fourth student who told police she had also received texts from Wilson where he was regularly complimenting her looks. She said the flattery started after she sent him a question about homework on social media, and he responded saying she should text him on his private number with any further questions. Location: Wayne High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where the alleged threesome and attempted seductions took place . In Indiana, a teen 16 or older can consent to engaging in sexual behavior unless it’s with a person in a position of power like a teacher, adoptive parent/grandparent or military recruiter. Earlier this week, Fort Wayne Community Schools sent out a letter informing parents that two members of staff had been removed from classrooms at Wayne High School due to two separate incidents. It remains unclear why the second member of staff was suspended.","Ryen William Wilson accused of sleeping with two students in classroom .

"Former French Interior Minister Claude Gueant was yesterday placed under formal criminal investigation . Former French Interior Minister Claude Gueant was yesterday placed under formal criminal investigation over cash he allegedly received from Colonel Gaddafi. It is all part of a wider corruption enquiry into claims that Gueant's former boss, Nicolas Sarkozy, received millions from the late Libyan dictator. Gueant, 70, was Sarkozy's chief of staff during the 2007 election campaign which saw Sarkozy become French president. The central allegation is that Muammar Gaddafi directly funded the campaign, in return for Sarkozy's support. Both Sarkozy and Gueant deny the claims, but Paris judicial sources confirmed Gueant 'was being interviewed about the allegations from 6.45am today'. He faces a long criminal investigation which could end up in a court trial and prison sentence. Investigators were particularly interested in how Gueant could have sold two paintings by an obscure Flemish Baroque master for the record price of Euro 500,000 (£423,000). Gueant insists that the cash payment was a good price for Andries van Eertvelt 17th Century paintings of boats in a storm. Gueant said: 'I made the deal under personal circumstances, but I'm not an art investor' saying he sold them in 2008 to an unidentified Malaysian lawyer. But art experts say the paintings were not worth anything like that amount, and there are suspicions that the cash in fact came from Gaddafi. Sarkozy, who only completed one term as president before losing the 2012 election to Francois Hollande, has been dogged by corruption allegations related to Gaddafi. A document made public in Paris in 2012 is said to show that the pair sealed an illegal financial deal that propelled Sarkozy to power in 2007. Written in Arabic and signed by Mussa Kussa, Gaddafi's intelligence chief, in 2006, it refers to an 'agreement in principle to support the campaign for the candidate for the presidential elections, Nicolas Sarkozy, for a sum equivalent to Euro 50million'. Claude Gueant and Nicolas Sarkozy are accused of accepting cash from Colonel Gaddafi (above) to fund their 2007 election campaign . France's current Interior Minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said at the time: 'Faced with such serious allegations, backed up by documents sourced from the Libyan dictator's own entourage, Nicolas Sarkozy must explain himself to the French people. 'Several times in recent weeks, specific information has been published by the press relating to France's relationship with Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime.' A governmental briefing note among papers sent to the investigative news site Mediapart points to numerous visits to Libya by Sarkozy and his colleagues which were aimed at securing funding. One, said to have taken place on October 6, 2005, led to 'campaign finance to NS' being 'all paid' - assumed to be a reference to Sarkozy. At the time, Sarkozy was an ambitious interior minister who was raising money for his presidential election campaign, even though taking cash from a notorious tyrant would have broken political financing laws. Sarkozy, who only completed one term as president before losing the 2012 election to Francois Hollande, has been dogged by corruption allegations related to Gaddafi . As France's head of state, Sarkozy could not be prosecuted while in office, but within days of him losing the election, the Paris home he shares with his third wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni, was raided by anti-corruption police. Sarkozy turned on his friend Gaddafi at the beginning of the Arab Spring in 2011. French jets were the first to attack Gaddafi's tanks in a military campaign which ended with the Libyan leader being murdered. Sarkozy is now back as president of the opposition UMP party in France, and insists he is innocent of any wrong doing and can stand again for the presidency in 2017.","Claude Gueant, 70, placed under formal criminal investigation yesterday .

"With two protective arms wrapped around his little siblings, Ethan looks just like any proud older brother. But what this photograph doesn’t reveal is that these children were all conceived at the same time – although Ethan was born a full two years before his brother and sister. The trio arrived after their mother Katie Preston had struggled through five long years of unsuccessful IVF treatment – and started to think that she would never be able to have children. Mrs Preston says Ethan loves helping to look after his brother and sister, and kisses them goodnight. Mrs Preston said: 'We feel truly blessed' Katie and Matthew Preston, both 28, have 'miracle' triplets. Ethan, now two, (centre), was born in 2012, but Isabel (left) and Arthur (right), now three months old, were born two years and five days later . Mrs Preston, from Castle Vale in Birmingham, said: ‘It was heartbreaking. You end up beating yourself up, you ask yourself, why me? What did I do? What if I had done things differently?’ 'I would see a woman with a pram in the street and would go home and cry,' she said. 'Many of my family and friends were having families, and we just thought it would never happen for us. 'I used to blame myself, and Matthew would blame himself - we were at rock bottom.' The pair were referred to Midland Fertility for treatment with NHS funding in 2011. But Mrs Preston and her husband Matthew, who are both 28, then went through a successful round of a procedure called ICSI – or intracytoplasmic sperm injection – where an embryologist chooses a sperm and injects it into an egg. Ethan, Isabel and Arthur were made as part of six embryos created when parents underwent IVF treament. Their parents call them their 'miracle triplets' This is different from IVF, where lots of sperm are placed inside a dish near an egg, in the hope that this will encourage fertilisation to occur. The ICSI procedure resulted in five eggs from the same menstrual cycle being fertilised and then frozen. One was immediately inserted into Mrs Preston’s uterus. After two weeks, she took a pregnancy test and was delighted when she saw two little blue lines appear. Nine months later she became a mother for the first time. But four of the eggs were still waiting for her at the Midland Fertility Clinic in Tamworth, Staffordshire. The couple, who had always dreamed of a big family, decided to try again. 'We just couldn't discard them after the effort and dedication that went into creating them, so we decided to use them,' Mr Preston said. Two of the best eggs were allowed to thaw and again injected into Mrs Preston’s uterus and by December 13, 2014 – two years and five days after Ethan, she gave birth to babies Isabel and Arthur. She said: 'To our surprise at our first pregnancy scan, we saw not one, but two little heartbeats.' 'We think of our three children both as twins and a big brother, and as triplets. Mrs Preston, who works as a cashier at a bookmakers, said: ‘As soon as they told me how many eggs there were – they were my children. For me, the conception starts as soon as the sperm hits the egg. ‘I couldn’t have given them to science or to another couple. For some people they are just embryos but they were my children from day one.’ Despite the age gap, Mrs Preston often dresses all three children in matching outfits, and says the trio are very alike. Arthur and Isabel were conceived the same time as Ethan but were born two years after- in December 2014 . Mrs Preston, pictured carrying Ethan, was delighted when she became pregnant with her first child . ‘Isabel never sleeps and neither does Ethan. Arthur and Ethan were also very similar as babies. Arthur is a constant giggler like Ethan,’ she said, adding: ‘I now have three beautiful children, they are all so precious and I love them all to pieces.’ Mrs Preston, a cashier at William Hill, added: 'They are our three little miracles. 'December is a busy time for the Preston family now - but we wouldn't have it any other way. 'They keep me busy, and are certainly a handful but we feel complete and adore our triplets. Mrs Preston is determined to help others trying for children realise that ‘their dreams can come true’. She went on to say: ‘We want to keep other people motivated, you will have your children. One day it will be you pushing that pram.’ Dr Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility, said the Preston family’s story should help inspire other people who are trying to have children. She added: ‘Katie and Matthew had two pregnancies and three babies. Their story should give hope to many couples who are concerned about starting ICSI.’ The couple said they had hit 'rock bottom' before they were referred to the Midland Fertility for treatment with NHS funding in 2011 to become pregnant with Ethan . But Mrs Preston said she couldn't bear to get rid of the other embryos taken as part of the procedure called ICSI – or intracytoplasmic sperm injection – and by December 13, 2014 – two years and five days after Ethan, she gave birth to babies Isabel (right) and Arthur (left)","Katie and Matthew Preston, from Castle Vale, turned to IVF to conceive .

"A new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases, it has emerged. An official source told The Associated Press that the U.S. Secret Service will conduct  drone flights between 1am and 4am over the coming weeks in restricted airspace over Washington D.C. During missions, agents will look at how to interfere with rogue consumer-level drones, which commonly carry video cameras but are powerful enough to carry small amounts of explosives. The challenge for the Secret Service is quickly detecting a rogue drone flying near the White House or the president's location, then within moments either hacking it to seize control over its flight or jamming its signal to send it off course or make it crash. Growing trend: A new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases, it has emerged . The Secret Service has said only that it will openly test drones over Washington, but it declined to provide details such as when it will fly, how many drones, over what parts of the city, for how long and for what purposes. It decided to tell the public in advance about the tests out of concern that people who saw the drones might be alarmed, particularly in the wake of the drones spotted recently over Paris at night. Flying overnight also diminishes the chances that radio jamming would accidentally affect nearby businesses, drivers, pedestrians and tourists. It is illegal under the U.S. Communications Act to sell or use signal jammers except for narrow purposes by government agencies. Depending on a drone's manufacturer and capabilities, its flight-control and video-broadcasting systems commonly use the same common radio frequencies as popular Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies. Jamming by the Secret Service - depending on how powerfully or precisely it works - could disrupt nearby Internet networks or phone conversations until it's turned off. Testing in the real-world environment around the White House would reveal unexpected effects on jamming efforts from nearby buildings, monuments or tall trees. Signals emanating from an inbound drone - such as coming from a video stream back to its pilot - could allow the Secret Service to detect and track it. Federal agencies generally need approval to jam signals from the U.S. telecommunications advisory agency, the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Found: The recreational drone that landed on the White House South Lawn is seen in this U.S. Secret Service handout . That agency declined to tell the AP whether the Secret Service sought permission because it said such requests are not routinely made public. The Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed it formally authorized the Secret Service to fly the drones and granted it a special waiver to fly them over Washington. The agency declined to provide specifics about the secret program. In January, a wayward quadcopter drone, piloted by an off-duty U.S. intelligence employee, landed on the White House lawn. At the time, the Secret Service said the errant landing appeared to be accidental and was not considered a security threat. The agency had been looking at security issues surrounding drones before the January crash, but the crash of that drone led the agency to focus more attention on security issues surrounding small, unmanned aircraft that can be hard to detect. Previously published reports have disclosed that the Secret Service already uses jammers in presidential and vice presidential motorcades to disrupt signals that might detonate hidden remotely triggered improvised explosive devices. The United States Secret Service, in conjunction with other inter-agency partners, will conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems, in the coming days and weeks. Because these exercises will be conducted within the normally flight restricted areas in the Washington D.C. area, they have been carefully planned and will be tightly controlled. In preparation for these exercises the Secret Service has coordinated with all appropriate federal, state and local agencies. Researchers with the Homeland Security Department's science and technology directorate are working on strategies to interdict an unauthorized drone flying inside security areas. The research arm of DHS is trying to balance security concerns of the small, hard-to-detect devices, with the burgeoning commercial use and interests of hobbyists. Likewise, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration said last week it's studying how the U.S. can resolve privacy risks with increasing use of drones. The Homeland Security Department hosted a two-day meeting last month with industry officials, law enforcement and academics to discuss balancing security and commercial interests and establishing security practices. Days later, the Secret Service, which is part of the Homeland Security Department, distributed a three-sentence press release saying it will 'conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems, in the coming days and weeks.' Trying to keep drones out of a secure area can be tricky. There are basically three ways to stop a drone, said Jeremy Gillula, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation: block the radio signals linking the drone to its controller, hack the aircraft's control signals and trick it into believing it is somewhere else, or physically disable it. Some drone manufacturers program a 'geo fence' - location coordinates their drones treat as off-limits and refuse to fly past - into the drone's programming. Police could physically knock a drone out of the air with a projectile or use a net to catch it. 'If it were me that would actually be the first thing I would think about doing,' Gillula said. 'You would have to basically encase the White House in this net. It sure wouldn't look pretty, but in some ways it would be the most effective way.'","Secret Service has become increasingly worried about the threat to president from UAVs .

"Andreas Lubitz's fear that he was going blind - thought to be the reason for him deliberately crashing the Germanwings jet - may have just been in his head, it emerged today. The killer pilot had reportedly been living 'on the edge' because he feared his deteriorating vision, possibly due to a detached retina, would cost him his pilot's licence. But investigators now believe his condition was simply a nervous, psychosomatic disorder and not physical at all. Doctors say the symptoms brought on by stress can be cleared up with rest and therapeutic drugs, raising the harrowing scenario Lubitz needlessly took his own life and those of 149 others. An investigator close to the criminal investigation: 'If this is indeed the reason why he killed himself, and all those others, then he may have chosen to die for entirely the wrong reasons. 'He lived for flying and was terrified that he would lose his pilot's licence. In his mind that would have been worse than death.' Scroll down for video .

Detectives and prosecutors will examine the hitherto sealed medical files of the University Clinic of Dusseldorf to see if his complaint really was all in the mind. But these are often linked to psychosomatic disorders. The Internet is filled with chatrooms where people who thought they were going blind were relieved to find anxiety, stress and depression behind their problems. His aunt Brigitte W, today said she was unaware of Lubitz's health problems only knew him as a normal and happy man. The 79-year-old told Germany's BILD newspaper: 'I knew nothing of mental health problems and eye problems. 'When we celebrated family celebrations, he was happy. He never spoke of stress at work. 'We were proud of him, that he fulfilled his childhood dream.' She added: 'He flew intentionally into that mountain ridge. It is difficult for the family to cope now.' It is understood Lubitz complained of blurred vision involving dark spots in front of his eyes, halos and flashes of light, causing him to misjudge distances on occasions. It was claimed yesterday that Lubitz was concerned he was losing his eyesight, possibly because of a detached retina - with his vision already restricted to 30 per cent. The condition causes the thin lining at the back of the eye to detach from blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients - and is often marked by flashes in the eye.

Perilous: French Gendarme Bruno Hermignies stands by a bulldozer clearing a path to the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 in the mountains near Seyne-les-Alpes as the recovery operation continues . It also emerged today that Lubitz had been treated for 'suicidal tendencies' several years before becoming a pilot and trawled gay porn websites in the days before his death. German prosecutors revealed Lubitz had previously received psychotherapy 'with a note about suicidal tendencies' several years ago before he became a pilot. Speaking of the complex operation to build a complete psychological profile of Lubitz in the days before the crash, the police source in Dusseldorf told International Business Times that investigators have been trawling through his internet usage. 'We have a team disassembling his computer, and that of his girlfriend, because the information that we received was that he trawled the dark side of the web visiting, among other things, sites containing, suicide themes and sexual perversions,' the source said. Lubitz was reportedly the subject of gossip about his sexuality after a brief spell working as a flight attendant, and was nicknamed 'Tomato Andy' - a gay slur based on the fact that although many people believe tomatoes to be vegetables, they are actually fruits. Roland Wolff (third left), chief of the criminal division of the Dusseldorf police and head of the special investigative team, talks with colleagues as 100 investigators help to identify the victims of flight 4U 9525 . Yesterday, it was revealed by police that Lubitz suffered from a 'severe psychosomatic sickness' that required the care of several neurologists and psychologists. Police said they took away a plethora of medicines from his apartment in Dusseldorf and from his parental home in the small Rhineland town of Montabaur. Police have moved to seize the confidential medical records of the mass killer hitherto protected by labyrinthine privacy laws in Germany. They particularly want to know if his blurred vision was a contributing factor to his catastrophic psychological collapse which led him to pilot his A320 Airbus into a French mountainside, killing himself and 149 innocent passengers and crew. Yesterday, The Mail  told how investigators believe his eyesight problems - coupled with a breakdown in his relationship with his long-term girlfriend - triggered the 'madness' that ended in mass murder. Lubitz masked his true condition – described by police as 'severe burnout syndrome' – from his employers. He was aided by German confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was. Break: Kathrin Goldbach still lived with Lubitz in his Dusseldorf flat (pictured) but was looking for a new place . But police still don't know whether his vision problems, which are understood to have begun several years ago, were caused by his psychological condition or whether, as one officer said, he was in fact 'slowly going blind'. German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that it was unclear whether Lubitz's vision problems had physical or psychological causes. Meanwhile, another report in France from Le Figaro claimed Lubitz's vision was at just 30 per cent at the time of the crash, which saw the 27-year-old fly his A320 Airbus into a French mountainside. It is understood he once planned to marry pretty blonde teacher Kathrin Goldbach, 26, but she called time on his increasingly erratic and controlling behaviour which made her fearful for her own safety during his rages. One friend said: 'He tried to order her what to wear, what men she could speak to, even the length of her skirts. He was a control freak of the highest order.' Another friend added: 'She said he was very kind and attentive, but that he had problems with mood swings. And I think we sensed that she became more fearful over time.' The break, according to friends, came just weeks ago. She still lived with him but it is understood she was on the lookout for a bachelor-girl flat. Frantic that he would lose her, Lubitz splashed out thousands of pounds buying two Audi cars. He took delivery of one vehicle just five days before Tuesday's horror. His obsessive need to be in charge extended even to fast food. Habib Hassani, who runs a pizza restaurant near Lubitz's Dusseldorf home, said: 'He was extremely particular about pizza toppings. 'He wasn't interested in what was on the menu. It was often paprika, ham, onion and broccoli. He had to have it his way. He was compulsive about it.' Desperate: Frantic that he would lose her, Lubitz splashed out thousands of pounds buying two Audi cars . On Friday, it was revealed that his illness was so chronic that he had multiple sick notes from doctors, including one issued to him for the day of the disaster, discarded and ripped up in his home. As his complex and disturbed personality was reconstructed by investigators, the agony of his murder mission struck at the heart of his home town of Montabaur, for ever changed because of the actions of a Jekyll and Hyde figure whose warped personality made him lead two lives. On the surface, he projected stability, confidence and calm: the cool pilot who turned up at his grandparents' home wearing his crisp Germanwings uniform. He was a fanatical runner, and he liked discos, cars, cooking and music. But his insecurity demanded constant attention – which led him to betray Kathrin with a five-month fling with a Germanwings stewardess conducted in cheap hotels where they stayed while working. 'He was always seeking assurances about the way he looked and the way he was viewed by others,' said the former lover, identified only as Maria, 26. She painted a portrait of a 'tormented and erratic' man who would wake up from nightmares screaming: 'We're going down, we're going down!' She added: 'He once told me he would do something to change the whole system, that the world would know his name and remember him.' He lived up to the macabre promise when he smashed his aircraft into a mountainside on Tuesday when the emotional volcano within him finally erupted. His mind disorders, despite treatment, could no longer be restrained. A spokesman for Lufthansa, the parent company of the budget airline, said the carrier was unaware of a psychosomatic or any other illness affecting Lubitz.","Andreas Lubitz was 'living on edge' because he feared losing pilot's licence .
Reported that his vision was down to 30%, possibly due to detached retina .

"Olive oil has long been linked with lower levels of cholesterol, blood pressure and a multitude of other health benefits. And while food companies have attempted to get it into the diets of more people by adding it to margarine, a team of scientists has gone a step further. The Italian researchers have discovered a way to convert the liquid state of extra virgin olive oil into a gel, without the need for other solids. Italian researchers have discovered a way to convert the liquid state of extra virgin olive oil into a gel, without the need for other solids. The so-called Gel Oil comes in different flavours (shown above) Known as Gel Oil, the food scientists said it can be added to salads and sandwiches, used in cooking and can be flavoured. Variations include lemon and basil. Olive oil (pictured) has long been linked with lower levels of cholesterol, blood pressure and a multitude of other health benefits . The discovery was made by 10 chemical engineers from the Italian University of Calabria in the southern town of Arcavacata. They used a technique called 'organogelazione' which involves subjecting the properties of certain molecules known in the food industry, such as emulsifiers, to a range of temperatures. When these molecules are heated and mixed they were found to form new structures. The university's food engineering department headed by Professor Bruno de Cindio said: 'In this network structure, the oil remains 'trapped' within the changing texture and transforms itself, in the first stage, into a gel form and, in a second stage, into a creamy spreadable paste.' He added that said that this also means it can be produced in various consistencies from a slightly stickier version ideal for dressing salads and other foods to a more solid variation that can be spread like margarine or butter on bread. The innovation has been patented and the team said it sees huge potential particularly among people with dietary restrictions or moral objections to dairy products such as vegans. The team are now hoping to create a company to sell Gel Oil and already developing variations flavoured with lemon and basil. Valeria Greco, one of the researchers of the team, said: 'Our idea certainly meets the needs of a new customer profile. 'People are increasingly being forced to have fast food meals and that means ready to eat products, but at the same time there is reluctance to compromise on quality and taste and our product very much caters to this market.' Scientists have found olive oil could cut your heart attack risk in just six weeks. The study published in November by the University of Glasgow, found that regular consumption of olive oil dramatically improved chemical signals in the body linked to coronary artery disease. It added just 20mls a day – about four teaspoons - to the diet of healthy adults, which is the amount used in a salad dressing or mopped up by bread during a meal. But a range of signals for heart disease measured in the urine improved in only six weeks, according to the report published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Scientists have found olive oil could cut your heart attack risk in just six weeks. The study, by the University of Glasgow, found that found regular consumption of olive oil (pictured) dramatically improved chemical signals in the body linked to coronary artery disease . Researchers at the Universities of Glasgow and Lisbon and private firm Mosaiques Diagnostics in Germany investigated the effect of olive oil on heart health in a group of 69 men and women who did not normally eat it. The volunteers were split into two groups and asked to consume 20mls of olive oil either low or high in phenolics every day over a six-week period. Phenolics are natural compounds found in plants, including olives, thought to be responsible for the protective effect of olive oil. The research team applied a new diagnostic technology by examining urine samples for a range of peptides (produced by the breakdown of proteins) already identified as biomarkers of diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD). Known as proteomics, the technology can pick up altered levels of certain proteins which suggest early signs of disease before symptoms appear. The results showed both groups saw a big improvement in scores for CAD – the most common form of heart disease. Dr Emilie Combet of the School of Medicine at Glasgow University, said ‘What we found was that regardless of the phenolic content of the oil, there was a positive effect on CAD scores. ‘Any olive oil, low or high in phenolics, seems to be beneficial. ‘Our study was a supplementation study. If people in the UK replaced part of their fat intake with olive oil, it could have an ever greater effect on reducing the risk of heart disease.’","Engineers at the University of Calabria, Italy, created the bright gel .

"A dog survived eight days in a building which had caught fire claiming the lives of two people. Zeus the dog went missing in Schenectady, New York state and ended up in an abandoned building which had been destroyed by a fire. The bodies of two men were found in the building. Chief of the local fire department Raymond Senecal told Wnyt.com that his officers spotted the dog peering out of a window and started the process of retrieving him. Scroll down for video . Stacey Lyndon was delighted to be reunited with her dog Zeus who was missing for more than a week . Zeus was lured from the destroyed building by firefighters with the offer of a slice of pizza used as bait . He said: 'We were able to get up there and lure him out with a little bit of pizza of all things. He looks really happy. I think he's probably a little bit hungry. 'I don't even know. It's incredible.' The fact that the dog survived the inferno is the second piece of luck for Zues who was rescued by his owner Stacey Lydon who found him tied to a pole. She said: 'I never gave up hope. I really didn't. Without any signs of a body, I would never stop looking for him.' Sergeant Matt Dearing of Schenectady Police Department told Global News: 'Obviously crews are progressing, continuing to try to remove debris and attempting to locate any remains still left inside 104 Jay Street.' The fire broke out as the area endured sub-zero temperatures to such an extent that water froze solid onto the fire fighters battling the blaze. Firefighters and their equipment were covered in ice on Friday as they fought the blaze in Schenectady . Zeus the dog was rescued from the building, pictured, after it was destroyed by the massive inferno . Three fire fighters were injured as was one person who leaped from the fifth floor to escape from the fire. The fire first broke out in a building across from city hall and spread next door. Both buildings had apartments on upper levels and commercial space on the ground floor. The cause of the fire is unknown. Chief Senacal said his officers were forced to shovel out snow which had buried several fire hydrants in a bid to battle the blaze. Firefighters remained at the scene for almost 24 hours in an effort to extinguish the flames.","Zeus the dog spent eight days inside a building which had caught fire .

"A devoted husband who complained about his dying wife's care was mistakenly investigated for attempted murder after an NHS call-handler misunderstood his comments. John Histon called the health service after allegedly being told by a paramedic that call-outs to his wife Betty were 'becoming costly'. Mr Histon said he told the 111 operator: 'I suppose it is best to get her to suffocate and she won't be a problem to you.' The 70-year-old was then horrified when police turned up on his door 24 hours later saying ambulance trust staff reported he was threatening to kill his wife. A paramedic is said to have moaned that call-outs to terminally ill Betty Histon were 'becoming costly'. When her husband complained to the NHS he was investigated for attempted murder over comments he made . After searching his home in Bristol and finding Mrs Histon - who had chronic lung conditions - asleep in bed, they dropped the investigation and the NHS has since apologised. Mr Histon, who has since lost his wife to long-standing lung problems, said his and her treatment in her final days was 'shocking'. The retired decorator from  Bristol said: 'When they turned up on the door they asked me ""do you know why we are here?"", I assumed there had been a break-in in the area. 'They said they had an allegation that I have tried to smother my wife - I thought it was a hoax. I was shocked and nearly hit the floor. 'I never deserted her and cared for her right to the very end so it was very distressing to be accused and I was very angry.' Former auxiliary nurse Mrs Histon had a lung condition and her concerned husband called for paramedics on December 15 when she was struggling to breathe. He claims the paramedics who attended said the call-outs to the grandmother were 'becoming a costly exercise'. Mr Histon said: 'The young female paramedic said ""what do you expect, there is no point in admitting her to hospital, there is nothing we can do for her"". 'She was quite cocky about it and she said looking at the notes it looks like they had been called out quite frequently and it was becoming ""a costly exercise"".' Mr Histon called the NHS 111 service - who work with the ambulance service - the next day to lodge a complaint. An ambulance was called to Mrs Histon's suburban street (pictured) in Bristol by her husband. Police arrived the following day after an NHS call handler misunderstood comments he made over the phone . 'I said to the operator I suppose it is best to get her to suffocate and she won't be a problem to you again to try and emphasise how upsetting it was to be told we were some kind of burden to them,' he said. 'I thought nothing of it until the next evening I got a knock on the door from the police. 'They said they had received an allegation I had tried to smother my wife. They said it was from the ambulance.' Mrs Histon died in January from bronchopneumonia and Mr Histon is considering legal action against South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust over his and his wife's treatment. A spokesman for the trust said: 'Mr Histon raised concerns regarding advice he had been given by one of the ambulance crews who attended his wife. 'He also had concerns about a safeguarding referral made following Mr Histon's comments about it being 'best to get her to suffocate'. 'The Trust has given Mr Histon sincere condolences following the loss of his wife, and is sorry that he took offence from the advice given to him by the ambulance service. 'The Trust has also confirmed that the safeguarding referral to the police could have been managed differently, however, due to the number of vulnerable people the trust comes into contact with, staff are always very sensitive to such comments. 'Mr Histon has confirmed that he will be pursuing some form of financial compensation and although he has received a full response from the Trust regarding his complaint, should he feel there are any elements he still requires further clarification on we would urge him to get in touch.'

"Fraser and Karina McGruer, pictured with daughter Olivia, want their summer born sons Louise (front left) and Alistair (right) to start in reception class in September . A father has claimed a lack of common sense is preventing his twin boys from starting school a year later because they were born in late August. Fraser McGruer’s boys Alistair and Louis turned four last summer but they put off joining lessons because they were too young. Now they have been told that when they start school in September this year after reaching the legal age for compulsory education, they will have to go straight into Year One and not join reception classes with pupils just weeks younger than them. Mr McGruer claims Hertfordshire County Council is either ‘unaware of or ignoring’ government guidelines in which ministers make clear children’s interests must come first. The Department for Education issued guidance to schools and councils in July 2013 and last December making it clear that there is no rule stating that a child has to be in the right school cohort for their age group. Summer-born children can wait until the September after their fifth birthday if their parents feel they need more time to develop. And it suggests delaying the start of school by 12 months should be 'no barrier' to the child then starting in reception class. Last Wednesday schools minister Nick Gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom, telling councils and headteachers to do 'what's in the best interests of the child'. But on the same day as Mr Gibb addressed MPs, Hertfordshire County Council wrote to the McGruer family to say Louis and Alistair would not be able to join the reception class in September. The brothers were born on August 22, 2010, some 11 weeks premature. They were due in November, which would have put them in the following school year starting in September 2015. Mr McGruer and his wife Karina, who also have a daughter Olivia, 6, have carried out their own research into summer born children and education start dates. Louis and Alistair both currently attend Flying Start Montessori Nursery, Sawbridgeworth. Two years ago they asked the council to delay the boys’ start date for a year, but still in reception. But last week the request was rejected, and the boys have been told they must go into Year 1 in September 2015 or they risk losing a school place at Mandeville Primary School where they originally applied. They have since changed the application to Spellbrook Primary School in Bishop’s Stortford. Mr McGruer told MailOnline: ‘Academically and emotionally, the boys are nowhere near ready to start year one – they would effectively be a year younger than many of their classmates . ‘We have produced large amounts of evidence from professionals involved in our children’s lives, supporting our case, but the local authority has dismissed it.’ The McGruers have been told they must start in Year One. They have since applied to attend Spellbrook Primary School in Bishop’s Stortford . He claims the council’s actions ‘clearly contradict’ the guidelines set out by the Department for Education and is calling for a rethink as a matter of urgency. ‘Despite the ins and outs of the issue, the basis of our request is very simple: our sons were born 11 weeks early, this should be acknowledged in the admissions process,’ said Mr McGruer, a filmmaker and photographer. ‘I think this is common sense coming up against a ‘computer says no’ attitude from Hertfordshire County Council. ‘Up and down the country, Local Authorities are either unaware of or ignoring the guidelines set down by the government at a national level. ‘The school we have applied to – Spellbrook Primary School – have indicated they understand our situation and are ready to accept the boys as we are requesting - if the places are allocated by the Hertfordshire County Council.’ A spokesman for the local authority said: 'The county council’s policy, as the admissions authority for community and voluntary controlled schools in Hertfordshire, is that all children should have a school place in the September following their fourth birthday. 'However, requests for children to be admitted out of year group are made on an individual basis taking into account all relevant information. 'The application for Alistair and Louis McGruer was considered in line with our published admissions policy. The evidence submitted was not ignored but carefully considered by a panel of officers.' Education minister Nick Gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom, telling councils and headteachers to do 'what's in the best interests of the child' Department for Education guidance allows parents to delay their child's schooling until the September after their fifth birthday. This policy, updated last spring, is designed to help children with birthdays between April 1 and August 31. This is because because experts believe they are more likely to struggle academically if they start school after just turning four. The Department for Education guidance says: ‘An increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents, local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer-born child to start school. 'There are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class'. But some campaigners say years of unclear and conflicting government advice on the policy has allowed schools and councils to use a loophole to push these children into Year 1 to ease pressure on places in reception. New government guidelines was introduced after research showed summer born children were more likely to struggle at school, do worse in exams and have less chance of getting into university. But some councils are still sending youngsters straight into Year 1 if their parents hold them back unless they can prove there were 'exceptional' circumstances. Mr Gibb told MPs that there had to be 'flexibility' from schools and councils when agreeing the start date for children who turn four just weeks before the start of the school year. Giving evidence to the education select committee, he said: 'The key thing is flexibility, and I think that admissions authorities and headteachers do need to do what's in the best interests of the child.' He added: 'If a child is very immature for their age and they are born in those summer months, and it's the very strongly held view of the parents that the child should start school in the following September, which is when the law says they should start, I think admissions authorities should be flexible and should do what's in the best interests of the child.' He stressed that councils mist include parents in discussions about when their children start school. But Michelle Melson, of the Summer Born Campaign, claimed that problems in arranging different school start times have worsened . She told the committee: 'We do have a compulsory school age in England, so children should be able to start at compulsory school age.' She added that summer-born babies who do start school after they are five are starting at compulsory starting age and should not miss out on reception by being placed straight into Year 1. 'Parents are being forced to enrol their child in school early, prior to compulsory school age, in order to have a reasonable chance of getting a place in their preferred schools.'","Fraser McGruer says Hertfordshire Council is at odds with guidelines .

"Listeriosis, a food-borne illness, linked to some Blue Bell ice cream products did not cause the deaths of three hospital patients, but it may have been a contributing factor, according to Kansas health officials. However, the only information provided about the patients at Via Christi St. Francis hospital in Wichita, Kansas, is that they were adults, said Sara Belfry, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said five people, three women and two men, developed listeriosis in Kansas after eating products from one production line at the Blue Bell creamery in Brenham, Texas. Officials have not released their names, and the CDC did not specify the gender of those patients who died. The deaths prompted the Texas icon's first product recall in its 108-year history. Scroll down for video . Listeriosis, a food-borne illness linked to some Blue Bell ice cream products did not cause the deaths of three hospital patients, but it may have been a contributing factor, according to Kansas health officials. The deaths prompted the Texas icon's first product recall in its 108-year history . Listeria bacteria were found in samples of Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Country Cookies, Great Divide Bars, Sour Pop Green Apple Bars, Cotton Candy Bars, Scoops, Vanilla Stick Slices, Almond Bars and No Sugar Added Mooo Bars, said the FDA (above the Blue Bell products that had listeria bacteria found in them) Listeria bacteria were found in samples of Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Country Cookies, Great Divide Bars, Sour Pop Green Apple Bars, Cotton Candy Bars, Scoops, Vanilla Stick Slices, Almond Bars and No Sugar Added Mooo Bars, said the FDA. Blue Bell said its regular Moo Bars were untainted, as were its half gallons, quarts, pints, cups, three-gallon ice cream and take-home frozen snack novelties. It also said it has recovered all recalled products that were in stores and in storage. The five patients became ill with listeriosis during their hospitalizations for unrelated causes between December 2013 and January 2015, said hospital spokeswoman Maria Loving. According to a statement on Friday from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all five of the people sickened were receiving treatment for unrelated health issues at the same Kansas hospital before developing listeriosis, 'a finding that strongly suggests their infections (with listeria bacteria) were acquired in the hospital,' the CDC said. However, uncertainty remains as to where the patients acquired bacterial infection. Blue Bell said its regular Moo Bars were untainted, as were its half gallons, quarts, pints, cups, three-gallon ice cream and take-home frozen snack novelties (above the No Sugar Added Mooo Bars that have been recalled) There appeared to be some uncertainty as to where the patients acquired the listeria bacterial infection (above the Almond Bars which have had traces of listeria bacteria found in them) 'Via Christi was not aware of any listeria contamination in the Blue Bell Creameries ice cream products and immediately removed all Blue Bell Creameries products from all Via Christi locations once the potential contamination was discovered,' Loving said in a statement Friday to The Associated Press. Information has been available from four of the five patients on what foods they had eaten in the month before the infection. All four had consumed milkshakes made with a single-serving Blue Bell ice cream product called 'Scoops' while they were in the hospital, the CDC said. 'Scoops,' as well as the other suspect Blue Bell items, are mostly food service items and not produced for retail, said Paul Kruse, CEO of the Brenham creamery. The CDC said the listeria isolated from specimens taken from four of the five patients at the hospital matched strains isolated from Blue Bell products obtained this year in South Carolina and Texas. Four patients in hospital had consumed milkshakes made with a single-serving Blue Bell ice cream product called 'Scoops' while they were in the hospital, the CDC said (above the Cotton Candy Bar that has also been recalled) The five patients became ill with listeriosis during their hospitalizations for unrelated causes between December 2013 and January 2015, said hospital spokeswoman Maria Loving (listeria bacteria were also found in Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Country Cookies, above) Blue Bell handles all of its own distribution and customer service, Kruse said, so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves, most of them institutional, as soon as it was alerted to the South Carolina contamination February 13. Kruse did not suspect handling of those products after they left the Central Texas creamery. 'The only time it can be contaminated is at the time of production,' he said. That contamination has been traced to a machine that extrudes the ice cream into forms and onto cookies, and that machine remains off line, he said. All products now on store and institution shelves are safe and wholesome, Kruse said. However, 'Contaminated ice cream products may still be in the freezers of consumers, institutions, and retailers, given that these products can have a shelf life of up to two years,' the CDC statement said. Blue Bell handles all of its own distribution and customer service, Kruse said, so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves, most of them institutional, as soon as it was alerted to the South Carolina contamination February 13. Kruse did not suspect handling of those products after they left the Central Texas creamery (above pictures from the Blue Bell factory in Brenham, Texas) CDC recommends that consumers do not eat products that Blue Bell Creameries removed from the market, and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them (above Via Christi St. Francis hospital in Wichita, Kansas) Cincinnati-based supermarket chain Kroger removed recalled Blue Bell products from 860 of its 2,625 stores and the company is alerting customers through its recall notification system, spokesman Keith Dailey said in an email. 'We would not sell any product that we believed to be potentially harmful to our customers,' said Dailey when asked if Kroger has confidence in Blue Bell products not affected by the recall and that remain on store shelves. Listeria is a food-borne illness that is especially dangerous to pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, those with compromised immune systems, and other serious conditions (like diabetes, kidney failure, liver disease, and HIV). It rarely causes serious illness in healthy people and can be treated with antibiotics. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, nausea and diarrhea. Because it can be so serious for some people, outbreaks of listeria generally cause more deaths than other pathogens such as salmonella or E. coli. An outbreak of listeria linked to Colorado cantaloupe in 2011 caused 33 deaths. Those at high-risk are advised to avoid eating hot dogs, cold cuts and other deli meats. They should also avoid fermented or dry sausages unless they are cooked properly. Refrigerated meat spreads and pâtés could also contain the bacteria. Scientists recommend people with a weak immune system should also avoid soft cheese unless it is labeled as made with pasteurized milk. CDC recommends that consumers do not eat products that Blue Bell Creameries removed from the market, and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them. The Texas Department of State Health Services said facilities like Blue Bell's are inspected on a monthly basis. The agency added that no enforcement action has previously been taken against the facility in Brenham and it is operating in compliance with food safety laws. It is not unusual to see listeria outbreaks linked to dairy products, including ice cream, said William Marler, an attorney who represented victims of a 2011 listeria outbreak that killed 33 people and was traced to a Colorado cantaloupe farm. In December, an ice cream company in Snohomish, Washington, recalled nearly a year's worth of ice cream and related products because of possible listeria contamination that sickened two men. Marler said he thought Blue Bell had responded appropriately once it knew its products were linked to illnesses and deaths. His only criticism was that Blue Bell did not mention the patients who were sickened or died in Kansas in a statement on its online site, and instead mentioned it was the first re-call in 108 year-history. Listeriosis is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes, the CDC said. Almost everyone who is diagnosed with listeriosis has invasive infection, meaning the bacteria spread from their intestines to the blood, causing bloodstream infection, or to the central nervous system, causing meningitis. Although people can sometimes develop listeriosis up to two months after eating contaminated food, symptoms usually start within several days. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics, the CDC said.","Kansas health officials said listeriosis was not cause but a contributing factor in the three deaths of patients at Via Christi St Francis hospital .
Five people in total developed listeriosis in Kansas after eating products from the production line at Blue Bell creamery in Brenham, Texas .
Contamination has been traced to a machine that extrudes the ice cream into forms and onto cookies, which remains off line .
Listeria bacteria were found in samples of Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Country Cookies, Great Divide Bars, Sour Pop Green Apple Bars, Cotton Candy Bars, Scoops, Vanilla Stick Slices, Almond Bars and No Sugar Added Moo Bars ."
"Social workers have offered the teenage victim of paedophile teacher Jeremy Forrest the chance to meet with him to explain the impact of his grooming . The schoolgirl who was groomed and abducted by paedophile teacher Jeremy Forrest has been offered the chance to meet him by social workers. Forrest was jailed after he had sex with the girl, then 15, and fled to France with her - finally being arrested after a week on the run. In the case that followed - during which the child at first pledged to stand by the maths teacher and professed her love for him - it emerged Forrest had begun grooming her when she was just 14. The girl's mother told BBC Radio 5 Live Daily that social workers had approached her daughter, who is almost 18, and offered her the chance to meet Forrest. They said the meeting could take place as part of the restorative justice scheme, where victims are given the chance to meet criminals so they can explain the impact of their actions. It is also thought to help to rehabilitate offenders by allowing them to see the personal impact their crime has had, and take responsibility. All meetings are supervised and in a controlled environment. Davina Williams, who has changed her name to protect her daughter's identity, said her daughter had not yet decided whether to take up the offer. But she added that the choice would be her teenage daughter's only. She said: 'I know she's in control of whatever happens next and rightly so. As a parent, you protect as much as you can as children and you teach the best you possibly can to give them the best start in life. 'When they are adults, you have to allow them to lead their own life. You don't have any control. I will always be here. I will always be her mum whatever happens. Scroll down for video . 'When a child has been groomed, it can take months, it can take years for them to accept that this has happened to them. You can't force them, you can't make them, they have to do it their own time. While they go through that process they have to find a way to cope with it.' Forrest previously worked at Bishop Bell School in East Sussex. He began his relationship with the girl on a school trip to Los Angeles when she was 14 and was seen holding her hand on the plane – something she claims he was doing to comfort her as she was struggling with bulimia. Forrest was arrested after he was seen with the girl in Bordeaux after they fled to France under false names . She opened up to him about the break-up of her parents' marriage before he kissed her in a classroom. She said they would have sex in his Ford Fiesta or hotels, which they would check into as Mr and Mrs Forrest. They first had sex when she was 15 and it later emerged that Forrest had been grooming the pupil since she was 13. Restorative justice is a government scheme aimed at giving victims a voice. It allows victims to meet perpetrators of crime to explain the personal impact of their actions upon them. Meetings are held in a controlled environment and offenders must have admitted the crime. All meetings are supervised. The scheme allows offenders to take responsibility for their actions and try to make amends with their victims. For offenders, meeting their victims can be a challenging experience because they are forced to confront the personal impact of their crimes. Restorative justice is used in a bid to rehabilitate people who have committed a number of crimes include violent offences and sexual assaults. According to the restorative justice council it accounts for a 14 per cent reduction in reoffending. In 2012 police were alerted to their relationship and the pair fled to France, using false names. They had planned to set up a new life together and Forrest left behind his marriage and career. The pair were found when they were spotted in Bordeaux after eight days on the run. Forrest, who was married at the time, was convicted for sex offences and abduction and was jailed for five-and-a-half-years. He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life. After the case the teenager said: 'I love Jeremy so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once he's out, we can marry and have children.' Forrest had previously insisted he was not a paedophile but had simply fallen in love with the teenager. Last year the girl, then 16, was said to have started a new relationship with a 20-year-old part time teacher and security guard. Forrest, 32, is due to be released in the summer.","Jeremy Forrest was jailed for five-and-a-half years for abducting the pupil .

"A former member of the Islamic State today claimed he witnessed the British graduate dubbed Jihadi John behead a Japanese hostage. The man, named only as Saleh, said the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives. Jihadi John, who was recently unmasked as 26-year-old Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, was last seen in a video posted online which appeared to show Japanese hostage Kenji Goto lying dead. Saleh, who worked as a translator, also revealed that ISIS routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die. ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi who is known as Jihadi John (seen, left, with Japanese hostage Kenji Goto) was a senior figure tasked with murdering foreign captives, claims a defector known as Saleh (right) Face of a killer: Saleh, who worked as a translator, revealed that Emwazi (above) routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die . Speaking to told Sky News in broken English from Turkey after fleeing ISIS, Saleh said: 'When he killed Kenji Goto, I live showed this (saw this) but not near, from a little (distance). 'The big boss was there with them. Turkish man say ""put this camera there, change place there"" but John (was) the big boss. 'All time, all time say to all ""fastly, fastly, fastly, we should finish"". So respect him. Only he talks orders - others do.' Saleh said the prisoners would be given Arabic names to make it appear like they were with friends and continually reassured that they would not be killed. He said: 'He would say to me ""say to them, no problem, only video, we don't kill you, we want from your government [to] stop attacking Syria. ""We don't have any problem with you; you are only our visitors"".' Saleh said he explained to the hostages that they were safe, but always knew they would be killed. His comments explain why so many of the prisoners appear so calm in the executions videos right up to the point where the knife is placed against their throat. A still photo of  Kenji Goto holding a picture of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh. ISIS defector Saleh revealed how hostages were given Arabic names to give them the impression they were among friends . After Mr Goto was killed, Saleh said three of four men put the body in the boot of a car and drive off, with Emwazi leaving in a different direction. Appearing with his face covered, the man added Jihadi John won respect for murdering foreign prisoners. He said: 'Maybe because he use the knife. I cannot understand why he is so strong. 'One man can kill and all people will respect. A Syrian man anyone [in ISIS] can kill. But strangers [foreigners], only John.' And hostages were routinely subjected to mock executions, with their captors telling them they would not be killed as it was a show for the camera, according to Saleh. Murderer: Jihadi John seen (in black mask) leading the execution of a dozen prisoners. Emwazi was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives, according to defector Saleh . Kuwait-born Emwazi had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities, but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several Western hostages. In e-mail exchanges with a journalist, the University of Westminster computer programming graduate said he considered suicide after coming face to face with what he suspected to be a British spy as he attempted to sell a laptop computer in 2010. Jihadi John rose to notoriety after he first appeared in a video posted online last August, in which he appeared to kill American journalist James Foley. Dressed in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose, and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig. He later featured in a video with Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.","Defector: Mohammed Emwazi was responsible for killing foreign prisoners .

"A leading paediatrician has said he would rather his children used marijuana than alcohol, such is the devastation that drink can cause. Aaron E. Carroll, professor of paediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, said while he would prefer youngsters to use neither, if forced to make a choice, he would opt for pot. Writing for The New York Times, he said that as his children grow up, he is frequently asked - given his profession - which of the two substances he would prefer them to use. He said: 'The immediate answer, of course, is “neither"". And after sifting through all the studies and all the data, I still say “neither"". Usually, I say it more than once. 'But if I’m forced to make a choice, the answer is “marijuana"".' Aaron E. Carroll, professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, said while he would prefer youngsters used neither alcohol or marijuana, if forced to make a choice, he would opt for pot . His decision is based on research into a number of factors - essentially the harm caused by both drugs. But in the course of his debate, he explains that while marijuana is easy to demonise because it's illegal, the evidence shows that in terms of harm and death, alcohol causes significantly more damage. He goes on to argue that while research has linked marijuana to changes in the brain and psychosis, as well as changes in lung function and cancer risk, 'these are all associations, not known causal pathways'. Instead, he explains, there may be other factors that explain these links - perhaps people with mental health problems are more likely to use the drug, he suggests. However he warns what many of us - especially parents - do is overlook the huge dangers of alcohol. He cites statistics from the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, which state that alcohol use is a factor in 40 per cent of all violent crimes in the United States, including 37 per cent of rapes and 27 per cent of aggravated assaults. What many of us - especially parents - do is overlook the huge dangers of alcohol, he warns . No such association has been found among marijuana users. 'People who are high are not committing violence,' he explains. He goes on to add that nearly 20 per cent of male delinquents and 10 per cent of female delinquents have an alcohol problem. Meanwhile binge drinking was responsible for around half of the 80,000 alcohol-related deaths in the United States in 2010, whereas cannabis kills virtually no one. He also factors in statistics for drink driving and domestic violence - and once again, alcohol fares worse. As it does in terms of long-term dependency. Professor Carroll states that while nine per cent of pot users eventually become dependent, more than 20 per cent of alcohol users do. From first-hand experience as a paediatrician, he says he has also seen more damage - some almost fatal -  caused by alcohol poisoning. Then there is the link with unprotected sex, drunken fights and accidents - all of which are significantly more likely when alcohol is thrown into the mix. Despite being marginally in favour of marijuana over alcohol, Professor Carroll denies his arguments are 'pro pot' - nor is he burying the negative effects of the drug. Indeed, he goes on to acknowledge marijuana does have risks and negative consequences - and they are 'certainly greater than zero'.","Aaron E.

"Ants may be the perfect workers - they share chores, solve complex problems and work to the death without complaint. And now the behaviour and appearance of nature’s most diligent insect has been emulated in plastic and metal, with the creation of BionicANTS. German engineers have crafted machines that mimic the cooperative behaviour of a colony, because the robots can make individual decisions as well as work as a team. Scroll down for video . German engineers have crafted mechanical ants (shown) that mimic the cooperative behaviour of a colony because the robots can make individual decisions as well as work as a team . The robots (pictured), which are around the size of a human hand, have been developed by German engineering firm Festo . The robots, which are around the size of a human hand, have been developed by German engineering firm Festo. And they are capable of manoeuvring objects, hinting that such robots could one day replace humans as factory workers. The firm said: ‘For the first time, the cooperative behaviour of the creatures has also been transferred to the world of technology using complex control algorithms.’ The machines work together to complete difficult tasks, such as manipulating a large object, as real ants do in nature. They do this by using a stereo camera fitted in each robot’s head which helps an individual ant locate and identify target objects. An ant can then pick it up using serrated grippers below its head. Sensors enable an ant to be aware of its surroundings and the robotic insects communicate over a wireless network to coordinate their actions. The robots have plastic, 3D printed bodies with electric circuits printed on top, (pictured) while their legs and grippers are ceramic actuators which can bend precisely and easily using little energy . ‘Like their natural role models, the BionicANTs work together under clear rules,’ said Dr Ing Heinrich Frontzek, head of future concepts at the firm. ‘They communicate with each other and coordinate both their actions and movements. ‘Each ant makes its decisions autonomously, but in doing so is always subordinate to the common objective and thereby plays its part towards solving the task at hand.’ Amazon has launched a competition encouraging engineers to create its next generation of shelf-picking robots. Bots will battle it out at the ICRA conference in Seattle in May. 'The challenge combines object recognition, pose recognition, grasp planning, compliant manipulation, motion planning, task planning, task execution, and error detection and recovery,' Amazon said. Participating robots will earn points by locating products on shelves, retrieving them and putting them into cardboard boxes ready to be sent to customers. Points will be deducted for dropped or damaged good and the team that creates the winning robot will win $26,000 (£17,463). Amazon currently uses robots by Kiva Systems to fetch items so its human workforces doesn’t have to walk as far in its vast warehouses. But its machines can't pick and pack products yet. The robots have plastic, 3D printed bodies with electric circuits printed on top, New Scientist reported, while their legs and grippers are ceramic actuators which can bend precisely and easily using little energy. The aim of the project is to create intelligent bots that could work in factories, taking over production jobs from humans. This is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Amazon already uses an army of 15,000 robots in its huge warehouses to pick up items ordered by customers. ‘Each ant makes its decisions autonomously, but in doing so is always subordinate to the common objective and thereby plays its part towards solving the task at hand (pictured)’ the company said . The BionicANTS will go on show at Hannover Messe - the world’s largest industrial technology fair - in April, along with other creations such as the firm’s robotic butterflies (pictured) Festo's bionic butterflies are incredibly light and are able to fly as a collective. Ten cameras installed in the room record the butterflies using infrared markers. They transmit this position data to a computer, which coordinates the artificial insects' flight. The intelligent networking system creates a guidance and monitoring system to stop the butterflies colliding, which could be used for drones working in future factories. While they are not as cute as the ants and work alongside humans, they are able to deliver heavy stacks of toys, books and other products to employees to pack.

Festo has also developed a robot inspired by the chameleon, called the FlexShapeGripper.

It uses the principle to grip a wide selection of objects in a form-fitting manner using an elastic silicone cap and can even pick up several objects, such as ball bearings, at once.

"When Moonlight the cat went missing almost nine years ago, his distraught owners tried everything to find him, before giving him up for dead six months later. But now the beloved pet has been reunited with owner Rosie Collier, 52,  after turning up at a vet's surgery two miles away from her house in Chediston, Suffolk, earlier this week. Mrs Collier, who lives with husband John, and 17-year-old daughter Melba, says the beloved animal is now back living with them and their other pets. Moonlight initially disappeared while staying with Mrs Collier's parents, Denise and Chris, in Wenhaston, while Mrs Collier was on holiday. Rosie Collier, 52 (centre), and daughter Melba (centre left) were reunited with pet Moonlight after nine years when a member of the public brought him to vet Jenny Reason (far right) who found he was microchipped . Mrs Collier said Moonlight went missing nine years ago while she was on holiday, and the family gave him up for dead after a cat matching his description was found in the road, but he miraculously survived . When she returned the family spent months looking for Moonlight, before a cat matching his description was found dead in the road. Mrs Collier said the family were 'devastated' at the loss, and even planted a special memorial tree for Moonlight in their back garden. However, unbeknownst to them, the pet was actually alive, and is believed to have survived wild on a nearby heath, hunting and killing his own food. Believing he was a neighbour's cat, a female animal-lover in the village occasionally fed Moonlight whenever he stopped by, but took him to the vet after noticing he had lost some fur. When the cat got there, medics discovered he had been microchipped, and were able to track down his owners. Mrs Collier said: 'I simply couldn’t believe it - it’s just miraculous! I was just so surprised, I really did not expect to ever get good old Moonlight back. 'I was in shock at first but then I had a huge grin from ear to ear for the rest of the day.' The news was particularly exciting for Melba, who was just eight at the time the cat went missing, and was distraught over losing him. Mrs Collier explained: 'There were buckets of tears. Melba was very distressed, even her dance teacher can still remember how upset she was - it was that traumatic.' But rather than inform her daughter straight away, Mrs Collier waited until Melba, who celebrated her 17th birthday yesterday, returned from Bungay college that evening to break the news. Mrs Collier believes Moonlight was living wild on a nearby heath, eating whatever he could catch. A female animal-lover also fed him scraps, and then took him to the vet when she noticed he had fur missing . Melba said: 'I was just really shocked. Eight years is a really long time and so I was not expecting it at all - it’s just so good to have our Moonlight back after all this time.' After a cautious reintroduction to Echo, the family’s golden retriever, and two new pets, Tilly the black labrador and Dusty the cat, Moonlight is happier than ever. Mrs Collier said: 'I was not sure he would remember us after so many years but he came straight home and he has been purring and rubbing himself up against us. 'He obviously still knows and remembers who we are - even the dog.' 'We always knew he was a good hunter, so if he was alive he would probably be OK looking after himself. 'We think he must have been living wild on the heath near here, killing rabbits and mice, but also taking advantage of people who would feed him. 'We are just so happy to have Moonlight back - it’s a genuine miracle.' Vet Jenny Reason, who discovered Moonlight was microchipped, added: 'When a missing pet turns up, it’s usually a matter of days, sometimes a little longer, but I’ve never known a pet to return after over eight and a half years. 'It’s a fantastic story - and just goes to show why it’s so absolutely vital to chip your pet.'","Rosie Collier, 52, said Moonlight went missing almost nine years ago .

"There's been acai,  kale, chia, and goji berries. But another obscure superfood new on the market in Australia is being heralded for its multiple health and beauty benefits, which include aiding in weight loss, slowing down cellular ageing, energy boosting, reducing skin conditions such as eczema, and giving a glowing complexion. While superfoods from the sea are nothing new, brown algae is being called superior due to its high levels of protein and fibre. Victoria Beckham, Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the stars said to have adopted brown algae into their lives and their bodies. Britney Spears is also a fan and reportedly even eats it raw. Stars' secret weapon: Victoria Beckham (left) and Gwyneth Paltrow (right) are reported to be among brown algae's celebrity fans . Slimy superfood: Many are using brown algae as an alternative to green algae due to its reportedly superior health benefits that include aiding in weight loss, slowing down cellular ageing, and helping skin conditions . Algae is any plant based organism that grows in water. So, when you’re talking about seaweed, you’re talking about algae. Spirulina lacks the same levels of fibre and is harvested from farms, leaving it open to possible contamination. Brown algae is most familiar to people as kelp and is especially common in the cold clean waters of the Northern Hemisphere where it is sustainably harvested. But how can this superfood help you lose weight? In one word, iodine. Iodine is a crucial element in weight loss as it regulates the thyroid gland, a gland in your neck that hormones can either wreck havoc or cause balance in our bodies. Natural benefits: Brown algae has a high concentration of iodine, one gram is reportedly equivalent to 50 times the recommended daily intake . Most Australians have an acute deficiency in Iodine because we don’t eat enough wild fish, seaweed or algae. This means a lot of Australians suffer hyperthyroidism or under stimulated thyroids leading to unnatural weight gain. Now, brown algae has an extraordinarily high concentration of iodine, one gram is reportedly equivalent to 50 times the recommended daily intake. Because of our natural iodine deficiency, it’s argued that increasing your consumption can increase your metabolic rate and in turn help you burn more calories. When it’s fresh it is slimy seaweed, and for this reason it is often dried, powered and consumed in capsule or shake form. Some recommend trying it with rice milk. It reportedly contains unique antioxidants and fibres that have been linked to emerging studies that show anti-cancer, anti-viral and anti-bacterial benefits as well as promoting anti-senescence which is the process of slowing down cellular ageing. Drink it down: As consuming slimy seaweed can be less than palatable, it is often dried and powdered. Divinita arrived on Australian shelves in November . Brown algae is also high in other nutrients like calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, chromium, copper, selenium and zinc and many B-vitamins . Professor Peer Schneck from Queensland University’s School of Agriculture and Food Sciences said his research shows that brown algae seaweed is more rich in antioxidants than acai berry and contain more vitamins that tomatoes and pumpkins.' It also keeps you feeling fuller for longer. ‘It comprises more protein than eggs and has a low GI,' said Professor Schneck. 'This is particularly important because it allows the body to slowly digest the contents which may help with the feeling of satiety and allow for better absorption.’","New super food has gained attention for its health benefits .

"As we approached another huge rapid, I had to pinch myself for a second. White-water rafting had been on my bucket list for years but to do it with Ben Fogle in the middle of the Amazon is a moment I will never forget. Hurtling along the Jatunyacu River in between steep mud cliffs with the loud buzzing noise of the jungle I felt like I was starring in my own version of Jurassic Park. ‘You can just imagine a teraductile flying overhead,’ Ben quipped. ‘The light, the scenery, the air, the people, it’s really unlike anywhere else in the world’. Trip of a lifetime: I was lucky to join adventurer Ben Fogle on a tour of Ecuador . Satey briefing: Ben watches on as our white-water rafting guide Gabriel gives us the lowdown . Setting sail on our Amazon adventure: Ben and I, on the right of the boat, receive instructions from our guide . I was invited to accompany 40-year-old Ben on a trip to the country where his life of adventure and travel all started. Ecuador has long-been associated as a gateway to the much more popular Galapagos Islands or simply a pit stop on a tour of South America. But from the bustling city of Quito to the stunning Andes, the Amazon jungle and the sublime beaches, it's much more than that. Ben’s first trip as an 19-year-old, unable to speak a word of Spanish, saw him spend a sobering night in a Quito prison cell and endure 15 rabies injections in his stomach after getting bitten by a dog. However the incidents did little to phase Ben as he says it was that trip that he decided he wanted to make a career out of travel. ‘I never believed I would do it,’ says Ben, husband to Marina and father to Ludo and Iona. Taking a breather: I prepare for the next stage of our descent down Cotopaxi volcano . The food: 'Guinea pig intrigues me. I'm still trying to master it. I’m an animal lover so actually one of the hard things I always have is embracing local food.' The people: 'In the South American countries the people are very friendly. The weather: 'We went from the Amazon where it was very hot to the chilly Andean Mountains. The light and sky is incredible in Quito.' Favourite moment: 'I've done white-water rafting a few times but this time was really amazing.' Weirdest moment: 'Getting whipped by nettles in the middle of a market near people eating their chicken and rice was a strange but memorable experience.' Scariest moment: 'When I first came to Ecaudor I was arrested and put in a  cell for a night for not having my passport on me. I was also bitten by a dog and had to have loads of painful rabies injections in my stomach!' The changes: 'Ecuador has changed unimaginably since I first came here. The infrastructure has vastly improved and it’s so much more geared to tourists.' ‘It’s gone in a strange convoluted way. It’s hard being away from home but I love my job. I love meeting people and exploring and experiencing new places.’ It was a place on BBC reality show Castaway in 2000 that propelled Ben into the spotlight. Since then he's raced 160 miles across the Sahara desert, rowed across the Atlantic Ocean with Olympian James Cracknell and presented numerous programmes including Countryfile, Crufts and Extreme Dreams. For the last 18 months he's also become a Worldwide Touring Ambassador for Virgin Holidays and using his vast experience he helped curate the itinerary for this trip. He's packed a lot into his 40-years but tearing down Cotopaxi Volcano on a mountain bike was a first for us both. He climbed the mountain as a teenager but this time took a more exhilarating route down. He said: ‘Everyone assumes I love everything but if you look at the history of all the adventure things I’ve done like they are usually slow. It was a bit scary but that’s what makes it so fun.’ Next up was a spot of horse-riding at the historic Hacienda San Augustin de Callo, which is built on the site of an Inca Palace. The current owner, glamorous Mignon Plaza, inherited the property from her grandfather, Leonidas Plaza, two-time president of Ecuador. Food for thought: Cow hooves and roasted guinea pig are popular local dishes in Ecuador . Llama selfie: I grabbed one of the friendly animals for a quick photograph . Llamas roamed around the hotel’s beautiful cobbled courtyard so I grabbed one for a selfie. Adventure sports aside we also took in the culture of the magical country. The voyage started in Quito, the highest capital city in the world, perched at 3000m on the eastern slopes of Pichincha, an active volcano. The Casa Gangotena Hotel, situated in the old town overlooking the Plaza De San Francisco, was a great place to recharge our batteries and adjust to the altitude. Joining  local travel film Metro Adventures we enjoyed a walking tour of the historic centre, a Unesco World Heritage Site, which features 40 colonial churches and chapels, including the stunning La Compania de Jesus church which is decorated in gold. 160 years in the making: The stunning La Compania de Jesus church was painted in gold leaf by hand . Bizarre medical practice: Ben Fogle gets his torso whipped by Señora Rosa in San Francisco market . I also witnessed bizarre scenes at the nearby San Francisco market where local healers whip willing punters with stinging nettles to raise energy levels. Ben took the plunge, stripping down to his underpants in between displays of meats from cow hooves to llama and paying $10 for the privilege. Afterwards angry red welts covered his body. He said: ‘It was a very strange but memorable experience. She said a had bad energy and a lethargy and a problem with my breathing which could be the altitude or from my recent bout of pneumonia. 'Maybe it was the relief of escaping the nettles, but I had a spring in my step and felt revitalised as I left the market.’ Flying the flag: Ecuador's national colours are seen above the Government Palace in Quito's Plaza Grande . Perfectly maintained: The beautiful Plaza Grande in Quito is a place for locals and tourists to relax . We also dropped in more unique local businesses including the famous sweet shop Las Colaciones De La Cruz where we tried our hand at sugar-coating peanuts in a wooden bowl over a hot fire. Carrion’s Restorations is a bizarre business which restores baby Jesus dolls while also doubling up as a facility to treat people with skin conditions. Jesus dolls are traditionally kept in the lounge of all of the Catholic households in Ecuador. Typically they are dressed in the occupation of the family members with a Jesus doctor, a construction worker and even a soldier with a gun among those we saw on sale. We also took part in a culinary masterclass at chocolatier Chez Tiff located in the Calle La Ronda art district. Strange tradition: Jesus dolls are sold wearing the traditional dress of various occupations . The area is home to lots of local artists and a place for children to play with games including hula hooping lining the main cobbled colonial street. After spending time in Quito we visited Guamote’s local market where thousands of indigenous people, dressed in traditional ponchos and hats and accompanied by pigs and llamas on leads, descend every Thursday. One of the busiest corners of the market was a café selling guinea pig. Previously faced with tarantula and rattle-snake, animal lover Ben admits this typical Andean cuisine still mystifies him. Ice cream break: Dulce Place in Calle La Ronda specialises in unusual flavours such as white corn . ‘Guinea pig intrigues me’, he said. ‘I don’t think it’s the tastiest of meats but the locals genuinely love the taste. It’s not something I’ve mastered yet. It’s very fatty.’ Locro (potato soup), Ceviche and a meat selection dinner, served on a hot volcanic rock which you then use to BBQ the food yourself, are other popular dishes we experienced on our journey, mixed down with a Canelazo, a traditional Ecuadorian drink of warm spiced cinnamon mixed with tequila. Cow foetus is also a delicacy in Ecuador but we steered clear of that. Each mealtime we quizzed Ben on his adventures and can report he is much more fun that I had imagined, even trying to help one young man in our party score a date on Tinder. Local life: Locals in traditional ponchos and hats descend every Thursday to Guamote market . Devil's Nose train: The route, which costs £15 per person, offers beautiful views of the Andes . Our tour also included an 800-metre descent on the Devil's Nose train, which zig zags down the spectacular mountainside on the route between Quito and Guayaquil and a trip to the lush hot springs in Papallacta heated from nearby Coxopaxi. Getting lost in the Amazon was an added bonus that was not on the itinerary. Due to a mix up with collection points after our rafting experience, myself, the Virgin Holidays PR and two fellow journalists found ourselves stranded along the edge of the Jatunyacu River. Impressive: Huge bridge which crosses the Jatunyacu River had a Jurassic Park vibe . Out of this world: Ben and I check out the Jatunyacu River before we go white-water rafting . Amazon life: Carly Reed, our lovely Virgin Holiday PR, and I meet the locals . QUITO . Casa Gangotena Hotel . RIOBAMBA . La Andaluza Hotel . BANOS . Samari Spa Resort . PAPALLACTA . Termas Papallacta . Activities arranged by Metropolitan Touring . The 11-day Andes to the Amazon tour with Virgin Holidays is available from £3645pp. For more details visit Virgin Holidays . With no shoes, phone, water or sun cream, we used our broken Spanish to mingle with locals and have a beer. When our mortified tour guide turned up three hours later we were almost disappointed. Ben, who had earlier dashed off to eat whittchety grubs at a local Amazon community during the incident (as you do), told us such moments are what adventuring is all about. He said: ‘I am an optimist so I always see the positives in everything. You got to experience a little bit of local life in the Amazon which is amazing. ‘An adventure is all about taking yourself out of your normal routine and experiencing something new.’ I couldn't agree more.","Ben's life of adventure and travel began on a trip to Ecuador 21 years ago .

"Raffaele Sollecito has been spotted looking at a £100,000 car in the wake of his murder acquittal after being accused of killing British student Meredith Kercher. Mr Sollecito, who spent four years in prison after previously being found guilty of  the murder of Surrey-born Meredith, 21, in 2007, is said to be looking at compensation. The 31-year-old was spotted looking at a £105,000 BMW at a dealership in Rome following his aquittal on Friday. 'Healing'? Raffaele Sollecito, who was cleared of murdering Meredith Kercher on Friday, was seen looking at a £105,000 BMW at a dealership in Rome . Raffaele Sollecito, pictured in Rome today with a family member, may be seeking compensation for the four years he spent in prison after being convicted of the murder of 21-year-old Meredith Kercher . The Italian and his American ex-lover Amanda Knox, 27, were both sensationally cleared on Friday, bringing an end to a see-sawing legal process which spanned more than seven years and saw them both serve four years in prison. Speaking later at a press conference in Rome, Mr Sollecito described the ruling as an 'end to the nightmare'. He spent four years in prison before being freed in 2011, said he wanted to get back to his old life after enduring over seven years of 'a kind of pain without an end'. Until Friday's ruling, life was a 'kind of limbo,' Sollecito said. 'So for me, the wounds inside my soul, inside my heart ... it's very hard to erase them.' He said he needed 'time to heal,' and 'time to really breathe this fresh air.' Planning ahead: Sollecito's lawyer says her client will wait for Italy's top court to give the reasoning behind the acquittal, expected in about three months' time, before taking a decision on compensation . Raffaele Sollecito (right) flanked by his lawyer Giulia Bongiorno, talks to the media during a press conference in Rome. He described the ruling as an 'end to the nightmare' Amanda Knox vowed to return to Italy just two days after being cleared of murdering British student Meredith Kercher. She is pictured (left) speaking after Friday's decision and (right) after her initial acquittal in 2011 . 'I feel today like someone who was kidnapped, who after seven years and five months has returned to freedom,' Sollecito said. Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said on Monday her . client, would wait for Italy's top court to give the . reasoning behind the acquittal, expected in about three months' time, before taking a decision. 'We have already heard people talking about compensation ... if we want to make someone pay,' Bongiorno said at a news . conference. 'We will see if any mistakes were made, what . measures to take, but this is all far in the future.' Yesterday, Knox's lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Mr Sollecito's father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' Arline Kercher, Meredith's mother, described the ruling on Friday night as 'odd'. She said: '(I am) a bit surprised, and very shocked, but that is about it at the moment. They have been convicted twice so it's a bit odd that it should change now.' A view of the house where British student Kercher was killed. It is understood Knox will go back to Italy to write a book about the country's legal system . Knox and Sollecito were pictured embracing as police searched the house immediately after Kercher's death . Her daughter, who was 21 and from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy. Miss Knox told reporters outside her family home in Seattle on the day of the verdict that she was 'full of joy'. 'Right now I'm still absorbing what all this means and what comes to mind is my gratitude for the life that's been given to me,' she said. Seattle-born Miss Knox, 27, who was Ms Kercher's flat-mate, and Mr Sollecito, spent four years in jail for the murder but were acquitted on appeal in 2011. But Italy's highest court on Friday overturned last year's convictions and declined to order another trial. The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation is the final ruling in the seven-year case and definitively ends the gruelling legal battle. The pair always maintained their innocence. Both Sollecito and Knox were imprisoned shortly after Kercher's body was discovered with 47 separate wounds on November 1, 2007. They were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively. After they served four years in prison a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent. Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years. Judge Gennaro Marasca read the decision to finally acquit the pair on Friday after a judicial body had deliberated for ten hours. It was met with stunned silence. Rudy Guede is now the only person to be successfully convicted of the murder. The unemployed basketball player was found guilty in October 2008 and was convicted to 16 years after his footprints were discovered in Kercher's blood. The court will publish its reasons for Friday's decision within 90 days.","Raffaele Sollecito spotted looking at a £105,000 BMW after acquittal .

"A University of Southern California chief has vowed to carry out his own investigation into claims  the son of Empire star Taraji P. Henson was 'racially profiled' on campus. The school's Public Safety director, John Thomas, said he was 'disturbed' by reports the actress's son Marcel had been stopped by police on campus for having his hands in his pockets. It comes after Henson revealed she had now decided to send the 20-year-old to historically black Howard University. Scroll down for video . Taraji P. Henson says her son Marcel was racially profiled by police at University of Southern California. The mother and son are pictured above at a film screening in Hollywood last April . Empire star Henson, 44, says her son was stopped at University of California (file picture) for having his hands in his pockets . In an interview with Uptown magazine, she said her son was racially profiled elsewhere in California beforehand and did 'exactly everything the cops told him to do, including letting them illegally search his car. 'It was bogus because they didn’t give him the ticket for what he was pulled over for,' she said. 'Then he’s at University of Southern California, the school that I was going to transfer him to, when police stopped him for having his hands in his pockets.' After learning of the USC allegation, John Thomas revealed that he too had experienced racial profiling as a teenager . In a statement, he said: 'I was deeply disturbed to read news reports about a prospective student who felt profiled on or near campus because of his race. 'We encourage reporting of allegations of bias and I hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother. Henson has revealed she has now decided to send her 20-year-old son Marcel to historically-black college . 'I would like to look into this matter further and better understand who was involved and what took place. 'As someone who personally experienced racial profiling as a teenager, I have a stake in learning more about this incident and doing all I can to reach a just resolution.' He said he was not yet clear on which police departments were involved and that 'any allegation of bias or unequal treatment by university officers would trigger an investigation that I would supervise along with the university's Office of Equity and Diversity'. He continued: 'It is my expectation and that of the university that our department uphold the highest standards of constitutional policing, affording equal rights and respect to all persons.' Marcel is Henson's only child, and his father was her high school sweetheart. New hit: Henson currently stars on Fox drama Empire as Cookie Lyon, the recently-released-from-prison ex-wife of a music mogul (played by Terrence Howard) After revealing her son's ordeal, the 44-year-old said in the interview: 'So guess where he’s going? Howard University. I’m not paying $50K so I can’t sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus. Also in the interview, Henson spoke about how happy she was to be one of now many black women leads on the small screen in shows like Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder. 'It feels good that there’s not just one black person. I don’t like that we get fixated on one or two at a time, or three at a time. If you look at Caucasian Hollywood, every year there’s a handful of new faces you’ve never seen before, then after that, they got five movies coming out and they’re introducing you to more talent. So I’m just so happy to see what’s happening on television right now. We have options and that’s how it should be,' Henson said. Proud mother: Henson and her son pictured on January 20, 2013 - attending a celebration for leading women in Washington, DC . Empire aired it's two-hour first-season finale last week, and has already been green-lighted for a second season. Henson plays Cookie Lyon on the show, the ex-wife of a rap music mogul (played by Terrence Howard) who was recently released from prison after taking the fall for his drug-dealing business. The show has had several guest starts in the music industry including Snoop Dog, Courtney Love, Rita Ora, and Jennifer Hudson.","Taraji P.

"Miriam Clegg, pictured in Leicester Square today, lifted the lid on life at home with husband Nick and their three sons Alberto, Antonio and Miguel . Miriam Clegg today boasted that she is a much better cook than her husband Nick, as the political battle of the kitchens continued. The Lib Dem leader’s wife mocked Ed Miliband’s two kitchens, insisting she only had one and it did not have a sofa. She also agreed her husband is a ‘dish’, spoke about her faith, and revealed how she won the battle to give their three sons Spanish names. The Spanish lawyer, who uses her maiden name Miriam González Durántez, used a series of interviews today to promote her Inspiring Women campaign to encourage school girls to reach their full potential. She said: ‘This is not about famous women and celebrities This is about all women. When people say there are not enough women role models its because they do not realise that the role models are not necessarily always in glossy magazines. They surround me in the streets, right? ‘I think this is too important the girls realise they can look for role models wherever they are. They are all there, they just need to look for them.’ She lifted the lid on life at home with husband Nick and their three sons Alberto, Antonio and Miguel. Appearing on LBC radio, she was quizzed about her recipe for croquetas, which she once cooked for Nigella Lawson. She insisted that she is a much better cook than Nick. ‘When it comes to cooking there is no contest. I’m better. There are few things I will win, cooking is one of them.’ In the run-up to the general election there has been much focus on the interior – and number – kitchens owned by politicians. After Mr Miliband posed in a small kitchenette with his wife Justine, it emerged that he had a larger kitchen on a lower floor. And David Cameron has been seen in both his Downing Street kitchen and at his constituency home in Oxfordshire, where he made his surprise vow not to seek a third term. The Prime Minister said last week: ‘To me, the kitchen is where you spend all your time. It needs a sofa you can slump on, a table you can sit at, a kitchen you can cook in, a place children can do their homework.’ But Mrs Clegg protested: ‘I only one have kitchen and I don’t even have a sofa in my kitchen.’ The Spanish lawyer, who uses her maiden name Miriam González Durántez, used a series of interviews today to promote her Inspiring Women campaign to encourage school girls to reach their full potential . Miriam Clegg boasted that she is a better cook than husband Nick, but insisted she only has one kitchen at their home in Putney, south west London . The couple met when they were studying in Belgium, and they married in 2000. She denied that they met dancing, and was honest about what first attracted him to her: ‘When you’re 20 you're impressed by anything else but by the looks.’ When LBC presenter Shelagh Fogarty remarked that the Lib Dem leader is a ‘dish’, Mrs Clegg replied: Well that’s what I think.’ But Fogarty went too far when she said he was ‘good looking in a head boy kind of way’. Mrs Clegg shot back: ‘You are talking about my husband!’ Mr Clegg spent the day answering questions at a Mumsnet event (left) and launching a Mental Health Charter for Sport and Recreation (right) Mrs Clegg is a staunch Catholic, and their sons are being brought up as Catholic despite Mr Clegg being an atheist. The family often attend Mass together in west London. She said: ‘Listen I have faith and I have always that faith is a gift., it has helped me in my own life to cope with some of the difficulties. ‘This is probably too personal a comment but when I lost my father its what carried me through. I hope that I can pass it on to my children, or at least I will try to bring it there then it’s up to them to make up their mind. ‘We are very tolerant generally of all faiths and in our families we have all sorts of faiths.’ She also revealed how their three sons got Spanish first names. ‘They’ve got Clegg afterwards, it was to compensate,;’ she said. Antonio was her father’s name ‘so he couldn’t say no’, and she almost died when she was giving birth to Alberto ‘so he had to give it to me’. Miguel is the patron saint of the village where she is from in Spain.","Miriam Clegg boasts that she is better in the kitchen than husband Nick .

"A deadly strain of bird flu has been found in a Minnesota commercial turkey flock. The virus devastated a flock of 15,000 turkeys in western Minnesota's Pope County. It's the same highly pathogenic H5N2 strain of avian influenza that's been confirmed in backyard and wild birds in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. However, it's the first appearance of the strain in the Mississippi flyway [states around the Mississippi river] said Dr. Bill Hartmann, Minnesota's state veterinarian. Fewer than 100 of the turkeys were still alive by Thursday, Hartmann said. The flock has been quarantined and the remaining birds were being killed. A flock of 15,000 turkeys was wiped out on a farm in Minnesota in a week by a deadly strain of bird flu carried by wild waterfowl that are not sickened by it. The strain has already been found in the Pacific Northwest . Dr. Bill Hartmann (left) said that this is the first appearance of the strain in the area. Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Dave Frederickson (right) said: 'We can only prepare for the worst and hope for the best' No other commercial flocks are nearby, he said, but 'backyard flocks' within a 10-kilometer area (approximately six miles) were being tested for the disease. The virus is carried by wild waterfowl that aren't sickened by it. The incubation period is approximately 21 days. 'We're encouraged that we'll be able to prevent the spread of the disease,' Hartmann said. 'We should be able to contain this without much difficulty.' 'If we can get through the next 21 days without finding anything, we should be in good shape,' Agriculture Commissioner Dave Frederickson added. Minnesota is the nation's top turkey producer, with industry groups claiming to produce some 46 million turkeys each year worth around $750 million. Frederickson said about 8 per cent of that production, or $92 million worth, was exported in 2013. He acknowledged that those exports could take a hit, as poultry exports from states in the Northwest already have. 'We're very cognizant of that,' Frederickson said. 'We can only prepare for the worst and hope for the best.' The risk to humans is low, state and federal officials announced on Thursday. Minnesota Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger stressed there is no danger to the general public . Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger said the only humans at risk were four people who worked directly with the infected flock and they will be monitored. However, no human infections from this strain have been detected anywhere, he said. 'There are no food safety concerns at this time,' Ehlinger said. 'This is not a threat to the general public.' Hartmann said he was prohibited by law from identifying the farm or saying where it's located in Pope County. Nearly all commercial turkey operations keep their birds inside large barns and they never go outside. Hartmann said that was the true for the affected farm, too. He said turkeys in only one of the farm's four barns got sick. Farm workers found 70 dead turkeys on February 26 and notified the state the next day when hundreds died. The state got confirmation of the virus from a U.S. Department of Agriculture lab on Wednesday night. The state veterinarian said it was possible the virus may have been tracked into the barns from fecal material left by infected wild birds. It's also possible for infected waterfowl to transmit the virus to shore birds that might then get into a turkey barn, he added.","Authorities in Minnesota are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best as a deadly strain of bird flu wipes out a flock of 15,000 turkeys .
It is the same strain of H5N2 that has been found in wild birds across Washington, Oregon and Idaho .

Tribute: The Duchess, 33, was at St. Paul's with husband Prince William for a service commemorating the men who died in Afghanistan . Windy: She also had some trouble with her hat, thanks to the chilly March breeze that sprang up . As she made her way outside, the Duchess went over to speak to the families and exchanged smiles with some of the brave fighters before joining the crowds outside for a flypast. She also spent some time chatting to a glamorously dressed Duchess of Cornwall, with the two apparently enjoying a friendly, if rather animated, conversation. Earlier, Kate had appeared moved as she sat beside husband Prince William and his brother Prince Harry to hear the tributes paid to the 453 men and women who died while serving in Afghanistan. The service was held to mark the end of combat operations in Afghanistan after 13 years, with the final British battalions pulled out and sent home last autumn. Harry, who served two tours of duty in the country, looked particularly solemn as Prime Minister David Cameron spoke of the 'outstanding bravery' of the men and women who fought. 'We take pride in the scale of their achievements, driving out Al Qaeda and building up the Afghan forces so they can begin to take control of their own security,' he continued . Light relief: The moment was one of the more light-hearted of a morning that had focused heavily on the sacrifice of UK troops .

'Thirteen years on, the terrorist threat to our country from the region has been substantially reduced. Our families are safer because of what our Servicemen and women have done.' But the British withdrawal came too late for some, among them Cpt Thomas Clarke, 30, Warrant Officer Spencer Faulkner, 38, and Cpl James Walters, 36, all of the Army Air Corps, who were among the last to perish in the conflict. The service, which was led by the Prime Minister and the Queen, involved almost every senior member of the royal family, among them the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Also seated in Sir Christopher Wren's magnificent cathedral was Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and Prince Andrew, Duke of York. The Princess Royal, who looked wonderful in her military uniform and cockade hat, was also at the service and, afterwards, travelled back to Gloucestershire for the final day of the Cheltenham Festival. During the service, a cross made of shell casings from the memorial at the main allied base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion was brought through the cathedral by representatives of the three forces and presented at the altar. Officer Cadet Noor Aziz, from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, read a recital before the Archbishop of Canterbury blessed the Camp Bastion cross for its new memorial at the Royal British Legion's National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

Sarah Bushbye, former Corporal of the Army Medical Services, Kerry Ashworth, mother of Lance Corporal James Ashworth of the Grenadier Guards who was killed, and Darren Fuller, former Colour Sergeant of the Parachute Regiment also said a prayer. Afterwards, the congregation made its way outside to see five detachments made up of serving personnel from the Army, RAF, Royal Navy and the Royal Marines take part in a parade ahead of the flypast. They marched in silence past St Paul's accompanied by military bands and pipes and drums, with Prince Charles taking the royal salute, through the centre of London to Guildhall. Among those watching in silence was Kate, who will join the military for a second time in less than a week when on Tuesday, she and William pay their annual St. Patrick's Day visit to the Irish Guards.

"Rating: . This is going to be special, I tell myself as we pass medieval Penshurst Place, lit up to dramatic effect, with the pretty village church glowing next to it. Certainly, the Leicester Arms Hotel, near Tunbridge Wells, had looked cheering on the website - a village pub given a good wash and brush up without losing its charm. Not quite. Not much good for a weekend of any sort: The Leicester Arms is in tired and in real need of a makeover . The whole place seems in the grip of a collective lethargy. I'm not even given much in the way of a welcome. 'Don't worry, this isn't rubbish,' says the weary young woman who shows me to a room on the first floor above the kitchen extractor - even though only two other people are staying. She is not referring to the room, but to the eight bulging black plastic bin bags - 'it's just sheets and stuff.' You might think sheets and stuff could be stored elsewhere. But then, on seeing my drab room, I have my doubts. It's a charmless affair. The window frame has been painted recently, but no one has bothered to scrape off the drips stuck to the panes; three dull watercolours hang on the walls; the small desk is battered and bruised; and the bedside lights are those infuriating ones that only come on when you tap them. Even the laminated card telling you how to get an outside line is creased and uninviting. Things are more convivial downstairs. The panelled bar, with its saddles on the walls, open fires (not lit) and exposed timber beams provide some atmosphere, but the best part is the dining room up a short flight of stairs, with its mish-mash of tables and chairs, some of which are lovely antique jobs. A mere three tables are occupied, but the wait between my indifferent first course (two tiny bits of rolled-up smoked salmon and some avocado mousse) and my main course (sea bass in an overly rich sauce with gnocchi) is unforgivable. 'Any veg?' I ask. 'Kale, that's about it,' says the waitress in a wouldn't-bother sort of way. 'I'll have some kale, then, please.' It's a Wednesday night, but feels like the butt end of a Sunday. I almost long for someone to ask if 'everything's all right with your meal' if only because it would mean I can ask for another glass of wine. I get talking in the morning to the 'sheets and stuff' member of staff, and I like her no-nonsense honesty. 'Been busy?' I ask. 'Not really, bit dead actually.' 'Who comes here at this time of year?' 'We get a lot down for a dirty weekend.' Perhaps if you're down for a dirty weekend you can forgive certain flaws. But calling this old boozer a hotel is a liberty too far. The Leicester Arms Hotel .

"Jeremy Clarkson visited his producer's home to apologise for their Top Gear altercation but was given the cold shoulder, it was claimed last night. The BBC investigation into the row has been told Oisin Tymon refused to even open the door to the presenter after he turned up at his house, according to a report. Sources said the incident happened four days after 54-year-old Clarkson allegedly punched Mr Tymon during an argument after filming over a hot meal at a North Yorkshire hotel. Scroll down for video . Claim: The BBC investigation into the row has been told producer Oisin Tymon (right) refused to even open the door to presenter Jeremy Clarkson (left) after he turned up at his home, according to a report . The claims emerged as it was revealed Clarkson and his co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May are still scheduled to host a Top Gear Live arena show in Norway next week. The top-rating show was pulled off air and Clarkson was suspended while an inquiry was launched. It has also been claimed that Clarkson has sent at least one apologetic email to Mr Tymon. Ken MacQuarrie, the BBC executive in charge of the inquiry, has reportedly been shown the contents of the emails. A source told the Daily Mirror: ‘In the hours before he reported the matter to the BBC, Clarkson seemed increasingly desperate to apologise to Oisin and persuade him to let the matter blow over. ‘When he arrived on the doorstep that Sunday, Oisin was not feeling ready to face him so didn’t answer. He just didn’t want to speak to him after what happened. Hosts: Although Top Gear has been taken off air, Clarkson and his co-presenters Richard Hammond (left) and James May (right) are still scheduled to host a Top Gear Live arena show in Norway next week . ‘Clarkson could be heard saying that he just wanted to talk. He was asking for the door to be opened but it didn’t work. He tried for up to five minutes but in the end had to walk away.’ Far from patching things up with the Corporation, the presenter appears to be creating further tension after launching a foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala last night. Speaking in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show’s track ‘before the ‘f****** b******* sack me’. In footage obtained by the Daily Mirror, he spoke to the Roundhouse audience about a charity auction for his ‘last ever lap’ on the Top Gear track - which later went for £100,000. Clarkson said: ‘I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me. ‘I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.' Rant: Clarkson speaks on stage, next to Pink Floyd's Nick Mason, during The Roundhouse Gala last night . He added: 'There was an 18-year waiting list to be in the audience of Top Gear, but the BBC has f***** themselves.’ Although Top Gear has been taken off air, tickets are still on sale for the four performances of the live show in Norway, which will take place next Friday and Saturday. Up to 5,000 people are expected to attend each one. Meanwhile, it was also revealed last night that Clarkson's future on the BBC is likely to be decided next week when the corporation's internal investigation into his behaviour is handed over to the director-general. A BBC Worldwide source told The Daily Telegraph: ‘At the moment we are taking things on a day by day basis and as things stand the [Norway] shows are scheduled to run as billed. ‘It is not happening tomorrow, it is happening in eight days' time, so we are waiting to see what the investigation delivers. Bids: Clarkson (centre), sitting next to journalist Christa D'Souza (left) and Nettie Mason (right) - wife of Pink Floyd's Nick Mason - during the live auction at the gala, to raise money to help disadvantaged youths . ‘No-one is really sure about the timing of the investigation's decision, so before we disappoint 20,000 fans in Norway, at the moment we are going ahead with the show.’ The Top Gear host has been suspended since it emerged he was involved in what the BBC called ‘a fracas’ with one of the show's producers. It was reported this week that Clarkson's Top Gear co-hosts declined an offer to continue the rest of the series without him. The last episodes of the series have been postponed, causing the BBC to lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints.","Oisin Tymon 'would not open door' to Jeremy Clarkson at his house .

"Before V. Stiviano's recordings toppled Donald Sterling from ownership of the Los Angeles Clippers, she boasted she would be the next Mrs. Sterling. She would pick up envelopes of cash in an alley behind the family's real estate company and told employees at the firm she would one day be their boss. Those predictions seemed like a fantasy on Wednesday as Sterling's wife went after the $3.6 million that she said the younger woman swindled from community property the couple amassed over 60 years of marriage. Scroll down for video . Court battle: 'She's been very, very nasty to me, and she's been mean to my husband': Shelly Sterling testified against V. Stiviano in the nonjury trial in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday . Donald Sterling told a judge on Wednesday that V. Stiviano befriended a Hispanic bank employee in order to get her name illegally added to a $1 million check . 'She defrauded him and I feel that she is not entitled to any of these gifts or whatever they call them,' Shelly Sterling testified. 'She's been very, very nasty to me, and she's been mean to my husband.' Stiviano, 32, will have her own chance to testify on Thursday in the nonjury trial in Los Angeles Superior Court as to why she should keep gifts that included a duplex, Ferrari, jewelry and designer clothes. The trial put the Sterlings and Stiviano together in the same room about a year after the recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to publicly associate with blacks culminated with his lifetime ban from the NBA and the record $2 billion sale of the team. Whether Stiviano was ever a girlfriend to the billionaire or mistress, as his wife contends, she was downgraded to 'ex-friend' when Donald Sterling took the stand. Donald Sterling, 80, who has been diagnosed with symptoms of Alzheimer's, was at times forgetful and testy. He said Stiviano hadn't contributed '50 cents' to the $1.8 million duplex now in her name. Donald Sterling, 80, said Stiviano, right, hadn't contributed '50 cents' to the $1.8 million duplex now in her name . Sterling, a lawyer and shrewd businessman who made a fortune buying apartment buildings across Los Angeles, never explained why he purchased the house, though he made it clear he paid every penny because he said Stiviano was poor and her family was on welfare. He said the house was supposed to be in the name of his family trust. Noting that Stiviano is part black and Hispanic, he said she illegally got her name inserted into escrow documents by befriending a Hispanic bank employee who added her name to a $1 million check. Stiviano's lawyer, Mac Nehoray, said Donald Sterling gave the gifts when he was separated from his wife and that no real community property was transferred to his client. Further, he said the law does not allow a spouse to seek that money from a third party. Sterling said he only intended to loan a Ferrari and a Bentley to Stiviano, but he put them under her name so he wouldn't be liable if she killed somebody, adding that she was once charged with drunken driving. The chief financial officer of Sterling's real estate company testified that it appeared his boss was cutting checks intended for Stiviano that made it hard to trace where they went. 'I believe he was doing it to lose the bloodhounds through the creek,' Darren Schield testified. Sterling said he only intended to loan a Ferrari, pictured, and a Bentley to Stiviano, but he put them under her name so he wouldn't be liable if she killed somebody, adding that she was once charged with drunken driving . Former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling sits with V. Stiviano courtside in 2011. On Wednesday he told a judge that she had swindled items worth $3.6 million from him . Schield, who notified Shelly Sterling of the questionable checks, said he witnessed Stiviano getting envelopes of cash or cashier's checks from employees at Beverly Hills Properties and she once told the accounting department they would one day work for her. 'I thought it was pure lunacy,' he said. The Sterlings, who were at odds in the same courthouse when Shelly won the right to sell the team last year over her husband's objections, presented a mostly unified front. While Donald Sterling denied the couple was ever estranged, his wife said they separated after the death of a son. She also said she drafted divorce papers last year, but never filed them. She said their relationship remained strong and displayed several affectionate cards her husband gave her for birthdays and their anniversary. One close family friend, Betsy Superfon, said she vacations with the two and often feels like a third wheel as they walk hand-in-hand. She described meeting Stiviano in the restroom once at a Clippers game where the 'friendly girl' complimented her on her coat and purse. When she returned the favor, Stiviano gushed that Donald Sterling had bought her things and she planned to marry him. 'I said, 'But he's married to my girlfriend,' Superfon said. 'No worries, honey,' Stiviano replied. 'I'm going to be the next Mrs. Sterling.'","The Sterlings are demanding back items worth $3.6 million that they claim Stiviano swindled from them - including cars and a $1.8 million duplex .

"Police say there is little that can be done against a man who made a Nazi salute while urinating on a memorial in a former concentration camp. Photos of Zdenek Appl, 24, urinating next to the Star of David at the Theresienstad concentration, were handed to Czech police by a disgusted former friend. But the force investigated have admitted it may be difficult to take legal action against Appl, as promoting Nazi ideology is not illegal in the Czech Republic like it is in neighbouring Germany or Austria. Disgusting: Zdenek Appl was said to be drunk when he was photographed urinating on a memorial in a concentration camp in the Czech Republic. He has since denied being a Nazi to Czech media . The pictures were taken when Appl was visiting the former camp, situated in the north of the Czech Republic close to the German border with Jiri Larva, 25. Jiri said he decided to hand the evidence over to the police after he was appalled by his former friend's action, who was allegedly drunk at the time. 'I knew that he had some questionable ideas but when he started urinating alongside star David and then stood on the wall making a Nazi salute I just felt it was going too far, as I handed the photos in to the police', he said. 'I haven't had anything to do with him since but I reckon he should be punished for what he was up to.' Czech media has reported that Appl has a Nazi tattoo on his arm with the words 'Arbeit macht frel' - meaning 'work makes you free', the same chilling saying that was put above the entrance to Auschwitz and other concentration camps. They also state that Appl runs a Facebook page full of arguments promoting Nazi ideology - he but later denied he believed in the far-right views. Salute: Appl's former friend Jiri Lava handed the photographs to police. saying he thought he had gone 'too far'. The pair were visiting the Theresienstadt monument in the north of the Czech Republic, the site where thousands of people died at the hands of SS offices . After speaking with the media by telephone, Appl added that he is not a Naxi and said his tattoo had been removed since the pictures were taken. Thousands of people died at the hands of the SS officers and from malnutrition while being held at the Theresienstad concentration camp, which was open between November 1941 and May 1945. As well as being a labour site for German, Austrian and Czech Jews, it served as a 'holding pen' for Czech Jews before they were sent to other concentration camps to be killed. More than 150,000 people, including tens of thousands of children, were held in the camp for either months or years before being sent to their deaths at Treblinka and Auschwitz. The manager of the Theresienstadt monument and head of Prague Jewish Community Jan Munk said he found the images despicable. He said: 'It is disgusting. We are reporting it to police as well and we will see. 'I really doubt that somebody would not decry the pictures.'","Disgusted former friend handed pictures of Zdenek Appl to Czech police .

"A rat being raised to feed a Pennsylvania family's pet snakes ended up biting their 6-month-old baby boy, killing him. Cumberland County Coroner Charlie Hall announced Thursday that the infant died from meningitis and myocarditis transmitted through the bite. The family lives in the 500 block of South Baltimore Street in Dillsburg. The coroner declined to officially identify the baby to the Daily Mail Thursday citing an ongoing investigation. Culprit: A rat (file photo) being raised to feed a Pennsylvania family's pet snakes ended up biting their 6-month-old baby boy, killing him . Tragic loss: Daily Mail has identified him as Landon Kreitz, the son of Justin Kreitz and Rachel Frye . Animal lovers: The boy's parents, Rachel Frye and Justin Kreitz, had multiple pet snakes at the house . Hall says the child was treated at the Holy Street Hospital emergency room December 30 for a fever and a rash and discharged home. Two days later, the lethargic and feverish child was brought back and died in the emergency room that dame day. Investigators later learned that the child had been bitten by a rat on his right index finger. Lab studies later revealed the baby had rat-bite fever. Hall says police and county caseworkers are investigating. The deceased child has not been publicly named, but Daily Mail has identified him as Landon Kreitz, the son of Justin Kreitz and Rachel Frye. Slithery pet: Justin Kreitz shared an image in May 2013 depicting a 'new addition' to their family: a rat snake (pictured) According to his obituary, baby Landon was just two days shy of seven months when he passed away at the hospital. The coroner's report suggests that the boy's parents had multiple pet snakes at the house. On his Facebook page Justin Kreitz shared an image in May 2013 depicting a 'new addition' to their family: a rat snake. When Daily Mail reached out to the family to comment on the report, a relative picked up the phone at the house saying she was not yet ready to make a statement and referred this reporter to Landon’s mother, Rachel. PennLive.com reported that when Chief Deputy Coroner Matt Stoner called the boy's 21-year-old mother to tell the family the cause of their son's death, Hall said the reaction was 'OK, thanks.' But the coroner pointed out that when he spoke to her, the woman sounded distraught. In a brief phone interview with the Daily Mail, Hall stated that this was the county's first rat-bite fever fatality in his memory.

The coroner added that criminal charges were not out of the question in connection to the baby's death, depending on the outcome of the investigation. According to the US Centers for Disease Control, Rat-bite fever is an infectious disease that can be caused by two different bacteria.People usually get the disease from infected rodents or consumption of contaminated food or water.","Boy identified by Daily Mail as Landon Kreitz died January 1, 2014, just two days shy of seventh months .

"A powdered alcohol intended to be mixed up into drinks has gained approval from a federal regulator. The product, called Palcohol, had received the greenlight from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau briefly last year before the bureau backtracked and said the label approvals had been given in error. On Wednesday, bureau spokesman Tom Hogue told The Associated Press the issues were resolved and that four varieties of Palcohol were approved. But Hogue noted that states can also regulate alcohol sales in their borders. Dry booze: A brand of powdered alcohol has been approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The maker of Palcohol hopes to start selling the product by summer. A few of their flavors of powdered alcohol seen above . The approval is a step forward for a small company whose product plans have already sparked controversy. Several states have already moved to ban powdered alcohol, including lawmakers in Colorado who last month advanced legislation to temporarily halt its sale. That bill has since morphed to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it gets federal approval. Concerns have included abuse by minors, the potential to snort the powder and whether Palcohol's light weight would make it easy to sneak alcohol into public events or spike drinks. Palcohol would come in a pouch, with water being added to the powder inside for the equivalent of an alcoholic drink. A statement on Palcohol's website says the company hopes to have the product for sale this summer. Palcohol founder Mark Phillips noted the approval of his products in an email early Wednesday morning, and said in a subsequent email that pricing hasn't yet been determined. 'We aren't commenting on production or distribution at this time,' he wrote. The four products that have been approved include powdered versions of a cosmopolitan, a margarita, vodka and rum. Phillips added that he expects another Palcohol product — Lemon Drop — should also be 'approved shortly.' Previously, Phillips had said he came up with the idea for Palcohol because he wanted a way to enjoy alcoholic drinks after hiking or other activities without having to lug around heavy bottles. Hogue said the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regularly reaches out to the Food and Drug Administration to get determinations on whether a product might be considered 'adulterated.' If the FDA says the product isn't adulterated, he said the bureau's evaluation centers on whether labels accurately reflect what's in the product. 'Potential for abuse isn't grounds for us to deny a label,' Hogue said.","A powdered alcohol brand called Palcohol was approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau .

"The battery of an underwater locator beacon had run out more than a year before flight MH370 disappeared, a report by investigators revealed today. The update on the progress of the probe surrounding the Malaysia Airlines plane - which vanished a year ago today - indicates those looking for the aircraft would have had less chance of finding it. The plane, which was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, went missing with 239 people on board on March 8, 2014 - and a huge search in the Indian Ocean has so far proved fruitless. One year on: Family members of passengers missing on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 shout at police officers who tried to move journalists away from a protest near the Malaysian embassy in Beijing today . Emotional: A Chinese relative of a missing passenger on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 weeps outside the main gate of the Lama Temple  in Beijing today . Sadness: A relative of MH370 passengers holds a sign reading 'Dad I miss U!' outside the Lama Temple today . Family: There were 239 people on board the flight when it disappeared  en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . Relatives of MH370 victims: (Clockwise from top left)  Li Jiuying holds a picture of her brother Li Guohai;  Jacquita Gonzales holds a portrait of her husband,  in-flight supervisor Patrick Gomes; Liu Kun displays a photo of his brother Liu Qiang; and Chinese woman Dai Shuqin, who lost five members of her family . Apart from the anomaly of the beacon, the report devoted many of its 584 pages to describe the complete normality of the flight - shedding little light on one of aviation's biggest mysteries. The significance of the expired battery was not immediately apparent, except indicating that searchers would have had lesser chance of locating the plane, even if they were in its vicinity. The report said: ‘The sole objective of the investigation is the prevention of future accidents or incidents, and not for the purpose to apportion blame or liability.’ Whilst the battery had expired on the beacon of the Flight Data Recorder, the report said that the battery on the locator beacon of the cockpit voice recorder was working. Standing together: Relatives of MH370 passengers attend an event today marking the one-year anniversary of its disappearance in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . Calling for their return: The brother of a missing passenger writes a message during the Kuala Lumpur event . Memories: Two Chinese people hold a picture of their son, an MH370 passenger, during the event in Malaysia . Remembered: Jie Yie, four, holds a picture of her grandmother Lee Sew Chu and her aunt Ng May Li who were aboard MH370, in Kuala Lumpur today . Ordeal: A Chinese relative of a missing passenger on  MH370 cries as she sits on the curb outside the Malaysia Embassy  in Beijing . The two instruments are critical in any crash because they record cockpit conversation and flight data, leading up to the end of the flight. Relatives of passengers and crew today marked the anniversary of the day the plane went missing, under a heavy police presence. Chinese relatives had planned to commemorate the disappearance of the Boeing 777 at a number of sites in Beijing, including the Malaysian embassy, the airport and the Lama Temple, a popular Tibetan Buddhist place of worship and tourist site. Dozens of uniformed security sealed the street around the diplomatic mission, while relatives said they had opted to avoid the airport as police were out in force. The big question: Artist Sudarsan Pattnaik creates a sand sculpture of MH370 on Puri beach in Odisha, India . Writing: A family member of MH370 pens a message on a balloon during a memorial event  in Kuala Lumpur . Tears: Wang Guohui (right), mother of MH370 passenger Li Zhi, cries next to another passenger's relative . Sign: Catherine Gang, whose husband Li Zhi was on the plane, holds a banner outside Lama Temple today . About 30 visited the Lama Temple, with around 10 entering the site in groups of two or three to pay their personal respects, as if attempting to keep a low profile. Flight Captain: Zaharie Ahmad Shah . The physical and mental well-being of Flight Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was examined by the report, which said he had no known history of apathy, anxiety or irritability. ‘There were no significant changes in his lifestyle, interpersonal conflict or family stresses,’ it said. It also said there were ‘no behavioural signs of social isolation, change in habits or interest, self-neglect, drug or alcohol abuse’ by the captain, his first officer and the cabin crew. Financial checks also showed nothing abnormal about their gross monthly income and spending pattern. It said the captain held several bank accounts and two national trust funds. He had two houses and three vehicles, but there was no record of him having a life insurance policy. Co-pilot: First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid . The co-pilot, First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, had two saving accounts and a national trust fund account. He owned two cars and ‘spent money on the upkeep’ of these vehicles. ‘He does not have much savings in his bank account. He has a life insurance policy,’ it said. The remainder waited outside the temple in a group, wearing T-shirts saying ‘Pray for MH370’, and waving placards to photographers reading ‘Keep searching for MH370’. Meanwhile, Voice 370 - a support group for the relatives - hosted a ‘Day of Remembrance’ at a shopping centre in Kuala Lumpur with songs, poems and prayers. Grace Subathirai Nathan, whose mother Anne Daisy was on the plane, said: ‘It is important to highlight to the public that we still don't have any answers and that we must pursue the search.’ The Malaysian prime minister said he still is hopeful the plane will be found. Najib Razak said: ‘The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear. ‘Together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists. Malaysia remains committed to the search, and hopeful that MH370 will be found.’ While the country's government has already formally declared the disappearance of the plane as an accident, and said all those on board are presumed dead, relatives of those on the flight have said they are frustrated by the lack of answers. Ministers from Australia, China and Malaysia are expected to meet next month to decide on the next course of action for the wide-ranging search. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said his government would provide ‘all needed service to every next of kin’ and help uphold their ‘legitimate and lawful rights and interests’. Most of the plane's passengers were Chinese. ‘A year has passed, the plane has not been located, but the search effort will continue,’ Mr Wang told a news conference in Beijing. ‘Today must be a difficult day for the next of kin. Our hearts are with you.’ The report by an independent investigation group went into minute details of the crew's lives, including their medical and financial records and their training. It also examined the aircraft's service record, as well as the maintenance schedule, weather, communications systems and other aspects. No way though: A journalist (right) is blocked by Chinese police outside Lama Temple after prayers in Beijing . A relative of a Chinese passenger from MH370 shows a poster saying 'Bring the MH370 passengers home' Moving away: Chinese police block journalists with cameras filming relatives of MH370 passengers in Beijing . Talking: A relative of a Chinese passenger from MH370 speaks to the foreign media outside the Lama Temple . These showed nothing unusual except for the one previously undisclosed fact of the battery's expiry date. It said that according to maintenance records, the battery on the beacon attached to the Flight Data Recorder expired in December 2012. ‘There is some extra margin in the design to account for battery life variabilty and ensure that the unit will meet the minimum requirement,’ it said. ‘However, once beyond the expiry date, the (battery's) effectiveness decreases so it may operate, for a reduced time period until it finally discharges,’ the report said. While it is possible the battery will operate past the expiry date, ‘it is not guaranteed that it will work or that it would meet the 30-day minimum requirement,’ said the report. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014 . 2015 .","Plane from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing vanished with 239 people on board .

"It's something we all do on a near daily basis, but could the reason behind those all-too-frequent 'bad hair days' be because you're washing your hair wrong? The reason your hair feels silky soft after a visit to the salon isn't pure coincidence; it's because hairdressers are carefully trained to wash and condition hair using a tried-and-tested regime. There is, in fact, a wrong way to wash your hair, and getting it wrong can take your hair from silky and shiny to totally lackluster and damaged. FEMAIL called on the industry's hottest hairdressers to share their insider knowledge on what you're doing wrong and the simple steps  to make sure you do it right. Scroll down for video . There is, in fact, a wrong way to wash your hair, and getting it wrong can take your hair from silky and shiny to totally lackluster and damaged. FEMAIL called on the best experts in the business to ensure you get it right . WASH HAIR CORRECTLY AND NEVER WITH HOT WATER . 'I’m a great believer in looking after hair as we would our skin. It’s fine to wash your hair daily, you wouldn’t not wash your face every day, but there are some things to consider,' said Andrew Barton at Urban Retreat at Harrods. By working your shampoo into the top section of your hair and then rinsing it out, it automatically cleanses the ends and stops damage occurring in the lengths . Did you know that you only need to use product on your scalp and no necessarily the ends? By working your shampoo into the top section of your hair and then rinsing it out, it automatically cleanses the ends and stops damage occurring in the lengths. Extreme care should be taken when washing your hair and while you may think scrubbing hard will thoroughly cleanse it, that couldn't be further from the truth. Putting too much pressure on your scalp can actually result in greasier hair. As Barton explains: 'Don’t rub your scalp too vigorously. This will encourage oil secretion from the sebaceous gland'. Stylists also say it's imperative to rinse your hair for twice the amount of time as lathering on product and never use hot water. 'Women often wash their hair with water which is too hot, thinking it will make hair cleaner,' said Barton. Washing your hair in tepid water is better for the follicles with the added bonus of saving money on your bills. 'The hot water activates the sebaceous gland which secretes oil and can leave hair greasy soon after washing. Use warm, tepid water for ultra clean hair and to extend the life of your blow dry.' DON'T RELY ON JUST ONE SHAMPOO . Thought a standard shampoo will give you the hair of your dreams? Wrong. 'We put our hair through a lot in the week, so as you might exfoliate your skin once a week to remove dead skin cells, washing hair with a clarifying shampoo will allow hair and scalp to breathe,' said Barton. Use a clarifying shampoo, such as Pureology Purify, once a week to remove impurities and product build up. When drying, avoid rubbing with towels, this creates friction and can damage the cuticle leaving hair dull and lifeless, blot dry instead to prevent damage . Barton also believes it's essential to work scalp care treatments into your regime. 'This is where the nutrients are produced to support healthy hair growth,' he said. Scalp care products such as Kérastase Initialiste and TRESemmé Renewal Hair & Scalp range can help leave hair feeling thicker, shinier and more resistant. Industry experts also recommend getting a hacial - or hair facial - a few times a year. Nioxin have launched Dermabrasion services for the scalp, which promise to remove build-up and restore the condition by accelerating scalp surface regeneration through exfoliation. Aveda, meanwhile, have a Healthy Hair Service whereby specialists use a camera to magnify the scalp to 600 per cent to analyse hair density and the scalp's oil levels. They then analyse the results and create a bespoke programme for your hair, which promises to leave it glossy from root to tip. Issie Churcher, HOB Salons’ Creative Colour Director, also believes in the power of double shampooing and exfoliating. She explained: 'Investing in professional shampoo and conditioner such as a duo from the Wella SP or Nioxin range means washing your hair daily can be beneficial to a healthy scalp, aiding in hair growth. 'To achieve the best results from your shampoo, make sure hair is well saturated with water this will help in achieving the best lather, allowing the hair and scalp to be cleansed thoroughly. 'Two shampoos is advisable to make sure hair and scalp is thoroughly cleansed and always finish with a conditioner appropriate for your hair type and avoid conditioner on the scalp to prevent oily roots. DON'T RUB TOO HARD AND NEVER TOWEL DRY YOUR HAIR . You may be in a rush but all hairdressers emphasise the importance of avoiding towel drying. 'When drying, avoid rubbing with towels, this creates friction and can damage the cuticle leaving hair dull and lifeless, blot dry instead to prevent damage,' said Issie Churcher. Dabbing your hair with the towel, followed by a quick squeeze to get rid of excess water is the way forward. It's also important to avoid combing your hair after you've showered and instead take a wide-toothed comb through locks whilst your in the shower waiting for your conditioner to work its magic. Never comb your hair straight after washing it, instead comb through it whilst the conditioner is setting in .","FEMAIL called on industry's hottest hairdressers to share insider knowledge .

"A female British adventurer is preparing for the final leg of her gruelling challenge to circumnavigate the world using just human power - four years after she set off. Sarah Outen MBE, 29, has already travelled a staggering 20,500 miles since she left Tower Bridge in London in a kayak on April 1, 2011. The Oxford graduate paddled from Britain to France and cycled 11,000 miles across Europe before jumping back in her kayak to travel from Russia to Japan. Scroll down for video . Sarah Outen, pictured after arriving in New York by bike from Alaska, is preparing for the final leg of her gruelling challenge to circumnavigate the world using just human power - four years after she set off . Sarah  has already travelled a staggering 20,500 miles since she left Tower Bridge in London in a kayak on April 1, 2011 . She then set off to row across the Pacific Ocean to Alaska but had to be rescued after her boat was battered by 80mph winds in a three-day tropical storm. She said she strapped herself to the bunk of her rowing boat while she waited for help. She said: 'That was really scary, it was a really intense few days being in those conditions and being alone. 'The water was coming in and there was nothing I could do but wait so I lay on my bunk strapped in and floated for three days. The Oxford graduate paddled from Britain to France and cycled 11,000 miles across Europe before jumping back in her kayak to travel from Russia to Japan . Love boat: Miss Outen proposed to her girlfriend Lucy from the middle of the sea using a satellite phone . The adventurer has 3,000 miles left to go before she completes her trip . A moment of respite: Sarah setting up camp at Shalti lake, in China, in June 2011 . Sarah in a sunbaked Gobi desert during her 11,000-mile ride to the edge of Russia . The route Sarah has taken since leaving London in 2011, with the final leg a row across the Atlantic . April 2011 - Sets off from Tower Bridge in London. Kayaks from London to France, then cycles 11,000 miles across Europe and Asia before kayaking from Russia to Japan. May 2012 - Rows across the Pacific Ocean to Alaska but is rescued by Japanese coastguards a month into the five month journey. She goes home to recover for nine months where she meets her fiancee Lucy. April 2013 - Returns to Japan and rows across the Pacific Ocean to Alaska, arriving in September 2013. Proposes to Lucy via satellite phone from middle of Pacific Ocean. Returns home because of Alaskan winter. May 2014 - Returns to Alaska and kayaks 1,500 miles along the Aleutian Islands. Has just a two week break before cycling 4,500 miles through Alaska, Canada and the United States in one of the harshest winters the country has seen. March 2015 - Arrives in New York. Plans to stay for two weeks before cycling 400 miles to Cape Cod and then rowing solo for 3,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean back to the UK. She will then cycle, kayak and row back to Tower Bridge aiming to arrive in September . 'I zoned out as much as I could and there was just one occasion when I lost it and started crying. 'The Japanese coastguard plane was flying overhead and I had to go out to let off a flare so they could find my position. 'I wasn't strapped in and a wave hit and I got thrown around the cabin and I was exhausted and scared so just burst into tears. 'But I told myself to pull it together and luckily got rescued.' The physically demanding journey has also been an emotional one for Sarah who proposed to partner Lucy Allen, 28, whilst she was in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. She said: 'I met Lucy during the time at home so in a way I was lucky that I capsized and was forced to abandon that row to Alaska the first time. 'We had talked about getting married and said we would propose to each other when I reached Alaska. 'But I was alone in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and I thought why wait so I picked up the satellite phone and just went for it. 'I had to ask her twice because she couldn't hear me properly but she said yes.' She returned to Japan in April 2013 and completed the five-month journey which made her the first and youngest person to row solo from Japan to the Aleutian Islands. Incredibly, she then kayaked 1,500 miles along the Aleutian Islands with pal Justine Curgenven before cycling 4,500 miles through Alaska, Canada and the United States. Since then she has battled plunging -40C temperatures and narrowly avoided being attacked by grizzly bears. Sarah, from Oakham, Rutland, eventually arrived in New York last Thursday and is having a two-week break until she cycles another 400 miles to Cape Cod. She will then prepare to row Happy Socks for the final leg of her journey, a solo trip across 3,000 miles of the Atlantic Ocean back to the UK. She said the most testing part of her incredible trip has been camping in plunging temperatures and tackling wild bears along her route. She said: 'It was difficult because overnight the temperature dropped below -40C several times which made breathing in the tent very difficult. 'There were ice particles in the air when I was up in Alaska and northern Canada between August and October. 'Some kind people invited me in to their homes but I mostly camped and I knew bears were around so at night my mind would play tricks on me. 'There was no-one around and the sound of bears in the forest would keep me awake at night. 'I only saw one bear on the bike when a brown grizzly ran across the path I was cycling on and disappeared. 'But during the kayaking along the Aleutian Islands we saw lots of grizzly bears on the banks of the shore. 'One evening I was in a stream having a wash and I suddenly saw this big grizzly bear walking towards me downstream. 'All I could do was get out as quick as I could and luckily my clothes were on the shore so he had a good sniff of them and that slowed him down. 'We were able to make a fuss and throw some stones in the water and luckily that scared him off but he was only a few feet away from us.'

"You would be excused for assuming there is only one possibly ending when a lone baby deer is met in the wild by a hungry tigress. But this series of heartwarming pictures by photographer Souvik Kundu shows a tiger sparing the deer's life and, instead of making it an easy snack, deciding to play with it and treat it like one of its own. The moment occurred at the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in India with the confused tiger snapped jumping next to the tiny deer, nuzzling with it, and even carrying it gently in its mouth like a cub. Photographer Souvik Kundu snapped pictures of a tiger playing with a fawn at the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in India . Crowds at the Maharashtra reserve gasped as they predicted the spotted deer fawn would face a swift and gruesome death at the paws of the giant feline. Instead, the unlikely two appear to become the best of friends, with the gentle tigress tenderly playing with it, before leaving the deer unharmed to live another day. Photographer Souvik said: 'When she slowly emerged from cover we were astonished to find she was playing with a hapless spotted deer fawn. 'The tigress seemed to be in a playful mood, jumping around in excitement.' The adorable encounter lasted for about 15 minutes, before the big cat retreated and allowed the small deer to rest in the grass. Photographer Souvik Kundu, 35, from Mumbai witnessed the tigress nuzzling the spotted deer fawn like one of her cubs . The joyful cat was seen jumping next to the deer, patting it and even carrying it in her mouth like a cub . The expectation among the crowd was that the feline would swiftly kill the deer and devour it . Souvik, 35, from Mumbai entitled photographs of the event, The Benevolent Queen, due to the tiger's gentle nature. He added: 'I'm still not sure why the tigress did not prey on the little deer when the chance presented and acted so unnaturally. 'One probable explanation is the tigress was in search for a mate and her urge for motherhood temporarily overcame predatory instinct. Play with me! The tigress instead just wants to play with the baby deer and kept patting it with its paws . Souvik said it was possible the tigress confused the fawn with her own offspring . 'As a result she had confused the fawn for her own offspring.' The Tadoba Andhari Reserve is the largest national park in Maharashtra, covering a total area of 241 square miles. The area was home to 43 tigers when a census was conducted in 2010. The photographs form a series entitled, The Benevolent Queen, due to the tiger's gentle nature .

"Men drink considerably more than women and at around age 25 peak at around 13 drinks per week, according to a new study observing drinking habits in Britain. Women drank the most, between 4 and 7 drinks per week in their 40s, but lessened their drinking after 65, says research published in the Journal of BMC Medicine based on data from nine longitudinal studies in the UK. Frequent drinking (daily or most days of the week) became more common during mid to older age, most notably among men, reaching above 50 per cent of men, said the study. Men versus women: Men drink considerably more than women and at around age 25 peak at around 13 drinks per week whereas women peak in their 40s . Middle-aged men don't drink as much as men in their twenties but they tend to drink more regularly even in old age. According to the World Health Organization, Americans drink less than people living in the UK and up to 30 per cent of the US population doesn’t drink at all. The study found that non-drinking in the UK was as low as 10 per cent and that it only rose to 20 per cent in those above 90-years-old. The Washington Post reports that low to moderate drinking, especially of red wine, is linked to health benefits and it's therefore not surprising that so many men drink into old age. However, prior research has documented that both heavy drinkers and nondrinkers have higher risks of premature death than their peers who drink in moderation. Some data linked to non-drinkers may be skewed because some non-drinkers may have chosen to stop drinking due to pre-existing health problems. Drink frequency: Men drink more frequently in older age than women but don't drink as much as they did in their 20s whereas women stopped drinking at around 65-years-old . The Post also mentions that alcohol is one of the most toxic substances that people consume and can often interfere with certain blood pressure medications that people take later in life. 'It raises concerns that [men] are becoming dependent on alcohol and there are risks in this age group mixing alcohol with medications,' said Dr Annie Britton at University College London, who carried out the study. One drink doubles someone's chances of going to the emergency room and is an even greater risk for drunk drivers who may crash their car while under the influence. Heavy drinking poses grave dangers to health and makes people more likely to die from suicides, homicides, liver disease, and some cancers, reports Culture of Health.","Men drink considerably more than women and at around age 25 peak at around 13 drinks per week .

"Beautician Sarah Bryan has made a dress that is good enough to eat - adorned with 700,000 multi-coloured sugar strands. Sarah, 26, from Ossett, West Yorkshire, spent 30 hours gluing the sweets - normally used to decorate trifles and cakes - to the fabric of the two-piece outfit at the rate of 250 per square inch. And she worked her way through 18lbs of the micro-sweets at a cost of £96. And the tubes of glue cost her another £60. Sarah Bryan, 26, spent 30 hours gluing the two-piece dress with £96 worth of sugar strands. She even spent three hours sorting out the pink sweets so she could decorate the skirt with a pink heart . Sarah, a mother-of-two, said: 'I think the dress looks fantastic - although the sweets made a terrible mess in the house while I was making it. They ended up all over the place.' She first sewed a crop top and constructed a long hooped skirt stiffened with wire. Then she squirted glue on the fabric and delicately placed the sugar strands with a make-up brush. She even spent three hours sorting out all the pink ones - a couple of millimetres long - so she could decorate the skirt with a pink heart. Sarah, from Ossett, West Yorkshire said: 'I stuck loads of the sugar strands on but I would lose a lot whenever I moved it. 'Loads of the them ended up all over the floor and I was always having to vacuum them up. They were all over the house. Sarah would squirt glue onto the fabric and then dab sugar strands on with a make-up brush . 'I am now lacquering the dress to make them completely secure.' She is now planning to auction the dress off for charity - one she made last year out of 14,000 Skittles sweets ended up being shipped to Florida where it was to be displayed at Ripley's Believe it or Not Museum. But it was damaged in transit. Sarah came up with the sweet idea for the first dress as a way of raising money for a cancer charity. She said: 'After making one dress out of sweets I got hooked and decided to make another. People think I am mad but I think they look great. Bryan first sewed a crop top and then constructed a wire hoop for the skirting. She plans on auctioning off the dress to raise money for a cancer charity . 'This one has been messier than the first to make. I thought using sugar strands would be easier - but it was harder and more intricate. She said her partner Nick Webster, 31 would come home from his night shift as a store assistant and finding evidence of the sweets crunched into the carpet. She added: 'He thinks I am crazy and he's getting fed up with the mess and smell of the sweets. I must admit it is pretty sickly. Not only that, when you tread on them you ended up with multi-coloured powder all over the place. 'But I think the dress is well worth the trouble. The dress looks great although admittedly you can't go out in the rain as the colours would run. Bryan created a dress last year out of 14,000 Skittles sweets which was shipped to Florida and displayed at Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum . 'Sunshine is all right..as long as you are not anywhere really hot like Egypt.' She also had to watch daughter Isabella 18 months and son Keegan, 11 didn't try eating the dress. She said: 'When I made the Skittles dress I kept finding patches where some of the sweets had vanished. 'I eventually realised that it was Keegan who was secretly snacking when my back was turned.

"Appalled: Eric Holder said he was shocked by Ferguson Police department, and prepared to tear it apart and start over . U.S. Attorney General Eric . Holder has threatened to dismantle Ferguson's police department to force through reforms after a damning report found widespread racism in the force. Holder told reporters that the Justice Department is 'prepared to use all the power that we have' to push through change in the beleaguered Missouri force, which was castigated nationwide over the killing of Michael Brown. The threat follows the publication of a report which showed officers swapping racist emails, as well as finding that 93 per cent of all arrests in the town, and most uses of excessive force were directed at the African American population. President Barack Obama has called the policing in Ferguson 'broken and racially biased' which requires a 'fix' from the federal government. Holder, speaking today in Maryland in front of Air Force One, told reporters that Justice Department plans include 'everything from working with them to coming up with an entirely new structure'. When asked if that meant dismantling the force and starting over, he said: 'If that's what's necessary, we're prepared to do that.' He seized in particular on parts of the report showing that Ferguson police overwhelmingly issued fines for offenses like traffic violations and speeding to African Americans - seemingly in an attempt to bolster the city's revenues.

Holder said: 'The notion that you would use a law enforcement agency or law enforcement generally to generate revenue, and then the callous way in which that was done and the impact that it had on the lives of the ordinary citizens of that municipality, was just appalling. Appalling. 'And that is not something that we're going to tolerate.'

"No-one enjoys filing their tax return, but paying your duty would have been an even more arduous task  2,000 years ago. A recently translated ancient Egyptian tax receipt has revealed that it probably took more than 220lbs (100kg) of coins to settle just one wealthy person's bill. The tax receipt was written in Greek on a piece of pottery that is said to date back to 22 July 98 BC. A recently translated ancient Egyptian tax receipt (pictured) has revealed that it provably took more than 220lbs (100kg) of coins to settle one wealthy person's bill. Although it is difficult to calculate what it would have been worth in modern-day terms, estimates place it in the region of $1,670 (£1,120) The person, whose name is unreadable, paid a land transfer tax of 75 talents, which was a unit of currency, as well as a fee of 15 talents on top, reports LiveScience. The pottery receipt shows that the tax was paid in coins, which were hauled to a bank in the city of Diospolis Magna, also known as Luxor or Thebes. Brice Jones, a PhD student at Concordia University in Montreal who translated the text, said that the bill was ‘incredibly large’. As paper money didn’t exist and there were no coins as large as one talent, the payees of the bill would have had to make up the sum using drachmas, where 6,000 of the coins equalled one talent. A stock image of a silver drachma dating to the 3rd century BC is shown . It may seem incredible that such a rigid tax system continued to function at a time of political infighting. Politics were deadly in 98BC. Pharaoh Ptolemy X, who was part of a dynasty of pharaohs who ruled Egypt after the death of Alexander the Great, had fought against his brother for the throne and some sources say he killed his own mother to keep a firm grip on power. Despite his best efforts, in 89BC his army mutinied and he was killed the following year, leaving his brother to take over the running of the region. As paper money didn’t exist and there were no coins as large as one talent, the payees of the bill would have had to make up the sum using drachmas, where 6,000 of the coins equalled one talent. Consequently, 540,000 drachma were needed to settle the tax bill written on the receipt. Although it is difficult to calculate what this would have been worth in modern-day money, estimates suggest it would have been around $1,670 (£1,120). Catharine Lorber, an expert in Egyptian coins, explained that the highest denomination coin was probably worth just 40 drachma, so 13,500 of them would have been needed to pay the bill. ‘The coins in question weigh, on average, 8 grams (0.3 ounces), so the total payment of 90 talents probably had a weight in excess of 100 kilograms (220 lbs),’ she said. The people charged with collecting the money, known as tax farmers, would have had to ring the heavy load to the bank, and it may have been placed in baskets and carried by donkeys. Dr Lorber said the surcharge, known as the ‘allage’, may have been added to the bill because part of it was paid in bronze coins, instead of silver. The pottery receipt shows that the tax was paid in coins, which were hauled to a bank in the city of Diospolis Magna, also known as Luxor or Thebes. This stock image shows Medinat Habu Temple in Luxor . Ancient texts uncovered in Egyptian village Deir el-Medina (Ptolemaic temple pictured) suggest New Kingdom workers had state-supported health care . Ancient texts recently uncovered among the human remains of an Egyptian village suggest workers from the New Kingdom also had their own version of a state-supported health care. This scheme, which involved paid sick leave and on-site doctors, made sure workers making the king’s tomb 3,600 years ago were productive and well looked after. The dig of the ancient Egyptian worker’s village at Deir el-Medina is being led by Stanford archaeologist Anne Austin. The village was built for workmen who made the royal tombs during the New Kingdom (1550 to 1070 BC). During this period, kings were buried in the Valley of the Kings in a series of rock-cut tombs. The village was purposely built close enough to the royal tomb to make sure the workers could hike there on a weekly basis. ‘These workmen were not what we normally picture when we think about the men who built and decorated ancient Egyptian royal tombs - they were highly skilled craftsmen,’ said Dr Austin. ‘The workmen at Deir el-Medina were given a variety of amenities afforded only to those with the craftsmanship and knowledge necessary to work on something as important as the royal tomb.’ According to ancient texts found on the site, as well as other historical accounts, the Egyptian state paid workers monthly wages in the form of grain and provided them with housing and servants to help with laundry, grinding grain and porting water. Ancient texts found among human remains (pictured with lead archaeologist Anne Austin) include daily records detailing when and why workers were sick and reveal they were also paid a certain amount of sick leave. Other papyri describe on-site physicians who would treat the workers as part of their employment .","Tax receipt written in Greek on pottery is dated to 22 July, 98BC .

"A couple sent their children to a £32,000-a-year private school and rented a house for almost £2,000 a month while claiming £42,000 benefits, a jury was told today. Sarah Grant, received a £40,000 payment from her parents and was drawing income as a director of three companies during the time she and husband Leslie, 67, were claiming benefits, Gloucester crown court heard. The couple, of Cheltenham, claims the firms were in liquidation and deny falsely claiming pension credits, housing benefit and council tax benefit without declaring that they had other income. Couple accused: Sarah and Leslie Grant allegedly sent their children to a £32,000-a-year private school and rented a house for almost £2,000 a month while claiming £42,000 benefits . Prosecutor Tara Wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of £42,500 to which they were not entitled. 'While they were in receipt of those benefits they were managing to continue to pay for their children to go to Dean Close School in Cheltenham and to continue to pay for expensive child care and expensive rent,' she said. 'We say they received £19,000 pension credit, £19,000 housing benefit and £4,500 council tax benefit to which they were not entitled. 'We say Mr and Mrs Grant knew they were under an obligation to inform the Department for Work and Pensions and the council of money coming into their accounts which affected their entitlement to benefits. 'The prosecution say they had income coming in from three sources. Between September 2010 and October 2011 Mrs Grant received £40,000 from her parents. 'There was also income from her position as a director of three limited companies that were trading during the material time and which Mr Grant was running. 'And they were using their business accounts for personal expenditure. 'Money from those accounts that was not being declared was being used to pay personal bills, for example their expensive rent and school fees as well as for more day to day things such as shopping.' Top private school: The Grants' children attended £32,000-a-year Dean Close School in Cheltenham while the couple was claiming benefits, the court heard . The three active companies of which she was a director were Hadleigh Partnership, Hadleigh Developments and Sarafino Ltd, she said . The prosecutor said Mr Grant had been receiving pension credit from November 2007 yet he was running the companies of which his wife was director. Investigations into their affairs began when questions were raised about how they were able to pay £1,950 a month rent while receiving housing allowance of only £775 a month, added Ms Wolfe. Mrs Grant was questioned by a benefits official in May 2010 and said her parents had paid the rent shortfall and school fees. She claimed the money paid to her by the companies was to reimburse her for expenses she had paid for the businesses from her personal account. Mrs Grant has held the position of director at eight different companies founded in the last seven years. On trial: Speaking at Gloucester Crown Court (above), prosecutor Tara Wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of about £42,500 to which they were not entitled . As well as the three mentioned in court, she was associated with Carousel Group Cheltenham, Sarafinos Estates, Clayhills Development, The Belgian Chocolate Company and D'Altos. All are now listed online as dissolved or in liquidation. Mr Grant was seen in October 2011 and 'spoke a lot about bankruptcy proceedings and legal proceedings in respect of money owed to him,' added the prosecutor. When they had filled out benefit application forms she had said she was a director but the companies were in liquidation. Both defendants, seen leaving court together side-by-side today, say the businesses were not a going concern and both said they did not work. The trial continues tomorrow.

"The family of black teenager Tony Robinson, who was shot and killed by a white police officer on Friday, have demanded justice in the wake of his tragic death, while court documents have revealed the health problems he was experiencing. A report by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections suggests the 19-year-old was an impulsive risk-taker who had ADD and experienced anxiety and depression. It stated the teenager also faced a choice between a middle-class lifestyle and that of a gangster after being exposed to a 'chaotic' family situation. The revelations were announced as close to 2,000 students marched in Wisconsin's capital to protest the fatal police shooting, while the police chief apologized. Students crowded into the rotunda of the state Capitol in the morning, chanting, waving signs and demanding justice. Scroll down for videos . Demanding justice: Demonstrators protest the shooting of Tony Robinson at the state Capitol in Wisconsin on Monday. The 19-year-old was gunned down by a white police officer in Madison on Friday . Symbolic: Students held up signs saying 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' and raised their hands into the air as they stood on the rotunda of the building . Deadly incident: Robinson, 19, was shot by officer Matt Kenny at an apartment in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday evening. The teenager's family have demanded that a full investigation be launched into his death . Madison police officer Matt Kenny shot Robinson on Friday evening while investigating a call that the young man was jumping in and out of traffic and had assaulted someone. Turin Carter, Robinson's uncle, said his family was calling for a thorough investigation and was concerned about the 'systematic targeting of young black males,' but did not endorse blanket anti-police sentiments. 'We are not proponents of anti-police (attitudes)... We understand that law enforcement is necessary and mandatory and we need to change our mindset about the police,' Carter said at a news conference outside the house where Robinson was shot. Standing near a memorial of candles and balloons, Carter said it was simplistic to call Robinson African American, saying he had a mixed heritage and his racial ambiguity was a central issue in his life. Many teenagers at the morning protests were from Robinson's alma mater, Sun Prairie High School. 'There is an indifference between people and police. We all need to come together,' said Ali Asafford, 15, after leaving class at Madison's East High School. The march was orderly and police presence was minimal. Plea: Turin Carter, Tony Robinson's uncle, tells the media there should be a thorough investigation into his nephew's death and is concerned about the 'systematic targeting of young black males, . Issues: Court documents revealed that Robinson suffered from mental health problems - such as anxiety and depression - and had a choice between a middle-class lifestyle and that of a gangster . Powerful image: Angelica Alv holds up a sign which reads 'Our Lives Matter' while using paint to signify blood . Gesture: Demonstrators raise their fists in unison inside the government building. Earlier on Monday the Madison police chief apologized for the deadly shooting . Officer Matt Kenny, the 12-year police veteran who shot Robinson, is on paid administrative leave while the Wisconsin Department of Justice investigates the shooting. In 2007, Kenny was involved in a fatal shooting that was found to be justified. Police Chief Michael Koval apologized on Monday after praying with Robinson's grandmother over the weekend and pledging transparency in the investigation. 'Reconciliation cannot begin without my stating 'I am sorry,' and I don't think I can say this enough. I am sorry. I hope that, with time, Tony's family and friends can search their hearts to render some measure of forgiveness,' Koval wrote in his blog. Attorney General Brad Schimel asked the public to be patient with the investigation, saying his office would not be able to disclose details since it could taint testimony from witnesses. Gathering: Madison Mayor Paul Soglin addresses a crowd of protestors on Martin Luther King Boulevard. Around 2,000 students descended on the city to protest the teenager's death on Monday . March: Demonstrators make their way down East Washington Avenue, approaching the State Capitol\ . Official efforts to be transparent, apologetic and light-handed with protesters followed months of heightened attention to police use of deadly force across the United States. Last year, the police shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, set off weeks of protests that sometimes turned violent. Police reaction was criticized as heavy-handed, and critics were outraged at the long delay in releasing the name of the officer who shot Brown. Madison, a city of 240,000 people about 80 miles (130 km) west of Milwaukee, has a mostly white population. The city is 7 percent African-American, U.S. Census figures show. Last year, Robinson pleaded guilty to armed robbery, and was placed on probation. Sentencing documents show it was his first brush with the law, and he was not the armed person in the group that committed the robbery. Heartfelt note: Most of the protesters who had walked out of their classrooms. One had scrawled a message on a lamppost . The robbery case file includes a letter from Robinson's grandmother, Sharon Irwin, to the judge. In it, she asks for her grandson to be sentenced to probation, saying he was just following his co-defendants' lead. Robinson 'is a great kid in between being a teen and a man,' she wrote. 'That is one of his issues. Impulsive. The other is being a follower.' His aunt, Loren Carter, wrote a note to the judge asking for mercy in sentencing. She said Robinson grew up poor without his father but was kind-hearted and intelligent. Robinson's defense attorney, Michael J. Short, wrote to the judge that Robinson had taken special-education classes and had never been in trouble with the law before. Studensts and some adults stood arm-in-arm as they made their way down the streets . 'He was an easy choice for the seasoned co-defendants to manipulate into participation,' Short wrote. 'He did not give any orders but just followed the instructions meted out by the other defendants.' Keith Wessel, a Madison family law attorney who said he was married to Robinson's grandmother for a time, wrote to Short in September and told him that he raised two of Robinson's uncles and knew Robinson from birth. Wessel wrote that some branches of Robinson's family exposed him to a 'chaotic environment.' He did not elaborate but said Robinson faced a choice between a middle-class life and the 'gangsta' path. He warned if Robinson went to prison on a felony charge he would continue toward the gangster world. He said Monday he was shocked at the shooting. He said Robinson stood 6-foot-5 but was a 'teddy bear.' Remembrance: A memorial for the teenager was set up outside the apartment where he was shot. It has gradually built up with flowers and tributes . Laid down: Flowers, balloons and candles line the road near the location where officer Matt Kenny gunned down Robinson on Friday . Emotional: Destiny Marshall of Atlanta, Georgia, is consoled by friends during a protest . 'I can't imagine Tony is going to fight a cop breaking into his house,' Wessel said. 'I just don't see that as likely ... I really think we need to examine our police policies.' Concern about Wisconsin's own history of police use of deadly force prompted passage of a law last year requiring independent investigators to probe such incidents. The bill had support from police associations. The head of the local NAACP chapter said the Madison police department did not engage in the sort of racial targeting that the U.S. Justice Department found prevalent in Ferguson. 'I have observed what I think is a very effective community policing structure, and I think it makes a difference,' said Greg Jones, president of the Dane County chapter of the advocacy group.","The 19-year-old was shot dead by veteran officer Matt Kenny on Friday .

"It is a stunning sunset - and heralds that for Antarctica, winter really is coming. Antarctica is moving from 24-hour daylight to the 24-hour darkness of winter. In between there is a brief period where the sun does set and rise - and this is the first sunset of 2015. Scroll down for video . The British Antarctic Survey research station on the Brunt ice shelf witnesses this year’s first sunset over Antarctica . Called Halley VI, it is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. The centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff, depending on the time of year. A central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room, bar and a gym. As the south pole moves from 24-hour daylight towards gradual darkness, the British Antarctic Survey research station on the Brunt ice shelf witnesses this year’s first sunset over Antarctica . For the crew of the French–Italian Halley research station in Antarctica, it means isolation is coming. They are about to be 'locked in' - and will have to survive six months of complete isolation. To make things worse, four months will be in darkness because the Sun never rises above the horizon. Called Halley VI, it is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. The centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff, depending on the time of year. A central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room, bar and a gym. A vacuum drainage system keeps water . consumption down, and the ski-clad stilts keep the units about 4 metres . (13 feet) above the level of the ice. The inside of the centre has been . been specially designed to support crew numbers ranging from 52 in the . summer to 16 during the three months of total darkness in winter, when . temperatures at the base drop as low as -56C. It has triple-glazed windows and a . quiet room at the north end of the station is included for residents to . contemplate the Antarctic environment in peace. This year, ESA-sponsored medical doctor Beth Healey will monitor five experiments that are helping to prepare for long-duration missions to explore our Solar System. 'Living in Concordia is similar in many ways to living in space, where crew are cut off from the world without normal sunlight and live in reduced pressure – Concordia station lies 3200 m above sea level,' says the European Space Agency. 'From searching for life that could survive in these extreme conditions to monitoring how the crew of 13 interact and cope with living in close quarters, Beth will have her hands full as the crew maintain the station and perform Antarctic science for the French and Italian polar institutes.' Called Halley VI, the lab is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. ESA signed an agreement this month with the British Antarctic Survey to perform two of the five Concordia experiments at their Halley VI station. If this pilot season runs well, ESA will extend the cooperation. Concordia offers ESA scientists a place to investigate how humans adapt to living in isolation and at high altitudes. The crew at Halley experience the same isolation and lack of daylight but live at sea level. Performing the same investigations at Halley will allow researchers to cross one factor off the list that might influence data: air pressure. Over the next six months, volunteers at Halley and Concordia will record themselves in a video diary and have their social interactions monitored. This is working towards objective computer software that will give clues to an astronaut’s state of mind. The Halley VI centre, a dismantlable research station created for the . British Antarctic Survey by British architects Hugh Broughton, was . nominated for  the World Architecture Festival Awards 2013 . Ask anybody how they feel and most will reply ‘fine’ but, for mission controllers planning a complex spacewalk or spacecraft docking, having an objective second-opinion could be a lifesaver. The system works by analysing small changes in intonation and grammar, as well as charting how often people talk to each other, to develop an idea of how people feel. The second experiment being run at both sites will test how our eyes adapt to four months of outside darkness and artificial lighting. Concordia sunset . David Vaughan, British Antarctic Survey’s director of science, concludes: “We are committed to supporting excellent science in Antarctica in all disciplines. We are hugely excited to be hosting these new experiments that may help prepare for, perhaps, the biggest adventure in history, a manned flight to Mars.” Click here for a full list of ESA’s research at Concordia this year and follow the Concordia blog for updates from the station.

"If you have ever wondered why sleepwalkers can navigate their surroundings without bumping into obstacles, a new study may hint at the answer. Scientists have discovered that navigational cells in the brain are just as active when we are asleep as when we are awake. The finding builds on last year's discovery of the brain’s ‘GPS system’ which comprises clusters of cells that give us a sense of direction. Scientists have revealed that  navigational brain cells  (an illustration of neurons is shown) are just as active when we are asleep as when we are awake. They made their discovery in the brains of mice . Researchers from NYU Langone Medical Centre, in New York, focused on the 'head direction system' in mice, which acts as a compass. The brain cells in the systems fire more whenever a creature’s head points in a certain direction. They found that these head direction neurons are active during sleep. The researchers studied brain activity in mice during deep, or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, that’s a stage known for intense dreaming activity in humans, during which brain electrical activity is virtually indistinguishable from that when awake. They found that during deep sleep, the 'needle' of the brain compass in the mice moved at the same speed when they were asleep, as when they were awake. The researchers studied brain activity in mice during slow-wave and  rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, that’s a stage known for intense dreaming activity in humans, during which brain electrical activity is virtually indistinguishable from that when awake. A stock image is shown . For the first time, conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while they slept. Scientists from the Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution in Paris, France, used the brain's replay process - that of replaying the day's events - to create new memories in the brains of mice, while they slept. The team, led by Karim Benchenane, focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about, or being in, a specific place – and help animals and humans form internal maps. He monitored the activity of these cells when the mice explored an ‘arena’ using electrodes, isolating the cell that fired in a certain arena location. While the mice slept, they monitored the creature’s brain activity and when the specific place cell fired, an electrode stimulated the brain areas linked to reward. When the mice woke up, they immediately scurried to the location that was linked to the rewarding feeling, showing that a new pleasant memory of the place had been formed by the scientists. The feat offers hope that the same technique could one day be used to change human memories, which could help people who replay traumatic events over and over in their minds. During slow-wave periods of sleep however, when brain activity significantly decreases, they found a 10-fold acceleration of activity, so that the mice were ‘looking around’ even more than when they were awake. ‘We have long known that the brain is at work during sleep,’ said senior Gyorgy Buzsaki, Biggs Professor of Neural Sciences at the university. ‘But now we know how it is working in one of the seemingly simpler senses - head orientation - or our sense of where we look at in any given space. ‘The direction sense is an essential part of our navigation system, since it can reset our internal compass and maps instantaneously, as, for example, when we emerge from the subway and try to orient ourselves.’ The finding could lead to new treatments for navigational problems, which are among the first major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological disorders. For the two year study, described in the journal Nature Neuroscience, researchers videotaped the head movements of mice and recorded the electrical activity in the head-direction regions of the sleeping animals. They focused on the antero-dorsal thalmic nucleus and postsibiculum regions of the brain. The recordings were then compared with similar readings made in the same mice while they were awake and navigating in various environments. Lead author of the study, Dr Adrien Peyrache, said: ‘The coordinated activity during the majority of sleep likely represents a consolidation of places, events and times, a sort of navigational backup system in the brain, during which the brain stores a map to memory.’ The next step will be to monitor other parts of the mouse brain involved in more complex forms of behaviours to see if similar neural activity patterns are at work. Researchers are also planning experiments to test whether head direction and navigation can be electrically controlled and predicted in advance. The finding could lead to new treatments for navigational problems, which are among the first major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological disorders .","Brain’s ‘GPS system’ was only discovered by scientists last year .

"He knew he was in jail, but he didn't know why. Eventually, Abreham Zemedagegehu learned that he'd been accused of stealing an iPad — an iPad whose owner later found it. He spent the next six weeks in jail, unable to communicate with his jailers because he is deaf. He described a frightening, isolated experience in which medical procedures were performed without his consent and he feared for his safety. Zemedagegehu sued the Arlington County sheriff last month in federal court, saying his treatment failed to meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Suing: A U.S. citizen who was born in Ethiopia, Abreham Zemedagegehu learned that he'd been accused of stealing an iPad--an iPad whose owner later found it . 'I felt like I was losing my mind,' Zemedagegehu said through an interpreter in an interview at his lawyer's office. 'I thought Virginia would give me an interpreter and they said no. That's why I felt lost.' Zemedagegehu, who is homeless, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Ethiopia. He grew up using Ethiopian Sign Language. He has learned American Sign Language, but he has never learned more than rudimentary written English. Maj. Susie Doyel, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office, which runs the jail, declined to comment on the specific allegations. She generally defended the jail's ability to handle deaf inmates and others with disabilities, and said several deputies in the jail are proficient in sign language. But she also acknowledged that communication with a deaf inmate is more problematic in cases where the inmate can't communicate in written English. In court papers filed Monday, lawyers for the sheriff ask a judge to dismiss the case, arguing that even if Zemedagegehu's allegations are true, they fail to show intentional discrimination because they attempted various different ways to communicate with him, including handwritten notes. And even if the discrimination were intentional, the lawyers write that it would not violate federal law because there is a rational basis for the discrimination: 'it takes extra resources and creates additional security considerations to bring in an ASL interpreter,' they write. Zemedagegehu's ordeal began Feb. 2, 2014, as he sought a warm place to sleep at Reagan National Airport. According to Zemedagegehu's lawsuit, officers from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority arrested him on a complaint that he had stolen another man's iPad. Jailed: He spent the next six weeks in jail, unable to communicate with his jailers because he is deaf. He described a frightening, isolated experience in which medical procedures were performed without his consent and he feared for . Zemedagegehu says he requested an ASL interpreter to explain what was happening, but instead was taken to the Arlington jail for processing. He said the booking process was bewildering, with someone speaking on a video screen and he not understanding what was happening. After he was booked, he underwent a medical screening, and says he was given forms to sign. He didn't know what they were, and refused to sign them. He says they stuck a needle in his arm without explaining what was occurring — he later learned it was tuberculosis test, to which he suffered a bad reaction. It was not until he was arraigned Feb. 4, and a court interpreter was present, that he understood the charge against him. When he was offered an opportunity to communicate, he said the jail provided a TTY device. Zemedagegehu said the machine was useless — it types out English text he doesn't understand, and as a practical matter, he said, no one in the deaf community still uses a TTY device. He needed instead access to a videophone or video relay service that is more commonly used, he said. Maj. David Kidwell, director of the jail for the sheriff, also declined to comment specifically on Zemedagegehu's care, but generally defended the use of a TTY machine. 'It gets used, absolutely. It's an accepted practice, and we've had great success with it,' he said. On March 14, 2014, Zemedagegehu struck a plea deal, pleading guilty to lesser misdemeanor charges in exchange for time served. Zemedagegehu says he only took the deal to get of jail, and that he didn't steal the iPad. Zemedagegehu's public defender filed a motion after the guilty plea seeking to have the conviction overturned, saying prosecutors failed to turn over evidence that the man who claimed his iPad was stolen actually had found it some time before the guilty plea. Prosecutors deny withholding evidence. A judge refused to overturn the conviction, saying the appeal had been filed too late. Zemedagegehu sued the Arlington County sheriff last month in federal court, saying his treatment failed to meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act . Zemedagegehu said he doesn't understand why it was so difficult for the legal system to accommodate him with an interpreter. 'They're doing this 25 years after the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed. They know better,' he said. Caroline Jackson, an attorney with the National Association of the Deaf, who is helping on Zemedagegehu's case, said cases like his are 'distressingly common. There's an assumption that persons behind bars have no rights.' The ADA itself does not spell out exactly what kind of accommodations a jail must make for deaf inmates. But since the law was passed, several lawsuits have addressed similar issues. In 2010, the Virginia Department of Corrections reached a settlement requiring it to provide qualified interpreters during the booking process and when providing medical care, among other things. Doyel said the county jail, which isn't part of the state prisons system, has passed audits conducted by the state Department of Corrections and has received accreditation from outside groups. Larry Tanenbaum, a lawyer with Akin Gump, the firm that took Zemedagegehu's lawsuit on a pro bono basis, said he thinks the jail failed to meets its standards in its incarceration of his client. 'To me, it's a matter of human kindness. You see a person in your care who's lost. How do you not help him?' Tanenbaum asked.","Abreham Zemedagegehu was jailed in Arlington County, Virginia in February 2014 and accused of stealing a man's iPad .

"A second Western Australian man has come forward to claim he was the target of a cruel Facebook hoax involving a photo of a person urinating on a war memorial. The image of a young man desecrating on a tribute went viral on social media, aiming to shame the person responsible. 'This is Liam Powell from Perth, western [sic] Australia urinating on a war memorial - share if you're disgusted,' the image was captioned. However, the wrong person was vindicated in the campaign. It has since been revealed that the photo was taken in England six years ago and the real culprit was 19-year-old named Philip Laing. Contrary to the caption, this Facebook image really shows Mr Laing, 19, soaking the wreaths of poppies in 2009. Liam Powell from Wanneroo in Perth's north is now hoping to clear his name, alleging that he was purposefully identified as the person in the image in an attempt to ruin his reputation. Another Liam Powell, a footballer from East Perth, has already spoken out to allege that he was intentionally victimised by the post. Both are insistent that the post was a personal attack, intended to ruin their reputation. Mr Powell from Wanneroo told Fairfax that he has an ongoing problem with internet trolls. 'This was actually aimed at me,' he told Fairfax, refuting the earlier claims from the East Perth Powell. 'I've had a problem with people on Facebook,' he said but is bewildered as to why he is the supposedly subject of such a cruel bullying campaign. He is feeling victimised after receiving almost 300 mostly nasty comments on Facebook regarding the viral photo. Philip Laing (pictured) pleaded guilty but escaped jail time and was instead sentenced to 250 hours of community service . Earlier, the other Mr Powell and his family explained that they felt shamed by the Facebook hoax as they have a military history, WA Today reported. Liam Powell's father, Andrew, said he's been flooded with comments from those who saw the image and the offending caption naming his 17-year-old son, who's an East Perth footballer. 'It's not Liam,' Mr Powell told WA Today. 'It's embarrassing for our family.' Mr Powell says he was particularly upset by the image due to his long military history. He says his father was in the navy, his grandfather was in the Second World War and his great-grandfather also fought in the Boer War. 'Even though it's not him [Liam Powell], I feel ashamed because people think it's him,' Mr Powell said. The real culprit, 19-year-old Mr Laing, caused revulsion in 2009 after he was pictured soaking the wreaths of poppies during a mass student bar crawl in the UK. The student, who pleaded guilty but escaped jail time and was instead sentenced to 250 hours of community service. Laing, is thought to have no memory of the urinating incident, which happened on a night out in 2009 when Mr Laing has been buying drinks for £1 (about AUS $2). He was ordered to pay £185 (about AUS $366) in prosecution costs. The real culprit, Mr Laing, told probation officers back in 2009 that he had been buying drinks for £1 (about AUS $2) on the night . Security staff later washed the memorial .","A photo on Facebook has gone viral which claims to depict 17-year-old Liam Powell peeing on a war memorial .

"An historic Grade II listed building on one of London's most desirable squares is set to be transformed into a 'mega-mansion' worth more than £60million. Number 52 Cadogan Square in Belgravia will be turned into what is being billed as one of London's finest recently refurbished homes after plans were submitted to Kensington borough council. Developers want to install a gym and spa along with a 'gentleman's cloakroom', 'ladies' powder room', commercial kitchen and staff quarters in the basement of the six-story property. There is also a family 'media room', 'his' and 'her' offices and a 'women's' sitting room on the same floor. The six-story Number 52 Cadogan Square in Belgravia, central London is to be refurbished into a so-called 'mega-mansion' worth £60million . Plans show the huge scale of the central London mansion - which will include a 'ladies' powder room', 'juice bar', nanny's bedroom and jacuzzi . The ground floor of the  mansion will have a dining room for 20 along with a huge drawing room and wine cellar. On the first floor, there will be an enormous master bedroom with an equally large dressing room and bathroom. The bedroom suite is so vast it even has its own kitchenette. The second floor boasts three massive guest bedroom suites while the fourth floor has three children's bedrooms and a nanny's bedroom, all of which are en-suite. In total, there will be around 20,000 sq/ft of accommodation - making it around 22 times the size of the average new home. The property also includes a sizeable mews property at the rear. The best properties on Cadogan Square will typically sell for around £3,000 per sq/ft - potentially giving number 52 a £60 million price-tag. Stamp duty on a £60 million home is £7.1 million - enough to pay for 300 nurses. Number 52 Cadogan Square was built in 1886 for Thomas Andros de la Rue, a wealthy printer, who wanted a stunning Queen Anne Revival style home. It was later the residence of sugar tycoon Vernon Tate, who lived there until his death in 1950s, after which the property remained in Tate & Lyle ownership and was used as accommodation for executives visiting London. As well as 20,000sq ft of floor space - making the property three times bigger than the average home - the property includes a mews residence . The building, which was designed in a 'Queen Anne revival' style, features a number of ornate architectural features . But after being empty for a number of years, the property is said to be in need of 'significant refurbishment' and architects, acting on behalf of The Cadogan Estate, have submitted plans to return it to an opulent family home. Photos submitted by architects to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council show an incredibly ornate interior, with elaborate chimney pieces, carved oak panelling and stained glass windows. The outside, according to experts, is an 'archetypal example of Queen Anne Revival style'. Local estate agents were excited when asked about the prospect of 52 Cadogan Square being returned to a family home, with one describing the property as a 'rare and wonderful thing'. Jake Russell, director at Russell Simpson, said: 'Cadogan Square is generally considered to be one of, if not, the best address in prime central London. 'With the vast majority of the square being flats, the rarity of an entire original freehold building with garden square views is enormously appealing and, I expect, would have much demand. 'Being so unusual makes it incredibly hard to value, but you'd expect for records to be broken with such a rare and wonderful thing.' The huge property is now said to be in need of 'significant refurbishment' after being empty for a number of years . Photos submitted with plans show the building's beautiful interior, with oak panelling and a wooden staircase leading up to the first floor . Photos of the interior of the mansion - built in 1886 for wealthy Thomas Andros de la Rue - show its well-preserved stained-glass windows . The Cadogan Group bought 52 Cadogan Square and 30 Clabon Mews in 2010 for £30 million. They are one of London's biggest and wealthiest landowners and, according to company reports, have a property portfolio worth £4.46 billion. While the layout for the mansion will remain largely untouched, it will undergo an 'extensive internal and external refurbishment works'. The mews house will be completely remodelled with the garage large enough to accommodate a Rolls-Royce Phantom. The end of the public consultation is Friday, with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea expecting a decision by April 15. Mr Russell added: 'Given the council are all for retaining the original character of an area, and the identity of the various pockets of Chelsea and Kensington, I'd be very surprised if they opposed the proposals to restore this building back to being a single family dwelling. 'Whilst the council have adopted a more negative attitude towards 'losing residential units' in the Borough more recently, there is a huge amount to be said for restoring these beautiful old buildings back to the way in which they were originally intended to be, and built for. What a home it would be.' The property will have a sauna, steam room and gym, as well as staff quarters. Plans show a sketch of a Rolls Royce in the garage .

"Charles Darwin himself described them as the 'strangest animals ever discovered' and was baffled as to how they could have evolved. Now scientists have unraveled a 180 year old mystery of the evolutionary origins of South America's hooved mammals that died out 10,000 years ago. The continents native ungulates - hooved animals - have baffled palaeontologists as they share traits with rodents, elephants and camels. The four-legged Macrauchenia patachonica, shown in the artists impression above, has baffled scientists since fossils of the species, which died out around 10,000 years ago, were found by Charles Darwin 180 years ago . But now by analysing the proteins preserved in fossilised bones, scientists have been able to show that the animals are more closely related to modern horses. The technique they used also promises to reveal new information about other long-extinct fossilised species. Fossils of an ancient primate found in the Amazon may be the first monkey to have traveled from Africa across the Atlantic Ocean to South America. The discovery suggest that monkeys first arrived in South America nearly 10 million years earlier than previously thought. Scientists believe the first primates traveled to South America, which was once an isolated island before it joined to North America three million years ago, from Africa on natural rafts that drifted across the Atlantic ocean. The two groups of primates then evolved separately to create distinct families of primates. However, evidence for when this epic journey occurred has been patchy and the oldest fossil of a monkey found in the New World was 26 million years old found in Bolivia. But now fossilised teeth, found on a riverbank in a remote part of the Amazon in Peru, that have been dated at 36 million years old suggest the crossing from Africa may have occurred far earlier. A reconstruction of  the 38 million year old Perupithecus ucayalensis (left) found in South America is shown above alongside a species it closely resembled - Talahpithecus parvus, that lived in Libya 39 milion years ago . Unlike DNA, proteins can be better preserved within fossilised remains. The scientists say it could allow them to look back in time 10 times farther than current techniques using ancient DNA. Dr Ross MacPhee, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History's department of mammalogy and one of the authors of the study, said: 'Fitting South American ungulates to the mammalian family tree has always been a major challenge for palaeontologists, because anatomically they were these weird mosaics, exhibiting features found in a huge variety of quite unrelated species living all over the place . 'This is what puzzled Darwin and his collaborator Richard Owen so much in the early 19th century. 'With all of these conflicting signals, they couldn’t say whether these ungulates were related to giant rodents, or elephants, or camels—or what have you.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature, began their study by attempting to extract DNA from the fossilised bones of ungulate fossils found in South America. However, DNA breaks down quickly in the warm wet conditions found in tropical areas that cover much of South America. Instead the researchers began to look at analysing the sequence of a structural protein called collagen that is found in all animal bones. Collagen can survive more more than a million years in a range of conditions and is made up from amino acids. The sequence of these amino acids is ultimately determined by the DNA code of the animal and so can be used to draw conclusions about the species origins. The researchers screened 48 fossils of Toxodon plantensis and Macrauchenia patachonica - the same species that Darwin discovered the remains of in Uraguay and Argentina 180 years ago. Dr Ian Barnes, a molecular evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London who led the research, said: 'Although the bones of these animals had been studied for over 180 years, no clear picture of their origins had been reached.' The photograph above shows the skull of a Toxodon plantensis kept at the Natural History Museum in London . Charles Darwin (right) was baffled by fossils of the Toxodon (shown in the illustration on the right) when he first discovered it and scientists have struggled ever since to work out where it sits in the evolutionary tree . The modern technique, known as proteomics, allowed the researchers to show that the closest living relatives of these species were perissodactyls - the group that includes horses, rhinos and tapirs. This suggests the strange South American animals migrated into the continent from North America around 60 million years ago just after a mass extinction killed off many of the non-avian dinosaurs. The researchers now believe their technique could help to revolutionise palaeotological research by allowing scientists to reach far further back in time than they have been able to with DNA analysis. Frido Welker, the lead author of the study at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the University of York, said: 'By selecting only the very best preserved bone specimens and with various improvements in proteomic analysis, we were able to obtain roughly 90 percent of the collagen sequence for both species. 'This opens the way for various other applications in paleontology and paleoanthropology, which we are currently exploring.'","Researchers looked at 48 fossils of hooved animals from South America .

"A 4,000-year-old Egyptian statue which was sold by a council for nearly £16million to an overseas buyer has been banned from leaving Britain. The statue of Sekhemka, a limestone figure which is just 30in high, was controversially sold by Northampton Borough Council for £15.76m last year to a mystery buyer abroad. But the council was accused of committing ‘a great act of folly’ by The Save Sekhemka Statue Action group, who feared the ancient relic could disappear into private ownership overseas. Sold: The statue of Sekhemka (pictured at Christie's, London last year), a limestone figure which is just 30in high, was controversially sold by Northampton Borough Council for £15.76million to a mystery buyer abroad . Now the culture minister Ed Vaizey has ordered a four-month export ban on the relic leaving the British Isles after Arts Council England ruled the sale breached standards for how museums manage their collections. That ban could even be extended to March 2016 if a ‘serious intention to raise funds to purchase the statue is made’, Arts Council England said. The statue, which dates from 2,400BC, is a tomb model of a kilt-wearing high official surrounded by his wife, son and seven offering bearings. Mr Vaizey praised the figure as a work of ‘outstanding aesthetic importance’, and ‘the finest example of its kind anywhere in the world.’ Treasure: The statue, which dates from 2,400BC, is a tomb model of a kilt-wearing high official surrounded by his wife, son and seven offering bearings. Above, the artifact picture in Christie's last year . But in July last year the council sold off the piece, which they have owned for more than 100 years, insisting it wasn’t the centrepiece of their collection. The Egyptian government called on the statue to be returned to Egypt if Northampton did not want it, and said the sale ran counter to the values and role of museums worldwide. A Northampton council spokesman said the export ban had ‘no impact’ on the council’s sale of the statue – and insisted it was a matter for the government and Arts Council England to resolve between them. Tomb model: The statue of Sekhemka, on display at Christie's, London, ahead of its sale last year . The statue of Sekhemka was found during a 19th century archaeological dig near Cairo. The tomb model shows a seated man wearing a kilt and wig, with his wife, son and offering-bearers. Sekhemka was a high level scribe who lived in the Old Kingdom sometime between 2,700BC and 2,2250BC - the period of Egyptian history when the pyramids of Giza were built. In a country that was mainly illiterate, his ability to read and write means he would have been a person of high status with access to high offices. At first, tomb statues - a sign of wealth - were reserved for the royal family. But as the economy improved, officials like Sekhemka who held high-ranking positions could afford to pay craftsmen to create likenessess of themselves for their tomb. They served two purposes: to act as a record of the way the person looked, and to ensure that the offerings he desired for his survival in the afterlife - listed on the papyrus carried in the statue's hands - were made after his death. It is unkown exactly when the statue arrived at Northampton Museum, but records indicate it was on display before the end of the 1890s. It has been on display at various Norhampton museums until two years ago. The statue, which stands just 30in high, has been praised as a work of 'outstanding aesthetic importance' by culture minister Ed Vaizey. He added it was 'the finest example of any kind in the world'. Its sale in July last year - a bid to raise money to extend Northampton's museum and art gallery - was heavily criticised.","Statue of Sekhemka was sold by Northampton Borough Council last year .

"Katie Hopkins has been reported to police by Labour MP Simon Danczuk over claims she incited racial hatred in tweets linking Pakistani men to the Rochdale child sex abuse scandal . Katie Hopkins has been reported to police by Labour MP Simon Danczuk over claims she incited racial hatred in tweets linking Pakistani men to the Rochdale child sex abuse scandal. Mr Danczuk, who represents the town, has asked the Police Commissioner of Greater Manchester Police, Tony Lloyd, to investigate whether a crime had been committed after comments made by the outspoken TV star on Twitter. Hopkins sent the tweets after Mr Danczuk attended the raising of a Pakistani flag over the town hall for half an hour on March 23 to mark Pakistan's National Day. She wrote: 'Raising a Pakistani flag in Rochdale is not helping community cohesion. it is inflammatory. @SimonDanczuk you & your party disgust me.' Outspoken Hopkins posted a series of messages to her account after the MP tweeted a picture of himself at the event. In response the controversial columnist sent a picture of eight men convicted of child exploitation offences, asking Mr Danczuk if they were his friends too. She wrote: 'Are these your friends too ‪@SimonDanczuk? Is this why you are raising the Pakistani flag in Rochdale? 77 years inside.' 'Your Pakistani friends saw young white girls as fair game when they abused them,' she wrote in a separate post. 'Do NOT lecture me on community cohesion fool.' 'Raising a Pakistani flag in Rochdale is not helping community cohesion,' she added in another. 'It is inflammatory. ‪@SimonDanczuk you & your party disgust me.' Explaining his decision to make the complaint, the MP said it was about the businesswoman 'inciting racial hatred'. He said: 'The letter is me asking the Police Commissioner to investigate whether a crime has been committed in relation to Katie Hopkins.' Hopkins is said to have started sending the tweets after Mr Danczuk attended the raising of a Pakistani flag over the town hall for half an hour on March 23 to mark Pakistan's National Day . He continued: 'It is not right that somebody who has little to do with Rochdale incited hatred of this kind. 'Rochdale is a very cohesive community - people work well together. 'Of course there are tensions, like there are in other communities, but people rub together really well and we don't need outsiders like Katie Hopkins to come in and cause trouble just for the sake of causing trouble and creating Sun headlines.' Mr Danczuk said Rochdale has faced up to the 'heinous crime' of child grooming 'in a way that's managed to keep our communities together'. He said: 'That's why Katie Hopkins' crass comments are not helpful. They are a clear attempt to divide communities, undo three years of hard work and make an unfair and racist generalisation that anyone of Pakistani origin is a child abuser. 'To equate the Pakistan flag with child abuse, as she has done on social media over the last week, is absurd and it creates a dangerous environment where extreme intolerance becomes acceptable. 'We have already seen taxi drivers stabbed in the face in race hate attacks and I'm not prepared to allow people like Hopkins, who know nothing about our town, to stir up tensions in such a dangerously provocative way that could lead to innocent people being attacked by extremists. 'As a result of her comments last week, I have been threatened by extremists and hard right groups have pledged to march on our town. I am a strong supporter of free speech but it has to be responsible - and that's why we have laws to prevent people deliberately provoking hatred of a racial group.' Ms Hopkins has been contacted for comment. She also sparked outrage yesterday after being accused of making a Holocaust joke aimed at the wife of Ed Miliband – even though his Jewish parents fled from the Nazis. 'Raising a Pakistani flag in Rochdale is not helping community cohesion,' she added in another. 'It is inflammatory. ‪@SimonDanczuk you & your party disgust me' She wrote: 'Are these your friends too ‪@SimonDanczuk? Is this why you are raising the Pakistani flag in Rochdale? 77 years inside' The controversial TV pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the Labour leader could 'gas' his wife   Justine  in a message on Friday. She tweeted: 'Pollsters say Justine is the least popular of party wives. He might stick her head in the oven and turn on the gas.' The outspoken star was then bombarded with hundreds of furious messages condemning her 'vile' tweet, with one saying: 'You really are a deplorable and scummy piece of excrement.' She has also courted controversy this week for her comments about the Germanwings disaster. The TV pundit tweeted saying: 'Sympathy for the co-pilot is making me angry. If you are suicidal, for goodness sake top yourself in private. Attention seeking b******s.' The controversial TV pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the Labour leader could 'gas' his wife Justine (pictured together) She followed this up with a number of tweets about depression, including: 'Most depression is just genuine sadness at a social situation. Like being caught in torrential rain with a bag from Primark.' Meanwhile, Mr Danczuk confessed yesterday to watching pornography. The husband of selfie-loving Karen Danczuk was spotted favouriting hard-core porn on Twitter - but blamed it on a fault with his iPhone. However, the 48-year-old was unembarrassed about the gaffe. He stressed he does not use porn regularly, but insisted: 'I am a man of the world and it is part of life, many people do.'","Katie Hopkins has been reported to police by Labour MP Simon Danczuk .

"Bristol Palin has announced she is engaged to her Medal of Honor winning boyfriend Dakota Meyer. The 24-year-old daughter of the former Alaska governor and failed vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin shared the news on her Intsagram page on Saturday. Alongside an image of her kissing the 26-year-old former Marine, who won the Medal of Honor, she wrote: 'Truly the luckiest girl in the world, cannot wait to marry this man!!!!' Scroll down for video . Romantic: Bristol Palin, the 24-year-old daughter of the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin shared the news of her engagement to Dakota Meyer on her Intsagram page on Saturday . The mother-of-one then uploaded a picture of her engagement ring and wrote a piece on her Patheos blog. It read: :Last night, Sgt Dakota Meyer proposed and I said yes! 'Dakota came to Alaska to film Amazing America with my mom last year. He met Tripp during that time, and I’ve seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. 'He’s visited us in Alaska, and I’ve visited his wonderful family in Kentucky. He’s wonderful with Tripp and I’m so proud to be marrying him. 'He’s so romantic! He asked me to marry him at a Rascal Flatts concert. The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated 'Bless the Broken Road' to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed! 'It’s amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God’s hands. He really is good and His plans are so much greater than our own.' Happy: She then uploaded a picture of the engagement ring followed by a string of heart symbols . Kentucky native Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, also shared his excitement on social media, saying: 'I'm definitely the luckiest guy ever to be able to spend the rest of my life with [Bristol].' The couple have recently started positing pictures together. Last week she uploaded an image of the pair playing in the snow with her six-year-old son, who she had with former fiancé Levi Johnson when she was just 17. Since her mother's failed bid to become vice president in 2008, Bristol has appeared on Dancing with the Stars and featured in her own Lifetime show about raising her son, titled Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp. She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far. Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four of his missing Marines. Excitement: Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, also shared his excitment on social media, saying: 'I'm definitely the luckiest guy ever to be able to spend the rest of my life with [Bristol]' Reaction: Sarah Palin congratulated the pair on Twitter after their announcement . He was able to rescue 36 troops and kill eight Taliban attackers despite being shot in the arms. Tragically he was not able to save his four fellow Marines and friends who he went in search of, but went back and carried each of their bodies to safety. He caused a stir in December for taunting ISIS members on Twitter on Facebook - calling them cowards. He also wrote: 'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club.' Bristol broke up with ex-partner Johnson in 2009 and started an intense custody battle. However, in the midst of the battle, they also briefly reunited and got engaged again. The engagement was short lived when they broke up for a second time in the summer of 2010. Johnston has been married to Sunny since October 2012 and have two children together.

"A talent show contestant ruined his chances of winning when he crashed off the stage and landed on the judges. The karaoke king was performing Steppenwolf's Born to be Wild at a strip club contest in Croydon, south London when he tumbled off the podium. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the stage-dive didn't help the singer's shot at winning the competition and he missed out on the prize. Judges at a talent contest  in Croydon were given a shock when one the performers fell off the stage . The performer attempted to grab the podium's pole but missed and tumbled off the stage onto the judges . The accident happened at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club last month during the final of the venue's popular Talent Show night. A recording made of the evening shows the performer, who has not been named, belting out the rock classic on the club's stage, which features a pole for the venue's usual performers. In the footage, the man warms up the crowd by playing air guitar and posturing before attempting to swing around the pole at the centre of the stage. But the man's hand passes several inches from the pole and he flies past it and - to screams from the crowd - falls straight off the stage and on to the line of judges. Luckily, a judge manages to move out of the way as the man falls and the performer hits the ground with a thud, but is said to be fine. The incident happened Larry Flynt's Hustler Club in south London during a talent contest night last month . A contestant performing Steppenwolf's Born to be Wild warmed up the crowd with some air guitar moves . The man then went for a party-piece move as he ran towards the pole in the centre of the stage to swing on it . But footage from the venue shows the man missing the pole completely and falling face-first, into the crowd . Uthania Jackson, manager of the club, was one of the judges and said the 'regular' was uninjured and has since been back for more. She said: 'He was fantastic in the first heat and went straight into the final and was really getting into it, performing air guitar and everything. 'But he misjudged where the pole was by a few inches and landed on me. He didn't win unfortunately. 'He laughed it off and felt a bit embarrassed but carried on into the night.' Mr Jackson was uninjured and instead chose to award the talent contest prize to a group of four women, called the 'Hustler Honeys', who performed a raunchy routine from Moulin Rouge on February 27. The stage-dive could not have gone worse for the man's chances of winning the contest as he landed on one of three judges lined up to choose the winner . To screams from the crowd, he fell between two of the judges' chairs and landed with a thud on the floor .

"A father who kidnapped his 18-year-old gay son and tried to drive him to their native Lebanon so he could marry him off and 'cure' his homosexuality has been fined £1,000. Nasser El-A. came out as gay at the age of 15 but his Muslim family considered it an affront on their faith and said it was unacceptable. His relatives tried to force him into a marriage to 'put him back on the right path' - and led by Nasser's father, later kidnapped him with the intention of taking him back to Lebanon. Kidnapped by his family: Nasser El-A. was violently abused and kidnapped by his Muslim family for being gay . Today the teenager's father and two uncles stood trial at Berlin Criminal Court and escaped with a fine of £1,000 each as punishment. Nasser is hoping his plight will raise awareness of the challenges faced by many gay Muslim men, The Local reports. When he first told his family about his sexuality in 2012, he was threatened with shocking violence. His uncle covered him in petrol and threatened to set him alight and later poured boiling water all over him. Speaking to Tagesspiegel, he said: 'I'm not someone who hides away. I don't want to suppress my sexuality. My father said he would personally ram a knife into my throat. Nasser ran away from home rather than face the the physical and mental abuse. Meets gay icon: The 18-year-old met German filmmaker and gay activist Rosa von Praunheim (left) at court in Berlin today . At first he struggled to find refuge and says the  lack of accommodation or shelter for vulnerable young men is another important point he wanted to highlight with his case. He eventually found a home with an organisation called Papatya, which is aimed at housing vulnerable girls and young women. He was later invited back home by his mother, with his father supposedly at work, and returned only to be kidnapped. The family had hoped to smuggle him back to Lebanon with a forced marriage in mind, but were stopped by authorities on the Romanian-Bulgarian border and brought back to Berlin. Despite Nasser's father and uncles not turning up in court for their sentence, the defiant teenager saw the day as a victory. He was pictured wearing a badge saying 'Stop homophobia' and a rainbow wristband in widely-circulated photos - making sure that he brought his cause to the widest audience he could reach. Making a stand: The teenager hopes his case will raise the profile of the struggles faced by gay Muslim men .","Nasser El-A, 18, came out as gay to his family when he was 15 years old .

"An 18-year-old camp counselor is accused of sending sick anonymous taunts to a 13-year-old boy camper, including threats of rape. Robert Yagid, from Davie, Florida, has been charged as an adult for aggravated stalking. Among the terrifying messages that Yagid allegedly to sent to the boy over the anonymous messaging app Kik, were 'Have you ever been raped before?' and 'You're so cute when you sleep.' Robert Yagid (center) has been charged as an adult for aggravated stalking. Among the terrifying messages that Yagid allegedly to sent to the boy were 'Have you ever been raped before?' and 'You're so cute when you sleep' A very long threatening message detailing a sexual assault was sent to the boy in June, according to cops. It read, 'Have you ever been raped before? Because that tight, white little a****** belongs to me now … You can call authorities, you can pray to God, but you will never find me. Until I've found you first,' it said, according to the affidavit. 'The devil has plans for you; it looks dim and full of sickness, consuming your body. Make amends to free your heart, and soul; for soon, there will be no going back.' When the boy's mother discovered the messages she took them to Pembroke Pines police and obtained a search warrant. 'The suspect's actions caused him to be fearful and he believed that his life was in danger,' Detective Michael Silver wrote in the search warrant application. The owner of Camp Adventure Inc., which runs private camps out of the Broward County park (pictured)  has said Yagid had worked for two summers as a counselor-in-training and did not supervise campers . That day detectives used IP addresses to find suspect Yagid at his house in Davie. After showing the boy a photo line-up he recognized the photo of Yagid to be 'Robbie' his camp counselor. Cops say they confiscated Yagid's electronic devices and found a Google history that read, 'The Creepy Sex Manifesto,' 'Stalking for Beginners,' 'How to Ruin Someone’s Life,' and 'Paedophiles Guide,' according to a juvenile arrest affidavit. When police questioned Yagid as to why he wrote the messages he wrote that he was, 'just bored.' In February a judge placed Yagid on home detention, ordered that he wear an electronic ankle monitor and prohibited him from using the Internet, except for homework assignments, reports the Sun Sentinel. Yagid also was ordered to have no contact with the victim. The owner of Camp Adventure Inc., which runs private camps out of the Broward County park has said Yagid had worked for two summers as a counselor-in-training and did not supervise campers. The next step for Yagid is an arraignment before a judge in adult court. That hearing has not yet been scheduled.","Robert Yagid, 18, has been charged as an adult for aggravated stalking .

"More than 100,000 people are claiming around £100 a week in benefits after being assessed as unable to work due to addiction, obesity or stress. They are claiming Employment Support Allowance (ESA), which is awarded to those who have an illness or disability that affects their ability to work. The benefit replaced incapacity benefit, income support and severe disablement allowance with an annual cost to the taxpayer of £725million. Scroll down for video . A map showing where the highest proportion of people claiming ESA for alcohol and drug problems are located in the UK . Now according to new figures in the Daily Star Sunday, 56,000 people with alcohol problems receive ESA, while 36,650 drug addicts are also claimants. In addition 47,990 people with stress are also handed around £100 a week, with 1,780 obese people receiving the benefit. Bournemouth has the biggest proportion of claimants of ESA for people with alcohol and drug addictions, with around one in 14 people in the Dorset town who are handed the benefit abusing alcohol, while one in 20 have drug addiction problems. Other areas with a high percentage of claimants with drug and alcohol addictions include Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Bristol. Meanwhile, the biggest proportion of claimants due to stress is South Hams in Devon, closely followed by Tamworth in Staffordshire and Richmond in North Yorkshire. 1. Bournemouth . 2. Edinburgh . 3.

The highest percentage of ESA claimants due to obesity is Sevenoaks as well as Malling and Tonbrige, all in Kent. Jonathan Iasby of the Taxpayers' Alliance told the newspaper: 'The benefit system is a valuable safety net but it can't be a comfort blanket. We need to ensure treatment is available to help people back to work.' According to the government 'you can apply for ESA if you're employed, self-employed, unemployed or a student on disability living allowance'. The initial assessment phase lasts for 13 weeks, during which your income and capital are analysed. Last year, the government claimed more than 100 people stopped claiming sickness benefits every day over 2013. Bournemouth, pictured, has the biggest proportion of ESA claimants, who receive the benefit due to alcohol and drug addiction . Since May 2010, when the Coalition took over, there has been a fall of 160,000 people claiming sickness payments. Ministers claim the success is down to the Government's controversial new assessment regime pioneered by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. This is due to applicants' physical and mental conditions assessed to show how it would affect their ability to work is also assessed. Sometimes applicants are asked to undergo a medical examination and are asked about how their condition affects their ability to carry out every day tasks, whether they vary from one day to another and what their normal day is like. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith pioneered the Employment Support Allowance, which requires claimants to undergo mental and physical assessments . Last year the private French firm that decided whether benefits claimants were fit for work pulled out of its £500million contract after claiming its staff received death threats. Atos Healthcare, which has been accused of making unfair decisions on when sick and disabled people lose benefits, was ordered to review its tests last summer after a Government report found its assessors were of unacceptably poor quality. But the IT company claimed it was pulling out as its staff were increasingly coming under attack while carrying out their work.","Over 100,000 benefit claimants receive Employment Support Allowance .

"A married New Jersey English teacher was indicted Wednesday on charges that she engaged in improper relationships with three of her male students, including having an alleged sexual relationship with one of them. Nicole McDonough, 32, of Mount Olive, was arrested December 30 on suspicion of having sex with an 18-year-old student while employed as a teacher at Mendham High School. However a subsequent investigation now sees her facing three charges of official misconduct, with prosecutors saying McDonough engaged in improper 'communication' and 'fraternization' with two other male students, who were also 18. Prosecutors did not elaborate on the kind of fraternizing the mother-of-two allegedly took part in. Indicted: High school English teacher Nicole McDonough - seen here at her first court appearance in January - was indicted Wednesday on charges of engaging in improper relationships with three her male students, all 18, including having an alleged sexual relationship with one of them . According to The Daily Record, the alleged sexual relationship occurred in April, May, and June of 2013. The relationships with the other two students then allegedly occurred in April, May, and June of 2014. Additionally, NJ.com have reported that McDonough does not face any sex charges because all three alleged victims were 18. The prosecution made it clear they believe she was only sexual with one of the boys. The indictment outlined that McDonough committed second-degree official misconduct because she 'did commit acts relating to her office, but constitutionally unauthorized exercises of her official functions'. Charged: Nicole McDonough (above) was arrested in December after reportedly having sex with an 18-year-old student. An investigation found she had 'improper relations' with two others, police say . McDonough did so 'with the purpose to obtain a benefit for herself, specifically emotional, mental and/or physical sexual gratification', the indictment said. Timothy Smith, McDonough's attorney, said Friday he would seek to have the indictment dismissed and called it a 'rogue prosecution' that incorrectly applies official misconduct laws. Official misconduct is punishable upon conviction by up to 10 years in prison with a minimum of five years to be served before parole consideration. Scene: McDonough, a married mother of two, worked as an English teacher at West Morris Mendham High School in Morristown, New Jersey . According to NJ.com, McDonough 'teaches honors and International Baccalaureate-level English courses at the high school' and 'holds a bachelor's degree in English Literature from the College of St. Elizabeth.' Describing herself on the school's website she writes; 'Although teaching is one of my many passions, I am also a mom, a personal trainer, and a cross-fitter. I am a mother of two amazing girls. We also have a puggle named Tegan.' She closes by saying; 'The classroom is one of my many loves and I am excited to return to start a full year of school!' Authorities have not released any of the student's names.","Nicole McDonough, of Mount Olive, New Jersey, was indicted on three counts of official misconduct Wednesday .

"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said he would use cash raised in England to fund a spending splurge north of the border . Scottish Labour Jim Murphy has threatened  a new £1billion tax raid on England to fund a fresh spending splurge north of the border. Mr Murphy said Labour would hit bankers with a new ‘bonus tax’ and slash the amount wealthy savers could pay into their pensions tax free. He said Labour would use this cash, almost entirely raised in England, for a range of giveaways in Scotland. Mr Murphy said he would introduce a ‘Scottish Jobs Guarantee’, which Mr Murphy says will end long-term youth unemployment. About 5,000 young Scots aged 18-24 will be eligible for the jobs guarantee in the first year of the scheme. The £1billion package includes a £1,000 increase in bursaries for Scottish students, a ‘future fund’ worth £1,600 for every 18 and 19-year-old in work and free university tuition. The future fund, unveiled at Scottish Labour's spring conference, will provide teenagers who do not go to university with £1,600 to spend on what they ‘need to get on in life’. Mr Murphy said: ‘This is an unprecedented investment in our young people, only made possible by harnessing the wealth of the whole of the UK, including the wealthiest in the City of London. ‘It is a guarantee of opportunity that the SNP can't deliver because they don't believe in redistributing from South to North. ‘It is a guarantee that the Tories won't deliver because they do not believe in redistributing from rich to poor.’ ‘This generation of young people has come of age when, for the first time, most parents believe that their children will do worse than they did.' Mr Murphy added: ‘While the living standards of those retiring now are greater than previous pensioners, young people's living standards have stagnated compared to their older siblings and parents. ‘The economic and social costs of a generation for whom the hope of youth has been replaced with pessimism over the chances of a better future may dog us for years to come. ‘But it is not too late to turn things around and to make the promise of a better future real. ‘It is not too late because this generation of young people have been educated for longer and to a higher standard than any previous generation.’ Jim Murphy said the SNP could not match Labour's spending pledge because they wanted to break away from the UK . On the jobs guarantee, Mr Murphy said: ‘We will use a new tax on the bonuses of bankers here in the City of London and in the UK's other financial centres. ‘We will use that funding to guarantee a real job, at at-least minimum wage, and to guarantee training for every young person too. ‘We offer the guarantee to all young people who are at risk of falling into long-term unemployment. ‘This will be a Scottish Jobs Guarantee, delivered by a distinct contract in Scotland, in partnership with employers, colleges and the Scottish Government.’ SNP work and pensions spokeswoman Dr Eilidh Whiteford said: ‘Given that Jim Murphy has voted in favour of tuition fees at every turn, Scotland's young people won't fall for his empty attempts to buy their vote. ‘And despite Westminster's disastrous economic record, youth unemployment is at its lowest level for five years in Scotland as a result of Scottish Government action. The Scottish Government's Opportunities For All scheme offers every 16 to 19-year-old a place in work, education or training - and as a result, 90% of school leavers are going into positive destinations. ‘Mr Murphy's warm words won't hide the fact that his party voted arm-in-arm with the Tories for £30 billion more cuts - at the same time as committing to wasting £100 billion on Trident nuclear weapons. ‘If Mr Murphy really wanted to invest in Scotland's young people, he would dump this ludicrous policy in favour of nuclear weapons and back the SNP in spending the money on education, childcare and health.’","Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy unveils £1billion spending package .

"Kerry Washington looks stunning on the the latest cover of Marie Claire - but more importantly the Scandal star looks like herself, following last month's controversy in which InStyle came under fire for allegedly altering her appearance on its March issue. Marie Claire's cover shot featuring the beautiful 38-year-old actress, who donned a smokey eye, tousled hair and nude lips for the magazine's April issue, is a far cry from the unnatural-looking pictures that InStyle had debuted over a month ago. When Kerry happily shared the InStyle images on her Instagram last February, fans became outraged, accusing the magazine of allegedly whitening her skin and altering her features - which InStyle quickly denied. Scroll down for video . Natural beauty: Kerry Washington looks like her usual stunning self on the April cover of Marie Claire . Same woman: The magazine's cover shot is a far cry from the unnatural-looking picture that InStyle had debuted over a month ago . The fashion publication apologized to fans and released a statement in which it blamed the actress' seemingly altered skin tone on the 'lighting' used during the cover shoot. 'We have heard from those who have spoken out about our newsstand cover photograph, concerned that Kerry's skin tone was lightened,' InStyle said. 'While we did not digitally lighten Kerry's skin tone, our cover lighting has likely contributed to this concern.' The magazine added: 'We understand that this has resulted in disappointment and hurt. We are listening, and the feedback has been valuable. We are committed to ensuring that this experience has a positive influence on the ways in which we present all women going forward.' Posting on her own Twitter account, Kerry thanked the publication for making such a 'beautiful statement', adding that she was grateful the magazine had taken the time to open up such an 'important' conversation. Sultry gaze: The 38-year-old actress donned a smokey eye, tousled hair and nude lips for the magazine's April issue . Yesterday, Kerry proudly shared the Marie Claire cover on her Instagram account and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. 'Obsessed with this cover,' one woman wrote. Another added: 'Yup, this is Kerry Washington the beautiful! Great cover.' Beyond the stunning cover shot, Kerry, who was interviewed by Girls star and author Lena Dunham for the publication, discussed motherhood, privacy and her hopes and dreams for her nearly one-year-old daughter Isabelle as she grows up. 'I just want [Isabelle] to know that she's heard. Really heard, because I feel like that is what we all really want,' she explained. Different person: InStyle came under fire last month for allegedly altering the Scandal star's appearance on its March issue (pictured).

Close cast: She also smiled while taking a group selfie with Jimmy Kimmel and her Scandal co-stars . 'When I think about any of the missteps in my life that I've made, all of which I'm grateful for, it's because I just so wanted to be truly seen and heard for who I am and was afraid I wasn't or wouldn't be.' She added: 'I see you, I hear you, I'm with you as you are.' Kerry also noted that she never felt particularly beautiful when she was younger. The actress, who attended the Spence School in Manhattan with Gwyneth Paltrow, noted: 'I didn't grow up thinking I was pretty. 'There was always a prettier girl than me. So I learned to be smart and tried to be funny and develop the inside of me, because I felt like that's what I had.'","The 38-year-old cover star dons a smokey eye, tousled hair and nude lips for the magazine's April issue .

Earlier today the 54-year-old announced more details about the project and revealed some of the gruelling training she is undergoing at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Moscow. On September 1 a Soyuz‑FG rocket will blast off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on a mission to the ISS. Alongside a Russian commander and Danish flight engineer will be English soprano Sarah Brightman. The singer is pictured during training at Star City in Moscow . The trip will make her the eighth so-called 'space tourist' who has paid millions for the privilege of bloasting into space. Others include software developer and founder of Canonical - which makes the Linux-based operating system Ubuntu - Mark Shuttleworth, and Cirque De Soleil founder Guy Liberte. Ms Brightman will begin her 10-day stint in space and on-board the ISS on 1 September. She will be accompanied by Colonel Sergei Volkov, a 42-year-old Russian who will be leading his third mission into space, and 35-year-old Danish Flight Engineer Andreas Mogensen. However, she will still need to to receive the basic training all astronauts must endure before being allowed into space. At a press conference at the Ham Yard Hotel in Soho the 54-year-old singer (pictured left) said her training lasts for 16 hours a day, starting at 6am, and this includes four hours of Russian language classes. She will also need to undergo weightlessness training in the Russian hydro lab (pictured right) A mock-up of the Soyuz spacecraft used to take astronauts to the ISS is pictured . Ms Brightman said her training lasts for 16 hours a day, starting at 6am, and this includes four hours of Russian language classes. It also includes being thrown around inside a machine called a centrifuge at high speeds to adjust to the varying levels of G force the journey into space involves. This training is taking place at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City in Moscow because the crew will travel to the ISS on a Russian Soyuz capsule and need to know how to use it. It falls into three phases, which will last until the mission blasts off in September. These are General Space Training, Group Training, and Crew Training. General Space Training: This starts up to five years before the mission and involves survival training and a final exam. Group Training: During the Group Training phase, cosmonauts focus on learning about the Soyuz and ISS. Crew Training: The final Crew Training phase then covers detailed vehicle operations procedures, ISS training, and English language. At the Yuri Gagarin Centre the training is broken into a further four sections: simulators, weightless environment training facility and a so-called 'hydro lab', centrifuge and flying laboratories. Flying labs (pictured) help train cosmonauts to carry out specific technical tests of space equipment. In addition, the IL-76 MDK flying lab was built to perform parabolic flights to create short-time weightless and low gravity environments - including lunar and Martian gravity . Simulators . At the centre is a mockup facility of ISS Russian Segment designed to exercise skills of crews and ground personnel in how to use the systems in the segment. This includes a simulator of the Zvezda Service Module, Zarya Functional Cargo Block, a model of ISS RS onboard computer system and the ISS US Orbital Segment (AST simulator). Weightlessness environment training . The hydro lab was set up in in 1980 and is designed to train cosmonauts in conditions of simulated weightlessness using water. Once underwater they are trained how to test space facilities, carry out extravehicular activity and research. It is also fitted with full-scale mock-ups of modules, and cranes are used to lift and drop cosmonauts into the water. Centrifuge . Centrifuges and centrifuge-based simulators are used to improve the cosmonauts’ tolerance of G forces. When G-loads are applied regularly the body's central nervous system adapts and can better manage blood flow, for example. The first centrifuge, called CF-7, was installed in 1973 and was designed to study the influence of spaceflight on the human body, reduce negative effects of acceleration, and test aeronautical and space engineering models.

Ms Brightman will be accompanied to the International Space Station (pictured) by Colonel Sergei Volkov, a 42-year-old Russian who will be leading his third mission into space, and 35-year-old Danish Flight Engineer Andreas Mogensen.

This training is taking place at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City in Moscow because the crew will travel to the ISS on a Russian Soyuz capsule and need to know how to use it. At today's press conference the 54-year-old singer said she was inspired by early space travel. ‘When I was nine years old I watched the first man on the moon,' explained Ms Brightman. ‘It actually changed my perception about life. ‘Suddenly my mind opened and I started to really work on the career I have now. ‘I thank that moment, it was pivotal in my life. ‘I never really talked about it as it could never be a reality, it was all very abstract. ‘But it was always my ambition to fly to space, its something I dreamed about and wanted.’ The future cosmonaut also rebutted a question about how the trip was being funded, saying ‘I paid for this myself, it was something I always wanted to do.’ She added: ‘I can’t currently say what the amount is.’ At a press conference at the Ham Yard Hotel in Soho, Ms Brightman said: ‘I’m just incredibly excited to go.’ Asked whether she planned to ‘be a Starship Trooper’ she laughed and said: ‘I might when I’m up there do one of the movements from that- I’ll see how it goes.’ The joke made reference to Ms Brightman's 1978 top 10 single '(I Lost My Heart) To A Starship Trooper.' She added that her ex-husband Andrew Lloyd Webber had also been involved in her plans to become the first ever international artist to perform live from space, and the pair has recorded a song about her mission due to be released later this year. ‘I have mentioned that I would like to sing something from space,' Ms Brightman said. 'I have been working a little bit with Andrew Lloyd Webber who has come up with a line for something. 'I have been working on various things, its finding a song which suits the idea of space, something that’s incredibly simple, because to sing in negative gravity is incredibly different to singing down here. ‘I’m trying to find a piece which is beautiful and simple in its message, as well as not too complicated to sing.’ Ms Brightman is shown left putting on her spacesuit. In the right-hand image the singer is shown adjusting a  harness and seat. This seat is a mock-up of the one she will sit in during the Soyuz journey . This training is taking place at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City in Moscow because the crew will travel to the ISS on a Russian Soyuz capsule and need to know how to use it . Ms Brightman is pictured inside a hyperbaric chamber. Hyperbaric chambers create an environment in which the atmospheric pressure of oxygen is increased above normal levels. The high concentrations of oxygen can reduce the size of gas bubbles in the blood and improve blood flow to oxygen-starved tissues . Scientists are also working on ironing 'out the technical side of how to make the performance work'. She went on to tell the event’s host, Carol Vorderman, that she has been studying hard and ends her day of lectures by getting a cup of coffee, some food, and carrying on studying. ‘The reason I do a lot of studying in the evening is really for my own confidence,' added Ms Brightman. ‘I want to understand why lights come up on the panel [of the spacecraft], all the things I need to know.’ At the press conference Ms Brightman also revealed her ‘mission patch’, a logo which shows an emblem of her with arms outstretched next to a union jack, American, and Russian flag, outlined against the earth and moon.

"Police say a Pennsylvania veteran who was hearing voices in his head killed a pastor because he thought the clergyman was possessed by demons. Authorities say 38-year-old Roland Zinneh went to the home of a woman named Precious where Connery Dagadu was staying on Tuesday night and asked the pastor to pray with him about the voices he was hearing. Police say there was a fight and Dagadu was killed. Scroll down for video . Alleged murder: Roland Zinneh was charged with first-degree murder in the asphyxiation of the 57-year-old pastor Connery Dagadu whom he allegedly believed was possessed by demons . Local pastor: Connery Dagadu (pictured) is known by Germantown locals as 'The Apostle' and holds services in a two car garage and is known to help strangers 'purge their demons' Police were called after the homeowner told investigators she heard a commotion in the basement the next morning and went downstairs. Precious says Dagadu was sitting on the floor near the television 'with his tongue out' and appeared unresponsive, reports NBC. Precious refers to Dagadu as 'Grandfather' and she told ABC she recruited him to live in her home because he 'is a man of God.' Police say Zinneh was combative when they arrived and yelled, 'I kill demons.' Zinneh allegedly paced around the cluttered room room, jumped up and down, and broke a basement window when police approached him. Zinneh was charged with first-degree murder in the asphyxiation of the 57-year-old Dagadu, of Germantown. Dagadu is known by Germantown locals as 'The Apostle' and holds services in Precious' two car garage, reports ABC. The home: This is the home of Precious where Connery Dagadu was allegedly slain by a crazed Roland Zinneh who sought council for hearing voices . The scene: This is a room in Precious' home in which Connery Dagadu was helping Roland Zinneh to 'purge his demons' on Tuesday night and where he was found dead on Wednesday morning . Precious told reporters he was known to help strangers 'cast out their demons' and 'purge evil spirits.' Zinneh is from Darby, Pennsylvania. He was taken to a hospital for treatment, and is now being held at the Montgomery County Detention Center. ABC reports that at the mental health facility where he was evaluated, Zinneh told a nurse, 'Yesterday I killed many witches. Yes I do that. I kill them.' According to Zinneh's Facebook account he is originally from Liberia and works as a DJ who plays weddings in the Pennsylvania area. Man of God: Precious (right) told reporters that she discovered Connery Dagadu (left) on the floor of her home completely unresponsive . Facebook posts: This is a Facebook posting alleged murderer Roland Zinneh wrote on his page hours before going to visit pastor Dagadu . Days earlier: Roland Zinneh mentions 'witchcraft on his Facebook' and is said to have told a nurse at the mental health facility where he was being evaluated after the alleged murder that he 'killed witches' His Facebook also claims that he served in the United States Army from 1997-2000. Zinneh's Facebook posts before the alleged murder alluded to his religious beliefs. 'THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING. REPENT NOW OR ELSE. SUNDAY IS THE DEAD LINE. THE FATHER GOD ALMIGHTY SAID NO EVIL. ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY IS JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD AND THERE IS ONLY ONE TRUE GOD,' he wrote On Tuesday March 10, hours before visiting his local pastor. On March 8 he wrote,  'TO ALL MY KRAHN PEOPLE IF YOU ARE INTO WITCHCRAFT OR THE DEVIL REPENT NOW OR BE KILLED BY THE HOLY GHOST FIRE.' Court records do not list an attorney for Zinneh. He is being held without bond.

"A cafe owner who took up photography 'as a hobby' has won a top British award for a dramatic storm image. Carla Regler, 31, who runs Seadrift cafe in the little fishing and holiday town of Porthleven with her partner Chris Brooks, used a digital SLR camera to take a stunning picture showing the awesome, furious power of the sea. Her amazing image of Porthleven being battered in last year's ferocious storms has won the weather category in the British Life Photography Awards. Scroll down for video . Carla Regler snapped this shot of Porthleven being battered in last year's ferocious storms , and has won the weather category in the British Life Photography Awards . A beautiful photograph of Porthleven take at Christmas last year, somewhat more serene than the powerful storm shots . Last year she won bronze in the Epson International Pano Awards for a different picture of the same scene, both taken on February 5th, the day that the harbour defences were breached. The Cornwall cafe owner said of her latest award 'This photo was taken at sunrise - the sun is trying to come through and that's what gives it that mood. 'It was a quite an emotional day for Porthleven. It was the day the boats were damaged. 'With everything that happened, it's nice to have been able to capture that moment. 'It's fantastic to get this award and I am really pleased.' The British Life Photography Awards recognises the country's 'obsession' with the weather. On the category section, it states: 'Blessed with four seasons, British weather moulds our landscape, coast, the environment and communities.' And the photos the judges are after are 'Images from parched landscapes to flooded meadows, windswept moors to spring sunlight.' Many households on the coast were left without power after ferocious storms swept in from the Atlantic . Unsurprisingly, all trains lines were suspended in Cornwall at the height of the storm, with structural engineers working overtime . In January and February 2014 hundreds of homes were flooded as the worst storms in 20 years continued to cause misery across the country. Waves as high as 30 feet battered the coastline at Porthleven as Storm Hercules reared its ugly head after moving across the Atlantic over the early part of last year. There were thousands of 999 calls in Cornwall alone, and the Environment Agency issued as many as 340 storm warnings across the country, warning of serious risk to life.' Carla and Chris, 39, moved to Cornwall from Wiltshire four years ago and took on a former wool shop in Porthleven, converting it into the seaside cafe of their dreams. But while Chris is the chef, Carla has become so successful at photography that they have turned the upstairs into a gallery to show off her work. Six months ago she was approached to do pictures for a lifestyle company, and she now also runs photography courses, which is amazing considering she has never had any lessons herself and is completely self-taught. Waves reached as high as 30 feet on the Porthleven coastline as Storm Hercules battered Britain in the early part of 2014 . She has two Canon digital SLR cameras, one costing £1,000, the other £4,000 which she used for the award-winning images. 'I tend to stick to landscape and seascape pictures, and I also like taking photos of horses' she said. 'Obviously the scenery along this coast is beautiful and dramatic so you can get some great pictures, in all types of lights and colours depending on the weather. 'The storms were something else - the town took a proper pounding and they are only just finishing repairs to the harbour wall. 'In fact we got swamped in two ways - the harbour area was battered and flooded, then we had loads of tourists coming down to take pictures of it all!'","Carla Regler, 31, runs Seadrift café in the little fishing and holiday town of Porthleven, Cornwall .

"Doctors could give transplant patients organs from cancer victims, drug addicts or those with infections under new plans in a bid to battle the shortage of healthy donors. Experts say donor organs are declining in quality with more now coming from the elderly or those damaged by lifestyle. The NHS is trying to increase the numbers of willing organ donors because so many patients are dying waiting for transplants. Doctors could give transplant patients organs from cancer victims, drug addicts, and those with infections under new plans (file picture) And one of the plans reportedly been considered is offering patients transplants using organs from people who would have usually had them rejected after being deemed to 'high-risk'. According to the Sunday Times, the proposals would create a special 'fast track' waiting list for the high risk organs. Dr Titus Augustine, director of transplantation at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, told the newspaper: 'One of the things that we have been looking at is trying to match risk with risk. 'There are people on the lost who are willing to take that risk, accept kidneys from people with known infection risk or cancer risk.' Organs are deemed high risk if they come from cancer patients, intravenous drug users and those with a history of having high-risk sex lives. However, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust have said they rejected a research proposal looking into high-risk organ donation. A spokesperson said: 'The Trust submits hundreds of research proposals and applications for funding every year. 'This was an application for funding for a research project looking in to offering patients at risk of dying without transplantation organs considered high risk. 'This proposal was rejected by the funding body and therefore will not be progressing any further.' Darren Hughes, 42, left, and Robert Stuart, 67, right, both died after receiving kidneys infected with meningitis-causing parasitic worms . Last year, it emerged that at least a quarter of all transplants that took place last year involved ‘high-risk’ organs that could be damaged or infected. Figures obtained from NHS Blood and Transplant, the authority which oversees donations, show that last year, 333 patients were given high-risk organs. This represented a quarter of the 1,320 transplanted and included donors who were former addicts, cancer sufferers or those aged over 71. The 333 figure was almost certainly an underestimate because it does not include donations from smokers, the obese or the very sexually active who may have HIV or other infections. But Bryon Jaques, who worked for Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals before emigrating to Australia, warned the NHS drive to increase donations was flawed. It comes after it emerged that two patients had died after being given kidneys from a homeless alcoholic infected with a rare parasitic worm. The relatives of Darren Hughes, 42, and grandfather Robert Stuart, 67, say they were never told about the lifestyle of the donor by doctors at University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes both underwent the operations at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff (pictured) in 2013 and died within three weeks . The organs belonged to a 39-year-old alcoholic with cirrhosis and had been rejected by hospitals in England and Scotland before they were accepted by the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. The man had died of meningitis from an unknown cause and the mystery behind his death had stopped surgeons in Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield, Birmingham and Edinburgh from accepting his kidneys. Mr Jaques, who is a transplant surgeon and liver specialist, said: ‘We were regularly offered donors that I considered to be very high risk. We were offered organs of patients who were dying of widespread sepsis (blood infection). ‘I was offered organs from patients with a history of recent and significant high grade cancer, which has a high risk of transmission. ‘We were offered livers from patients who were actually dying of liver failure. The vast majority of transplants that do take place in the UK are successful and that’s due to the dedication and hard work of the whole transplant community. Last year – 2013/2014 – there were 4,655 transplants, an increase of 10 per cent on the year before.","NHS is trying to increase the number of organ donors due to a shortage .

"Hillary Clinton may be the presumptive Democratic frontrunner in the 2016 presidential race, but she is by no means the party's 'inevitable' nominee, a likely challenger said Thursday. 'Maybe that's the way it is today,' former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley acknowledged on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' program. 'Most years there is the inevitable frontrunner. And that inevitable frontrunner is inevitable right up until he or she is no longer inevitable,' he added. NOT 'INEVITABLE'? Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley threw cold water on the idea that his party will give Hillary Clinton a neasy route to a presidential nomination . BLOODBATH: Clinton faced bruising questions on Tuesday at the United Nations from a crush of reorters fixated on 'email-gate' The timing of O'Malley's jab is notable. Clinton is  embroiled in controversy about her use of a private email account for her entire four years as secretary of state, and her Tuesday press conference did little to quell the furor. But O'Malley seemed to dismiss the growing scandal. Even if the federal government had an iron-clad retention policy that covered every agency, he said, it's not the sort of thing he wants to campaign on. 'None of that would make a hill of difference,' O'Malley insisted, to Americans struggling to make ends meet in a time of slow economic growth. Clinton's never-ending email story is 'not the issue that's going to restore our economy,' the former governor said. 'People don't care so much about email policies.' Still, he said it was 'important' for the former secretary of state to follow federal laws and regulations. A New York Times report Thursday said that congressional Democrats are still desperate for Mrs. Clinton to run in 2016, saying she is 'simply too big to fail.' While she tops all polls on who Democrats would pick for president, O'Malley countered the notion that the most powerful woman in American politics was a lock for the nomination. And he stressed that if he threw his hat in the ring, he would not be aiming for a consolation prize like the vice presidency or a cabinet post. 'I would be running not only to win but to govern well, to make the case to the people of the country there are better choices we can make together that will make wages go up and to make college more affordable for our kids again,' O'Malley said. 'We don't have any announced candidates yet,' he noted, 'but I've never run a bad race and I've never gone all out when I've gone all in.' TIMING: The 'Morning Joe' appearance on MSNBC came during a week when Clinton's feet are being held to the fire in what's being called 'email-gate' He said he expected a 'robust conversation' among Democrats during the campaign. But O'Malley appeared unwilling to unsheathe the knives just yet, declining to say whether Clinton did anything wrong in her email kerfuffle. He said he will announce his political intentions this spring. Clinton observers expect her to do the same. Last week, when Maryland's long-serving Senator Barbara Mikulski announced she would not seek re-election in 2016, instead of jumping into the battle to replace her, O'Malley begged off. Still, he has a long way to go – on the calendar and in polls. An NBC survey this week showed Clinton with 86 percent support, versus just 11 percent for O'Malley. 'Am I really up to 11 percent?' he asked with a grin.","Martin O'Malley went on MSNBC and said if he runs for president he 'would be running not only to win but to govern well'

"Ian Walters, 51, allegedly killed his wife Tracy by deliberately driving their truck into a tree at 84mph . A violent and controlling church treasurer allegedly murdered his wife by driving their truck into a tree at 84mph just hours after she asked for a divorce because she was unable to cope with his insatiable sexual demands, a court heard yesterday. Tracy Walters died after making a flurry of calls to police about sex-obsessed husband Ian in the days leading up to the M1 crash, including one that morning. Jurors were yesterday played motorway CCTV footage of the moment Walters, 51, a driving examiner, steered the Mitsubishi pick-up truck into trees on an embankment as they returned from a ‘make or break’ holiday. Walters is alleged to have deliberately veered his 4X4 off the M1 motorway as he returned from the trip in the Yorkshire Dales with his horse rider wife Tracy. The court heard how the 51-year-old, who also worked as a driving instructor, was allegedly 'very angry' at the time because his wife had asked for a divorce. The pair, who were married in 2012, were said to have been in a 'troubled' relationship, with Walters allegedly using sex 'as a sort of sedative' against his wife. Jurors were told how he would often turn to violence if his wife was unwilling to satisfy his sexual demands. The court also heard how Mrs Walters had text one of her sons seconds before the crash to say she wanted to report Walters to the police but was too afraid. Opening the trial at Leicester Crown Court today, Charles Miskin QC said Walters had purposely crashed the pick-up truck because he 'wanted to show her who was in charge'. He told the court: 'He didn't cause the crash for any virtuous reason, for example to avoid a person on the road. The prosecution case is that he deliberately caused the crash.' He added: 'He wanted to show her who was in charge, who was in control.' The couple, who met through their jobs when Mrs Walters worked as a driving instructor, were returning to their home in Swindon, Wiltshire, when the fatal crash took place near Markfield, Leicester. The jury was shown CCTV footage of the Mitsubishi L200 moments before it veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. The court heard how the vehicle ploughed through shrubbery before hitting the tree, leaving Mrs Walters with serious injuries. The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard . The 48-year-old was flown to hospital but died two days later despite wearing a seatbelt and the airbags deploying. Mr Miskin said tests revealed the black Mitsubishi was travelling at between 74 and 84mph when it hit the tree. The Mitsubishi, which is not thought to have braked, was even 'airborne' for a time after hitting a concrete structure, the court was told. After the crash, the metalwork of the vehicle had to be 'unpeeled' from around Mrs Walters by emergency crews. She told paramedics ‘I’m dying’ and fell unconscious before she could be airlifted to hospital. She died two days later. Prosecutor Charles Miskin QC told the jury Mrs Walters’ texts and social media messaging gave the ‘inside track’ on how her marriage had gone from ‘troubled to abusive’. Relatives had also seen bruising, while Mrs Walters had texted her sister throughout the holiday describing the couple’s rows. The court heard during their journey home she texted her son from the passenger seat of the L200 truck asking him to arrange for police to be waiting when they reached their home in Swindon. The message stated: ‘I want him (Walters) arrested…but don’t want to wind him up.’ The court heard the vehicle left the southbound carriageway at Ratby, near Leicester, just 12 seconds after Mrs Walters received a reply from her son. It hit a concrete box housing gantry messaging equipment and became airborne, before eventually coming to a rest beside a tree 150ft from where it left the road. Mrs Walters, a keen horse rider, was flown to hospital following the collision in Markfield, Leicester, but died two days later from her injuries . Mr Miskin said Walters’ insatiable sexual appetite was one of the ‘principal issues’ in the breakdown of their 18-month marriage. Mr Walters, a former Parochial Church Council treasurer at Christ Church in Swindon, was also flown to Coventry's University Hospital with serious injuries. Walters suffered multiple fractures and brain injuries and spent three weeks in hospital before he was discharged in mid-April. He was charged with murder two months later. After his arrest, he claimed not to remember what caused the crash and denied having reason to harm his wife. Mr Miskin said the text Mrs Walters sent to her son may have 'acted as the trigger' for Walters's alleged conduct. The message said: 'I need him arrested when I get back, but I am scared because he is so volatile and I don't want to wind him up'. Reading the message to jurors, Mr Miskin said: 'He (the defendant) knew that he was in trouble with her, he knew that he was in trouble with her family, and he knew that he was in trouble with the police. 'He probably felt some degree of humiliation. He wanted to show her who was in charge, who was in control.' In police interviews after his arrest, Walters claimed he could not remember anything about the incident. But he added that he would not have done anything to intentionally hurt either his wife or himself. The court heard both Walters and his wife had been married once before and had grown-up children from their previous relationships. The Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crash . The couple had started dating in 2011, before marrying one year later in Cyprus. But their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards. Facebook messages sent by Mrs Walters during her week away and on the day of the crash were read to the jury by Mr Miskin. He said Mrs Walters - who had written a note saying she was 'scared and very unhappy' - appeared to be unable to cope with her husband's sexual demands. He added: 'It seemed he wanted sex all of the time and she couldn’t cope with his demands. It seems he was using sex with her as a sort of sedative.' The court was also told how Mrs Walters had asked for a divorce on several occasions.. Leicester Crown Court heard the crash took place ten days after Mrs Walters called police to their home when her husband slapped and pushed her for refusing him sex. Police interviewed Walters, but did not arrest him. The couple saw a counsellor the next evening, when Mrs Walters revealed a ‘belt of bruising’ on her back. She told the counsellor Walters became violent to her on their honeymoon. Mr Miskin said the counsellor described Walters as ‘narcissistic’. When officers arrived, Walters denied being violence, only admitting he was 'annoyed' because his wife had refused him sex, the court heard. He was questioned but not arrested. Mr Miskin told jurors that the pair had been away to try and resolve their issues but that the holiday had not gone to plan. The court heard the couple checked out of their holiday cottage in the Yorkshire Dales a day earlier than planned. Walters told the owner they’d had a ‘big bust up’, and that his wife wanted a divorce and had called police. Mrs Walters made an ‘unconnected 999 call’ from their cottage, before Walters allegedly told the owner that he was leaving early. Mr Miskin added: 'He said that Tracy wanted a divorce and had called the police.' After the crash, the metalwork of the vehicle had to be 'unpeeled' from around Mrs Walters by emergency crews, the court was told . ‘Walters was angry, very angry. He knew he was in trouble with her (his wife) and he knew he was in trouble with her family. He also knew he was in trouble with the police. He wanted to show her who was in charge, who was in control.’ He added that Mrs Walters had also made an an application under 'Claire's Law' to discover if her he had a violent past. But there were also 'frequent reconciliations' and the couple had sought marriage counselling. Officers later found a note written to him by Mrs Walters at their home, in which she outlined her unhappiness. The note added: ‘I am not a b**** and it is not two weeks since we had sex.’ Mr Miskin said that Walters ‘risked his own life and limb’ in the crash, and may have intended to kill himself, but must also have foreseen that his wife could suffer ‘really serious injury or death’. If the jury agreed, he said, then Walters was guilty of murder. Walters denies murder. The trial at Leicester Crown Court continues.

"The British baby who was the youngest victim of the Alps plane crash has been pictured for the first time - being cuddled by his mother who also died in the tragedy. Little Julian Pracz-Bandres, who was just seven months old, was flying back from Spain with his mother, Marina Bandres, when the disaster unfolded. A photo released by Ms Bandres's family in Spain today shows the 37-year-old mother smiling with joy as she clutches her young son to her cheek. Blue-eyed Julian, who shows the first signs of hair growing from his head, is wearing a turquoise baby grow in the family picture. Julian and his Spanish-born mother, who is a film editor based in Manchester, had travelled to her family home in northern Spain for her uncle's funeral this weekend. Scroll down for video . Youngest victim: Seven-month-old Julian Pracz-Bandres, pictured with his mother Marina Bandres, died when the Germanwings Airbus A320 crashed in the Alps this week . Julian's mother was a film editor who had lived in Manchester for the last seven years. Her husband, Julian's father, had stayed in England while they made the trip to Spain. He said he was 'devastated' by their deaths . Ms Bandres's father has said she and her son were unable to get a direct flight back to the UK so arranged to fly via Dusseldorf, meaning they boarded the doomed Germanwing Airbus A320 on Tuesday. Julian was one of three British victims among the 150 passengers and crew who died in the disaster in south west France. Julian's father, Ms Bandres's husband Pawel Pracz, had stayed in Manchester while his wife and son flew to Spain for the short trip. Mr Pracz said in a statement yesterday: 'My wife Marina Bandres Lopez-Belio and our son Julian Pracz-Bandres were on-board the plane that crashed in the Alps yesterday. 'We have been living in Manchester for seven years. Marina was an editor and colourist, and we were both working in post-production for film and video. 'Marina was visiting her family in Spain for her uncle's funeral, she bought the tickets at the last moment, and decided to return to Manchester quickly as she wanted to return to her daily routine as soon as possible. 'I'm with my closest family in Manchester, and in close contact with our family in Spain at this very difficult time. We are devastated and would like to request that we be allowed to grieve in peace as a family without intrusion at this difficult time.' Ms Bandres's father, Manuel, said today that he is still waiting for official confirmation that his daughter and grandson had been killed in the crash. Martyn Matthews (pictured with his wide and children) was also killed in the Alps crash. He had been on a business trip to Barcelona and took a connecting flight so he could get home to his family sooner . Paul Bramley, a 28-year-old from Hull who was studying in Switzerland, was also among the 150 people killed . Cesar Ritz Colleges in Lucerne, where Mr Bramley was studying, paid tribute to him on Facebook yesterday . Ms Bandres's father told Spanish newspaper El Pais he was yet to be contacted by the authorities to tell him his loved ones were dead, but said he knew 'for certain' they were on the flight. A neighbour of the couple in Manchester said yesterday: 'Marina loved that little baby. She and Pawel were so lovely and were so in love. It's absolutely devastating. 'They were a beautiful couple and were so happy with their lives. Marina was such a kind person, who always had a smile on her face.' The neighbour said the couple had lived in the flat for around three years, adding: 'I felt sick when I found out she had been involved in that.' Ms Bandres had been living in Manchester for seven years and married her Polish husband at the cathedral in her home town of Jaca, northern Spain, two years ago. She and her husband graduated in 2009 from a diploma course in TV and film production at Manchester's Futureworks School of Media. They were both on the crew of an acclaimed short film called Sophie's Fortune which premiered in Manchester last December. The other two British victims of the crash have been named as Wolverhampton businessman and father-of-two Martyn Matthews, 50, and Paul Bramley, a 28-year-old student from Hull who was studying in Switzerland. Mr Matthews, was a manager for German electronics firm HUF UK in Tipton, West Midlands. He had been to a one-day conference in Barcelona. He leaves a wife Sharon, 48, and two children, Jade, 20, and Nathan, 23. A rescue worker as the crash scene. 150 passengers and crew lost their lives in the crash on Tuesday . In a statement, the family said: 'We are devastated at the news of this tragic incident and request that we are allowed to deal with this terrible news without intrusion at this difficult time.' It emerged yesterday that Mr Matthews was flying back from a business trip and took an indirect flight so he could return to his family as quickly as possible . A spokesman for his company, HUP Group, said yesterday: 'There were no direct flights to Birmingham from Barcelona, so the company booked him on the Germanwings flight to Dusseldorf. 'From there he was going to fly to Birmingham. He should have been him with his family on Tuesday night. He was keen to get back to his family, so it was not a long trip, just a standard business trip.' The spokesman added: 'We all feel utterly devastated by what has happened. Everyone in the company is shocked and saddened.' Student Mr Bramley was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with his Estonian girlfriend Anneli Tiirik. The 28-year-old had just finished his first year at the college and had taken a few days holiday with friends in Barcelona before flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family. His mother Carol said: 'Paul was a kind, caring and loving son. He was the best son, he was my world.' His father, Philip, who lives in Hull, said they are both deeply shocked and will miss him. Among the dead were 16 German schoolchildren who had been on an exchange trip to Spain . Birgit Black, Dean at Cesar Ritz Colleges in Lucerne, where Mr Bramley was studying, said: 'Paul was a very well know and well liked student on campus. 'He had a lively, friendly and engaged character and was always supportive of fellow students and colleagues. He will be missed.' Flight 4U 9525 was flying from Barcelona in Spain to Dusseldorf in Germany on Tuesday morning when it crashed near the town of Barcelonnette in the French Alps. It emerged today that the plane's co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane after locking the captain out of the cockpit. French prosecutor Brice Robin said the co-pilot - named as 28-year-old German Andreas Lubitz - used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually and deliberately. Mr Robin said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700km per hour. 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'.

"An Illinois man claims that a hot sauce he sampled while on vacation last year which caused him to fall to the ground in a seizure may have saved his life. Randy Schmitz, 30, of Orland Park, Illinois, was sampling the Flashbang hot sauce at Pepper Palace in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, when started having convulsions. When he was given medical treatment, an MRI scan of his brain showed a cancerous tumor in its early stages. Randy Schmitz, 30, was sampling a hot sauce made of scorpion and habanero peppers at the Pepper Palace in Myrtle Beach when he had a seizure . During a post-seizure brain scan, doctors noticed a cancerous brain tumor in its early stages. Schmitz flew home early from his vacation and had the tumor removed two days later . 'If I didn't try that, I think something eventually would have triggered the seizure and I would've found out, but that cancer tumor would've grown in my head,' Schmitz told the Chicago Tribune. Flashbang hot sauce contains Carolina reaper, scorpion and habanero peppers. Customers have to sign a waiver before tasting it. After the seizure, the special education job coach flew home early from his family vacation and underwent brain surgery two days later. Doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital removed a two-and-a-half-inch by one-and-a-half-inch malignant tumor from Schmitz's frontal lobe. After Schmitz had the tumor removed, he was treated with radiation, and he has home more month of chemotherapy treatment . Jeffrey Raizer, medical director of neuro-oncology at Northwestern Medical Hospital, said that though it can't be proven that the hot sauce triggered the seizure, the tasting conditions, including dehydration and stress, match those known to lead to seizures. 'If you have a lot of hot sauce and you're sweating a lot, people can have dehydration and it can cause seizures,' Raizer told the Tribune. 'If you eat a habanero pepper, it's a big jolt to your system.' Raizer added that the seizure allowed Schmitz to be treated with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy before the tumor got worse. He has completed his radiation treatments and has one more month of chemotherapy treatment. He got married two weeks after his diagnosis. Schmitz was so grateful that the tumor was spotted that he wrote a letter to Pepper Palace saying, 'Your Flashbang Pepper Sauce SAVED MY LIFE!!!' Schmitz was diagnosed with the brain tumor just weeks before he was set to get married to his wife. Despite his surgery and treatments, he and his wife still walked down the aisle on time . Schmitz was so grateful that he wrote Pepper Palace in January to thank the company for its involvement in his seizure. 'Your Flashbang Pepper Sauce SAVED MY LIFE!!!!' he wrote in an email to the company. Pepper Palace posted his email on their website, along with the response: 'Way to go, Randy, you are truly a Wall of Flame survivor!' Schmitz was sent a box of hot sauce, T-shirts, golf balls and other souvenirs from the store. He admits, however, he's still 'a little bit nervous' to open the bottle of Flashbang.","Randy Schmitz, 30, was sampling the Flashbang hot sauce at the Pepper Palace in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina when he had a seizure .

"The U.S. government on Thursday asked an appeals court to lift a temporary hold on President Barack Obama's executive action to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, arguing it can't wait for the judge who blocked the action to make a ruling on a similar request. Justice Department attorneys filed an emergency motion with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, to lift a preliminary injunction issued last month by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas. The injunction had been issued on the request of a coalition of 26 states that filed a lawsuit to overturn Obama's immigration plan. OFF TO COURT: President Barack Obama has responded to a Texas judge's injunction halting his immigration executive actions by demanding an appeals court overrule him . HERE COMES THE JUDGE: Federal jurist Andrew Hanen called the Obama administration on the carpet and put the brakes on the president's immigration plan . The states, led by Texas, argue that Obama's action was unconstitutional and would force them to invest more in law enforcement, health care and education. DECISION TIME: Federal Judge Priscilla Owen will likely make the call on whether to overturn Hanen, her former law school classmate . The injunction was intended to stall Obama's actions – which would spare from deportation as many as 5 million people who are in the U.S. illegally – while the lawsuit progresses through the courts. Many Republicans in Congress and states led by Republicans oppose the action, saying Obama overstepped his authority as president. Obama said he had to act because Congress has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The Justice Department had asked Hanen to lift the injunction while the case was appealed to the 5th Circuit. But Hanen put that request on hold pending a hearing on March 19 to review allegations the government misled him about the implementation of part of the immigration plan. In their 21-page motion, Justice Department attorneys called the injunction 'unprecedented and wrong' and argued lifting it was crucial as the order 'irreparably interferes with (the Homeland Security Department's) ability to protect the Homeland and secure our borders.' Justice Department attorneys said that if the injunction is not lifted, it should at least apply either only to Texas or to the 26 states that sued. 'President Obama's unconstitutional use of executive power to accomplish what he couldn't do in Congress sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the fabric of our Republic,' Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement responding to the Justice Department's emergency motion. 'The state of Texas and a bipartisan coalition of 25 other states will continue to oppose the President's unilateral and lawless actions,' Paxton added. A coalition of 14 states, including California and Iowa, and the District of Columbia filed a motion on Thursday with the 5th Circuit in support of lifting the injunction. They argued the immigration actions will benefit states through increased tax revenues and improved public safety. But Texas has on its side a longer list: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Legal experts say the 5th Circuit is known to be fairly conservative, and is likely to deny the Justice Department's request. Ultimately, it could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. PLAINTIFF: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is spearheading the lawsuit along with 25 other governors . ANGER: Conservatives have bristled at the idea of the White House tossing border security overboard in favor of letting 5 million or more illegal immigrants stay . At next week's hearing, Hanen was set to have Justice Department attorneys explain why the federal government granted three-year deportation reprieves as well as work permits to 100,000 individuals before Hanen's Feb. 16 injunction. Attorneys had previously said federal officials wouldn't accept such requests until Feb. 18. The Justice Department has said the reprieves and work permits were granted under the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, which was not halted by Hanen's injunction. DACA protects young immigrants from deportation if they were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. In a separate court document filed with Hanen's court on Thursday, the Justice Department said the acknowledgement that some individuals were granted reprieves under 2012 DACA guidelines does 'not bear on the resolution' of the pending request before the judge to lift the injunction. Hanen's injunction put on the hold an expansion of DACA as well as a program that would extend deportation protections to parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years.","26 states sued in federal court and won a temporary injunction preventing the White House from mainstreaming more than 5 million illegal immigrants .
Judge Andrew Hanen put on the brakes, saying the policy could cause harms that it would be impossible to undo .
Now the Obama administration is going over Hanen's head to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, demanding it overturn Hanen .
Obama wants to give Social Security numbers, green cards and work permits to some who are in the country illegally, and guarantee them they won't be deported for at least two years ."
"Estranged real-estate heir Robert Durst was arrested in New Orleans after new evidence emerged about his alleged murder of a friend who may have known about the suspicious disappearance of his wife. He was taken into custody at 4.30pm Saturday night at the JW Marriot on a probable cause warrant for the 2000 Beverly Hills murder of his friend Susan Berman, FBI Los Angeles spokesman Laura Eimiller told Daily Mail Online. Durst has long been suspected of killing Ms Berman, and the arrest follows new evidence seen in the HBO documentary miniseries The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, which examines the case. His estranged younger brother Douglas, who heads his family's multi-billion dollar real estate company, said that his family was 'relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst.' Scroll down for video . Robert Durst, (pictured) 71, was arrested in New Orleans Saturday night with an out-of-state warrant from Los Angeles County . Durst was questioned in 2000 after the death of his longtime friend and elderly neighbor Susan Berman, (right) who was going to speak to police about the disappearance of Kathleen McCormack (left, with Durst) His estranged younger brother Douglas, who heads his family's multi-billion dollar real estate company, said that his family was 'relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst.' 'We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done,' he said. Ms Emiller said that Mr Durst was arrested after discussions between the FBI and LAPD planning his apprehension had been going on for the last couple of days. 'As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death,' The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement. The millionaire had been living at the hotel and was recognized by agents in the lobby during his arrest on Saturday. Some suspect that Ms Berman played a role in the disappearance of Dursts's wife Kathleen . Durst's lawyer Chip Lewis said that his client would not fight extradition to California. 'He's maintained his innocence for years,' Mr Lewis said. 'Nothing has changed.' 'It's all about Hollywood now,' he said, adding that the arrest was probably orchestrated by the entertainment industry. The HBO show has stirred up interested in the case again after uncovering new information about Ms Berman's death. The woman's stepson Sareb Kaufman gave filmmakers a letter from Durst to his stepmother a year before she died from a gunshot wound to the back of the head. It has similar handwriting  as one sent to police alerting them of her murder right before Christmas. It also featured the same spelling mistake, writing Beverly Hills as 'Beverley Hills'. Authorities in Los Angeles, who have long thought Durst sent the murder letter, have reopened the investigation into Ms Berman's murder after receiving Kaufman's message. The killing took place right before she was scheduled to be questioned about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife Kathleen McCormack in New York. Mr Lewis said he had 'no doubt we will present a most compelling defense' in the case against his client. He said new evidence touted by HBO producers was something he had already been acquainted with. Berman, whose father was a mafia boss, was seen as acting as Durst's unofficial spokesman after his wife's disappearance, in which the heir was suspected by many of foul play. Some have also thought that Ms Berman helped Durst bury Ms McCormack in New Jersey, Rolling Stone reported. Ms Berman, whose father was a mafia boss, was friends with Durst and acted as his unofficial spokesman following the disappearance of his wife . Durst divorced Kathleen McCormack (left) in 1990, angering her family by not telling them. He remarried to Debrah Lee Charatan (right during his 2003 trial) in December 2000, shortly before Susan Berman was killed . Durst admitted to forcing his wife to have an abortion in 1976 and physically abusing her during their troubled marriage . Durst was not picked to manage the empire his father created, and instead control of the business was given to his younger brother Douglas . Last month Durst, who has spoken openly to the HBO series, said that he was 'complicit in Kathie's not being here' but had nothing to do with her disappearance. He also admitted to forcing her to have an abortion in 1976 and having a physical altercation with her the night she disappeared. Durst has admitted killing another man less than a year after the death of Ms Berman. The millionaire was tried for the grisly 2001 murder of his neighbor Morris Black in Texas. He was found not guilty in 2003 after claiming the killing was in self-defense, but he admitted to dismembering the body, putting it in bags and dumping it in Galveston Bay. Durst had moved to Texas and was pretending to be a mute woman named Dorothy Ciner at the time of the killing. The suspected early 2000s murders followed Durst's estrangement from his family, which are heirs to the real estate fortune amassed by his father New York developer Seymour Durst. Robert did not take up tee reigns of his father's empire, which were instead given to his younger brother Douglas following Seymour's death in 1995. Durst was found not guilty in the 2000 killing of Morris Black in Galveston, Texas, but he admitted to dismembering the body . Durst was arrested in Pennsylvania (right) for trying to steal a chicken sandwich while jumping bail before his trial for the murder of Morris Black (left) The suspected murderer was living next to Morris Black and pretending to be a mute woman when he shot and dismembered him in 2001 . Durst (pictured) said that he shot Black with a handgun (pictured) in self-defense during the 2001 altercation, and was found not guilty of murder . The estranged Durst later regained $65 million in a court settlement with his family. Beyond the HBO documentary, his life is the inspiration for the movie All Good Things, which was also directed by The Jinx's filmmaker Andrew Jarecki. The director he was intrigued after 'seeing someone who is born to such privilege and years later is living in a $300-a-month rooming house in Galveston, Texas, disguised as a mute woman'. His bizarre cases have captivated audiences with Durst's eccentricities, which have included dressing up in fake mustaches while a fugitive. He was rearrested for the Black trial after he shaved all the hair and eyebrows, skipped town on $300,000 bail and was arrested in Pennsylvania for trying to steal a chicken sandwich despite the fact that he was carrying thousands of dollars. He served about three years in prison for his bail offense. He was fined $500 last year after peeing on a candy rack at a Houston CVS pharmacy in July, according to KHOU. Durst has remarried to Debrah Lee Charatan, who is seen on the HBO show, on December 11, 2000, shortly before Ms Berman died. He divorced Ms McCormack in 1990, angering her family by not reaching out to them. She was declared legally dead in 2001. His net worth was estimated to be just under $100million earlier this year, according to The Squander. Forbes estimates that the Durst family has $4.4billion. The JW Marriott in New Orleans would not comment on the arrest.

"Scientists using . the Hubble Space Telescope have confirmed that the . Jupiter-orbiting moon Ganymede has an ocean beneath its icy . surface, raising the prospects for life, Nasa has revealed. The finding resolves a mystery about the largest moon in the . solar system after NASA's now-defunct Galileo spacecraft . provided hints that Ganymede has a subsurface ocean during . exploration of Jupiter and its moons from 1995 to 2003. Scientists told reporters on a conference call that it took . some detective work to confirm the discovery. In this artist’s concept, the moon Ganymede orbits the giant planet Jupiter. A saline ocean under the moon’s icy crust best explains shifting in the auroral belts measured by Hubble. Scientists first suspected an ocean in Ganymede in the 1970s, based on models of the large moon. NASA's Galileo mission measured Ganymede's magnetic field in 2002, providing the first evidence supporting those suspicions. The Galileo spacecraft took brief 'snapshot' measurements of the magnetic field in 20-minute intervals, but its observations were too brief to distinctly catch the cyclical rocking of the ocean's secondary magnetic field. Like Earth, Ganymede has a liquid iron core that generates a . magnetic field, though Ganymede's field is embedded within . Jupiter's magnetic field. That sets up an interesting dynamic . with telltale visuals - twin bands of glowing aurora around . Ganymede's northern and southern polar regions. As Jupiter rotates, its magnetic field shifts, causing . Ganymede's aurora to rock. Scientists measured the motion and . found it fell short. Using computer models, they realized that a . salty, electrically conductive ocean beneath the moon's surface . was counteracting Jupiter's magnetic pull. 'Jupiter is like a lighthouse whose magnetic field changes . with the rotation of the lighthouse. It influences the aurora,' said geophysicist Joachim Saur, with the University of Cologne . in Germany. 'With the ocean, the rocking is significantly . reduced.' Scientists ran more than 100 computer models to see if . anything else could be having an impact on Ganymede's aurora. They also repeated the seven-hour, ultraviolet Hubble . observations and analyzed data for both belts of aurora. 'This gives us confidence in the measurement,' Saur said. NASA Associate Administrator Jim Green called the finding . 'an astounding demonstration.' 'They developed new approach to look inside a planetary body . with a telescope,' Green said. Ganymede joins a growing list of moons in the outer solar . system with subsurface water. On Wednesday, scientists reported . that Saturn's moon Enceladus has hot springs beneath its icy . crust. Other water-rich worlds include Jupiter moons Europa and . Callisto. NASA Hubble Space Telescope images of Ganymede's auroral belts (colored blue in this illustration) are overlaid on a Galileo orbiter image of the moon. The amount of rocking of the moon's magnetic field suggests that the moon has a subsurface saltwater ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 60 miles (100 km) thick, 10 . times deeper than Earth's oceans, and is buried under a 95-mile . (150-km) crust of mostly ice. 'It is one step further toward finding that habitable, . water-rich environment in our solar system,' said astronomer . Heidi Hammel with the Washington-based Association of . Universities for Research in Astronomy.","Finding resolves a mystery about the largest moon in the solar system .

"He admits it is ‘the biggest gamble of his life’ and is terrified that his latest television venture will be a flop. And it would seem comedian James Corden, who makes his debut this month as anchor of The Late, Late Show – one of America’s top talk shows – may be right to be concerned, according to some members of the test audience at a rehearsal last week. Corden and his new employers, CBS, could be worried that American audiences won’t get his British brand of humour and they want to ensure he is word perfect for his first live show on March 23, when Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks will be a guest. Response: James Corden is to make his debut as anchor of The Late, Late Show later this month - but CBS bosses could be worried about how he will be received, so a  rehearsal was held this week . A source on the programme revealed they needed to ‘iron out the glitches and find out what works’, adding: ‘The US audience is totally different to anything James has experienced before. It’s been a real rollercoaster of highs and lows.’ The Mail on Sunday gained exclusive access to Corden’s rehearsal last week, and while some of the 200 invited audience – many of them professional actors paid to ‘fill’ seats – seemed charmed by his laid-back delivery, most complained that they were ‘baffled’ by his sense of humour and found his estuary accent difficult to understand. Though he told interviewers last week that he intends to ‘shake up’ late-night TV in the US, the new show is surprisingly formulaic. Corden, 36, sits behind a desk topped with an old-fashioned rotary phone, while guests sit on a blue sofa in front of a fake backdrop of Los Angeles. There is a small bar set up in the corner of the studio, staffed by barman Ian, and a house band led by wild-haired musician Reggie Watts. The comic opened the ‘show’ with a monologue of jokes, including one about last week’s scandal over US Secret Service members who crashed into a White House barrier after a drunken party. ‘They’ve got a new motto – to protect and serve me another,’ he told his audience. Guest Susan Wittan, from Rockville, Maryland, who attended Thursday’s rehearsal said: ‘I’d never heard of James Corden until today. 'He seems to be a very friendly, nice guy but I didn’t get some of his jokes and I found him a bit hard to understand at times. He speaks quite quickly and used British words like mate. ‘I enjoyed some of the humour but I’m not sure how well he will go down in America.’ Revolutionary: Despite Corden - seen here interviewing Whitney Cummings, of sitcom 2 Broke Girls, and Eric Christian Olsen, from crime show NCIS: Los Angeles - promising the shake up the tried-and-tested format, some audience members complained there was little to differentiate it from other talk shows . Another woman, Christine, who revealed she was being paid as a ‘seat filler’ said: ‘I don’t think enough people know who he is. I didn’t enjoy the show much. It was boring.’ The dress rehearsal came amid increasing concerns that Corden, who has lost 6st in the run-up to the show’s launch, has been under tremendous stress, doubtless mindful that many other Britons, such as Ant and Dec, and Russell Brand, tried and failed to crack the American audience. While friends and family insist his new, slimline image is the result of a conscious effort to look svelte for his big launch, others close to the show say his fear of failure is the real reason that he has lost so much weight. Risk: Corden has moved his family - wife Julia Carey, son Max, three, and four-month-old daughter Carey - to LA, but admits taking the role is the biggest gamble of his life so far . In recent weeks he has displayed obvious signs of anxiety. ‘There have been a few heated moments,’ the source said. ‘There have been a few raised voices. But that can be normal for any new show. ‘You can’t blame him for being stressed and nervous. His entire professional future is on the line.’ Corden, who relocated to LA at Christmas with wife Julia and their children Max, three, and 14-week-old Carey, is on a reported £1.5 million-a-year deal. He admits CBS has taken ‘a huge gamble’ bringing him to the United States, saying: ‘I don’t know if I’m making a huge mistake. But I’d rather regret doing something than not doing something. ‘It’s madness really. When I got the job I’d never even been on an American talk show.’ Before Thursday night’s rehearsal began Corden, clearly on edge, spoke to the audience. He told them: ‘This is a dream come true for me. If you’d told the 12-year-old me that I would be doing this I would never have believed it.’ He also spoke about his children, saying: ‘When you have one kid it’s like having a pet. When you have two it’s like getting the whole zoo.’ But he appeared distracted at times, with one onlooker commenting: ‘He seemed like he had a lot on his mind. There were times during the moments by himself when he looked stressed and worried.’ He interviewed comedian Whitney Cummings, of sitcom 2 Broke Girls, and actor Eric Christian Olsen, from crime show NCIS: Los Angeles. Both are CBS shows. When Cummings joked about Britain being ‘a nation of alcoholics’ Corden replied: ‘I would refute that although I am aware that I’m the only late-night host with a bar in his studio.’ Family man: Corden told the audience about his newly expanded brood, saying: ‘When you have one kid it’s like having a pet. When you have two it’s like getting the whole zoo.’ Unknown?: Some said they thought Corden was not well-known enough to do well as a talk show host in the States - but CBS have been doing a lot of promotion to spread his name around, like this billboard stunt . Afterwards one British audience member said: ‘The show was pretty predictable. The main difference between this one and the other American late-night shows is that the guests walked out and sat on the sofa together. It’s more like Graham Norton’s show in format. ‘There were skits and jokes and a house band. He made the effort to engage the audience and invited everyone up on to the stage at the end to dance. 'But there’s nothing revolutionary about it. He’s likeable but won’t win any originality awards. He was trying very hard, though. The tone of the show is sweet.’ Amelia Darwin, who also watched the show, added: ‘James Corden worked really hard and is a likeable man. But I’m not sure he’s got what it takes to be a huge success here. The show is too similar to everything else out there. 'I wish him well but I won’t be tuning in.’ Nick Bernstein, CBS Vice President, Late Night, West Coast said: 'The studio audience reception to the practice shows has been terrific. 80% of the audience has re-booked for a future taping. A late night host with an accent is hardly a foreign concept to CBS. We find James British accent quite charming.'","Corden due to make his debut as anchor of The Late, Late Show this month .

"Within a week they will be bitter enemies again. But David Cameron tried to bring some cheer to final Coalition Cabinet meeting today by giving all of his ministers a free bottle of beer. The unique brew called 'Co-ale-ition' combines oak flavours to represent the Conservative party and 'zesty lemons' in tribute to the Lib Dems. Nick Clegg provided crisps form Yorkshire. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles tweeted this picture from inside Downing Street of the gift from the Prime Minister for the final Cabinet meeting of the coalition . The bizarre gift greeted the 33 ministers who attend Cabinet each week, along with numerous aides, advisers, officials and spin doctors. The Co-ale-ition beer was produced by Wychwood Brewery, based in Mr Cameron's Witney constituency. The gift was made the morning after the night before, as the Tories nurse the political hangover of Mr Cameron's surprise announcement that he would not seek a third term in Number 10. Senior ministers including Defence Secretary Michael Fallon hit the airwaves this morning to defend the decision as 'sensible' before arriving in Downing Street for the Cabinet meeting. Home Secretary Theresa May was named by David Cameron as a possible successor. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who has also been tipped as a leadership challenger, left Number 10 with his bottle of beer . Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, Environment Secretary Liz Truss and Tory party chairman Grant Shapps arriving in Downing Street . Lib Dems lined up outside Number 10 for the final time before the election. Pictured are David Laws, Danny Alexander, Jo Swinson, Nick Clegg, Ed Davey, Don Foster, Alistair Carmichael, Stephen Wright and Vince Cable . Sitting around the coffin-shaped Cabinet table were some of those Mr Cameron endorsed as possible successors, and several who also covet the top job. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Cameron said: 'There definitely comes a time where a fresh pair of eyes and fresh leadership would be good, and the Conservative Party has got some great people coming up: the Theresa Mays, and the George Osbornes, and the Boris Johnsons.' Mrs May was seen arriving in Downing Street this morning. But also in attendance with several Tory ministers who have been tipped as future leaders, including Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid and Environment Secretary Liz Truss. Nick Clegg gave each member of the Cabinet a pot of crisps from his constituency . Wychwood Brewery of Witney created a special Co-ale-ition Beer, bearing a label showing Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg waving in front of the famous Number 10 door above the slogan 'Indispensable political ale'. Wychwood's Chris Keating said: 'We're delighted the Prime Minister has chosen to support a local business from his constituency to reflect on the last five years and commemorate the occasion with a specially crafted beer for his colleagues.' Mr Clegg gave his colleagues a tub of Henderson's Spicy Yorkshire Sauce crisps, branded Coalition Crunch for the occasion. Mr Clegg said: 'I'm tremendously proud to represent a city that has given the world so many fantastic things over the years. Henderson's Relish is just one of the world famous products to have come out of Sheffield. 'At the end of the five years of this Coalition Government, I could not think of any better gift to give my fellow Cabinet members than a tub of the Spicy Yorkshire Sauce flavoured snacks made by Yorkshire Crisps. 'The Coalition Government has cut taxes for 200,000 people in Sheffield; put £62 million into our schools to help the most disadvantaged children and found £1.2 billion to bring every road in the city up to standard. 'I hope that this gift from the city is a nice reminder of what this Coalition Government has delivered for the North generally and Sheffield specifically.'","Prime Minister leaves gift on Cabinet table for all 33 senior ministers .

"A 41-year-old mother of three accused of killing her husband  has had her murder retrial delayed because she has gotten pregnant through IVF. Julie Harper was acquitted on October 2nd of  gunning down her spouse of 11 years, Jason Harper, 39, in the couple's home in Carlsbad, California, in August 2012 as their three children watched cartoons upstairs. A judge declared a mistrial after the jury came back deadlocked, but had leaned towards a lesser charge of second degree murder. Her new trial was set for April 15, but her due date is May 12 and, because doctors believe it is high risk pregnancy, they urged a judge on Monday to delay it. Scroll down for video . Pushed back: Julie Harper was acquitted on October 2nd of murdering her husband of 11 years, Jason Harper, 39, in 2012. Her retrial has been delayed because she is expecting a baby . Vista Superior Court Judge Blaine K. Bowman agreed to push it back to September 8, starting with jury selection. However, according to the San Diego Reader, prosecutors are suspicious that it was an IVF pregnancy, claiming that a 'neighbor witness' saw 'a man in his underwear staying in the master bedroom' around six months ago. They said: 'Once again, Defendant is engaging in a disturbing manipulation of our criminal justice system.' Prosecutor Keith Watanabe told the court that Harper has a new 'lover and fiance', who she described as the 'love of her life' in a letter written 17 days after her husband was shot. They have asked the judge to question this man. A week before the killing, the jury in the initial trial heard Mrs Harper filed for divorce and allegedly forged her husband's signature so she could withdraw $20,000 from two bank accounts and their daughter's college fund. Allegations: A judge declared a mistrial after the jury came back deadlocked, but they had leaned towards a lesser charge of second degree murder. During that case the defense contested Harper (left) was abused by her teacher husband of ten years (right) During her first trial, Harper testified that she was afraid of her husband and that he repeatedly 'raped' her. She portrayed herself as a victim of domestic and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, and insisted that she fired the fatal shot in self-defense. But  Watanabe challenged Harper's claims, saying that she had prepared for the final showdown with her husband by packing a ‘getaway bag’ and putting inside passports for herself and her children . They have aso alleged that 52 prescription bottles were located in the same room where the deceased husband was found, and those medications included Oxycontin, Oxydocone, Hydrocodone, Valium, and Morphine. At the new trial, if Harper is convicted of second-degree murder, she could face between 40 years and life in prison.

"Private schools have long awarded places to foreign pupils to bring in extra income. Now it seems the same is happening in state education. Around 1,000 youngsters from China and Russia are paying up to £15,000 a year to attend a handful of England's best state sixth-form colleges, it was claimed yesterday. Dozens more such colleges are understood to be considering recruiting from abroad in the future. While charging pupils to attend state schools is against the Department for Education's admissions code, different rules are thought to apply to standalone state-funded sixth-forms. Around 1,000 youngsters from China and Russia are paying up to £15,000 a year to attend a handful of England's best state sixth-form colleges . Some college heads say that without the extra income they would have to reduce teacher numbers because of a nationwide schools funding crisis. But there are concerns that the practice will leave fewer places available for local pupils. Alan Smithers, professor of education at Buckingham University, said: 'Some state schools are now behaving like businesses and taking advantage of the voracious ambitions of Chinese and other overseas students. 'The downside is that British students may be squeezed out of places that would be valuable to them. 'Chinese pupils are remarkably successful. Whether it's because they are driven on by tiger mothers or a fear of job insecurity ... they have the ambition and work ethic to get excellent exam results and enter our top universities.' Head teachers say that without the extra income they would have to reduce teacher numbers and cut art, music and sports classes. James Kewin, deputy chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, which represents nearly 100 sixth form colleges in England, said foreign pupils produced much-needed money. Richard Huish College (pictured) in Taunton, Somerset, which was recently rated 'outstanding' in an Ofsted inspection, has about 60 overseas pupils in the sixth form, most from mainland China . He told the Sunday Times: 'In terms of the income it is phenomenal and a lot of schools that have been hit by public sector cuts are seduced by that.' Richard Huish College in Taunton, Somerset, which was recently rated 'outstanding' in an Ofsted inspection, told the newspaper it has about 60 overseas pupils in the sixth form, most from mainland China. The college is understood to be building a new boarding house to allow the number to increase to 120. Principal John Abbott, said the school received £4,560 a year for a British pupil from state funding but charged £12,000 for overseas pupils, a sum that will rise to £15,000 next year. He said: 'They provide wonderful additional financial income. We have not been immune to the public sector cuts. Their academic results are fantastic too, especially in maths, science and economics — better than those of the British students.' Peter Symonds Sixth Form College in Winchester, Hampshire, which sends a large number of pupils to Oxford, is reportedly considering enrolling overseas pupils from 2017. It is understood families of foreign pupils would be charged about £15,000 a year. The college said: 'Like other schools we are cash-strapped and charging for overseas students would help a lot.' Figures published last year showed 24,391 non-British pupils whose parents lived overseas were enrolled in the 1,257 schools that were members of the Independent Schools Council. Of those, 19 per cent were from Hong Kong and 18 per cent were from mainland China. The Department for Education said that some colleges, depending on their status, were allowed to admit and charge overseas students. In February, David Cameron admitted that state school spending per pupil would fall in real terms under a future Conservative government. Mr Cameron said that while the overall amount spent on schools would rise, spending per pupil would not increase in line with inflation. Campaigners say the money schools receive has not kept pace with inflation over the past five years and many areas of England receive inadequate levels of funding due to an outdated formula of allocations. According to ASCL, over the next 18 months their budgets will be stretched further by a rise in costs of about 4.5 per cent because of increases to pension and national insurance contributions, and pay rises.","Foreign students are paying up to £15,000 to attend best state colleges .

"A 28-year-old man has been sentenced to eight months in jail for using a gun to hold a woman he had met through a dating website hostage for three hours. Drew Francis Thompson, from Canberra, was found guilty by the ACT Supreme Court of aggravated burglary, unlawful confinement, assault, and carrying a firearm for his actions in November 2013, which were described as 'productive of terror'. Mr Thompson met the young woman, then 21, through online dating site eHarmony in March 2013, who broke off the relationship after accusing him of having bad fashion sense, living at home with his parents, and still being a student. Mr Thompson met the young woman, then 21, through online dating site eHarmony in March 2013, who broke off the relationship after accusing him of having bad fashion sense . The 28-year-old attempted to rekindle their relationship, but the woman resisted, and finally relented to meet with him at a shopping centre in Dickson on the grounds that it would be the last time they would see each other. Mr Thompson told the court that he had been humiliated by the young woman's words, and that she told him he was 'boring' and 'too simple to be her partner'. The young woman told the court that she had been 'cruel' to Mr Thompson, and that she had 'yelled at him' and 'humiliated him'. A month after the meeting, Mr Thompson broke into her apartment while the young woman was home, wearing medical gloves and carrying a gun, and hid behind the door of her bedroom while she was in the bathroom. The court reported that when she entered the room, wearing only underpants, Mr Thompson grabbed the woman, put his hand over her mouth and told her not to scream, before forcing her onto her bed with his gun resting on her chest. 'That situation is immediately productive of terror,' said Acting Justice David Robinson during Friday's sentencing, noting that the young woman said she could still smell the glove to this day. After three hours, Mr Thompson left the apartment, and the now 22-year-old went to the police, reporting that she was in fear for her life and believed that he might come back. 'Fear and insecurity have been and still are an everyday part of her life. She has been and is still unable to fully participate in life. Fear and distrust are prominent,' Acting Justice Robinson told the court. Drew Francis Thompson, from Canberra, was found guilty by the ACT Supreme Court of aggravated burglary, unlawful confinement, assault, and carrying a firearm for his actions in November 2013 . 'The contrast to her previous participation in life with its joys is stark.  She is receiving ongoing psychological assistance and is driven by stress, sleeplessness and hyper vigilance.' The judge found that Mr Thompson may have been suffering from a depressive mental condition at the time of the incident, but noted that he expressed little remorse or empathy for the distress that he caused the woman. He said that Mr Thompson appeared to wish to 'impress upon her the gravity of the distress that she had inflicted upon him', and that he took 'the gun to the apartment with the intention of harming' her. '[She] had exhibited a distinct dislike of guns. The use of guns upset her and made her uncomfortable because she connected them with violence. The offender was a gun enthusiast,' Acting Justice Robinson said. The judge said that he believed Mr Thompson showed good prospects for rehabilitation, due to his new girlfriend, his supportive family, and the counselling he was receiving. Mr Thompson, who has already served a month in jail, was sentenced to two years for his crimes, and was to continue serving his sentence until December this year, from which time it will be suspended.","Drew Francis Thompson, from Canberra, was found guilty by the ACT Supreme Court of aggravated burglary and unlawful confinement .

"A Romanian woman has become an internet celebrity after she posted a picture of herself online asking for men to have sex with her so she can get pregnant. Adelina Albu, 25, from Timisoara, in western Romania, is offering €500 (£350) to the right man, who will perform the bedroom necessities and then leave. Although the man will provide the sperm, he will have no parental rights over the child whatsoever. Adelina Albu, 25, from Timisoara, in western Romania has posted a Facebook advert asking for a man to impregnate her . According to The Mirror, Adelina posted the advert on her Facebook page with the words: 'Meeting men is not a problem. Meeting one who wants a baby is.' 'So, rather than wasting my time on a pointless relationship I’m going to pay for it.' Before she agrees to sleep with the potential partner or hand over any money, the man will have to undergo a fertility test and sign an agreement to waive rights as a father. Adelina added: 'Men are so immature all they think about is themselves. 'I am a mature, independent woman and I want a baby - not a man who behaves like one, but a proper one.' Adelina now has more than nine thousand followers on Facebook and even has her own fan page. Her announcement comes just a couple of weeks after a Russian woman advertised for a man to impregnate her online. Elena Komleva, from Cheliabinsk in southern Russia also recently advertised for a man to impregnate her . Elena Komleva, from Cheliabinsk in southern Russia, placed the advert on a social media website - and was soon flooded with offers. The 29-year-old toe-nail painting artist described it as a 'contest' adding that her mother would select the winning candidate. Taking to her Vkontakt page - the equivalent of a Facebook profile - she wrote: 'My mother needs grandchildren to give them all the baby clothes she has been collecting. But nobody wants to marry me yet. 'So, if you are young, strong and healthy drop me a line. 'My mother will be in charge of selecting the candidates and announcing the winner. She knows what I need.' She has already been inundated with offers from men, with many posting replies to her advert.","Adelina Albu, 25, from Timisoara, in western Romania wants a baby .
