"Jonny Evans has grudgingly accepted the six-match ban imposed on him by the FA for spitting at Papiss Cisse. There is no right of appeal for the Manchester United defender and he begins his ban immediately by missing Monday's FA Cup quarter-final with Arsenal. Though he maintains that he did not spit at the Newcastle United striker, the FA found Evans guilty and confirmed in a statement: ‘Mr Evans denied the charge but it was found proven.’ Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates . Evans and Papiss Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Manchester United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA after the ugly incident . Cisse already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing Everton’s Seamus Coleman in December. As a result, the Newcastle striker gets an additional one-match suspension after admitting his guilt, while Evans gets six. The incident, during United’s 1-0 win at St James’ Park on Wednesday, was not seen by referee Anthony Taylor or his assistants, but was caught on TV. A three-man panel of former referees reviewed the footage on Thursday and agreed the players should have been sent off, prompting the FA to bring a charge. An independent regulatory commission heard the charge and decided both players should be banned. Cisse, 29, pleaded guilty and issued an apology for his part in the incident. He is suspended for an extra game as he was banned in December for elbowing Everton’s Seamus Coleman. By contrast, Evans, 27, had denied the charge on Thursday, saying: ‘I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse.’ Cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the FA on Thursday . Tempers threaten to boil over as team-mates from Newcastle and United gather on the pitch . Arsenal (h), Monday (FA Cup quarter-final) Tottenham (h), March 15 (Premier League) Liverpool (a), March 22 (Premier League) Aston Villa (h), April 4 (Premier League) Man City (h) April 12 (Premier League) Chelsea (a) April 18 (Premier League) The FA also looked at an incident where Evans was alleged to have spat in the direction of Emmanuel Riviere during the game but that was dismissed. Evans will potentially miss any FA Cup semi-final should United progress plus their Premier League games against Tottenham, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Manchester City. If United were to lose on Monday, Evans would then miss the trip to Chelsea and would not return until United’s Premier League trip to Everton on April 26. United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA - one less than Newcastle striker Cisse . There is no right of appeal so Evans will not be able to contest the decision by the three-man panel . 1.

(b) the Rules and Regulations of The Association and in particular Rules E3 to 28 below; . (c) the Statutes and Regulations of UEFA; . (d) the Statutes and Regulations of FIFA; . (e) the rules or regulations of an Affiliated Association or Competition; . (f) an order, requirement, direction or instruction of The Association. That would be a blow for United manager Louis van Gaal, who insisted ahead of the Cup clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford that the main priority for United this season must be to qualify for the Champions League. United haven’t won the FA Cup since 2004 and haven’t landed any silverware since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but the Dutchman says the competition must still be treated as a welcome bonus rather than the club’s primary objective. ‘I always want to get the goals we have set. And the goal we have set is the top four,’ said Van Gaal. ‘A title is fantastic. When you win the FA Cup you are not in the Champions League, which is important for the club, but you have won a title. So for the players it is fantastic, for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the Champions League.’ Cisse was banned for an extra game after being sent off for elbowing  Seamus Coleman in December .","Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse involved in spitting row on Wednesday .
Evans denied charge but has been found guilty and hit with six-game ban .

"When a legendary figure like Pat Jennings says none of the other 1,097 matches in his career was comparable with the 1979 FA Cup final between Arsenal and Manchester United, you know it was something special. Forever known as Wembley's 'five-minute final', Arsenal threw away and then regained the trophy in an incredible late sequence that saw them squander a 2-0 lead going into the 86th minute before winning 3-2 in the final moments with a goal that put Alan Sunderland's name in FA Cup folklore. It created a superstar in Arsenal's man-of-the-match Liam Brady and broke the career of Manchester United manager Dave Sexton. Pat Jennings (left) and Pat Rice pose with the FA Cup after the dramatic Wembley final of 1979 . Jennings reacts after conceding a goal as Manchester United fought back to level the scores at 2-2 . But Alan Sunderland scored the winning goal for Arsenal to write his name into cup folklore . Victorious captain Pat Rice was so drained and overcome with emotion as he climbed the famous 39 steps to finally lift the trophy, he delivered an unwitting snub to the famous royal guest of honour. Rice recalls: 'Prince Charles was there to present the trophy. He said, 'Congratulations' as we shook hands but as soon as I saw the cup, I turned around to lift it up to the Arsenal fans. 'I didn't realise he was still waiting to give me my medal. It was only when I turned back, I saw him with it in his hand. It must have looked insulting but it wasn't meant like that. Eager is the polite way of putting it. Just a couple of minutes before I'd been out on the pitch thinking 'f***, we've blown it'.' Sammy McIlroy, who had scored United's dramatic equaliser on a baking hot May afternoon, says the impact of the game has not diminished with time. 'It's 36 years on and people still ask me about it every week,' he adds ruefully. 'They always want to know about that final rather than the one we won against Liverpool two years earlier.' United and Arsenal meet again in the FA Cup on Monday in a quarter-final at Old Trafford but it is impossible that Wayne Rooney and Alexis Sanchez will grip the nation like their predecessors did. 'There has not been a final before or since with the twists and turns of that game,' says Brady, who helped set up the winning goal when Arsenal were on their knees reeling from McIlroy's equaliser. 'I played two short of 1,100 games and I have never known four minutes like that,' adds Jennings, a gentle giant of a goalkeeper who otherwise stayed unflappable in a 23-year career with Watford, Spurs, Arsenal and Northern Ireland. Sammy McIlroy (left) scored United's equaliser against Arsenal in the dramatic 79 cup final . Alexis Sanchez (left) of Arsenal and Wayne Rooney (right) of Manchester United will lock horns on Monday . The 1979 showpiece took place eight days after Margaret Thatcher had been elected Great Britain's first female Prime Minister and given the prestige of the FA Cup final in those days, the two events seemed equally important at the time. A full house of 100,000 and a TV audience of 15 million was guaranteed. United travelled to their team hotel a full three days before the match to fulfil the insatiable demands of the press, photographers and television cameras, with BBC and ITV planning their entire Saturday schedules around the final. Then, as now, Arsenal and United were big clubs in transition. Arsenal had not won a trophy for eight years, while United were rebuilding after the glory days of George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton. They had been relegated to the Second Division five years earlier. Both sets of supporters flocked down Wembley Way convinced good times were about to return for their club. For 85 minutes, the match appeared routine, with Brian Talbot scoring for Arsenal after 12 minutes and Frank Stapleton adding to it with a 43rd-minute header. The only talking point was over who should be credited with the opening goal — Talbot or Sunderland, who appeared to connect at the same time. 'I know it was mine. I've got a picture on my trophy cabinet showing me kicking the ball and Alan kicking my boot,' says Talbot. With Arsenal leading 2-0 going into the final minutes, complacency crept in. 'It was unprofessional but I met eyes with Liam as if to say, 'Yes, we've won it',' says Graham Rix. 'We were coasting, comfortable,' adds Talbot. Even the experienced Jennings says: 'I was imagining myself going up the steps.' Brian Talbot (right) opened the scoring for Arsenal after only 12 minutes in the cup final against United . Gordon McQueen (fifth left) pulled a goal back in the 86th minute to give United hope . Then, with just five minutes left, Arsenal boss Terry Neill decided to send on substitute Steve Walford for David Price as a thank-you for his performances in earlier rounds. It backfired disastrously. Out of nowhere, in the 86th minute, Gordon McQueen drove in a loose ball from a set piece to make it 2-1. Just 106 second later, McIlroy jinked past David O'Leary and Walford before toepoking past an onrushing Jennings to equalise. Pandemonium ensued in the stadium as Arsenal fell apart. 'I knew the cameras were on me so I put on my best acting, trying to look concerned but not terribly worried,' says Neill. 'In reality, my insides were going up and down.' Reflecting now, McIlroy says: 'The Arsenal boys were gone, on their knees. If we'd taken it into extra-time, we would have won. 'I went crazy, I could have run out of Wembley and back in again after that goal. After the game, Bob Bishop [the scout from Northern Ireland who discovered both McIlroy and Best] told me we'd celebrated too long, we should have gone back to the halfway line and concentrated. 'He was probably right but it was not what we wanted to hear after throwing it away.' At 2-2, United were now red-hot favourites but what happened from the restart is part of FA Cup legend. Brady surged into the United half past Mickey Thomas, then past Lou Macari, and slipped a ball to Rix on the left.

Rix, a 21-year-old from a south Yorkshire pit village, delivered a cross that arced away from United goalkeeper Gary Bailey, leaving Sunderland the chance to score from close-range. The picture of the bouffant-haired forward running away in total ecstasy chased by the most-relieved substitute in history, Walford, remains an iconic image. 'When I picked up the ball, I was initially just trying to get the ball away from our goal,' says Brady. 'I went past one challenge, two challenges and I was in the final third and I saw Graham outside me.' Rix takes up the story. 'I didn't know Sunderland was at the far post, my only thought was to take the cross away from the goalkeeper. It was something I'd trained on with [coach] Don Howe all those wet and windy Wednesday nights: keep it out of the keeper's grasp.' Sunderland says: 'I went into auto-pilot and when the ball went it, the pent-up emotion came out.' Just two minutes, 59 seconds had elapsed between the three goals and history had been made. More than 250,000 Arsenal fans greeted the team's heroes in Islington the following day. The Arsenal players collected bonuses nearly three times their £1,000-a-week wages but for some the long-term rewards turned out to be far greater. Brady's performances against Juventus in the following season's European Cup-Winners' Cup persuaded the Italian giants to sign him and he blazed a trail for many other First Division stars like Ray Wilkins and Paul Gascoigne to go to Serie A. For United, being a runner-up was not good enough and Sexton was sacked within two years. 'He was unlucky, if we'd won the final, he would have been given more time,' says Thomas, a comment that will be of interest to Louis van Gaal. More than 250,000 supporters came out to greet Arsenal the day after their FA Cup triumph . Arsenal parade the trophy around Wembley after securing a dramatic victory over United . Arsenal's Class of '79 still meet up for reunions at the Emirates and Rice will be at Old Trafford tomorrow with the club's board of directors. 'I still remember the elation,' says the former Arsenal captain. 'When Sundy scored, I thought, 'Right, we're not going to bloody lose this again'.' If Monday's tie produces just a quarter of the late drama of '79, it will be a thriller.","Pat Jennings feels the 1979 FA Cup final was the best game of his career .

"He is the protege of Total Football mastermind Rinus Michels, but 'Little General' Dick Advocaat has been pitched straight into battle at Sunderland. In nine games there will be little time to roll out the revered brand of football which won fame and acclaim with the Ajax and Holland teams of the 1970s. Instead, the 67-year-old is tasked with saving a failing side from relegation. Then, successful or otherwise, he will be gone. But who is the man who, at 67, is making his Premier League debut as Sunderland’s oldest-ever manager? Dick Advocaat (left) in action during his playing days for Roda against PSV Eindhoven . Advocaat on a cycle ride when assistant coach with Holland in 1987 - seen here with Adri van Tiggelen, Ronald Koeman, Rene van der Gijp and Marco van Basten . Advocaat has held many managerial positions both in his native Holland and abroad - see here at PSV Eindhoven in 1996 . Advocaat is best remembered in Great Britain for his two league titles with Rangers in the late 1990s . Advocaat certainly doesn’t want for experience. This is the 18th job of a 28-year managerial career which has taken in nearly 900 matches and yielded 10 major trophies. He is best known on these shores for three-and-a-half years at Rangers, a stay which produced two SPL titles – including a record 21-point winning margin – two Scottish Cups and a League Cup. Advocaat, though, has since been accused of reckless spending – a claim he defends – and it was at Ibrox that he splashed out a club record £12million for Chelsea striker Tore Andre Flo. That name alone is enough to cause alarm among followers of Sunderland. For they paid Rangers £6.75m for the Norwegian after a relatively successful two years north of the border. VIDEO Sunderland appoint Advocaat as manager . There will be a few familiure faces in the Premier League for Advocaat. He has worked with and against Ronald Koeman in Holland . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is another manager that Advocaat knows well . Former England, Manchester City and Leicester boss Sven Goran Eriksson is someone else that Advovaat knows from his time in the game . Successful, however, is not a word used to reflect on his time at the Stadium of Light and, after four league goals in 29 appearances, he left on a free transfer. That, of course, is not Advocaat’s fault and there will be no scope for new additions during his time on Wearside, should the Flo connection cast doubt over his judgment. Rather, it will be his ability to make a snap judgement on those already in residence which will determine his legacy with the Black Cats. He is certainly well remembered at the likes of PSV and Zenit St Petersburg, where in 2008 his domestic champions beat former club Rangers in the final of the UEFA Cup, a triumph which won him honorary citizenship of the Russian city. Working with Premier League players will not be new to Advocaat as he has come across many in his time in international football - including Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini while he was coach of Belgium between 2009-10 . Former Arsenal star Andrey Arshavin is another player Advocaat has worked with during his time as Russia manager between 2010-12 . Advocaat signed Brazil international Giovane Elber for German side Borussia Monchengladbach in 2005 . During his first spell in Eindhoven in the mid-Nineties he lifted the Dutch Cup and Eredivisie title, working with the likes of Brazilian striker Ronaldo. His second stint in 2012 saw the club finish second in the league and lose in the cup final, but a win ratio of 65 per cent equalled that of his initial tenure and still stands as the best of his career. Were he to win six of nine matches with Sunderland then it would perhaps eclipse everything he has achieved. But there have been rocky times, too. Advocaat has nine games left in the Premier League season and his aim is to ensure Sunderland don't go down . Despite his years of managerial experience, Advocaat has never been in a relegation battle before . He was hounded from his second spell as Holland national-team boss after both the media and supporters were critical of his handling of the team, despite them reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2004. Ten years earlier he took Holland to the last eight of the World Cup but was on the brink of losing his job before the finals in the USA after a fallout with star player Ruud Gullit, who retired from international football in protest. Subsequent posts at South Korea and Russia saw his teams fail to emerge from the group stages of World Cup 2006 and Euro 2012 respectively, while his latest job was an unhappy five-month period in charge of Serbia, where he was sacked in November. Despite his origin as a pupil of Michels, Advocaat has been criticised for playing defensive football with too much emphasis on structure and discipline. However, on the evidence of Sunderland’s shambolic 4-0 defeat to Aston Villa on Saturday, structure and discipline is probably the best place to start.","Dick Advocaat has had 18 managerial jobs over a 28 year career .

'The team is playing well. They're on a great run since Steven's been out the team. 'Unfortunately, and he'll know himself, when you go out the team and they continue on a great run it's hard to get back in.

"The NFL have fined the Atlanta Falcons and stripped them of a draft pick  following the team's use of fake crowd noise at home games. In a statement released on Monday, the league announced that the Falcons have been fined $350,000 (£237,000) and will forfeit their fifth-round selection in the 2016 draft. If the Falcons have multiple picks in that round, the highest selection will be forfeited. Team president Rich McKay has also been suspended from the league's Competition Committee beginning April 1. Atlanta Falcons have been fined £237,000 for their use of fake crowd noise at the Georgia Dome . Owner Arthur Blank acknowledged the team's wrongdoing and described the incident as embarrassing . The NFL noted throughout the 2013 season and into the 2014 season the Falcons violated league rules that state 'at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium.' The league also said Roddy White, the team's former director of event marketing, was directly responsible for the violation and would have been suspended without pay for the first eight weeks of the 2015 regular season had he still been with the club. The Falcons fired him. The league determined that Falcons ownership and senior executives, including McKay, were unaware of the use of an audio file with artificial crowd noise. But as the senior club executive overseeing game operations, McKay bears some responsibility for ensuring that team employees comply with league rules. McKay can petition Commissioner Roger Goodell for reinstatement to the committee no sooner than June 30. The Falcons played fake crowd noise during the 2013 and 2014 seasons . Falcons president Rick McKay has been suspended from his position on NFL Competition Committee . Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in early February that he had seen enough of the NFL's investigation to acknowledge wrongdoing by his club. 'It's not really a fine line,' Blank said.

"Chris Evert has given a vote of confidence to Laura Robson by insisting that the former British No 1 can still make the world’s top 10 when she finally gets back from injury. The American, among the all-time greats of the women’s game, reckons that Robson can make up for lost time despite having been out for 14 months with a wrist injury that required surgery last April. Evert offered her endorsement as current Great British No 1 Heather Watson went out of the Miami Open second round on Saturday, beaten 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 by world No 15 Angelique Kerber after creating enough chances to have won. Heather Watson makes her way off the court after crashing out of the Miami Open to Angelique Kerber . Watson was beaten 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 by world No 15 Kerber at Crandon Park Tennis Centre on Saturday . ‘Yes it has been a very long but Laura is still young so she will be fine,’ said Evert, speaking at the launch of her new Chrissie by Tail clothing line. ‘If she was 27 or 28 there would be a problem but she has got plenty of time on her side,’ said the 18-time Grand Slam winner. ‘I was very impressed with her at Wimbledon in 2013 before the injury. I was thinking top 10 for sure and that can still be attainable. But she has got to get herself really fit for her return to the tour and that is going to be tough for Laura.’ Current British No 1 Watson (left) shakes hands with Kerber at the net after their second round match . Laura Robson has been backed to reach the top 10 upon her return from a 15-month injury lay-off . There are signs that Robson may finally be ready for a return to action in time for May’s French Open in Paris, despite missing out on Miami and taking her name off the entry list for next month’s WTA Tour event in Bogota. When she does come back, however, it is likely to be at a lower-profile event. Meanwhile, her long-time friendly rival Watson resumed at 5-7 down in her rain-delayed contest with Kerber, having missed a set point the previous afternoon before a deluge arrived. The final two sets proved to be as wildly undulating as the first one had been. The 22-year-old from Guernsey, breathing down the neck of her career-high ranking of 38, will know that this was a match she could have won against a player who has been as high as No 5 in the world but has suffered a disappointing year to date. Watson plays a shot at the 2013 US Open - she has been out injured after needing surgery on her wrist . Former US tennis star Chris Evert has backed Robson to return to her best and make it to the top 10 . With a little more composure she would have done, and an indication of how much it hinged on the more vital moments was that she ended up with more points than her more experienced opponent, with 113 to 111. The games often came in blocks as two nervous combatants became confident and then fearful again, depending on the scoreboard. In relatively cool conditions for this event, Watson went 2-0 up in the second, then 3-2 down, before reeling off the next four games. Watson 'will be fine' as she is very young, according to former World No 1 Evert . Kerber, a left-hander who has been to the Wimbledon semi-finals, then surged to 5-1 as Watson was broken immediately in the decider, losing one point through a volleying error of astonishing simplicity. The anxious German looked tired — ‘she’s knackered, Heather’ cried out an English voice — and Watson duly got back on serve to 4-5 before four unforced errors sealed her fate. It could have been a different end to this segment of the season, and once her doubles is over she will be concentrating on the clay courts.","Heather Watson was beaten in the Miami Open second round on Saturday .

"Those who would love to see the lesser spotted Laura Robson back competing on a tennis court are learning that it is a question of hope trumping expectation. Having withdrawn from the qualifying event of this week’s Miami Open, she has now removed herself from the entry list to next month’s WTA Tour event in Bogota, and the new target for her return appears to be the French Open in May. That suggests she is going to be left with at least 16 months of catching up to do when her troublesome wrist is deemed fit for full tournament play again, having not played since the Australian Open in January last year. Former British No 1 Laura Robson protects her wrist while out in London . Nobody is more frustrated about this than Robson herself, now 21 and without a world ranking. She would dearly love to be in Miami now, but instead is back practising over in Bradenton near Tampa at the IMG Academy. Perhaps encouragingly, she posted a picture of herself on Twitter doing a full, tendon-testing handstand. Robson admitted last summer that she has shed tears over this hiatus in her career, which has proved longer than feared since she played her last match in Melbourne before eventually undergoing wrist surgery. Here this week her manager, Max Eisenbud, issued a positive-sounding update while preaching patience: “I’m happy with the way it’s been going and she’s been hitting the ball great in practice,” he said. “ It’s a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week. It’s all about when she is ready to compete. We don’t want to put her in a situation where she can’t play a full tournament.” Among Eisenbud’s other clients include Maria Sharapova, whose intermittent struggles with her shoulder have informed his approach. “I learned a lot from the whole experience with Maria, and that’s why I feel strongly about not rushing it. Laura is still young with a lot of time ahead.” Sharapova seems to have won her battle, but there are other examples of players who show just what a tough road lies ahead for Robson - and that on the assumption that she shows a full-on appetite for hard work that has not always been evident. When she finally decided to go for surgery last April to repair a minor tendon tear she sought the advice of 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro, who has had operations on both wrists. She used the same specialist at the Mayo clinic in Minnesota. Ironically this has turned out to be the Argentine’s own comeback event and on Thursday evening he lost 6-4 7-6 to Vasek Pospisil. The fact that this was just his second tournament in fourteen months after an abortive return in January shows just how infernally complex wrist injuries are for tennis players. He was just delighted to be back on court: “It's not 100% free, but I felt even better than Sydney tournament in January,” he said. “ It's only two months after my second surgery and my left wrist. I feel better week by week, but it's still very early to feel 100%. “Mentally you must be strongest enough to deal with the problem and get up every morning to do your treatments and rehab and stay calm, looking forward for the future. I'm not hurried to be in the top 10 very soon. I want to play tennis. It doesn't matter how long it's take me to be in the top again.” Being absent for a long period of time with any injury brings with it problems in a tennis world that constantly evolves. An example of this is 2010 Wimbledon finalist Vera Zvonareva, who was out for 17 months following the 2012 Olympics due to a shoulder problem that required surgery. Robson has sought the advice of 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro . Del Potro made only his second tournament appearance in 14 months at the Miami Open . Since returning at the start of last year the talented Russian has not got past the third round at any event and her ranking still languishes at 153. She lost another first round here this week. So it could be hard for Robson whenever she returns, although on her side is that she does have bags of natural ability and is a superb ball striker. That much was clear when, enjoying a rare spell free from injury, she became the first British player since Jo Durie to reach the world’s top 30 in the summer of 2013 aged only 19. It might yet make more sense for her to wait until the season begins on more forgiving grass rather than arduous clay to make her return. When she does she will have a new clothes sponsor in Nike after being dropped by adidas, and will be coached by Colombian Mauricio Hadad, a former guide of Heather Watson. The 22 year-old from Guernsey plays world No 15 Angelique Kerber in the second round while Andy Murray will take on America’s Donald Young.","Laura Robson has not played since Australian Open in January 2014 .

"Fans of Chelsea, Blackburn and Wigan may be shocked to learn that unheralded striker Franco di Santo is currently one of the hottest properties in Germany's Bundesliga with Werder Bremen where he has scored 12 goals in his last 18 matches. Even more surprising is the Argentine's views on the respective merits of the two leagues. Contrary to popular belief, the 25-year-old insists players in Germany are made to train harder than their Premier League counterparts and that games are more intense and competitive in the Bundesliga. A few months ago, Di Santo's opinions might have been ridiculed but given the dismal performances of English clubs in Europe this season, it appears he may have a point. Franco di Santo is loving life in the Bundesliga with Werder Bremen after stints with three English clubs . The Argentine striker moved to England with Chelsea but also played for Blackburn and Wigan . Following Chelsea's exit against Paris Saint-Germain, it is unlikely any Premier League will be in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, with Manchester City and Arsenal both losing their first leg matches at home. In contrast, Bayern Munich are safely through to the last eight with Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen having a great chance of joining them from the Bundesliga next week. Their fourth representative Schalke gave Real Madrid an almighty scare at the Bernabeu before going out 5-4 on aggregate. 'When I came to Germany, I thought it would be a little bit less intense than the Premier League,' admitted di Santo, who signed for Bremen on a Bosman free following Wigan's relegation in 2013. 'But when I got here and felt the intensity, it was like “Wow”. Everything is fast just like in England but sometimes I feel there is more pressure here. In the English league, you have time to turn around and go against the defender face-to-face, but here it is always pressure, pressure, pressure. Di Santo says he thought it would be a little bit less intense than the Premier League but he was surprised . Di Santo says that after a career as a young player in the Premier League he finds the Bundesliga as intense . 'The other thing that is different is the kind of training. Here, we train twice-a-day two or three times a week. It was hard for me coming from English football where you sometimes have two days free in a week. 'Here it is impossible to do that. Maybe you have one day off every two weeks. The philosophy is completely different. In England, they think your body needs to rest to be fit for the game, to get it in great condition. Here it is the opposite, you have to train more. 'Sometimes it feels too much but you do feel stronger in key moments because you are training, training. When I was in England I would be a little bit more tired in the last 10 minutes. Here I feel good, so maybe for my body it is better to train!' The reputation of the Premier League has taken a nose-dive recently but Di Santo is not surprised our top clubs aren't able to dominate in the Champions League and suggests there may be a snob value towards the Bundesliga because of the dominance of Bayern Munich. The 6ft 4in centre forward has 12 goals in his last 18 games as Bremen rise up the Bundesliga table . 'I think Germany and England have the strongest two leagues but the big difference is the marketing. The Premier League has 10 years more experience in that,' he says. 'On the pitch, the Premier League is not better or quicker. 'Of course, Bayern Munich is by far the best team in Germany but it's not because the other teams are s***, it is just because they very strong. 'If Bayern came into the Premier League, they would finish top-three for sure and they could win it, why not? They have World Cup winners and players like (Arjen) Robben, (Robert) Lewandowski and (Franck) Ribery. Di Santo,  modestly for his league, believes Bayern Munich would be in the Premier League's top three . The big striker took on Chelsea and their midfield giant Nemanja Matic in pre-season. Bremen won 3-1 . 'Just because some of the other teams in Germany aren't big names, it doesn't mean they're not good. 'We played Chelsea in pre-season and beat them 3-1. OK, it was pre-season but Chelsea put out a good team and it wasn't like they were able to score 10 against us.' Di Santo, a 6ft 4in centre forward, has packed a lot of experience into his short career. He left Argentina for Chile very young and at 17 signed for Chelsea with a big reputation. It didn't quite happen for him at Stamford Bridge and he failed to score a goal for them in two seasons. 'I had to be realistic, I was competing against (Didier) Drogba, (Nicolas) Anelka, (Andriy) Shevchenko, (Claudio) Pizarro and (Salomon) Kalou for a place and they were probably better than me at the time,' he admits. 'The most time I got was 45 minutes against Aston Villa when Anelka got injured.' The presence of Didier Drogba (left), who is still Di Santo's friend, made it difficult for him to get game time . Di Santo (right) says his loan to Blackburn went well at first but then he was dropped by Sam Allardyce . Franco di Santo has hailed his Argentine international team-mate Angel di Maria as one of the top 10 players in the world. Di Maria has struggled in England, as Di Santo did, following a record £59.7million summer move to Manchester United. But di Santo insists: 'Di Maria did so well in the World Cup for Argentina, it was a shame he was injured for the final against Germany otherwise the outcome might have been different, for sure. 'He is among the top 10 players in the world. His best position is on the wing, either right or left. He is quick and skilful but some players need more time to settle into a new league than others. 'I'd say (Lionel) Messi and (Cristiano) Ronaldo are on a different planet but after them, there are five or six of around the level – Sergio Aguero, Arjen Robben, Edinson Cavani, Zlatan Ibrahimovic – and di Maria.' He went on loan to Blackburn. 'I played every single game for a half a season and did really well, but didn't score - that was my big problem. I decided to stay another six months but then the manager Sam Allardyce didn't play me any more. It was weird, from amazing to becoming very hard. But I did get a goal and assist in our local derby against Burnley and they made a DVD of the match with my face on the cover!' Ironically, it was Roberto Martinez – now in charge of England's sole Europa League survivors Everton – who helped start to turn his career around by signing him for Wigan on a permanent basis in 2010. 'It was my personal decision to leave Chelsea, I still had time on my contract but needed to play. Roberto told me I was good enough to play for Argentina, he gave me confidence. And he made me think about getting into the penalty area more. Before then, I only wanted to score pretty goals, go past a lot of players. 'Now I realise if it comes off my knee, it still counts as one goal and that has helped me.' Wigan won the FA Cup – Di Santo was an unused substitute - and were relegated in the same season, and Martinez left for Everton. He signed Arouna Kone, Antolin Alcaraz, James McCarthy and Joel Robles – but not Di Santo. 'There is no problem with that, it would have been difficult to sign so many players from Wigan,' says the player. Blackburn fans mob Di Santo after he scored against Burnley and it even earned him a space on a DVD cover . Wigan lifted the FA Cup at Wembley before being relegated, although Di Santo didn't play a single minute . Instead, the forward – who won three caps for Argentina during his time at the DW Stadium – went to Bremen in northern Germany and is finally fulfilling the promise everyone predicted in his teens. His winning goal against Freiburg last weekend lifted Bremen up to eighth, just six points of a Champions League berth. Unfortunately a booking also means he is suspended for Saturday's big match against Bayern. He still keeps in touch with old Chelsea pals like Drogba and Branislav Ivanovic and friends from Wigan like Alcaraz and Maynor Figueroa. He admits though that having not been ready for English football at 17, he would fancy a return at some point to see how the intensity and hard work in the German League have helped him develop. Wigan owner Dave Whelan gets a champagne shower from Di Santo, but they would soon part company . While Di Santo is enjoying the Bundesliga, he says he fancies a shot at 'revenge' in the Premier League . 'I am happy here really, I know I am in a league that is very competitive, one of the best in the world,' he said. 'In one way I am very happy here, I am doing well and playing in a very competitive league. But for the other side I would like to have my revenge in the English League, show what I can do with the experience I now have. It may depend on Roberto Martinez or other coaches what happens! 'If I have to stay in Germany, I am going to be happy, and for the other side, if I have to go to England, I will try to do my best to show I am better than last time.' Di Santo still has friends in England from his time there and keeps contact with a few Chelsea players .

"The NFL sent a tough message to Cleveland Browns general manager Ray Farmer for texting. However, the league didn't delete any of Cleveland's precious draft picks. Farmer has been suspended without pay for the first four games of the 2015 regular season for sending text messages to the sideline during games last season. The league announced its punishment on Monday, ending an investigation that hung over the franchise during yet another turbulent offseason and threatened to undermine the Browns' upcoming draft. Farmer, who acknowledged sending the messages weeks ago, will not be paid during his suspension. The league said his ban begins on midnight of the Sunday preceding the Browns' first regular-season game and will end immediately after the fourth regular-season game. Farmer cannot be involved in any club matters and is prohibited from being at the team's offices, practice facility or games, the league said. Ray Farmer  sent text messages to the sideline last season during games and has been suspended . 'I respect the league's decision and understand that there are consequences for my actions,' Farmer said in a statement released by the Browns. 'Accountability is integral to what we are trying to build and as a leader I need to set the right example. I made a mistake and apologize to Jimmy Haslam, (coach) Mike Pettine, our entire organization and our fans for the ramifications. Learning is a big part of who I am and I will certainly be better from this situation.' The Browns were also fined $250,000, but that's pocket change considering what they could have lost. Cleveland has 10 picks in the upcoming draft, including two in the first round (Nos 12 and 19) and six of the first 115. The Browns, who went 7-9 last season, could be positioning themselves to make a run at one of the top quarterbacks, and losing any assets would not only have weakened their bargaining power, but prevented a team with several holes from adding young talent. The Browns haven't been to the playoffs since 2002 and have had just two winning seasons since 1999. Owner Jimmy Haslam, who has remained supportive of Farmer, has said the team is committed to finding a franchise quarterback. The team signed free agent Josh McCown, backup Thad Lewis and is waiting for Johnny Manziel to be released from rehab. Johnny Manziel's first NFL season was plagued with doubts about his lifestyle and ability to knuckle down . During its investigation, the league said it found no evidence that Haslam or other team executives knew about the texts. Troy Vincent, the NFL's vice president of football operations, said Farmer used a cellphone on 'multiple occasions' during games in 2014. League rules prohibit teams from using any electronic devices beginning 90 minutes before kickoff through the end of a game. The rule forbids communication to the sidelines, coach's booths, locker room or any other club-controlled areas. The only exceptions are the league-issued tablets coaches use for still photos. The texting inquiry was just one of several issues to hound the Browns this winter. Along with Manziel's trip to rehab, offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan had a messy departure and troubled wide receiver Josh Gordon was suspended by the league for at least one season for multiple drug violations. Throughout the inquiry, Haslam professed his loyalty to Farmer, who was promoted in February 2014 when team president Joe Banner and GM Michael Lombardi were fired. 'We accept the league's ruling,' Haslam said. 'Ray made a mistake and takes full responsibility for his role in violating the policy. It is critical that we make better decisions. Ray has tremendous integrity and I know has great remorse for what occurred. We are all committed to learning from this and making the Browns a stronger and better organization.'","Browns general manager was caught texting personnel during games last season .

"Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp is confident his side can overturn a 2-1 Champions League first leg deficit against Juventus on Wednesday due to their watertight defence. The improving Germans, who have recovered after a dismal first half to the domestic season that saw them anchored in last place as recently as last month in the Bundesliga, have kept a clean sheet in their last three league games, including a 0-0 draw against Cologne on the weekend.

Dortmund boast a fine record at home in Europe having won 11 of their last 14 Champions League games at the Westfalenstadion. But in order to book a spot in the last eight they have to snap a losing run at home against Juventus, having lost all three previous encounters against the Italians in Dortmund. Klopp will be counting on goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has scored five in his last seven outings and in-form Marco Reus, who has struck five times in eight games. Marco Reus cancelled out Carlos Tevez's opener before Alvaro Morata scored a 42nd-minute winner . Juventus are flying high in Serie A, edging closer to the Italian title with their first triumph away from home in over two months at Palermo, opening up a 14-point lead. 'One less win needed to win the league,' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri said, knowing he will now need to shift his focus to Dortmund and their attacking game. 'We will need to take the lead there, maybe score more than one goal,' said the coach. They will, however, be without influential playmaker Andrea Pirlo who has yet to fully recover from a thigh injury suffered in the first leg.

"Laura Robson has aborted her planned comeback at next week's Miami Open, having decided her wrist is still not ready for full on match play. The former British No 1 had accepted a wildcard into the qualifying event for the prestigious tournament involving both sexes in South Florida. However, she has now handed it back, as looked likely after she posted a picture of herself on Saturday night at a fashion exhibition in London. Laura Robson attended a fashion event in London as she continues to recover from a wrist injury .

Caution has been the watchword for Robson since she underwent surgery on her wrist early last summer. She had hoped to come back at some small events in California last month ahead of Indian Wells this week, but that was postponed for the Miami wildcard. The next possible target is a WTA event in Colombia next month although seeing will be believing. Robson is not said to have suffered any major setback in her rehab but the view is that there is no point rushing and doing further long term damage as she is still only 21. It is now 14 months since Robson last appeared, at the 2014 Australian Open, where problems in her wrist ligament fully flared up. It will inevitably be a long road back when she manages to regain full fitness.

"The treatment of Gareth Bale in Spain suggests it is not just in the Premier League that foreign players can get a raw deal. Bale’s form has dipped lately, but before that he scored vital goals — at a rate close to one every other game — and helped his team win their 10th European Cup. The condemnation he receives from the local media and crowd, therefore, is mystifying. He is accused of not being a team player. Few in England would recognise that description.

"Richard Scudamore’s elevation to the role of Premier League executive chairman reinforces his commitment to the organisation, which he has led for the last 15 years. His promotion and the appointment of two non-executive independent directors in Claudia Arney and Kevin Beeston, as revealed by Sports Agenda, was finally rubberstamped at Thursday’s club summit. The three-strong board will meet monthly to ensure proper scrutiny of Scudamore’s increased powerbase, with the newcomers also attending the PL’s club summits six times a year. Richard Scudamore was elevated to the role of Premier League executive chairman on Thursday . Scudamore, who has recovered from serious heart surgery last summer, said: ‘This is almost a re-commitment. This isn’t something you would do if you were about to leave. ‘Look at me, I’m up for it and my health is absolutely fine. This is a very enjoyable job. My enthusiasm for it has never waned.’ Arney, an Arsenal season ticket-holder, is a non-executive director of Halfords. She used to work at Goldman Sachs and the Treasury. Beeston is chairman of housebuilder Taylor Wimpey. He was a board member of Ipswich during their financial troubles and is a Chelsea season ticket-holder. Oddly, the Premier League say he enjoys watching rugby and tennis. Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves vows an inquiry if England don't beat West Indies in their Test series . Colin Graves, the incoming chairman of the ECB, has already stated he expects England to beat a ‘mediocre’ West Indies side in the Caribbean next month. And Graves will be in Barbados for the last of the three Tests, when head coach Peter Moores and England managing director Paul Downton will surely have to be shown the door if a series defeat follows the World Cup debacle. Barclays will definitely not be renewing their title sponsorship of the Premier League when their £40million-a-year contract expires at the end of next season, clubs were told on Thursday. The PL will not be short of offers, even at a higher price, to endorse the world’s richest league, with Guinness said to be interested. Barclays first raised doubts about their deal at the start of 2014, when a senior executive was alleged to have said the sponsorship had ‘zero value’ in the UK. On top of that, group chief executive Antony Jenkins doesn’t like football. Barclays have sponsored the Premier League since 2001 but the 2015-16 season is set to be their last . It will not help promoter Barry McGuigan’s negotiations with ITV over Carl Frampton’s next fight that foreign exchange traders CWMFX, who heavily sponsored his first super-bantamweight world title defence on the network, have had their London offices raided by police. Thirteen people were arrested on suspicion of fraud. ITV declined to comment. The Webb Ellis trophy will be contested for at the home World Cup, which begins in September . Around 350,000 World Cup tickets being returned by the International Rugby Board to ER2015 are not expected to include many for England matches at Twickenham. This is much to the annoyance of the official England Rugby Supporters Club. They are upset at the number of Twickenham tickets that have gone to official hospitality, especially after being told they had priority status for World Cup matches — apart from England at Twickenham. ER2015 say they will have a ‘few thousand’ extra England tickets to put on sale, while corporate hospitality were given 21,000 tickets for England group games at HQ. FA chairman Greg Dyke is adamant more homegrown players need to play in Football League sides . Premier League clubs and FA chairman Greg Dyke had a remarkably civil encounter on Thursday considering their conflicting positions on Dyke’s campaign for more homegrown players. It was agreed there would be consultation on the issue after a club asked Dyke whether he would force through changes. The FA and Milltown Partners, their PR advisers, had been very bullish about making it happen after Dyke announced his campaign last Monday, but the FA chairman rode back on Thursday, telling clubs he only wanted debate. England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster has just been told by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie that four runners-up finishes in the Six Nations is ‘unacceptable’. So it’s not the best week for the Leaders in Sport website to be promoting a video about Lancaster ‘creating a winning formula for one of the most physical sports in the world’. Not yet he hasn’t.","Premier League CEO Richard Scudamore has been made chairman .

"Lord Windermere, the 2014 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, has been confirmed as a ‘definite’ starter in the Crabble’s Grand National at Aintree on Saturday week. Trainer Jim Culloty has made no public comment since the nine-year-old was pulled up behind Coneygree last month when trying to defend his title. Since that run jockey Davy Russell has lost the ride on Lord Windermere, although a broken arm 24 hours after that news emerged means Russell would not have been available anyway. The 2014 Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere has been confirmed as a definite Grand National starter . Culloty will also be represented by Spring Heeled, who also won at last season’ s Cheltenham Festival, as his launches a twin assault on the £1million prize. A spokeswoman for Culloty’s Co Cork stable said: ‘Both horses are definite runners. There are no concrete jockey plans at the moment.’ Victory for either gelding, both of which run in the colours of Dr Ronan Lambe, would make Culloty, who won the 2002 race as a jockey on board Bindaree, only the sixth man to both ride and train a Grand National winner. Trainer Jim Culloty has made no comment since the nine-year-old was pulled up behind Coneygree last month . Best known as the rider of three-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Best Mate, Culloty would also join Fred Winter as the only man to have ridden and trained the winner of both the Grand National and Gold Cup. Jockey options for the Culloty pair could include Robbie McNamara, who won the 2014 Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup on Spring Heeled, who has been kept fresh for his National challenge. Spring Heeled is a 20-1 shot for the Aintree race but confirmation that Lord Windermere, due to carry top weight of 11st 10lb, will run could prompt the few bookmakers making his a 50-1 shot to trim his odds back in line with rivals. Trainer Jim Culloty's second representative Spring Heeled is a 20-1 shot for the Grand National at Aintree . Definitely out of the National is Jonjo O’Neill’s Merry King, who has a breathing problem while Nicky Henderson’s Hadrian’s Approach is rated ‘very doubtful’ after picking up a leg injury. Merry King’s exit frees up jockey Richie McLernon, who looks a riding option for Emma Lavelle’s Court By Surprise. Alan King has confirmed Godsmejudge, the 2013 Scottish National winner, run despite the gelding being beaten almost 70 lengths on his latest run over hurdles at Bangor.

"The good news for all concerned in Monaco was that it had stopped raining. Arsene Wenger had raised fears on the eve of the game and as the downpour continued into the night the Arsenal manager wasn't the only one casting anxious glances skywards. This is a big day for the new AS Monaco and they do not want it washed out. Arsene Wenger had raised fears over the playing surface at Monaco's Stade Louis II on Monday night . The Stade Louis II has a  poor surface and groundstaff have worked hard to help it drain after heavy rainfall . Dimitar Berbatov celebrates during Monaco's 3-1 win against Arsenal at the Emirates last month . A recent game against Montpellier had been cancelled and because the pitch at the Stade Louis II is a notoriously poor surface, with so much going on beneath it: car parks, swimming pools, etc groundstaff worked through the night to help it drain as they prepare for what they hope will be a famous victory, one which will see them into the last eight of the Champions League for the first time since 2004, when they went on to the final and lost to Jose Mourinho's Porto. Much has happened to Monaco since then. They almost dropped into the third tier of French football and faced extinction before Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev came to the rescue and got them moving in the right direction once again. The first leg result against Arsenal was confirmation that the Rybolovlev project is still on track, having survived a change of direction and an exodus of top players like James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao last summer.

No club in the Champions League era has surrendered a two-goal lead after playing the first leg away and Leonardo Jardim's team prides itself on tight defence. They have conceded only once in the last 12 home games and are quietly confident history will not be rewritten, with Jardim expected to enhance his reputation for caution by making a tweak or two to his team to make it even more solid. If they park the Bentley as smartly as they did at the Emirates Stadium, it promises to be one of the great nights in Monaco's recent history. VIDEO Monaco favourites to progress . Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim has guided his team to eleven clean sheets in their last twelve home games . Aymen Abdenoour celebrates the win over Arsenal and Monaco will be confident history will not be rewritten . The 18,000 capacity stadium is sold-out, which rarely happens. There were fewer than 6,000 in to see them beat nine-man Bastia on Friday, a 3-0 win which kept them in touch with the Ligue 1 leaders. Despite its rich history, Monaco will never be one of the France's football hotbeds. It is a unique club set in the playground of the privileged, where most of the local residents are far wealthier than any of the players and many of them more recognisable. In Monte Carlo, the most famous of the Principality's districts, you would hardly know there was a big Champions League game on. The stadium is set in Fontvieille, a district reclaimed from the sea in the 1970s, and cut off by a tunnel from the more recognisable sights such as Casino Square, the Opera, a harbour crammed with super-yachts and the Grand Prix circuit. Abdenoour and Ricardo Carvalho congratulate goalscorer Anthony Martial during Friday's 3-0 win over Bastia . Work has started this week in preparation for the Monaco Grand Prix in May. Wenger's first return to the club he managed for seven years until 1994 fails to make the social calendar for many of those who settle here to enjoy tax-free life in the world's smallest monarchy. L'Equipe has devoted it's pages to Tuesday's clash . Prince Albert, the ruling monarch, continues to support the club he used to run and will be at the game, as the French attempt to claim another football triumph against the English after Chelsea were knocked out by Paris St Germain last week. French sports paper L'Equipe devoted its first five pages to the game with the disciplinary saga of PSG idol Zlatan Ibrahimovic relegated to Page 6. Instead, rival strikers Olivier Giroud and Dimitar Berbatov were pitched head-to-head on the front. At Stade Louis II on the eve of the game, Wenger was met by Monaco's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev and presented with a framed picture designed to commemorate his work at the club, where he won the French title in 1988. In an interview with Sportsmail, last month, ahead of the first-leg, Vasilyev hailed Wenger as 'one of the iconic coaches of modern football' but the Arsenal manager is not big on sentiment. He was wounded by the 3-1 defeat in the first leg and aware that history is against a glorious comeback, but the noises from the Arsenal camp were all about believing the impossible to be possible. With their array of attacking talent, scoring three goals seems an achievable target. Keeping Monaco at bay at the other end while doing so, may be a different proposition.

"Arsenal face an uphill battle to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League when they take on Monaco but Arsene Wenger's men should take heart from some previous European comebacks. The Gunners must score at least three away goals on Tuesday as they look to overturn the 3-1 defeat they suffered at the Emirates late last month. Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at 10 of the greatest second leg comebacks in European competition. Arsenal's players, pictured in training on Monday, are looking to overturn their 3-1 first leg defeat by Monaco . Chelsea 4-1 Napoli (Agg 5-4 after extra-time), Champions League last 16, March 14, 2012 . Chelsea looked dead and buried after a dismal 3-1 defeat in Naples but, after the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas, the Blues stormed back to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. Goals from Didier Drogba and John Terry had Roberto Di Matteo's men in control before Gokhan Inler's strike in the 55th minute put the visitors in charge. Frank Lampard levelled the tie with a 75th minute penalty and Branislav Ivanovic popped up in extra-time with a thumping finish to continue Chelsea's charge towards the trophy. Branislav Ivanovic celebrates after scoring the decisive goal in Chelsea's 4-1 win against Napoli in 2012 . Fulham 4-1 Juventus (Agg 5-4), Europa League last 16, March 18, 2010 . Fulham also suffered a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of this tie but the Cottagers didn't require extra-time to make it through to the last eight of the Europa League in style. David Trezeguet's goal appeared to have ended the contest early on but strikes from Bobby Zamora and Zoltan Gera - either side of a red card for Fabio Cannavaro - had Roy Hodgson's men back in it. Gera netted another from the penalty spot before Clint Dempsey sealed Fulham's progress with a delightful chip beyond the helpless Antonio Chimenti.

AC Milan could be forgiven for thinking this tie was as good as over after their 4-1 first leg win at the San Siro but Deportivo had other ideas. The Spanish side wiped out the visitors' advantage with first-half goals from Walter Pandiani, Juan Carlos Valeron and Albert Luque, putting themselves in the driving seat on away goals.

Paco Alcacer was the hero for Valencia as they overturned a three-goal first leg deficit to reach the last four of the Europa League. The talented striker netted either side of an Eduardo Vargas strike as the hosts forced an extra 30 minutes following their 3-0 defeat in Switzerland.

"Formula One champion and Australian Grand Prix winner Lewis Hamilton has responded to calls for changes to tackle Mercedes' dominance by saying other teams need to hire some better people. Hamilton's world championship defence got off to a flying start on Sunday with a crushing victory for Mercedes in the season-opening Melbourne race as F1 rivals succumbed to a farcical rash of reliability problems. Pole-sitter Hamilton started from a grid reduced to 15 cars from a possible 20 and cruised to his 34th race win with a 1.3sec gap to runner-up team-mate Nico Rosberg. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian GP win in front of second-placed Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel . Hamilton stormed to victory at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix following a dominant performance . Nico Rosberg followed Hamilton home as Mercedes picked up where they left off with total domination . By the time fans were heading out of Albert Park, Red Bull consultant Helmut Marko was discussing the possibility of billionaire owner Dietrich Mateschitz falling out of love with the sport and leaving. Appearing on an afternoon TV show in Sydney on Tuesday, Hamilton agreed that Mercedes' dominance had caused controversy and responded to suggestions of a possible Red Bull withdrawal by saying all the other teams could do better. 'It's very interesting to hear that when they dominated for four years, big time. They've not had a good couple of years - they didn't do so bad last year. Hamilton and Rosberg (right) shake hands  after Mercedes pair finished more than 30 seconds ahead of third . Helmut Marko (left, with former Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel) says the team will evaluate the situation . 'But you've seen a real big improvement from Ferrari, they've actually overtaken Red Bull and Williams have made a really big step and I think you're going to have to watch them really closely this year. 'There's a lot of potential, particularly in the rules for them to make big steps and close the gap. So we still have a fight on our hands,' said Hamilton. There have been suggestions that F1 is too technical and complicated. but Hamilton did not agree. 'It's not for us...So you've got to hire some better people I guess. Ultimately it's a test and a challenge of evolution, of innovation and we've hired great people to - and we've done a great job and we weren't complaining when they were doing.' Red Bull chief Christian Horner is concerned that Mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport . Horner's Red Bull team won consecutive titles between 2010-2013 with Sebastian Vettel behind the wheel . Asked if criticism was just 'sour grapes', the British champion said: 'I'm not going to get into the political side of things, I just drive. I'm really grateful for, for what Mercedes have done as a team. 'There's over 1,000 people in our team who've done an amazing job, and the car's fantastic - best car I've ever driven, so happy with it and I want to really grab the opportunity with both hands and do the best job I can.' Asked if Mercedes' domination of Sunday's race was boring, Hamilton replied: 'Definitely wasn't for me!'","Lewis Hamilton won the opening race of the season in Australia on Sunday .

"David Duckenfield has admitted that his failure was a direct cause of the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans at the Hillsborough disaster . The police match commander in charge of Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest in 1989 has admitted that his failure to close a tunnel was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 fans at the Hillsborough disaster. During the inquest into the deaths today, David Duckenfield also admitted that he 'froze' on the day in question, while Paul Greaney QC suggested that a child of 'average intelligence' could have realised the consequences of opening a gate to relieve congestion. Up to 2,000 fans entered Hillsborough stadium's Gate C, with many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them which Mr Duckenfield had not ordered to be closed. They then continued to the already full central pens on the terrace which led to the fatal crushing. Mr Greaney reminded Mr Duckenfield of his earlier evidence to Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquest, about his state of mind after the opening of Gate C when he told her: 'It was a momentous decision and your decision is such that you do not think of the next step. My mind for a moment went blank.' Asked again if he 'froze', Mr Duckenfield said: 'It appears to be a distinct possibility.' Mr Greaney said: 'You know what was in your mind and I will ask just one last time. Will you accept that in fact you froze?' Mr Duckenfield responded: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney went on: 'Do you agree with the following, that people died in a crush in the central pens?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'That if they had not been permitted to flow down the tunnel into those central pens that would not have occurred?' The witness repeated: 'Yes sir.' Liverpool supporters were crushed to death during an FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest in 1989 . Liverpool supporters and family members of the victims of the disaster have long sought justice . The barrister continued: 'That closing the tunnel would have prevented that and therefore would have prevented the tragedy.' Mr Duckenfield said again: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'That you failed to recognise that there was a need to close that tunnel.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I did fail to recognise that sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'And therefore failed to take steps to achieve that.' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I did sir.' A young Liverpool fan is carried away from the danger as supporters are forced on to the Hillsborough pitch . Mr Greaney said: 'That failure was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 persons in the Hillsborough tragedy.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes sir.' Earlier Mr Duckenfield had claimed he was unaware of the geography of Sheffield Wednesday's ground, this being his first match in charge, and denied that he 'bottled it'. Mr Greaney, representing the Police Federation, put it the retired police chief: 'Do you agree that never mind a competent match commander it might only take a child of average intelligence to realise what the consequences of your actions might be?' Thousands of Liverpool fans hold up scarves during a Hillsborough memorial service at Anfield last year . Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I did not think of it on the day, sir, because of the pressure I was under.' Mr Greaney asked: 'Is the explanation of your failures Mr Duckenfield not that you were ignorant of the geography for example but rather that you knew the geography, you knew what the consequences might be of people entering the crowd but you simply froze?' The witness replied: 'I am not in a position to make that judgment, sir. Others should make that judgment.' Mr Greaney continued: 'You bottled it. You panicked and you failed to take the action that you knew needed to be taken to avoid consequences that you had foreseen. Now does that describe your state at the time?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I disagree with you sir.' A shirt of local rivals Everton is among thousands of flower tributes laid at Anfield shortly after the disaster . 'Why?' asked Mr Greaney. Mr Duckenfield said: 'Because that's my view.' The barrister said: 'Why is it your view?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Because it is my view and there can be no other view than mine.' Mr Greaney said: 'Do you accept that might thought to be a rather arrogant thing to say?' The witness replied: 'Sir I apologise. If that appears arrogant I didn't mean that to be so.' The inquests have heard that Mr Duckenfield told the 1989 Taylor Inquiry into the disaster that he had made the right decisions on the day but he now accepted that he had made errors - some of which were 'grave'. Chair of the Hillsborough Families For Justice, Margaret Aspinall, arrives at the inquest last week . He has told the jury that his serious failings were due to his lack of experience and that others also played their part in the cause of the deaths. Mr Duckenfield agreed with Mr Greaney that it was 'totally unacceptable' that a match commander 'did not have a grip on the geography of that ground sufficient to enable you to understand the consequences of your decision making'. He also accepted that when giving evidence to Lord Justice Taylor it appeared that he was aware that the congested Leppings Lane turnstiles did lead to the central tunnel. Mr Duckenfield said he did not want to go into detail about his 'personal circumstances' - he has previously said he suffered post-traumatic stress - but it may have been he was 'confused' when giving evidence in 1989. Supporters pay their respects to the deceased at the Anfield gates in Liverpool after the disaster in 1989 . Mr Greaney said: 'The other possibility that I put to you is that you did at the time know much more about the geography of that ground and you are seeking to conceal that knowledge from this jury.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I can assure you, sir, I had no idea where fans would go from A to G (turnstiles) or the opening of Gate C.' Mr Greaney pointed out that Mr Duckenfield could have looked at a plan of the ground layout in the police control box before opening the gate at 2.52pm and that he could have consulted a fellow senior colleague with greater experience of the ground. A memorial service is held at Liverpool's Anfield ground on the April 15, 1989 anniversary of the disaster . The barrister told the court that another officer who was in the control box, who was operating the CCTV cameras, had earlier told the jury that he thought Mr Duckenfield was 'not a leader in that control room during that critical period'. Mr Greaney asked Mr Duckenfield: 'Do you agree that (the officer) was describing a match commander who had frozen?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'It is a possibility, sir, but that is his view and I cannot comment further.' Mr Greaney said: 'Can you not tell us whether on that day in that situation you simply froze?' The witness replied: 'Sir, I think it is fair to say that we were all in a state of shock.' Duckenfield agreed with Greaney that it would be 'disgraceful' and 'cowardly' to shift blame for his failings . Mr Greaney said: 'You were the one whose job it was to get past any feelings of shock, do you agree?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes, sir, but I am human.' Mr Greaney said: 'Do you agree that you failed to offer any true leadership in that situation on that day?' The witness replied: 'That is not my view.' Earlier, Mr Duckenfield agreed with Mr Greaney that it would be 'disgraceful' and 'cowardly' to try to shift blame for his own failings to officers under his own command. The retired chief superintendent of South Yorkshire Police has previously said he had expected police officers on the perimeter track of the ground and those in the West Stand overlooking the Leppings Lane terrace pens to have kept an eye on monitoring the filling of them. But he accepted they had no received formal instructions to do so. The Hillsborough Memorial at Anfield has been relocated during the redevelopment work on the stadium .

The formation of such a force is not a cause for concern according to former SAS soldier Andy McNab who described the footage as a 'very funny' PR film. The man who uses the name as a pseudonym to protect his identity told MailOnline: 'Just looking at the guys as they handle weapons... it is clear that not even regular soldiers  have much to worry about from these guys.' And although Islamic State's aspiration to train a deadly Special Forces battalion is worrying, it is mostly a 'display of force for a local and international audience' according to Director of International Security Studies at security think-tank RUSI. Daring: One Jihadi soldier in army fatigues rappels upside down as hundreds of onlookers watch from below . Hardened: The 'Special Forces' unit's intensive training culminates in the recruits traversing a narrow and shallow river with their weapons . Show of force: Such public displays of dominance 'makes people both fear them, but also makes them an attractive force for people to want to go and join', one defence expert told MailOnline . Elite: Raffaello Pantucci from RUSI said the propaganda video is a chance for ISIS to glorify not only its tactics and soldiers - but the weapons it has seized . Leader: One ISIS commander - the only one not masked in the entire video - addresses the audience flanked by four menacing ISIS soldiers . Deadly: The ISIS soldiers - who trained in a busy Middle Eastern city - also carry out heavy weapons training in a slightly more remote location . Raffaello Pantucci told MailOnline: 'They are showing off their capabilities and captured equipment given the US issue M16 rifles on display. 'By showing off their men's ability, training and captured equipment, they are demonstrating that they are a strong force that is still in control of its territory and are an effective force. 'This makes people both fear them, but also makes them an attractive force for people to want to go and join.' Previous  footage from Islamic State's training camps believed to be in Iraq showed recruits disguised as bushes. Other drills involved the extremists performing unnecessary forward rolls over mounds which would leave them far more exposed to enemy fire than keeping low with a commando crawl. While in some scenes, the recruits have a crack at martial arts by taking it turns to smash wall tiles over their own heads. The terror group, which has been determined to portray itself as a formal military force, showed off its 'sniper battalion' in a much more threatening display in late February. Through its vast social media channels, it released pictures of bearded and clean-shaven men posing with long-range sniper rifles in northern Iraq. Sharpshooters: In later February, the militant group has revealed pictures of its special 'sniper battalion' (pictured) Violent legacy: Islamic State Twitter accounts are linking the sniper battalion to a famous Iraqi sniper . Believes to be a propagandist reply to the hit US film American Sniper, the fighters were kitted out in khaki uniforms, peaked caps and ski goggles to protect them from the glare of the sun. The unit is part of the Ninewa Division of northern Iraq according to US-based Jihadi tracking organisation SITE. ISIS snipers have seen action in both Syria and Iraq where they have been responsible for the deaths of many Kurdish and Iraqi soldiers. They played a prominent role in the battle for Kobane which involved intense street fighting even though the extremists were eventually expelled from the city. ISIS Twitter accounts were quick to link the battalion to a famous Iraqi sniper who plagued American forces during the Iraqi conflict. One said the unit was carrying on the legacy of 'Juba the Sniper' - a Sunni insurgent who operated in Baghdad from 2005 where he is said to have killed around 40 American soldiers.","Eight-minute propaganda video shows ISIS soldiers training in a busy city .

"Trekking through the dunes of the Sahara in 40 degree heat can be thirsty work even for camels. And one for one of the animals taking a long swig from a beer bottle was just what they needed to refresh themselves. The herd of camels were on a trek across the Erg Chebbi dunes in Morocco, where one of the group was snapped having a refreshing drink. A camel takes a swig from a beer bottle on a short refreshment stop while trekking across the Sahara desert . Tour guides filled the beer bottles with water for the camels to drink as temperatures reached as high as 40 degrees . But rather than swigging down beer the bottles had actually been filled with water by the guides for the camels to drink. Photographer Joao Victor Bolan, who captured the image, said: 'The picture where a camel drinks from a bottle, it was obviously just for fun. It was just water. 'They don't usually drink too often and while we were there, I hadn't seen any camel drinking. 'We only made a short stop - I would say not more than 15 minutes - but judging by how fast they drank it, I guess they were thirsty.' Mr Bolan travelled over 370 miles across the High Atlas mountain range from the Moroccan city of Marrakech to reach the sand dunes. The pictures were snapped by photographer Joao Bolan, who spent time trekking across the Erg Chebbi dunes in Morocco . The 26-year-old travelled with a guide and a friend and when they reached the dunes, they hired a total of six camels to help them explore the area. And while there, they experienced extreme temperatures ranging from soaring heat during the day to freezing temperatures around minus five late at night. Mr Bolan, from Sao Paulo, Brazil added: 'I was photographing the route from Marrakech to Erg Chebbi through the High Atlas region. The group experienced extreme temperatures on their trek ranging from soaring hear during the day to freezing temperatures at night . 'We stopped at a base camp for the dunes where we spent the night. 'Like any other desert, it was incredibly hot during the day and cold at night. 'Riding the camels was a little uncomfortable to be honest. 'After two hours, your back really starts to hurt but I would say that was a nice experience because it's a huge animal that goes on a paced rhythm in a majestic environment.'","A herd of camels was trekking through the Sahara with a group of tourists .

"This is the moment a pair of skydivers dramatically set fire to their petrol-soaked parachute canopies sending them plummeting to earth at 120 miles per hour. Alex Aimard and his friend Petter Jonsson leapt from a plane over Eloy in Arizona armed with a parachute doused in kerosene, a flare gun and a Go Pro camera. And after deploying their parachutes, the pair then pull out the guns during their descent to set fire to their canopies. Alex Aimard aims his flare gun at his petrol-soaked parachute after jumping out of a plane over the Arizona . The fire from the gun causes the parachute to ignite and causes a blaze in the Mr Aimard's canopy . With just seconds to react and release the now flaming parachutes before the fire travelled down cords to their bodies, the pair free themselves. But luckily they also have an emergency parachute, meaning they then glide safely to the ground. The pair, who are both experienced professional skydivers and BASE jumpers, had meticulously planned the dangerous stunt, which took place earlier this year. Mr Jonsson, from Sweden, said: 'I was so focused on my task that I didn't have time to be scared or think about what could have gone wrong.' The fire then takes hold and starts to travel down the cords to their bodies meaning Mr Aimard has to quickly free themselves . After being freed, Mr Aimard then deploys his emergency parachute so he can glide safely back to the ground . While Mr Aimard, from France, added: 'Petter jumped first so when I exited the plane I saw something that I will never forget - a big cloud of smoke made by the explosion of his chute. 'It was like being part of a Rambo movie for real.' The duo had been taking part in a two-week online project called Living the Dream, when they travelled to Utah and Arizona to perform the sky dives. The potentially deadly fire stunt took place on the last day of their trip. Mr Aimard explained: 'We struggled with the weather conditions and the project was on hold for a few days due to a strong wind, which gave us plenty of time for preparation. 'When the wind finally slowed down, everything happened in a couple of hours. Petter Jonsson then attempts the stunt and shoots the kerosene soaked parachute with the flare gun . With the parachute in flames,  Mr Jonsson then starts plummeting to earth at more than 120mph . But despite the dangerous stunt Mr Jonsson makes it safely back down to the ground thanks to his emergency parachute . 'Skydiving itself is not without danger and flying in a plane with two big buckets full of gas and two flare guns doesn't decrease the risk. 'You can imagine a lot of things going wrong but with fine tuned preparation there was no room for doubt or uncontrolled fear.' But despite the stunt receiving praise from fellow skydiving professionals, there was some online criticism. But Mr Aimard explained: 'Globally the response was very positive, but we got a couple of messages complaining about the pollution and how immature it was to do that. 'And I kind of agree, I guess this is why it was so much fun.'","Alex Aimard and Petter Jonsson leapt from a plane flying over Arizona .

"Sunderland winger Adam Johnson is keeping fit by training at his mansion with a coach from the club,Sportsmail understands. The 27-year-old, arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl, has been suspended by the Premier League strugglers pending the outcome of a police investigation. However, the Black Cats are sending a fitness coach to Johnson’s two-acre woodland pad to oversee private workouts. Adam Johnson, pictured with girlfriend Stacey Flounders,has had his bail extended until April 23 . The 27-year-old Sunderland winger was arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl . The player is understood to have told Sunderland, who appointed Dick Advocaat as new manager on Tuesday following the dismissal of Gus Poyet, that he is innocent. And while publicly club officials moved to suspend him, privately they want to keep him fit in the event that he is cleared in time to join their fight against relegation. A source said: ‘There’s a fitness coach going pretty much every day. The idea is to keep him ready so that if the allegations are dropped he can go straight back into the side.’ The gates at Johnson's £1.85million were shut following his arrest earlier this month . Former Manchester City man Johnson has been suspended by Sunderland since his arrest . Johnson was arrested on March 2. Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothes officers and a forensics team were seen at Johnson’s luxurious £1.85m house, close to a quiet hamlet in County Durham, and he was questioned at Peterlee police station before being bailed until March 18. That has now been extended and he will report back to police on April 23. Police officers raided dressing rooms at Sunderland's Stadium of Light as they investigate Johnson . Changing rooms at the club's Academy of Light training ground were also scoured by local police . As revealed by Sportsmail, as part of the probe, officers also turned up at the Stadium of Light and the 60-acre Academy of Light and scoured both dressing rooms as part of their hunt for evidence. All Sunderland staff were called to meetings following the arrest and warned away from posting anything about it on social media and from speaking to the press. Sunderland-born Johnson, whose long-time girlfriend Stacey Flounders gave birth to daughter Ayla Sofia in January, signed for the club for £10m from Manchester City in 2012. He has played 12 times for England. Peterlee Police Station in County Durham where  Johnson was taken after he was arrested .

"Former football coach Shane Hughes, who is accused of repeatedly raping a 12-year-old girl . A former Chelsea children's football coach has appeared in court accused of repeatedly raping a 12-year-old girl. Shane Hughes, who is believed to have worked for the Premier League club's Community Foundation, faces 14 counts of raping the girl. The alleged rapes dates back to 2011 and relate to one female victim, who is now aged 16. The 30-year-old, wearing a blue suit, with a white shirt and no tie, stood emotionless in the dock while Guildford Crown Court heard the charges laid out against him. Judge Christopher Critchlow said the charges against Hughes relate to when he was a football coach. He explained: 'These are allegation concerning his role as a football coach and what he did in that capacity.' The court was also told that Hughes, of Lenham in Kent will deny the charges against him. Gordon Ross, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant at the moment faces 14 charges of rape in relation to a claimant under the age of 13. 'The incidents date back to 2011 and thereafter. 'The early indication is that this will be a contested matter with a complete denial of any sexual activity.' Hughes was granted conditional bail to return to Guildford Crown Court on May 22 for a plea and case management hearing. An order was made banning Hughes from contacting the alleged girl victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Hughes was granted conditional bail at Guildford Crown Court, pictured, and will return on May 22 for plea case management . Formed in 2010, the Chelsea Foundation is an independent charity working within the community, which includes coaching courses for children. The club have declined to comment on the case but a source told the Sun on Sunday: 'He had worked for the foundation and not for the club or its youth set-up directly.' The case continues.

"A French baker has become embroiled in a racism row after selling dark chocolate cakes depicting an obese man and woman. Patissier Yannick Tavolaro has been selling the cakes, named Dieu and Desses (God and Goddess) in his shop in Grasse in the south of France for the past 15 years. They are made from chocolate to look like nude human figures, which have over-sized genitalia and breasts. Baker Yannick Tavolaro with the Dieu and Desses cakes he sells in his patisserie in the south of France, which have been branded racist . The Council of French Black Associations say the cakes are racist because they ridicule African religions . But the Council of French Black Associations (CRAN) has branded the pastries racist saying that they ridicule African religions after they were alerted to them by a member of the public. And now they are calling for Mr Tavlaro to take the cakes from the shelves of his bakery. In a statement the organisation's president Louis Georges Tin said: 'These cakes are inspired by colonial fantasies about black people with wide-eyed expressions, over-sized mouths and obligatory nudity. 'Worse still, considering their name, they ridicule African religions, presenting their divinities in a grotesque way, only good enough to be munched up.' The anti-racism group are calling for the cakes to be pulled from the shelves of Mr Tavolaro's bakery . But Mr Tavolaro says that in no way is he racists and that he only uses dark chocolate for the cakes because it is easier to work with . But Mr Travaloro is refusing to stop selling them, saying in no way are they racist and he only uses dark chocolate as it is easier to work with. He told Le Parisien: 'If they were racist, people wouldn't order them – the only thing people are offended by is the fact they’re black – if they were white nobody would mind. 'But black chocolate is easier to work with. 'People don’t know me – I’m being judged on these cakes. I’m not racist and nor are my customers.' Mr Tavolaro says he has been selling the cakes in his bakery in the town of Grasse for the past 15 years . Mr Tavolaro's supporters have now launched a Facebook campaign to show solidarity with the baker. The complaint by CRAN follows a similar case in France last year, where a chocolate maker changed the name of two of his specialties called 'Bamboula' and 'Negro'. The chocolate maker in Auxerre agreed to rename the chocolates, despite saying they were a centuries old tradition that actually paid tribute to Senegalese soldiers injured during the war and in no way racist.","Yannick Tavolaro has been selling the dark chocolate cakes in his bakery .

"Gareth Southgate was irritated. England had just put one over their oldest rivals in thrilling circumstances but something was gnawing away at the Under 21 head coach. For some reason, Southgate couldn’t get over the first 25 minutes at the Riverside Stadium, even though England had beaten Germany 3-2. England, he felt, were overawed by Germany who looked a team of stars, passing smoothly in tight areas, winning cute free-kicks and making their experience tell. They were doing everything their numbers suggested they would. The numbers? Norwich's Nathan Redmond, who scored England's second goal, deserves a Premier League return . Jesse Lingard levelled for England to make it 1-1 in Middlesbrough during an impressive victory . James Ward-Prowse hit the winner to give Gareth Southgate's men a tremendous win ahead of Euro 2015 . Nathan Redmond: West Ham and Stoke considered moves for the winger last summer. Should Norwich fail to get promotion, he might be going up any way. Danny Ings: Currently exploring his options with his deal at Burnley ending in June. Liverpool is his most likely destination. Luke Garbutt: Out of contract with Everton at the end of the season, Roberto Martinez is convinced he will sign a new deal. If he can’t, others will be on alert. Jack Butland: Just three FA Cup games is not enough for England’s No 3 keeper since returning to Stoke from his Derby loan. If Asmir Begovic doesn’t moves on, he might. Will Hughes: Some may think he is too lightweight but Hughes is an elegant player. If Derby don’t make the leap into the Premier League, others may try to entice him. Tom Carroll: Tottenham midfielder on loan at Swansea, a club that suits his style. He would benefit from making the switch permanent. The team Horst Hrubesch selected had 639 top-flight appearances between them; the squad’s combined number was a staggering 977. That figure would have been more than 1,100 had key players Bernd Leno and Kevin Volland not withdrawn through injury. Marc-Andre ter Stegen, the German goalkeeper, is only 22 but he is playing in the Champions League with Barcelona, Emre Can with Liverpool and Max Meyer’s goal against Maribor in December helped Schalke reach the last 16 of the Champions League. How does the top-flight experience of the England starting XI measure up? The figure is 230, the squad’s total is 389. It gives credence to the point FA chairman Greg Dyke has made about young English players not getting sufficient opportunities but when you see the impressive way they tore into Germany, it makes you wonder why some can’t break through the glass ceiling. Southgate has been deservedly praised for how he has handled things since taking over in September 2013 but a run of one defeat in 16 games — with 13 victories — is not solely down to the man in charge. Southgate was not happy with the first 25 minutes of England's match against their German counterparts . ‘We want to get the ball down and score lots of goals,’ said James Ward-Prowse, whose late goal defeated Germany. ‘It’s also down to players putting in the effort.’ Ward-Prowse is one of the luckier squad members. With 67 Barclays Premier League appearances, he was the most experienced starter against Germany and has benefited from being at Southampton, where youth is given its head. So what about the rest? Experts talk about a team’s spine but England had four players — goalkeeper Jonathan Bond, Ben Gibson, Jake Forster-Caskey and Will Hughes — in key positions who had never kicked a ball at the highest level. ‘I spoke to Oliver Bierhoff about what happened in Germany,’ John Barnes, the Liverpool and England legend, told Sportsmail two years ago. ‘The German Federation said in 2002 they needed young German players to be playing regularly for their clubs to help the national team. ‘All the clubs are German-owned, so they feel a responsibility to the national team. Bayern Munich had to be the drivers. The clubs had to go through a period of not winning anything in Europe but look at them now.’ Hughes has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs, most notably Liverpool, but nobody has taken the plunge. Skilful, elegant and thriving under Steve McClaren at Derby, he scored the goal against Croatia last October which secured England’s place at Euro 2015. Will Hughes is good enough to play in the PRemier League, despite his diminutive status . Danny Ings showcased his talents too, and he is looking likely to ply his trade away from Burnley . Jesse Lingard, who scored against Germany, is another who is benefiting from working with McClaren but the odds are against him getting regular game time at Manchester United after his loan spell. But if not United, why not somewhere else in the Premier League? Will anyone gamble on Nathan Redmond? The Norwich winger, who excelled against Germany, believes the Championship has toughened him up since his side were relegated last May and a good showing in the finals this summer will help him. Critics will argue they are not good enough or lack mental toughness but the way they played on Monday doesn’t back that up. Germany are the best team England have faced at this level since Spain at Euro 2011, when they were chasing shadows before scrambling a 1-1 draw with a late Danny Welbeck goal. The performance against Germany showed how much England have evolved and why they are genuine contenders to win the European Under 21 Championship, even if their numbers suggest they don’t have enough experience. ‘We’ve got good quality in the team,’ said Ward-Prowse. ‘The games will be different in the summer, but we can take a lot of confidence into the tournament.’","The Germany Under 21 side beaten by England U21s had 639 top-flight appearances between them: the squad’s combined number was 977 .

"By Tuesday evening, Conor McGregor will have travelled more than 13,000 miles in 10 days and visited eight countries on three continents. He has 14 weeks to prepare his challenge for the UFC featherweight title and will train for hundreds of hours before his date with destiny in Las Vegas on July 11. But he insists he will need just four minutes to dethrone champion Jose Aldo. Conor McGregor (right) stares out Jose Also ahead of their UFC world title showdown . The Irishman is confident of knocking Aldo out in the opening 'four minutes' when they meet in Vegas . McGregor and Aldo faced the media in London on Tuesday on the penultimate leg of their world tour which has taken in Rio, New York and Los Angeles among others. And the Dubliner said: 'I find the route to victory here. That's the key to victory here, when I hit people they do not survive. I map out my shot selection and put people away every time. 'Jose has got the basics down well. He's got the right hand, he's got the low kick; he can catch people but after that it's wild, it's sloppy and they escape. 'Look back at his career, you can see the shots remain the same. Then look at my career; my evolution is undeniable and I will continue to get better. McGregor did most of the talking during the press conference, insisting he was 'prepared to kill' Defending champion Jose Aldo has not been defeated in 10 years while defending his title eight times . 'He does not want it the way I want it. He doesn't want me around, he always wants separation but there will be no separation on July 11. 'I will show up prepared to kill. It will be decided in the first four minutes; he will be out on his feet. The shots I want to land will land and it will be a formality after that. How long he can take that is up to his chin. 'He has been through war after war after war, 25 minutes of getting hit. The brain does not recover, it does not get younger. I will hit him and I will hit him hard. It will be wrapped up within the first four minutes.' McGregor smiles as the pair's globetrotting tour that has visited three continents nears its end . McGregor takes in the sights from the London Eye on the penultimate stage of the world tour . McGregor also revealed he plans to dominate not just his current weight class but, in time, the lightweight division too. 'I definitely have my eyes on the lightweight division,' he added. 'I came into this company as a two-weight champion. I am the only Irishman, the only European to hold belts consecutively. 'Most certainly I'm looking to replicate that achievement on the biggest stage, the UFC. But there are plenty of featherweights who have spoken out of turn and who should have kept their name out of their mouth. 'When you speak my name in vain, no matter how many years down the line, I'm like an elephant, I never forget and I'll come and get you.' UFC president Dana White speaks at the pre-fight press conference in London . Aldo, who is unbeaten in 10 years and has made eight defences of his title, cut a quieter figure alongside his charismatic challenger. 'I don't fight for anyone else,' he said. 'I feel comfortable with this, I don't have any emotions. He can talk if he wants, he can do anything, the most important thing is to be the champion. 'I'm going to be well prepared and ready to end the fight as quickly as possible.'","Conor McGregor faces Jose Aldo for UFC featherweight title on July 11 .

"Liverpool and Manchester United met on Sunday and renewed hostilities in English football's greatest rivalry, but 100 years ago they were making headlines for all the wrong reasons in a scandal that shocked the nation. The events ultimately cost one player his life and left another broken. It was Good Friday, April 4 1915 and Britain was at war. As the two sides met, Manchester United were struggling to avoid relegation, while Liverpool were in mid-table. In an oddly tame affair, George Anderson put United 1-0 up before Liverpool defender Bob Pursell conceded a penalty yet United's Patrick O'Connell missed by some distance. Anderson added a second before Liverpool forward Fred Pagnam hit the crossbar and was seemingly chastised by teammates for trying to score. Sandy Turnbull (second row, third from right) sits next to Enoch West and Arthur Whalley sits on the left of the front row (all three are circled) The sparse 18,000 Old Trafford crowd, sensing something was awry, jeered and booed, the match referee and local reporters noted Liverpool's lack of commitment. United manager John Robson is alleged to have left the stadium in disgust. 'The second half was crammed with lifeless football,' reported The Manchester Daily Dispatch. 'United were two up with 22 minutes to play and they seemed so content with their lead that they apparently never tried to increase it. Liverpool scarcely ever gave the impression that they would be likely to score.' A fortnight later, handbills were circulated alleging that a large amount of money had been bet at odds of 7/1 on a 2–0 win to United. A suspiciously large number of bets had been made on that very scoreline causing odds to shorten to 4/1. The two points United won from the game were enough to earn them 18th place and safety. United with the three trophies they won in 1909. Turnbull is seated front right . The Sporting Chronicle published a notice from a bookmaker called 'Football King' who promised a substantial reward for information that would lead to punishment of the 'instigators of this reprehensible conspiracy'. It stated: 'We have solid grounds for believing that a certain First League match played in Manchester during Easter weekend was 'squared,' the home club being permitted to win by a certain score.' Mark Wylie, curator of the Manchester United museum, has been reflecting on the scandal this week as the 100th anniversary approaches with many questions still unanswered. 'Football was under intense scrutiny anyway, with it being wartime,' he said.' There had been so many complaints in the newspapers, in parliament, from the military, that professional football was being played while British soldiers, sailors and airmen were being killed, so the powers-that-be were anxious to see that football wasn't tarnished any further and they launched an investigation.' The Football League's lengthy delving found that players from both sides had been involved in rigging the match: Sandy Turnbull, Arthur Whalley and Enoch West of United, and Jackie Sheldon, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Thomas Fairfoul of Liverpool. United captain Charlie Roberts holding the FA Cup on the steps of Manchester Town Hall . They were accused of plotting the events during clandestine meetings at the Dog and Partridge pub in Stretford. Sheldon, a former United player, was found to be the plot's ringleader. Liverpool's Fred Pagnam and United's George Anderson had refused to take part; Pagnam had threatened to score a goal to ruin the result hence his teammates remonstrating with him when he hit the crossbar. He later testified against them and claimed Sheldon had offered him £3 in a taxi en route to the game. At the same hearing, United legend Billy Meredith denied any knowledge of the match-fixing, but said that he became suspicious when none of his teammates would pass the ball to him. Manchester United 2 Liverpool 0 (April 2, 1915) Anderson (2) MANCHESTER UNITED: Beale; Hodge, Spratt, Montgomery, O'Connell, Haywood, Meredith, Potts,  Anderson, West, Norton. Manager: Jack Robson . LIVERPOOL: Scott; Longworth, Pursell, Fairfoul, Bratley, MacKinlay, Sheldon, Banks, Pagnam, Miller,  Nicholl. Manager: Tom Watson. Attendance: 18,000. On December 23, 1915, the seven were banned from playing for life. Stockport County's Lawrence Cook, a first class Lancashire cricketer, and Manchester City's Fred Howard were also suspended for their part in placing bets. A distraught West, the only United player to have appeared in the game, protested his innocence and sued the FA for libel. 'It wasn't a glorious episode,' says Wylie. 'Players could see that football was changing. With the sport under such scrutiny amid wartime, it was pretty obvious that football in 1915/16 would be very different, if it happened at all. Summer wages were being abolished, so once you got to the end of April there would be no wages until the end of August, and it was still unclear what would happen the following season. They could see their livelihood going. That was supposed to be encouragement for players to do things for the war effort.' By the time their bans were handed down, the Football League had suspended operations for the duration of the First World War. It was suggested that if the men joined the armed forces their punishment would be rescinded. All except West, signed up. For Turnbull it was to have tragic consequences. The death certificate of Sandy Turnbull (right), featuring the memorial at Arras in France . A forward of great repute, Turnbull was a Boys' Own character who had joined United from Manchester City with Meredith. The fiesty Scot, pioneered the first footballers union and his 1909 FA Cup final winning goal prompted United's owners to build Old Trafford to herald a new dawn. Fittingly, Turnbull, who lived in Maine Road, scored United's first goal at the Theatre of Dreams. Yet following the betting scandal and facing a life without football, Turnbull went to war. Sadly, on May 3 1917, at the age of 33, Lance Sergeant Sandy Turnbull was killed during a muddled, unsuccessful night attack on German lines just east of Arras, France. His body was never found. He left a widow, Florence, and four young children. The FA gave him a posthumous reinstatement. All the other players, except West, had their bans lifted by the FA in 1919 in recognition of their service to the country. West, who had been good friends with Turnbull, had continued to fight a different battle, one to clear his name. In February 1916, when United and Liverpool played in a regional match, he took to standing outside Old Trafford handing out handbills: '£50 reward. To all whom it may concern: I, Enoch James West (late Manchester United), offer the above sum to be given to any Red Cross Fund if any person or persons can prove that I bet or won any money in any way over the match at Old Trafford, Manchester United v. Liverpool, on Good Friday, 1915, the said match over which I got suspended. (Signed) Enoch James West, 68 Railway Road, Old Trafford. West twice unsuccessfully attempted to sue the FA for libel and in 1918 was caught and banned again for playing under an assumed name for a club in Ireland. He was eventually pardoned under a general amnesty in 1945, by which time he was aged 59. He had served the longest ban in football and maintained his innocence until his death in 1965. His family carried on his fight. A book entitled 'Free the Manchester United One' by Graham Sharpe pleaded Enoch's case. On publishing, Sharpe said: 'I am confident that at the very least, I have established that there is little or no genuine evidence which can be interpreted as conclusive proof of the guilt of Enoch West as he was charged.' West's great grandson, Graham West, said: 'I would just like to set the record straight, Enoch 'Knocker' West was wrongly accused of match fixing and he protested his innocence till his death bed. Having been accused of this, it broke his heart, all he lived for was football. He died a broken man thanks to these accusations that were never proved.' Sadly, the full truth may now never be known.

"Mark Cavendish has issued a typically blunt assessment of the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report into past practices of doping and suggested Lance Armstrong's charity return to the Tour de France 'could be done in a different environment'. CIRC was established to investigate whether the UCI, cycling's world governing body, was complicit in past doping practices, such as the Armstrong affair, which saw the American stripped of his seven Tour titles and banned for life. Some of the reports findings were scathing but, according to 2011 world champion and 25-time Tour stage winner Cavendish, little was revelatory. Mark Cavendish says there were few revelations in the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report . The 25-time Tour de France stage winner said the report was 'all the s*** that's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document' Cavendish, speaking after announcing he'll compete in August's Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic, said: 'To be brutally honest, I don't really think there's anything new in there. 'There's all the s*** that's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document. 'People talk about the past of cycling like it's the present. It's a little bit frustrating; that would be an understatement. 'As long as cycling's cleaning up and I'm racing in a fair playing field in a sport I love, then I'll continue to be happy with that.' One unnamed but 'respected' professional cyclist told CIRC that 90 per cent of the professional peloton continues to dope, while another reported the figure was 20 per cent. Cavendish doesn't see much use in the report, commissioned by new UCI president Brian Cookson . Cavendish did not confirm if he had read the report in full or just the media dispatches which followed its publication earlier this month. He did not speak to CIRC and was unaware that riders could approach the commission to share their views. Asked if he felt the report represented the views of the modern peloton, Cavendish said: 'Absolutely not. I really don't. I wasn't asked at all to say anything. 'Ninety-five per cent of the peloton will know the one rider who will have said certain comments and the other five per cent won't have raced or known that rider, so couldn't comment on it. 'I think certain quotes from unreliable sources don't really mean anything and completely warp the sense of the whole process.'

"When 50-year-old Consuela Ross went for a walk on the banks of Loch Ness with her daughter and granddaughter, she was simply hoping to photograph some of the stunning scenery. But now she is claiming to have witnessed the latest glimpse of the fabled monster that dwells in its depths as it came to the surface for air. However, despite having her camera in her hand she says she was too captivated to take a picture, and instead only managed to record the moment after the beast dived under the surface. Tourists taking pictures of Loch Ness swear they spotted the elusive monster that lurks in its depths, but were too mesmerised to photograph it, instead capturing the moment after it dived under (pictured) Consuela Ross, 50 (left), was visiting the Loch with daughter Reyshell Avellanoza, 29 (centre), and granddaughter Heather Elizabeth, five (right), when they made the sighting. Husband Campbell Ross, 74 (centre), was waiting in the car park at the time . A video taken at the time shows a mysterious circle of disturbed water spreading outwards from the centre of the lake, which Mrs Ross swears was occupied by the beast moments earlier. Miss Ross was walking beside the lake with daughter Reyshell Avellanoza, 29, and granddaughter Heather Elizabeth, both from the Philippines, when the incident happened. The family had spent the day visiting nearby Urquhart Castle with Mrs Ross's husband, Campbell Ross, 73, when they decided to drive to the lake. Mr Ross stayed in the car while the others went to the water's edge, when Heather, who was seeing the Loch for the first time, pointed out a strange shape. Earlier this year Swedish monster-hunter Bjarne Sjöstrand, 52, won a £2,000 prize in a Nessie spotting competition after picking out a strange object on satellite images . Another sighting: International paranormal investigator, Jonathan Bright, took this photo three years ago, which he claims shows Nessie's head emerging from the Loch . Consuela told the Daily Record: 'She said it looked like a big black belly. We looked and could see this big disturbance quite a way out and this big black object in the middle of it. 'We were so mesmerised, we didn't immediately think of taking pictures although we had the cameras in our hands. 'By the time we realised what we were seeing and began filming and snapping away, the object had sank virtually out of sight and moved away further into the loch, leaving behind a perfect circle of water - like a whirlpool.' Earlier this year Swedish monster-hunter Bjarne Sjöstrand, 52, won a £2,000 prize in a Nessie spotting competition after picking out a strange object on satellite images. Mr Sjöstrand, who has never visited Scotland, won the best Loch Ness Monster sighting of 2014, in an annual competition run by bookmaker William Hill. In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast. A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . The systems administrator was at home in Stockholm when he spotted a long thin object in the water on a Google Earth image taken above Horse Shoe Scree on the loch's southern side. Mr Sjöstrand said: 'I am very interested in anything regarding Nessie and the history of Loch Ness. 'The reason I found this image on Google Earth was that I was sitting one night at home reading about Nessie and Loch Ness on the internet and thought I would check to see if I could see something from above - and that proved to turn out well. 'I have never been to Scotland but my hopes are that one day I will visit Loch Ness.' The picture is the latest in a series of possible Loch Ness Monster pictures. In November MailOnline reported that grainy footage had emerged showing a long and thin shape swaying in the water - one that bears a striking resemblance to Nessie’s fabled slender neck. The video shows the object waving in the choppy water, around 500ft from the loch’s shore. It was captured by Richard Collis – who counts himself amongst the most ardent Nessie cynics after years of fishing on the waters without a sighting. But the tree planter was so taken aback by the mysterious shape he noticed while driving along the edge of the loch that he filmed it on his iPhone, and believes he might have stumbled upon the real deal. 'As I was watching, I was thinking what the hell is that?’ said Mr Collis, 58, who noticed the shape while travelling around a mile from Fort Augustus at the south-west end of Loch Ness. He added: ‘I don’t really believe in anything like that until I see it.' An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathon's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.

For while Gus Poyet may have vowed to fight on in the wake of Saturday’s 4-0 humiliation at home to Aston Villa, Monday’s dismissal as head coach of Sunderland would have come as a mighty relief. Poyet has long since lost faith in his vision for Sunderland. Frustrated by the influence of sporting director Lee Congerton in transfers, he was left with a dysfunctional team made up of players signed by both himself and the club hierarchy. Gus Poyet was sacked as Sunderland manager on Monday with the club one point above the relegation zone .

Sunderland fans turned on manager Poyet (bottom left) during the defeat by  Villa on Saturday afteroon . VIDEO Poyet sacked as Sunderland manager . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. Some of Poyet’s press-conference outbursts distanced him from the personnel on the pitch and were not well received at boardroom level. ‘I am not going to be a head coach when it suits and a manager when it doesn’t,’ he said in December. ‘It is clear what we need to do. That is down to recruitment. So, if you ever get the chance to speak to anyone on the recruitment side and ask them about it, you are lucky. If you don’t, don’t ask me.’ Such comments would not have been tolerated at other clubs and Congerton informed owner Ellis Short that Poyet was not the man to take them forward. Poyet grew particularly disillusioned during January and when he let coach Charlie Oatway take a pre-match and half-time team talk there was a feeling he had lost interest. Subsequent team selections left players and senior figures baffled - four central midfielders named in the starting XI versus Hull, who play with wing-backs, being the most alarming example. Poyet had lost his faith in his vision for Sunderland and was fed up sporting director Lee Congerton (centre) Poyet advised his son Diego to sign for West Ham last July rather than join him at the Stadium of Light . But the players should not escape criticism, either. This is the third manager, following Martin O’Neill and Paolo Di Canio, who has been sacked with the core of the current squad on the books. They have fought relegation during the past two seasons and have survived despite falling short of 40 points on each occasion. The squad has gone stale and so had Poyet. He did not think the players were good enough to implement the attractive football he craved. Certainly, not once was there any evidence of such a brand of play during his 17 months in charge. Tellingly, the Uruguayan also advised his son Diego to sign for West Ham last July rather than join him at the Stadium of Light. Then there was his failure to promote from within the club’s academy, a major source of contention among staff who work with the youngsters. Indeed, they were miffed at the sight of assistant boss Mauricio Taricco joining in first-team sessions rather than sending for one of their players. But Poyet’s refusal to entertain academy prospects - not one such player started a game during his tenure - was symptomatic of his loss of love for the project on Wearside. Results, if not performances, were always just enough - 14 draws this season - to keep talk of a crisis in the background. Poyet was appointed by Sunderland in October 2013 following the sacking of Paolo Di Canio . But discord and discontent rumbled all the while and only now is it all being laid bare after the situation unravelled on the pitch in such shambolic fashion at the weekend. Poyet’s behaviour in the dressing-room on Saturday did little to convince the players he was scrapping for his and their survival. For Poyet no longer wanted to be at the club and the key powerbrokers no longer wanted him there, either. His sacking was the best outcome for all parties. HULL . Chelsea (Home) - March 22 .

"Police officers on Merseyside are on alert for Sunday's crunch clash between Liverpool and Manchester United after a number of well-known United hooligans saw their banning orders expire. The match between the two fierce rivals, which carries the highest security risk rating, kicks-off at Anfield at 1.30pm. Along with the usual bragging rights, this season it also features the added tension of both sides being in direct competition for a Champions League spot. Police officers on Merseyside are on alert for Sunday's clash between Liverpool and Manchester United . And it is understood around half-a-dozen known United troublemakers are free to go to the game after orders preventing them from going to matches ended last year. United will take around 3,000 followers to Liverpool. While police are happy with the early kick-off time, they are aware of the various elements which could potentially turn things ugly but remain confident they can deal with any situations. In November, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) deployed around 400 officers for the Manchester derby, which the previously-banned hooligans were also able to attend. United earned a 3-0 win in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford in which Wayne Rooney scored the opener . Raheem Sterling had several opportunities to score for his team, but failed to find the net last December . While the match passed without major incidents of disorder a large-scale brawl was captured on a mobile phone video more than 90 minutes after the final whistle. There, a number of United fans fought with City supporters outside a pub close to the Etihad Stadium, setting off a flare and hurling bottles. Police said fans used chairs and wooden poles as weapons amid chaotic scenes. Five men were later arrested, while a man thought to be a City fan lay motionless on the ground after being punched and kicked in the head. He later declined hospital treatment. When Liverpool played United at Old Trafford in December the match, which ended 3-0 to the home side, passed with a small number of arrests.

"Putting your thumb up  is a recognised hand signal the world over, and the ultimate sign of approval. So it was a good choice of gesture for Elle-Rose Williams, 25, and her fiancé Paddy Moogan, 30, to pick as their go-to pose while on an around-the-world trip. The couple  documented their mammoth journey, spanning months and continents, by capturing photographs of their thumbs in front of landmarks, skyscrapers, beautiful scenery and historical monuments. Scroll down for video . A view from a cliff in Christchurch, New Zealand, during the first leg of the couple's world tour . Thumbs up outside The Louvre in Paris, despite a rainy day. No landmark was left unphotographed . Elle, a social media manager and travel blogger from London told MailOnline: 'It started as just a fun way to record where we'd been, whenever we saw something gorgeous or memorable we'd take a photo of a thumbs up in front of it. 'As we travelled more it became a running joke, and we'd make sure we did it everywhere we visited.' The duo's  adventure kicked off in New Zealand two years ago. After living in Queenstown for six months they visited Australia before passing through Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and the USA, thumbs at the ready. This time in San Francisco in USA during a day trip to see The Golden Gate Bridge . View of Las Vagas by night from the The Foundation Room roof top bar of Mandalay Bay Hotel . Commenting on the aesthetics of the thumb photos Ellie, who writes the blog The World and Then Some says: 'They aren’t great photos. They’re not artistic. They’re not even lit properly in most cases. But they tell our story. They show where we’ve been and how far we’ve come.' With so much time in front of the camera, the couple's thumbs have won  attention online. Elle describes the The Grand Palace in Bangkok as 'one of the most beautiful places I've ever been' On a cold day in Central Park in New York Ellie and Paddy's gesture still takes centre stage . To date, they've been photographed front of the The Louvre in Paris, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, The Grand Palace in Bangkok, Central Park in New York, the Harbour Bridge in Sydney, The Grand Canyon and Notre Dame, also in Paris. Elle says, 'My favourite photo is the one we took in NYC at Christmas time (its the darkly lit one, with a Christmas tree in the background).

'It was taken moments after Pad proposed to me, in the exact spot it happened. Which might be the most 'thumbs up' moment of my life so far.' 'We get married next year - so of course I'm hoping to get a photo of us after saying 'I do' with the wedding rings included!' 'I think the photos sum us up as a couple, we're very laid back, happy and just take things as they come.' Sometimes a landmark deserved a full body shot.

"It may lay claim to being the 'Happiest Place on Earth', a magical kingdom ruled by fairytale princesses and the like, but even Disneyland was still built with bricks, mortar and hard graft. The only theme park to have been completely overseen by Walt Disney himself, Disneyland Park, celebrates 60 years in 2015 and extensive celebrations are planned. A time-lapse video from the Disney archives reveals how the park, which forms half of the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, was built from nothing before its opening on July 17, 1955. Sleeping Beauty Castle at the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California, emerges from scaffolding . The castle at the first Fantasyland, with imitations at all other parks since, in Disneyland in Anaheim . The fun park, the only one of its kind to be fully overseen by Walt Disney, opened on July 17, 1955 . The site was bought in 1953 with construction beginning in 1954 and the grand opening the year after that . The Rocket to the Moon is lifted into place in front of the futuristic Tomorrowland attraction . From an expanse of brown dirt, iconic features such as Tomorrowland's Rocket to the Moon are raised into place while Sleeping Beauty Castle emerges like a turbo episode of Grand Designs. Other original features rising from the earth include the Main Street Train Station's clock tower, the shell for jungle-themed Adventureland and rocky Old West throwback Frontierland. Looking down Main Street USA to the original Fantasyland, Sleeping Beauty's Castle forms perhaps the most iconic image of the park, which emerges like a mini-town in Orange County. Later years have seen the introduction of New Orleans Square in 1966, Critter Country in 1972 and Mickey's Toontown in 1993, followed by an entirely new Disney California Adventure Park in 2001 - together they are now known as Disneyland Resort. The view down Main Street USA as final building and cosmetic works are completed in 1955 . What Main Street looks like today as millions continue to stream through the gates every year . The time-lapse video of the creation of Disneyland looks like a turbo version of Grand Designs . While the idea had been in his thoughts for some time, Walt Disney didn't muck about with the making of the park - purchasing a 160-acre site in 1953, beginning construction in 1954 and opening the year later. Although it was supposed to have been unveiled in a press preview day with about 14,000 invitees on Sunday, July 17, 1955, that opening saw 28,000 people go through the gates due to thousands of counterfeit ticket sales. The whole affair was televised and not a good look for the company, with a series of bloopers during the coverage by ABC Television, who partly funded the project. Main Street USA is an expanse of dirt as a mini-town emerges in Orange County, California . The first thousands of guests flood through the gates at Disneyland, the original Disney fun park . Far from the fantasy Walt  would have hoped for it was labelled internally as 'Black Sunday' after a number of operational mishaps that range from chaotic queues to a gas leak in Fantasyland that closed Fantasyland, Frontierland and Adventureland for the afternoon. But it was merely a minor setback for what is now Disney's Parks and Resorts division which now overseas Anaheim's Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort in Floria, Tokyo Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, a fleet of cruise liners and a host of hotels. And just like the end of this timelapse, which show the first guests arriving in Anaheim, millions continue to flood through the turnstiles - more than 130 million a year, in fact.","Disneyland in California celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2015 .

"Women are grossly underrepresented in professional football, both in terms of TV coverage of female games and in the number of women working in the male section of the sport. Those that do venture into men's football are often subjected to regular abuse - according to the campaign group Women In Football, two thirds of females working in the industry have been on the receiving end of sexual harassment. So a female lineswoman who was filmed talking back to the Ponte Preta footballer Biro Biro during the Campeonato Paulista match on Sunday has been heralded a hero by fellow members of her sex. Scroll down for video . Tatiane approaches Ponte Preta footballer Biro Biro to argue back against a criticism he had about one of her decisions . During the match between Sao Paulo and Ponte Preta, lineswoman Tatiane Sacilotti is seen to signal a throw-in. But Biro Biro is not happy with the decision and heads over to Tatiane to give her a dressing down. Unimpressed with the attack, Tatiane takes it upon herself to follow Biro back down the pitch, arguing back furiously. Shocked by the comeback, Biro then walks off with a wave of his hand, so Tatiane heads back to her post with a fuming backwards glance. The clip has since been shared hundreds of times on social network sites. @CANNCDavis wrote on Twitter 'Looool Tatiane Sacilotti has made my day she was not having it.' Another said: 'Brazilian lineswoman puts abusive player back in his box.' Tatiane is furious as she follows Biro Biro up the pitch . As Biro Biro is shocked into heading back onto the pitch, Tatiane heads back to her post, shooting a glowering look back at her opponent . It isn't the first time in recent years that a lineswoman has been headline news. In January 2011, TV commentators Andy Gray and Richard Keys, who apparently believed their microphones were switched off, were recorded making disparaging remarks about Sian Massey, 25, before Liverpool’s Premiership clash with Wolves. Commenting on Ms Massey, Mr Keys said: ‘Somebody better get down there and explain offside to her.’ Mr Gray, a former Scottish international footballer, replied: ‘Can you believe that? A female linesman. Women don’t know the offside rule.’ Mr Keys replied: ‘Course they don’t. I can guarantee you there will be a big one today. 'Kenny (Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish) will go potty. This isn’t the first time, is it? Didn’t we have one before?’ Gray’s contract was immediately terminated by Sky Sports' managing director Barney Francis for unacceptable behaviour, while Keys resigned soon after. Name: Tatiane Sacilotti Dos Santos Camargo . Born: Brazil, February 10, 1986 . Age: 29 . Job title: Assistant referee . Tatiana faced much abuse during her junior years as a referee, including being spat at by fans. By 2011, she had graduated to the premier league in Brazil though, where she has stayed ever since. Tatiana's dream is to work up the career ladder at FIFA and her idol is the Brazilian referee Luis Flavio de Oliveira. To substitute her income as a referee, Tatiane has launched a pancake delivery service with her mother Antoinette called House of Pancake, which sells 29 different recipes. The family, who are descended from Italians, run the company together - Tatiane and her mother make the pancakes and her father and brother deliver the produce. When she is not busy with one of her jobs, Tatiane is deeply religious and regularly attends church in Cachoeira. She also exercises daily with a personal trainer, where she does circuit training and runs eight km. Speaking of her parents' reaction to her training as a referee, she told refnews.com: 'She supported me at the time. 'My mother does not even like football but she watches all of my games and requires complete silence in the room and bites her nails. 'She gets mad when they say I messed up, but she does not know whether it was right or wrong. 'Her support has been very good.' Although she is well respected in the game, Tatiane continues to suffer abuse from men in the game occasionally. During one incident in 2013, a footballer complained about one of her decisions and assaulted her. Tatiane said: 'He complained much of a marking mine. 'I asked him to calm down and put a hand on his chest. 'Then he slapped me, but it was light, not reported to the referee.'","Tatiane Sacilotti was working a match between Sao Paulo and Ponte Preta .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is confident fatigue will not hamper their bid for a top-four place despite an arduous season so far. European commitments and a run to the semi-final of the Capital One Cup, in addition to their continued involvement in the FA Cup, means the Reds have played 46 matches this season. That is already three more than in the whole of the previous campaign, which saw them fall agonisingly short of winning the Premier League.

Martin Skrtel works on his fitness and conditioning with Liverpool coach Ryland Morgans (left) Liverpool pair Lazar Markovic (left) and Dejan Lovren strike a pose during the training esssion . Such a toll manifested itself in a sluggish performance last weekend in a goalless FA Cup quarter-final at home to Blackburn - their third match in six days including an early-morning return from Turkey. However, with an eight-day break, during which the players were given some much-needed time off, Rodgers believes they will be firing on all cylinders on his return to former club Swansea on Monday. 'Our last performance against Blackburn was at the end of a real tough period of games,' said the manager. 'I've seen all the numbers and all the statistics on it and, physically, it was the lowest we have been for this season. Now we're re-energised and refreshed mentally and physically. 'We go into a run of games now, starting with Swansea, and we feel we can go in and push on in terms of our level of performance again. We know it will be tough. 'It's that period of the season where you taper your training. You don't need to be as long in your training and preparation as the players have got a real good level of fitness, so it's more explosive and more intensive, but in shorter blocks. 'The players have been brilliant this week. They're looking really sharp, looking really confident and we just want to continue with our sequence of performances and good results.'

They are now only seven points off second place but Rodgers knows with Manchester United - whom they play next weekend - to catch and Tottenham and Southampton chasing them there is still plenty of work to do. 'I think it's going to be very tight, of course,' he said. 'We've rejoined the race for that in the last three months and everything counts in the games. 'We just need to ensure we continue to be aggressive in our game and give everything that we have between now and the end of the season.

We're in a good moment, but we respect it'll be a very difficult game at Swansea.'","Brendan Rodgers confident of avoiding fatigue in Premier League run-in .

The man entered a bank branch just before 4pm in Weintraubengasse in the 2nd district yesterday afternoon, walked straight over to the cashier and demanded  money. He seemed to be under the impression that the spoon would be mistaken for a knife, reports The Local. The cashier pretended he was going to get some cash and instead called the police. The man sat down in the waiting area and was still sat there patiently when police found and arrested him. Witnesses told the English language newspaper that no one took the man seriously.

Floyd Mayweather could earn $180m from his May 2 fight with Manny Pacquiao given the huge public interest . Pacquiao will receive 40 per cent of the purse, which could hit $120m on projected record pay-per-view buys . Mayweather laughs while watching the Los Angeles Lakers take on the Boston Celtics . Those figures are based on Arum's firm expectation that this, the richest fight of all time, will not just break the pay-per-view record in America – but double it. He says: 'We are looking at four to five million buys. The interest is amazing, even from people who do not follow boxing, even people who don't follow any sports. 'Wherever you go everyone is talking about this fight.' They are also bending his ear for tickets in the 16,000-capacity MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 2. Arum has already told a host of A-list celebrities: 'No comps this time. The demand is so huge that the only answer is everyone has to pay.' The only free ticket promised by Arum is for female UFC star Ronda Rousey, who he heard was preparing to spend all her career fight winnings thus far on a seat as close to ringside as that amount could buy. Promoter Bob Arum believes there will be between 'four and five million buys' of the fight on May 2 . Arum has only promised one free ticket to the Las Vegas showdown - to UFC star Ronda Rousey . Pacquiao, pictured working out in Minila, has already started preparing for his fight with Mayweather . Tickets are expected to be priced from the lowest at $1,250 to upwards of $6,000 for a seat at ringside. But it is unlikely any at all will go on general sale. Purchases may well be restricted to those holding a $250,000 credit line, or higher, at the MGM group of casinos on the Strip. Although there will of course be a thriving black market at eye-watering prices. Speaking at an ESPN fights night in New York state, Arum said: 'One guy offered me a hundred grand for a ticket.' Then he joked: 'I told him he could have my seat for $200,000.' The double-up factor will begin with the Grand Garden taking $40m at the box office, compared with the previous high-mark of $20m for Mayweather v Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in September 2013. But it is the pay-per-view TV sales – with rival networks HBO and Showtime sharing the broadcast – which will generate most of the revenue. The record number of buys stands at 2.4m for Mayweather v Oscar De La Hoya eight years ago. Oscar De La Hoya's fight with Mayweather in 2007 holds the record for the most pay-per-view buys at 2.4m . Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau in November last year . Mayweather's last fight came when he beat Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas in September 2014 . Naturally the charge has risen substantially since then, probably to $99.95 per subscription. Thus Arum's five million buys – along with such ancillary income as TV rights overseas, including Britain - would make this 'The Half-Billion Dollar Fight'. That would generate $200m to be shared among the likes of the local broadcasting stations, the MGM hosts, the promoters, the undercard fighters and so on. As for the $300m to the two best pound-for-pound boxers in the world, Arum says: 'Floyd loves cars and he could buy so many as to satisfy very dealer in Las Vegas. A lot of Manny's money is going to charity in the Philippines.' Each to his own – and the Las Vegas sports books are bracing themselves for seven-figure bets on Mayweather, the favourite, and Pacquiao, the under-dog.","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao will meet in Las Vegas on May 2 .
The boxers have been expected to share a purse of $250m in a 60-40 split .
But pay-per-view sales could add another $50m to the fight's pot .

"He's about to make the biggest move of his life, trading his long career with Liverpool FC for US club Los Angeles Galaxy. And Steven Gerrard looks just about ready to live in the lap of luxury when he relocates to the West coast of the States this summer with his family. One sprawling Malibu mansion the footballer has reportedly viewed with wife Alex and children has been unveiled, an outstanding property overlooking the ocean which used to belong to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster. Scroll down for video . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard and his family are set to move into this sprawling mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean when he relocates to Los Angeles to play for LA Galaxy in June . Gerrard (left) with his daughters and wife Alex are looking forward to their big move later this year . The Liverpool captain is set to end his 17-year career with the club at the end of the season . The 34-year-old (right) will be leaving his boyhood side for LA Galaxy on an 18-month deal in early June . The family will reside in Los Angeles for 18 months while he plays out his contract with the team, and although it's a long way from his home in Merseyside, there's no doubt the family will feel incredibly comfortable in the not-so-humble abode. Reportedly worth $25m - £16.8m - the luxurious pad is said to have been offered to the midfielder, 34, by his new football club, who'll foot the $20,000 a week (£13,400) rent over the 18-month period he's signed to the team. Steven, along with his model wife Alex, 32, and their daughters Lilly-Ella, ten, eight-year-old Lexie and Lourdes, three, are already said to be building themselves a £3million five-bedroom house on a two-acre site in an upscale area in Merseyside. But that doesn't much compare to their potential American property, which they could be set to move into in early June after the sportsman's long and illustrious career with Liverpool comes to an end in late May. With six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, the swanky property also boasts sweeping mountain and Pacific Ocean views and was regularly featured on reality show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Yolanda Foster and her music producer husband David had the modern property custom-built to their taste in 2009, and resided there with the 51-year-old star's three children, including model Gigi Hadid. The property, reportedly worth £16.8m, includes six bedrooms, nine bathrooms and plenty of  living space . Gerrard's new home is just a short 15 minutes from beach-perfect Santa Monica . Gerrard will be able to enjoy a spot of billiards in his games area - which comes complete with a bar . Located in the resplendent area of Carbon Canyon in Malibu, near to Los Angeles International Airport and just a short 15 minutes from beach-perfect Santa Monica, it seems the Gerrard family will have lots to keep them occupied over the next year and a half. The large house also includes separate exercise, massage and sauna areas inside, and also a magnificent infinity pool outside. There's a sizable barbecue area too, and a garage big enough for three cars, housed in its own private orchards of citrus and avocado trees. The stylish home also includes a screening room for those big-movie moments, and a 'sports room', with a full-sized billiards table and bar, for when Steven wants to forget about football after work and let his proverbial hair down. The house is perfect for entertaining, and US reality star Yolanda had a professional chef’s kitchen build with a custom floor-to-ceiling glass refrigerator. One of the bedrooms in particular opens up into a stunning panorama of the ocean . Gerrard (left) will be hoping to end his Liverpool career on a high by winning the FA Cup this season . Gerrard follows in David Beckham's footsteps who played for LA Galaxy between 2007-2012 . In the official pictures of the impressive property, it is clear it's finished to an incredibly high standard, a combination of both contemporary and classic design, with a deluxe Californian and certainly Hollywood-style vibe. It's going to be a huge adjustment process for both Steven and his family, but he's not the first British footballer to make such a move: David Beckham famously left Madrid to play with LA Galaxy back in 2007, and he moved his entire family out to Los Angeles for the job. The MLS team recently confirmed Steven's signing following his decision to turn down the offer of a contract extension and leave Liverpool after 17 years with his beloved team. 'Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years,' he said on confirming his move. 'I'm not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I'm going over there to win, and if I win and play well, then my life becomes more enjoyable. 'There's obviously a bonus of where the LA Galaxy are located as well. That will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different.' Gerrard scored twice from the penalty spot during Liverpool's Foundation charity match on Sunday . And a senior Galaxy official confirmed: 'The club is helping Steven and Alex with every imaginable aspect of their family move and we are obviously hoping to get them settled as soon as possible.' Alex returned to Liverpool last month after jetting to Los Angeles in search of a new home for her, her husband and their adorable girls. Tweeting shortly before she returned, she wrote: 'Last day in LA coming home tonight !! VIlla Blanca for lunch then last few bits of shopping, looking forward to seeing my man and girls.' And it seems like the move can't come quick enough for the Gerrard family. Alex, who has been married to the footballer since 2007, recently tweeted her disdain for the typical British rain, something she surely won't miss when moving to sunny California in June. 'Wish this rain would do one !!!' she wrote on Twitter while watching her man play in the All-Star Charity match at Liverpool's Anfield on Sunday. MailOnline has contacted a representative for Steven Gerrard and is awaiting comment. Gerrard and wife Alex, pictured last year in Ibiza, are excited to be moving to sunshine-drenched California .","Steven Gerrard will be leaving Liverpool at the end of the season .

"Former Newcastle United striker Faustino Asprilla handed an aircraft pilot a bottle so he would not have to leave his co-pilot alone if he needed to go to the toilet mid-flight. The Colombian-born football star was after boarding a flight in Moscow when he approached the flight deck. He told his 102,000 followers on Instagram that he expressed his fears to the pilot as a result of the recent Germanwings tragedy where pilot Andreas Lubitz crashed his jet into the Alps. Former Newcastle striker Faustino Asprilla (left) claims he ordered a pilot to remain in cockpit during flight . Sitting on an aircraft, Asprilla told his followers: 'I went to the pilot's cabin. I strictly forbid the pilot to get out and urinate because if that other lunatic locks the door in, it will happen what happened in that other flight. Everyone knows. 'If he wants to urinate, I have him an empty bottle of water.' Asprilla played for Newcastle United between 1996 and 1998, although manager Kenny Dalglish had problems with the Colombian's playboy lifestyle. Earlier, Asprilla tweeted a photograph of himself looking nervous in an airport departure lounge with an aircraft over his shoulder. Faustino Asprilla told his 100,000 Instagram followers that he warned an airline pilot against taking a mid-flight toilet break during his recent flight. The former Newcastle United star gave the pilot a bottle instead. Asprilla joined Newcastle from Italian club Parma and returned after his two-year stay on Tyneside. However, the club is facing serious problems, having been officially declared bankrupt while their chairman Giampietro Maneti was arrested for money laundering. The club faces debts of £60 million.

"David Beckham has lifted the lid on his son Brooklyn's first date, in which the former Manchester United midfielder watched on from a nearby table in a London restaurant. Speaking to James Corden on the Late Late Show in America, Beckham told the hilarious story of his 16-year-old son's first foray into the world of dating. When probed by Corden, who asked, 'He must be getting quite big into the dating circuit now?', Beckham said: ''Yeah, it's happening. He's going to hate me for this. David Beckham embarrassed his son Brooklyn on James Corden's Late Late Show in America . Brooklyn watched on from the audience as his father told the story of his first date, at a sushi bar in London . Beckham was a guest on Corden's show, alongside Claire Danes (second left) and Bob Odenkirk (right) 'I'm fine with it, because on his first date - when he was about 14 and a half - it was Valentine's Day so he said, ""I'd love to take this girl to dinner."" 'I said, ""Okay, great."" I spoke to Victoria, and she was like, ""Really?"", so I said, ""Yeah, he's going to do it."" 'She said, ""Okay, make sure you take him and then make sure you sit in the restaurant."" So I was like, ""Really, you're going to make me do that?"" and she said ""Yeah, that's the only way I'm going to let him go.""' Brooklyn is looking to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a professional footballer . Beckham's affection for his son is clear; he posted this on Brooklyn's 16th birthday at the start of March . 'So we took him to a small sushi restaurant and he sat at the sushi bar and I sat about five tables back. By the way, my daughter is four years old. When she gets to that age, I will be closer than that!' Beckham's son Brooklyn, who was sat in the audience as his dad retold the embarrassing story, is aiming to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a professional footballer. This season, he has been playing for Arsenal's Under 16s but was recently dealt a blow with the news that the Gunners will not hand him a new deal at the end of the season.

'A couple of years ago, you know what kids are like, they want new sneakers, they want new soccer boots,' Beckham told Corden. 'It came to the point where he turned 14, 14 and a half, and I thought ""If you want something, then go and work and you've got your own money"". 'It got to the stage where I was like, ""Okay, if you wanna buy some new stuff, or new boots or new trainers, then if you're working for them then you can afford them yourself"".

"Who says cats hate water? Jaguar this week launched its new, second-generation XF compact sports saloon with a high-wire drive over water on cables just an inch thick. In a stunt worthy of the latest Bond film Spectre — for which the firm is supplying many of the cars — the XF was revealed in a dramatic stunt in the heart of London's Docklands. High over the Royal Dock in Canary Wharf, stuntman Jim Dowdell — a veteran of the Bond, Bourne and Indiana Jones films — drove the car 240 metres across wires to demonstrate the car's lightweight aluminium construction and agility. Don't look down! Jaguar's new XF seen crossing London's Royal Dock by high wire this week . Excitement aside, Jaguar's XF sport saloon promises 'business class' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines. It's being built at Jaguar Land Rover's Castle Bromwich factory in Birmingham alongside the allaluminium F-Type sports car and top-of-the-range XJ limousine. Its official global debut is at the New York motor show on April 1 before going on sale in the autumn from £30,000 to £80,000. Jaguar's XF sport saloon (pictured) promises 'business class' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines . The new version is 80kg lighter than its closest competitor. This helps it return more than 70 mpg with CO2 emissions of 104g/km. Engines include 163bhp and 180bhp 2-litre Ingenium diesels linked to six-speed manual and eight-speed automatic gearboxes. The manual 163bhp diesel is 'the lightest, most efficient non-hybrid diesel model in its market segment,' says Jaguar. All other engines are eightspeed automatics. There is also a powerful 3-litre 300bhp V6 twinturbo diesel and a 3-litre 380 bhp V6 supercharged petrol engine. The proportions have also been tweaked. While 7mm shorter and 3mm lower than its predecessor, its wheelbase is 51mm longer, meaning more back seat space, legroom and headroom. Jaguar is investing £600 million in its manufacturing capacity in Britain, £400million at its Castle Bromwich plant. Great to see Britain's former 'Motown' — Coventry, once the capital of our motor industry — getting some bumper good news this week. The city that for decades has built the iconic London taxi is to gain a new factory, costing £250million, creating up to 1,000 jobs and building up to 36,000 vehicles a year. Chinese motor giant Geely , which bought the UK firm outright two years ago after holding a stake since 2006, said the state-of the-art research, development and assembly plant for the London Taxi Company will be built in the city of Lady Godiva (and Peeping Tom). It is a tenfold increase on the company's site, which has been home to London taxis for 70 years and heralds the introduction of the next generation electric and ultralow emission London black cab. Coventry's links with China go back a long way after it had the foresight in the early Eighties to twin itself with the Chinese city of Jinan in Shandong province. What the two cities had in common was silk: Jinan is at the end of the Silk Road and Coventry — before the rise of the motor industry — was a centre for the finest silk-working. The Chinese think long-term and have an important concept called guanxi — or social connections — which help smooth business. Coventry was early to establish these vital connections. Looks like it's paying off. April should put a spring in the step of outdoor touring types as order books open for the new generation of Audi's epic seven-seat luxury sport utility vehicle the Q7. But you'll have to wait until August for first deliveries. In April order books open for the new generation of Audi's epic seven-seat luxury sport utility vehicle the Q7 (pictured) Priced from £50,340 to £53,835, it will be available at launch with a 272 bhp V6 TDI engine. A 218bhp 3.0 TDI Quattro is expected to follow in late summer 2015. And finally ... what possible future could there be for a loud, middle-aged, overweight, motormouth petrolhead who's originally from 'up North', is always behind the wheel of some fancy car or other, divides opinion, drives everyone nuts and is not even that funny? Wonder if I should apply for that vacant Top Gear slot now that whatsisname's gone and got the sack?","The stunt was worthy of the latest James Bond film, Spectre .

"Not to be outdone by Tom Brady leaping off a cliff, adrenaline junkie DeAndre Levy can add wing-walking to his nerve-jangling offseason exploits. Last year the Detroit Lions linebacker hiked in Macchu Picchu for five days, swam with sharks in South Africa and boarded down - and crashed on - an active Nicaraguan volcano. But the 28-year-old hit new heights in a biplane, leaving the cockpit to clamber along the aircraft before the pilot spins the plane 180 degrees at approximately 3,500 feet.

"Richard Kilty tiptoes to the front door of his old home, careful not to muddy his new trainers. It is semi-derelict and the windows are boarded up, soon to be demolished as this notoriously tough Stockton-on-Tees council estate is redeveloped. A man repairing a garage roof warns our photographer to conceal his camera but there is barely a soul about. 'It still gets eventful on the evenings,' says Kilty, pointing out a black gate blocking an alleyway entrance, installed at the behest of police officers tired of suspects they were chasing disappearing into nooks and crannies. Sprinter Richard Kilty poses on the deprived estate where he grew up in Stockton-on-Tees . Kilty waves on the podium after receiving his 60m gold medal at the European Indoor Championships . The 25-year-old, who briefly retired from athletics in 2012, works out at Deny's Gym in Stockton-on-Tees . Kilty no longer lives on the estate after experiencing success on the world stage over the last 18 months . Age: 25 . From: Stockton-on-Tees . Events: 60m, 100m, 200m . Golds: 60m - 2014 World Indoor Championships, 4x100m relay - 2014 Europeans, 60m - 2015 European Indoor Championships . Nickname: Teesside Tornado . 'It was usually just kids' stuff,' he says, but delve a little deeper and you realise how remarkable his rise has been from the deprivation of the Victoria estate to one of Britain's fastest men. A block of flats on the edge of the estate was a 'no-go zone' says Kilty, recalling mother Melanie asking him to rescue his younger brother Jack. 'I found him in a room with about 30 heroin addicts. They weren't physically intimidating, they only weighed about six stone but you didn't know if one of them was going to pull a knife on you.' In the moments before the 60metres final at the European Indoor Championships in Prague last month, Kilty glanced around the call room at his competition and his mind flickered back to life on the estate. 'I recognised the look of fear in their eyes, I've seen people in much more dangerous situations on the estate and they looked less scared than some of these athletes. 'On the evenings after I'd got home from school there'd always be fights. People would get stabbed or hit with hammers. We'd hang around in little gangs, that was just something you had to be part of. Kilty gets away from Pascal Mancini (left) and Christian Blum to win gold in Prague earlier this month . Kilty poses outside his local gym in Stockton-on-Tees after returning to the area where he grew up . Kilty shows off his 60m gold medal at the World Indoor Championships in Poland in March last year . 'All of us have gone down different paths, my friend David drowned in a river, another friend just got out of prison for aggravated burglary with a gun. I've managed to run my way out of poverty so why should I be scared standing on a start line for a race?' A year to the day after winning the World Indoor Championships in Poland Kilty, 25, won his second international title. The circumstances were very different. He was favourite, whereas 12 months earlier bookmakers had made him a 33-1 outsider with Jamaican Nesta Carter in the field. Six-and-a-half seconds and 33 strides later his life had changed. 'I went there with £17 in my bank account and by the time the plane landed back in the UK I had six figures — £40,000 from winning the race, a British Athletics bonus and a four-year contract with Nike. 'I can remember sometimes not having much money for food and clothes. When I eventually do have kids I want them to live a comfortable life not like I did. I feel I'm doing a good job of that, a couple more years like this and I'll be OK.' He knows all too well what it's like to have it all snatched away. 'I've been homeless twice,' he says. 'The first time I was five and a half and we were put in a hostel up the road, six of us sharing a room in the same building with prostitutes, asylum-seekers and drug addicts. Looking back it was crazy and dangerous but it just seemed like a bit of an adventure at the time. Kilty was made homeless twice and lived in a hostel with prostitutes, asylum seekers and drug addicts . Kilty poses with Adam Gemili, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and James Ellington (L-R) after winning the 4x100m final at the European Championships in Zurich last year . Kilty holds his head as he discusses his childhood and rise to becoming one of Britain's fastest men . 'We moved to the estate after that, my parents owned a pub and made good money for a time but my mum was an alcoholic and addicted to amphetamines. Somehow they lost all their money and we ended up with nothing. 'When I was 14 we were back in the hostel and I had come to my senses. I realised how dangerous it was, luckily my dad was strong and could protect us. I was living there when I won the English Schools title.' Kilty represented Great Britain through the junior age groups but struggled to make the leap to the senior team. Linford Christie took him under his wing before London 2012 but Kilty missed out on selection for the London Olympics despite achieving the qualifying standard for the 200m. 'I had no option but to return home to live with my mam on the estate,' he says. 'One night someone was hit with a baseball bat and nearly killed. I got arrested and was later cleared, I was 150m away when it happened but the damage had been done, my face was plastered all over the news-papers. The week after I was arrested for an alleged kidnap which again was nothing to do with me and I was cleared. But I should never have been in that environment. 'I retired from athletics and was about to join the Marines but one day I was walking by the river and I suddenly decided I couldn't let my talent go to waste. I didn't want to become a failed product of the estate so I decided to give it one last roll of the dice.' Kilty celebrates after surprising the field - and the bookmakers - to win gold in Poland in March last year . Kilt beats Christian Blum (right) to the line to win the 60m European Indoor title earlier this month . Kilty believes his success on track has helped bring his family closer together after problems in the past . Kilty's five-year-old niece, Olivia, hair tied neatly in bunches, arrives to watch her uncle have his picture taken. She is the daughter of his half-sister and still lives on the estate. They are a close family now but it was not always the case. His father Kevin, who has 12 children, was granted full custody of Kilty and his three full siblings after social services became involved. 'One side of the family was at war with the other,' he says. 'It was dysfunctional growing up but everything is good and happy at the moment. I think my success has brought the family together.' Kilty is being coached by Christie again as his focus has switched to making the British team for August's World Championships in Beijing. Vehemently anti-drugs, Kilty believes his coach's protestations that his positive drugs test for nandrolone in 1999 was erroneous. 'He'd been retired three years at that point,' he says, 'I don't believe he took drugs. I'm a clean athlete and I wouldn't train with him if I believed he was a drug abuser. 'But there definitely is a doping crisis at the moment. Justin Gatlin (current 100m world leader) is running faster at 34 — supposedly off drugs — than he was on drugs.' 'I line up against a drugs cheat in virtually every race — Gatlin, Tyson Gay, Dwain Chambers, Asafa Powell. It's annoying knowing convicted dopers are out there when you've worked so hard to get where you are.'","Richard Kilty won  60m gold at the European Indoor Championships .

"This is the heart-warming moment two young African elephants locked trunks in a touching embrace that was caught on camera. The very public display of human-like affection was photographed by Jacques Matthysen at the Kariega Game Reserve, east of Port Elizabeth, South Africa. It occurred while a herd of nearly 30 elephants playfully chased each other and rolled around on the floor at the popular tourist destination. Photographer Jacques Matthysen said two young elephants locked trunks, like humans would hold hands, in a touching embrace . Jacques, who works as a photographer for the reserve, said he is used to seeing the young elephants act in a playful manner, but their affectionate behaviour took him by surprise. As Jacques and a group of visitors looked on, two of the elephants stopped chasing each other and entwined their trunks in a loving gesture. At one point it appeared as if they were ‘kissing’. The 37-year-old photographer said: ‘The mood in the herd seemed “excited”. We moved out to a safer distance - about 50 metres (164ft) - away when one of the younger bulls, about eight years of age, started chasing a younger bull. The heart-warming moment occurred as a herd of nearly 30 elephants playfully chased each other and rolled around on the floor . ‘What we first thought to be aggression, turned out to be all playfulness. ‘Soon a number of younger bulls and cows started to play around. They pushed, head butted and rolled onto each other for quite a few minutes. ‘Soon after, it looked like they were embracing each other, with gentle touches to the faces with their trunks.’ Jacques Matthysen, the game reserve's photographer, said the elephants' affectionate behaviour caught him by surprise . He said two of the elephants locked trunks like humans would hold hands. ‘I quickly focused my camera on them, to capture the “loving” moment. ‘I am very happy with the sighting and images. This just shows us how these giants, that can be so dangerous and so aggressive, can in fact be so gentle and loving animals.’","Jacques Matthysen photographed the heart-warming moment at Kariega Game Reserve in South Africa .

"There has always been a great rivalry between these sides, but I never played at Old Trafford with any fear. I went there as a youngster in 1986 and won with Arsenal and during the Arsene Wenger years we had a team that could go and win anywhere.

The other game people love to remind me of is the ‘Battle of Old Trafford’ in 2003. In the little black book of opposition players, Ruud van Nistelrooy was one not to be trusted. He was a top player and a fighter, but he would look for any reason to go down. Perhaps I overreacted, but the whole team was infuriated by him. And I’m still not convinced I deserved to give away the penalty that Ruud eventually missed!

"My heart says it is New Zealand to win this World Cup final but in my head I have to go for Australia, although not by a wide margin. The important thing for the event as a whole is that it has got the right final, involving the two best sides. I thought India were the one team who might just have a say but Australia were too strong —both these sides fully deserve to be here. The reason they have both earned it is that they have played the full-on, modern brand of one-day cricket: powerful batting combined with wicket-taking bowling marshalled by two captains constantly looking to make things happen. It is the completely up-to-date version of 50-over cricket — slightly different to what was seen from certain other teams we could mention. Tim Southee is relishing the prospect of facing Australia in the World Cup final on Sunday . Aaron Finch will hope to make an impact for Australia in the World Cup final . Everyone likes an underdog, and part of you wants to see the Kiwis win because it would be great to have a new winner. They have played exhilarating cricket and you also get the sense that their whole country is really behind them. From an England point of view, they are visiting in early summer and to welcome them as world champions would really add something to it. But my head is ruling the heart largely due to the home advantage of Australia playing at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. To me that is a massive factor at World Cups. The Black Caps have played every match at home so far and I fear that it is going to be difficult to travel to a venue that is going to be quite different to where they have been playing. Australia celebrate as they book their place in the final with a win over India in the semi-finals . David Warner thanks the crowd after winning the semi-final against India . The ball has swung around in New Zealand, but, with the drop-in pitch, that has not been so much the case at the MCG which, apart from anything else, is much larger than where they have been so far. On some of the grounds in New Zealand even the mishits will go for six, and that will not happen this time. One of the more notable statistics of this tournament has been that Brendon McCullum has scored 85 per cent of his runs in boundaries, . The remarkable Kiwi captain is the most important single figure in this game. As a batsman he’s shown that he is looking to tee off virtually every time. New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum has scored 85 per cent of his runs in boundaries . He has made some dashing knocks in the earlier rounds without pushing on to a really big score. If he could do that in the final it would be huge for New Zealand. He has been my captain of the tournament. He is aggressive without doing anything for show, but he may have to be a little more conservative in his field placings in this match, and how he uses the spin of Daniel Vettori will be key. Apart from McCullum I like plenty of cricketers in this New Zealand side, there are lots of tough nuts who are a bit unsung, guys such as Vettori, Ross Taylor and Grant Elliot. Daniel Vettori will play his last ever ODI for New Zealand in the World Cup final . The 100,000 capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground will provide a fitting venue for Sunday's showpiece . I do not expect them to choke, but I think Australia may be building up to a big performance. The Aussies haven’t quite played their best yet and they have been more stop-start, with a game called off and the loss to New Zealand. That will not have too much bearing in my view, and you have got to be impressed by the firepower that runs through the team — look at those late runs from Mitchell Johnson that were so important in the semi-final, for example. This could go either way, but home advantage should just tip it for Australia. And it should be good for the neutral.","My head and my heart are torn over who should win the World Cup .

"John Barnes did get a second chance as a manager in British football. What he didn’t get was a third. Having tried and failed at an elite club, Celtic — he left after the infamous loss to Inverness Caledonian Thistle — Barnes managed Jamaica and then Tranmere Rovers. On October 9, 2012, when he was sacked after a run of two wins in 11 matches, Tranmere were 22nd in League One.

Barnes believes black managers don’t get the second chances afforded their white counterparts, but where could he have gone from there? Nothing in his record suggested he would thrive in the lower leagues, his experience at Celtic will have damaged his appeal to bigger clubs. Barnes was stymied by circumstances, not the colour of his skin.

The problem is getting the elusive first job, not where to go if it doesn’t work out at Tranmere.

"It was not as if England lost to Bangladesh in the sub-continent. These were English-type conditions and it was seamers who took the wickets, not spinners. That makes it even more of a diabolical result. Players always have to take responsibility and have a good look at themselves but mistakes have certainly been made by Peter Moores and this management. They had six months to prepare for this tournament rather than in two of the last three World Cups when they have come in to it off the back of the Ashes. Chris Woakes walks towards his bowling mark during the  World Cup  match between Bangladesh and England . They changed the captain just ahead of this tour which to me was not the wrong call but one made too late. They should have replaced Alastair Cook a year ago and then Alex Hales could have been opening the batting for a year by now. Then at the last minute here they came up with this cunning plan of picking Gary Ballance which smacked of England losing their bottle and reverting to old-fashioned type and going with the Test No3. And why did it take until this game for Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad to pitch the ball up? Eoin Morgan said it wasn’t a team plan so why were they bowling too short and why didn’t someone tell them to stop it before now?

Yet, in all honesty, I watched that match and I wasn’t too fussed about the result because my feeling is that even if England had won and gone on to the quarter-final they would have been hammered by India, South Africa or whoever they faced on a drop-in pitch at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. England are playing a different brand of cricket from the top five or six teams and the underlying problems need to be looked at as much as the position of the coach, who comes under scrutiny after every tournament disappointment.

"Australia's 17-man squad to defend the Ashes against England this summer is packed with pace men as well as a fair share of ageing stars. Ten of their squad are in their thirties, paving the way for a raft of Dad’s Army references that will gather momentum if they get off to a bad start in Cardiff. Nonetheless, this is a squad that I would pick to defend the urn. Never mind planning for the future, their tour will be all about the present. Team Australia celebrate after winning the Cricket World Cup before naming their Ashes squad . NICE BALANCE . My first thought when I saw the squad was that it’s the way I’d have gone about selection. A five-Test series in England is not the time to experiment and the Australians have put faith in experience. Australia's selection of Adam Voges will bring an experienced head with them this summer . Adam Voges is an interesting choice: like Chris Rogers, he knows English conditions well. It’s not a tour for blooding a young batsman. It’s also why they’ve gone with Peter Siddle among the seamers. If Ryan Harris breaks down, Siddle can slot straight in. FIREPOWER . IF Mitchell Johnson bowls anything like he did during the last Ashes, Australia should win. Both sides know there’s still some scarring. Mitchell Starc managed to swing the white Kookaburra during the World Cup so he should be able to swing the red Dukes ball in England. He swings it late, too — as Brendon McCullum found out in the final. Fast bowler Mitchell Johnson will be hoping to terrorise English batsmen like he did last time around . I was impressed with Josh Hazlewood, too. He could prosper in England with his hit-the-deck style. Harris always has wicket-taking potential, although I wonder how quickly he’ll slot back in after sitting out the West Indies tour. No 3 THE KEY . The series could hinge on Australia’s No 3. Whoever it is, England will think they have a chance. Shane Watson has done the job in the past without ever really making it his own and there’s been talk of Steve Smith moving up the order. Steve Smith has been in sensational form and could get moved up the batting order to No 3 . He’s in the form of his life but he still moves around a lot at the crease. If the ball’s swinging, that could spell trouble. The other option would be Voges, who has just averaged 104 in the Sheffield Shield. AGE CONCERN . I firmly believe you should try to get every last drop out of some of these cricketers, especially in an Ashes. As England discovered in 2013-14, an ageing side is only a problem if the players are approaching retirement, like Graeme Swann. At 37-years-old, Brad Haddin is likely to be playing his last Ashes along with a few others . But for someone like Rogers this tour will be a last hurrah. I’ll be watching Brad Haddin. He’s a fierce competitor but he’s 37 and keeping in England can be tricky because of the late swing. DODGY AT THE BACK . Part of the reason Michael Clarke has given up one-day internationals is to manage his dodgy back. Mike Atherton will tell you a bad back can go at any moment, although Clarke looked physically sharp during the World Cup. Captain Michael Clarke will be hoping he doesn't suffer a recurrence of his back problems . But if the Australia captain’s back is stiff when they play in England, the bowlers will test out the 33-year-old’s suppleness against the short ball. He’s still vulnerable early on. Michael Clarke (capt) Age 33 . Caps 108 . Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more. David Warner . Age 28 . Caps 36 . Verdict Could win a Test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions. Moeen Ali’s off-breaks will be crucial in pinning him down. Likes to say a word or two. Shane Watson . Age 33 . Caps 56 . Verdict Has a decent record in Ashes cricket, but has never reached the stage where he frightens England. But his medium-pace balances Australia’s team in a way Cook can only envy. Shaun Marsh . Age 31 . Caps 12 . Verdict A gritty left-hander, and son of former Test opener Geoff. Began Test career with 141 in Sri Lanka in 2011, but success has been sporadic since then. CV includes six ducks. Mitchell Johnson . Age 33 . Caps 64 . Verdict If England haven’t got over the trauma of the 2013-14 series, when Johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece, the Ashes will stay with Australia. Josh Hazlewood . Age 24 . Caps 3 . Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. James Faulkner . Age 24 . Caps 1 . Verdict Played his only Test to date at The Oval in 2013, where he got up England’s noses by accusing them of boring batting. A left-arm seam-bowling all-rounder, he can give the ball an almighty whack. James Pattinson . Age 24 . Caps 13 . Verdict Injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011-12, but the talent is undeniable: tall, aggressive and fast, he should trouble England more than his brother, Darren, when playing for England in a single Test against South Africa in 2008. Peter Siddle . Age 30 . Caps 56 . Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. Brad Haddin (wkt) Age 37 . Caps 63 . Verdict Australia’s second-most important cog in their 5-0 Ashes wheel in 2013-14, after Mitchell Johnson. His sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team. Chris Rogers . Age 37 . Caps 20 . Verdict This will be his last hurrah in a late-blooming Test career. Calm, compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner Warner. Steve Smith (vice captain) Age 25 . Caps 26 . Verdict One of world cricket’s rising stars, he scored four tons in Australia’s recent home series against India. Will captain the side full-time after Clarke retires, and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg-spin. Nathan Lyon . Age 27 . Caps 39 . Verdict A steady off-spinner who troubled England’s right-handers  during whitewash. But, really, they should have nothing to fear. Mitchell Starc . Age 25 . Caps 15 . Verdict Another left-arm seamer, and Man of the Tournament at the World Cup. His yorkers are as dangerous in Tests as they are in ODIs, and  accuracy and pace have improved. Ryan Harris . Age 35 . Caps 27 . Verdict If he can drag his injury-laden body through one final series, Australia will be thrilled. He was an unsung star during their 3-0 defeat here two years ago, and produced the ball of the series to bowl Cook in Perth. Josh Hazlewood . Age 24 . Caps 3 . Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. Fawad Ahmed . Age 33 . Caps 20 . Verdict The Pakistan-born leg-spinner has played only three one-day internationals and two Twenty20 games for Australia, so would represent a risk. But Australian leggies have done well in England before… . Michael Clarke (capt) Age 33 . Caps 108 . Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more. David Warner . Age 28 . Caps 36 . Verdict Could win a Test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions. Moeen Ali’s off-breaks will be crucial in pinning him down. Likes to say a word or two. Shane Watson . Age 33 .

CV includes six ducks. Mitchell Johnson . Age 33 . Caps 64 . Verdict If England haven’t got over the trauma of the 2013-14 series, when Johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece, the Ashes will stay with Australia. Peter Siddle . Age 30 . Caps 56 . Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. Mitchell Marsh . Age 23 . Caps 4 . Verdict A rangy all-rounder and younger brother of Shaun, Marsh stunned England during the World Cup with figures of 5 for 33 at Melbourne – despite having taken only six ODI wickets until then. His batting is the stronger suit. Peter Nevill . Age 29 . Caps 0 . Verdict Peter who? Nevill has been chosen as the reserve wicketkeeper behind his New South Wales team-mate Haddin, although he has also played as a specialist batsman for his state team. Unlikely to get a game unless Haddin breaks a finger. Adam Voges . Age 35 . Caps 0 . Verdict An outsider for a Test debut, but he knows English conditions well – Voges has spent time with Hampshire, Middlesex and Nottinghamshire – and bowls left-arm spin to complement his middle-order hitting.","England host Australia for the 2015 Ashes on home turf this summer .

"England’s seven-game winning streak does not include Italy. Lithuania, but not Italy. Slovenia, but not Italy. San Marino and Estonia, but not Italy. So the idea that the heat has been taken out of Harry Kane’s full debut for his country by a string of victories since last summer’s World Cup does rather overlook a salient fact. That England’s seven wins, as welcome as they may be, are against the also-rans of European football. Only Slovenia are on course to qualify automatically for the European Championship at the halfway stage — by coming a distant second to England — while Norway, Switzerland and Scotland are in third place in their respective groups, Lithuania lie fourth, Estonia fifth and San Marino where they always are. This is not Roy Hodgson’s fault. His players can only beat what is in front of them. Tottenham striker Harry Kane is set to make his full England debut against Italy on Tuesday night . Kane celebrates after scoring on his England debut against Lithuania just 79 seconds after coming on . Kane looks on as England manager Roy Hodgson talks to members of the squad at the Juventus Stadium . Yet just as Hodgson is trying to play down the clamour around Kane, playing down the euphoria around England’s present run may be equally wise. It is not a year since England’s poorest World Cup finals performance in recent memory and what we do know is that when a group of players that are the scourge of the Baltic nations plus an odd mountain range or two came up against Italy in Manaus last June, they did not have the wit to win. That is where Kane comes in. Italy and England may be depleted in Turin, but certain standards remain. Italy’s defence will be of a calibre England have not experienced since the World Cup. Their ambition will be greater than that of previous opponents, too. The Spurs striker headed in against Lithuania  shortly after coming on as a substitute at Wembley . Kane celebrates his first international goal as England cruised to a 4-0 win over lowly Lithunania . This is a genuine test for Kane, in a way his cameo role against Lithuania wasn’t. He will not have played against a team of Lithuania’s standard since he was being farmed out by his club on loan to gain experience. Lithuania fielded a starting back four featuring players from Rangers, Hapoel Haifa, Zalgiris Vilnius and Cambuur of Holland. On Tuesday, he will play against two of the men who have powered Juventus to the pinnacle of Italian football — Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci — plus Andrea Ranocchia of Inter Milan. It is an upgrade. And that is what England require of Kane, too: an upgrade. Hodgson knows he already has the players to qualify for a major tournament — but he didn’t have ones who could muscle past Italy or Uruguay once there. The hope is Kane could change that. Kane will come up against Italy and Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci (left) on Tuesday night . Giorgio Chiellini (second right), pictured with his Italy team-mates, will also come up against the England man . Italy players train at the Juventus Stadium in Turin ahead of Tuesday's friendly against England . At the moment we are left asking questions to which we probably know the answer. Why is Danny Welbeck so prolific for England — Europe’s top scorer in the current qualifying campaign, no less — yet still finding his feet with Arsenal? Why is Raheem Sterling’s form so inconsistent for Liverpool, yet so vital for England? The explanation can be found in that Lithuanian back four. When does Welbeck get to play against defenders at the level of the Scottish Championship with Arsenal? When does Sterling face opposition such as Cambuur? Danny Welbeck, top scorer in Euro qualifying, celebrates with Wayne Rooney after scoring on Friday night . Raheem Sterling comes up against better quality opposition for Liverpool than when playing for England . Chelsea send their promising youth-team players to Vitesse Arnhem on loan, and they often make the first team. Vitesse are currently fifth in the Eredivisie; Cambuur are 10th. The last time they met, on February 4, two Chelsea players featured for Vitesse, who won 2-0. So that is what Welbeck and England were up against on Friday — defenders who might not quite be at the level of Chelsea’s best youngsters. Faced with John Terry in the Premier League, different rules apply. Yet against Terry on January 1, Kane nhad one of his best games of the season. Kane had one of his best games of the  season against John Terry during Spurs' 5-3 win over Chelsea . He is English football’s top scorer playing often against players with the quality we shall witness on Tuesday night. What Hodgson must be hoping is that in Turin he sees a player who can take England beyond. Wayne Rooney was Europe’s top scorer on the way to South Africa in 2010, too. Having qualified, England failed to attain the necessary level when competing in the finals. Hodgson talked of Kane on Monday as a squad player being given the chance to show what he can do — albeit with one of his most promising lines of supply severed as Sterling is back on Merseyside nursing a minor injury. Yet he is more than just that. If Kane demonstrates that he can pose a genuine threat to high- level defenders, he has the capability to change the way England approach matches. The Premier League's top scorer will be up against defenders of real quality when England take on Italy . Welbeck does a job for Hodgson, but that is what it is: a job. It is a good job — he is the player Hodgson relies upon when he is concerned the opposition has superior technique — but it has limitations. Welbeck works hard, he closes down, he has pace on the counter-attack — and he does exactly what the manager asks of him. And, for now, that is enough. Welbeck has been prolific as England power through the mediocrities. Welbeck does a good job and is often relied on by Hodgson when England face sides with superior technique . Extra is needed in France in 2016, however, if England are to be more than just present. Hodgson must discover match-winners, players who have the beating of contenders like Italy. So Tuesday night is much more than a friendly for Kane. This is a moment when he has the opportunity to alter the potential of English football and, if successful, we shouldn’t be frightened to embrace this.","Roy Hodgson has confirmed Harry Kane will start for England against Italy .

"To get in touch with Martin, leave your comments below or send your tweets to @MailSport using #TackleKeown . Sportsmail columnist MARTIN KEOWN answered YOUR questions after an entertaining week in the Champions League and the FA Cup. Chelsea were knocked out by PSG on Wednesday night, with subjects ranging from the referee's performance, Zlatan Ibrahimovic's comments on the Blues being 'babies', David Luiz's return and whether the Premier League is still the best in the world. Also, Arsenal overcame their Old Trafford hoo-doo to beat Manchester United on Monday night, and the former Gunners legend was at the game. But what was that 'money' sign to Arsene Wenger all about? You can read all the answers below. Host commentator . It’s certainly a good way to sum it up. If you think about how you’d react in that situation, he didn’t know whether to laugh or be angry. He probably thought the referee had got it so wrong, and everyone could see it, that he’d get off the hook. The controlled reaction of the Chelsea players was definitely a factor in the red card. Many years ago, when I was playing under George Graham against United, he accused us of being too nice during half-time. He said we had to get around the referee as they were influencing every decision. From that day, I contested every decision, almost giving the referee a running commentary. I would often say, ‘who’s in charge, them or you?’. There’s nothing worse for a referee to hear. I appreciated why people don’t like to see it, but as well as influencing the referee, it makes you fight and compete for everything. It makes you more alive and puts your receptors on red alert. It’s like a game within a game, and believe me, it works. Niall came into the game quite late. As a youngster he did his A-levels and his club Reading helped him through. Just recently he’s turned a huge corner, particularly since Steve Clarke was appointed and started involving him in first-team training. Ireland asked about him last year, but he had an operation, which curtailed his development. Now he’s in the Under 21 squad and we’re very proud. It looks ironic, given that I played for England, but a lot of my family were shocked I didn’t play for Ireland as I come from a big Irish family. I could have played with as much passion for Ireland as I did for England, and it’s Niall’s right to play for Ireland, too. It was a clear demonstration from United that he’s not going to be a part of their future. We know he hasn’t played well, and he looks like he’s lost some sharpness because of his knee injury. Though his last contribution for United, winning a penalty against Sunderland, was very important and has been largely overlooked. He hasn’t played since! I think letting him go is probably the right call though. He’s not sharp enough, and doesn’t strike fear into the opposition. He looks to have given up trying to certain extent. I think Van Gaal is largely responsible for United’s situation at the moment though, not the players. Man management was Sir Alex Ferguson’s forte, and some players find it harder to cope than others. Mangers have to work with players’ minds, bodies and hearts. And when all is not right in their mind they will react to everything. It feels like Van Gaal has created this environment. Fergie would squeeze every ounce out of his players. If he were still there, they wouldn’t be so far away from top of league. I don’t blame either of them, Ben. They were shown the door, so why not? When Roman Abramovich first took over at Chelsea, he offered a lot of money for Thierry Henry, but Arsenal refused and Henry was flattered by it. I think Luiz would have been half-hoping for that same reaction from Chelsea. As for Welbeck, he’s a young man early in his career and was never really given a chance as a centre forward – his preferred role. And then there were the unnecessary comments from Van Gaal, claiming Welbeck was only good enough to be a substitute at United. He wanted to fulfill his dreams at United and he had to listen to that. Now he has the chance to fulfill his dreams with Arsenal. Everyone in the studio thought it was so funny. It’s like showing a montage of Gary [Lineker]'s misses! I was trying to explain that Andy Cole’s run takes me off Giggs’s line so I ended up caught in the middle. My most vivid memory is from after the game when I went into United dressing room to show some respect, but they were in full celebration mode and didn’t show a great deal of respect to us. I felt I had to say something though, it was an epic battle. But they weren’t better than us that day, put it that way... I had to have my smile surgically removed! It was fantastic. I must admit, I was surprised at how many of the young United fans in the ground wanted photos with me and autographs. They were very respectful. I had to walk through the United fans to get to the gantry, and it was a bit intimidating, but overall it was fine. Maybe, because the fans were so young, that hadn’t seen everything that used to go on! There was one occasion when I exclaimed out loud when Arsenal wasted a chance – that got a few comments from the crowd, but it was good to feel like part of my old club again. All credit to Luiz – he has so much self-belief. People were saying Mourinho was a genius for letting him go, but was he a genius last night, Calvin? Of course, he had to let him go for that kind of money. It’s just unfortunate for him that the player came back to demonstrate he was worth every penny. Though I must say, Thiago Silva was magnificent with those successive headers at the other end late on. You couldn’t have written a better script. David Luiz looks like the hero at his old ground, then Silva gives a horror penalty away but snatches the winning goal. It’s a valid argument, Jaymie. However, I think Chelsea’s performance has quite a lot to do with winning the Capital One Cup. I’ve never liked that trophy being awarded so early in season. It’s possible you’ll lose focus, making it tough to keep going. When Chelsea celebrated winning the cup I think they were also enjoying the fact that Manchester City had lost to Liverpool earlier in the day. They were probably thinking they had the league title wrapped up that weekend as well as the League Cup. That looks to have taken the edge off of them. They had a tough game against West Ham afterwards, and they were very lucky to get a result there. They look to have the wrong mentality. Money sign? We were talking about the grass! The Old Trafford pitch is part synthetic, part grass, which was a change sanctioned by David Moyes last season. We were remarking on how it compares to a normal grass pitch. I don’t think it makes it any less interesting, Nico, but whether it’s the best? I’m not even sure I thought it was best when Chelsea and Manchester United were in the Champions League final in 2008. Before Christmas, it looked like Chelsea and Real Madrid could win it. Suddenly there are huge question marks. It’s all about finding consistency and form at right time. The workload doesn’t help, but Chelsea had seven days to prepare. Routine is everything for footballers, and perhaps going from a game every three days to one a week might have affected them. Usually Chelsea control the tempo. They tried to press, but the likes of Thiago Motta and Marco Verratti were so calm and technically gifted... this forced the Chelsea players to sit off a bit as they couldn’t get the ball off them. PSG didn’t panic with ten men, they were brave and kept the ball in tight situations. They just ignored the fact they had 10 men, it was an incredible show of strength. It was like they had been hypnotised into thinking they had 11 men! Jose Mourinho was just as guilty as his team. Usually he’s very decisive – sending on three subs if he needs to – and gets it spot on. But he had them time wasting after they scored the first goal. They didn’t go out to win the match. Ibrahimovic goes to ground, realises he could make heavy contact and tries to pull away - I agree. Oscar knows exactly what he’s doing by feigning injury – it’s not nearly as bad as he makes out. I don’t think he should have been sent off, I’m not even sure it was a booking. The speed at which the Chelsea players all surround the referee is important – it’s the quickest you’ll ever see John Terry run! They can’t even be certain what’s happened or if their player is injured, but it doesn’t stop at least five or six of them waving their arms in air. It’s a calculated, orchestrated reaction, and they’ve been doing it for a while.","Chelsea knocked out of Champions League after away goals defeat by PSG .

"PSV frontman Memphis Depay has been tipped to  match Arjen Robben and even touted as a better player than Cristiano Ronaldo at the same age. With 16 Eredivisie strikes to his name, the 21-year-old winger has stormed to the top of the goalscoring charts this season and even found the net for Holland at the World Cup in Brazil last summer. Wanted by Manchester United and Tottenham, Depay may well depart the Philips Stadion at the end of the season after PSV admitted it may be difficult to keep him at the club. Here, Sportsmail tells you everything you need to about the exciting Dutch hotshot. PSV star Memphis Depay is wanted by Man United and Tottenham and tipped to one day match Arjen Robben . The 21-year-old is the current leading goalscorer in the Eredivisie having scored 16 league goals this season . Early years and PSV Eindhoven . Born in 1994, Depay started out at hometown club VV Moordrecht - a Dutch amateur side in south Holland - at the age of six  before joining Sparta Rotterdam three years later. The son of a Ghanaian father and Dutch mother, Depay moved to  PSV at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in September 2011 having impressed during a trial. Depay signed his first professional contract in June 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the Dutch giants. Depay joined PSV at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut for the Dutch giants in September 2011 . Signing a professional contract in 2012, Depay has already made over 100 appearances for the Dutch giants . Playing style . Pacy, with neat close control, Depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire Eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign. Adding more goals to his game this season, the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot. Often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside, Depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents. However, still at a young age and learning the game, the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long. Depay loves to run at defenders and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to leave opponents for dead . Depay boasts neat close control, an explosive right foot and is often deployed on the left wing for PSV . Top of the scoring charts . Depay's strike during Saturday's 3-0 win away at Go Ahead Eagles was his 16th of the season and took him to the top of the Eredivisie goalscoring charts - one  ahead of PSV team-mate Luuk De Jong. An impressive feat for a player who is not an all-out attacker. The No 7 has enjoyed a steady flow of goals during the last two seasons and has found the net 19 times in all competitions this term. Scoring four braces, Depay's goals from out wide have helped fire PSV eleven points clear at the top of the Eredivisie table and will have certainly caught the eye of Europe's biggest clubs. Depay, pictured scoring against Feynoord, has found the net 19 times for PSV in all competitions this term . Depay is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring during PSV's  win at Go Ahead Eagles on Saturday . Talent to one day match Arjen Robben... and already better than a young Cristiano Ronaldo? While Depay has been tipped to become as good as Dutch star Arjen Robben by PSV manager Phillip Cocu, one man believes the Holland youngster could one day rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Ed van Steijn, the man who scouted Ronaldo for Manchester United, believes Depay is better than the Real Madrid star was at the same age. Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better. 'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.' Ed van Steijn, a Dutch scout, believes Depay is a better player than Cristiano Ronaldo at the same age . Van Steijn believes Real Madrid star Ronaldo made similar mistakes at Man United as Depay did at 17 . Meanwhile, former Holland midfielder Cocu said of Depay: 'Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben? I think so. 'They are different players, but they are both fast and have a good shot. And both always have the urge to learn. 'But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn.' Depay's PSV team-mate Stijn Schaars is also a fan and told Helden Online: 'He's doing everything to reach the top. 'He has a body of a true athlete, power and flair. I'm not afraid of him losing his head. His drive is huge. I like him a lot.' PSV coach Philip Cocu congratulates Depay after the frontman's strike set his side up for victory on Saturday . Cocu believes Depay is capable of matching Holland and Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben in the future . International star and World Cup goalscorer . Depay was handed his first Oranje call-up by Louis van Gaal in 2013 and was selected for Holland's World Cup squad a year later. The energetic frontman scored the winning goal in Holland's 3-2 victory over  Australia, before coming off the bench to net against Chile and help Van Gaal's men seal top spot in Group B. Having impressed in Brazil, Depay was nominated for the tournament's 'Best Young Player' award but lost out to France midfielder Paul Pogba.

As well as his supreme talent, Depay catches the eye with his large collection of tattoos. The young PSV star even has the inside of his lip inked. On his left arm, the winger has artwork dedicated to his grandfather who passed away the day after Depay's 15th birthday. The PSV frontman boasts a large collection of impressive tattoos and even has the inside of his lip inked . The winger also has an inking on his left arm dedicated to his grandfather, who died when Depay was 15 . On the move? With Manchester United keen, and Tottenham even putting in a £14.6million bid for the winger, PSV general director Toon Gerbrands is resigned to the fact Depay is likely to leave the club when the next transfer window opens in June. Speaking last week, Gerbrands told Dutch broadcaster NOS: 'Tottenham were willing to offer €20m (£14.6m) for Depay. We decided to keep hold of him, but he has the option to leave after this season.' Depay's team-mate Georginio Wijnaldum has also been linked with a summer switch to French champions PSG and Gerdbrands is expecting bids for the midfield duo. 'I think these two players are very attractive to a lot of clubs in Europe,' the PSV director said. 'So far, no-one has come forward with an offer but I expect we will come under great pressure.'

The FA intend to carry on regardless awarding two caps to their England club members for coming to home games and one cap for trips abroad. For years it had been the other way round for the loyalty league table that will next be used to allocate FA tickets for what will be a hugely over-subscribed Euro 2016. England supporters have chanted their upset - ‘two caps for Wembley, you’re having a laugh’ - at every international game since the World Cup and the matter was raised by fans chief Malcolm Clarke at the last FA council meeting. England fans are unhappy with the FA's move to switch  loyalty value of attending away games to Wembley . England supporters who attended England's friendly in Italy will have earned just one cap for the trip . The FA board said they noted Clarke’s concern. But rather than look fully into whether they had made the right decision, the FA are staying on the same course. They claim that the hardcore loyal support who go to home and away games are not being disadvantaged and that filling Wembley is the over-riding priority. England fans ambassador Kevin Miles said: ‘We have appealed in the right way through our council representative and it will be disappointing in the extreme if our complaints are effectively ignored. The FA have not heard the last about this.’ Andros Townsend shoots and scores during England's 1-1 draw against Italy at the Juventus Stadium . Land Rover, who pulled their England rugby sponsorship after boorish behaviour by the players on a company day during the 2011 World Cup fiasco in New Zealand, have purposely made their tournament sponsorship in 2015 grass-roots related. Yet Land Rover still felt the need to spice up their launch match between two amateur sides at Farnborough Rugby Club by inviting along rugby celebrities Sir Clive Woodward, Jonny Wilkinson , Matt Giteau and Will Greenwood. And so much for grass-roots delivery — all the junior and mini-rugby sessions were cancelled so committee members could meet the big names. Land Rover, sponsors of next year's Rugby World Cup, invited Jonny Wilkinson to their launch match . Brian Cookson, the UCI president charged with cleaning up rotten cycling, faces a difficult day on Thursday. UCI’s licence commission meet to discuss his recommendation to withdraw leading team Astana’s elite competition licence following major doping offences by their riders. Drug-riddled Astana are expected to take their case to the Council of Arbitration for Sport if they lose their permit. They will claim Cookson has not followed the correct legal procedure as there is nothing in the UCI statutes about withdrawing team licences for rider transgressions. Potentially, Astana — backed by the Kazakhstan sovereign wealth fund — could then sue the UCI for massive damages if their appeal is upheld by CAS.

The size of Debbie Jevans' six-figure pay-off from the RFU after walking out as chief executive of England Rugby 2015 points to Twickenham’s high command wanting her out — even if she made the first move. It is understood the breakdown of Jevans’ relationships with the RFU leadership included those with affable chairman Bill Beaumont as well as chief executive Ian Ritchie. Debbie Jevans received a pay-off after walking out as chief executive of England Rugby 2015 . It is said Jevans had been thinking about leaving since New Year, such was the disconnect. So there would have been time to ensure she did not depart Twickeham empty-handed and her believed £150,000 severance payment reflects tournament preparations going well. The last big split before the Debbie Jevans affair in which both sides kept this quiet followed Adrian Chiles’ sacking as ITV’s lead football presenter. Chiles has still not spoken out about losing his prime sports host role to Mark Pougatch, despite having settled his pay-off terms with ITV.","England fans unhappy FA switched extra loyalty from away games .

"The extent of the fall-out between Debbie Jevans and the RFU hierarchy has started to emerge since the England Rugby 2015 chief executive suddenly quit last Friday. As Sportsmail revealed, Jevans had become so exasperated with the increasing level of interference in her forensic planning of the Rugby World Cup that she felt she couldn’t work at Twickenham any longer. But it’s now understood that the RFU had become equally fed up with the way Jevans always demanded her own way — as in her previous role as director of sport at the London Olympics — and didn’t properly accommodate the host nation position at a World Cup where the financial guarantee stops with them. Debbie Jevans resigned as chief executive of England's World Cup 2015 organising committee last Friday . And although Jevans resigned of her own accord, the RFU made no attempt to change her mind. The crucial relationship between RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie and Jevans had began to unravel over the last few months and culminated in a series of huge rows in Ritchie’s office at Twickenham last week. This led RFU chairman Bill Beaumont to tell a member of staff: ‘We’ve got a major problem here.’ It was Ritchie who was responsible for signing the highly combative Jevans, whom he knew from his role as CEO of the All England Club where Jevans is an influential committee member. The exact flashpoint that forced Jevans to resign less than six months before the start of the tournament is not known. But staffing levels at ER 2015 are known to concern the RFU with nearly 200 already on the ER 2015 payroll. The relationship between RFU chief Ian Ritchie and Jevans had began to unravel over the last few months . Sources say Ritchie walked through ER2015’s expanded office space recently, wondering what the huge army of employees actually did. The 1991 World Cup, hosted by five unions, had been organised by less than 25 full-time staff — not many more than turned up on the ER 2015 team recently to arrange a single fanzone. The split with Ritchie also left Jevans isolated as she made no attempt to embrace the rugby fraternity or commercial agencies like IMG. Certainly, the clubs regarded her as very difficult to deal with — unplayable some even said. Also, Ritchie is not the jovial, happy-go-lucky CEO he portrays on the surface but a ruthless, cold-eyed businessman who has seen off Jevans in the same ruthless way he brought her in to replace Paul Vaughan . Ritchie’s desire to curb ER2015 excess and bring the organising committee into the bosom of the RFU can be seen by the installation of RFU finance director Stephen Brown as the new ER2015 managing director. Jevans had previously held the role of director of sport at the London Olympics . The International Rugby Board have kept their distance from the Jevans walk-out. But they have to take some of the blame for the crazy structure of the Rugby World Cup where they receive an £80million guarantee but still keep sponsorship, corporate hospitality and TV rights while leaving the host nation and the organising committee to sell the tickets and fight for recognition. Jevans has made it clear she will not be explaining the personal reasons behind her departure any time soon. The International Rugby Board, headed by Bernard Lapasset, have kept their distance from the Jevans saga . It hasn’t helped the strained relationship between the Premier League and the FA over homegrown player numbers that the clubs kept FA chairman Greg Dyke waiting for one hour and 20 minutes outside their Piccadilly meeting last week. Dyke had prepared a presentation but wasn’t given the opportunity to address the clubs. FA chairman Greg Dyke was not given the opportunity to address the Premier League clubs last week .

"The battle over homegrown players overshadowed the Premier League, FA and Government’s get-together on Friday in a fanciful show of harmony to promote grassroots facilities. The League’s opposition to FA chairman Greg Dyke’s campaign to increase the homegrown players in their squads from eight to 12 made pictures of Dyke, PL chief executive Richard Scudamore and Minister for Sport Helen Grant at a new 3G pitch in Brixton rather incongruous, especially as how the money will be spent or who will administer it has not been decided. ‘The nitty gritty will be worked out,’ promised Grant on her last day in office before the election, just when she’s starting to looking the part. Greg Dyke’s has a campaign to increase the homegrown players in their squads from eight to 12 . The PL want to kick Dyke’s project into the long grass, claiming it will never get through the necessary committees on which the League have seats. Dyke has ridden back from his aggressive approach on Monday when he said the FA had looked into forcing change but did not want to do so. When Southampton asked Dyke at the clubs’ summit if he was going to force it through — as the FA could — he denied he’d said that. Instead, there will be a consultation process with an FA document arriving soon which the PL and their clubs will inevitably reject. Scudamore said: ‘We haven’t actually seen the consultation document, we haven’t seen the process. When that arrives, we will consult properly on it.’ The FA’s best hope is that UEFA can persuade the European Commissioner to allow 12 home-grown players in Champions League squads. Minister for Sport Helen Grant's appearance at a new 3G pitch in Brixton was rather overshadowed . The non-stop spin about who’s giving what to grassroots football was in full force. Scudamore, Dyke and Grant were each accompanied by at least two of their PR team or policy advisors, all spinning like tops over a supposedly joint initiative. It was likened to a three-legged stool by Scudamore, who added: ‘They fall over if any one of the legs gets sawn off.’ The three speeches at the UEFA Congress from Sepp Blatter’s challengers for the FIFA presidency do not seem to have had much impact on voters. According to his supporters, Blatter  is still on course for a ridiculous fifth term in office with a landslide 160 territories out of 209, which explains why he doesn’t feel the need to go out on the campaign trail. That support includes around half of the UEFA countries, which is the percentage estimated by the Slovenia and Iceland delegations in Vienna. According to his supporters, Sepp Blatter is still on course for a fifth term in office . FA of Wales’ loveable loose cannon president Trefor Lloyd Hughes gave the impression he didn’t really know where he stood at the UEFA Congress over his noisy claims to the British vice-presidency on the FIFA ExCo because it was Wales’s turn. And this was borne out by his official FAW statement congratulating the successful candidates after the elections in ‘Vienna, Switzerland’. FA cutting to the Max . The FA’s desire to find 15 per cent cuts from every department to fund the England commission coaches and pitches initiative doesn’t stop them bringing in costly management consultants Maxxim to find more efficient ways for football’s ruling body to work. Complaints from the national game about the proposed cuts to the FA Trophy and Vase prizemoney brought the FA board response that sponsors should be found by the commercial department. Hardly likely when the flagship FA Cup has been without a backer all season. Four second places in the Six Nations is not stopping England head coach Stuart Lancaster talking about coming first for a change. His latest speaking engagement, for the NSPCC, is a glitzy evening with himself and Jonny Wilkinson at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London on April 23 talking to 450 guests about ‘What it takes to Win’. Whether it’s advisable, even for a good cause, for Lancaster, with his track record, to be talking in tandem with a fabled World Cup winner is debatable. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie chats to Lancaster at England's base in Pennyhill Park in Bagshot . The ECB are negotiating a car deal for England with Toyota set to replace Jaguar.

"I always thought international football was about the best players from one country pitting themselves against the best players from another country. But this is a fantastical idealistic notion. The cosmopolitan nature of the world in general, and the easy, frequent movement of large numbers of people from country to country in modern times has made the globe a smaller place. At the weekend, Italy's equaliser against Bulgaria was scored by a Brazilian, Eder, who first arrived in Italy when he was 16. He has admitted he doesn't know the words to the Italian national anthem. An Argentina-born striker, Franco Vasquez, is also in Antonio Conte's squad. Eder, who was born in Brazil, celebrates his goal for Italy in their Euro 2016 qualifier with Bulgaria . Eder, who moved to Italy when he was 16, has admitted that he doesn't know  the national anthem . Argentina-born Franco Vasquez is also part of Antonio Conte's Italy squad . Italy's Italian strikers are either too old (Luca Toni, Antonio di Natale) or out of form (Ciro Immobile, Mario Balotelli, Graziano Pelle), hence the foreign call-ups. The controversy led to Roberto Mancini saying that 'the Italian national team should be Italian. An Italian player deserves to play for the national team, while someone who wasn't born in Italy, even if they have relatives, I don't think they deserve to.' It's nothing new for Italy: they won the World Cup in 2006 with Argentinian Mauro Camoranesi in the side. He moved to Italy at the ripe old age of 23, didn't sing the national anthem, spoke in Spanish after the game when he dedicated the victory in the final in Berlin to the people back in his neighbourhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires – roughly 7,000 miles from Rome. As if more confusion was needed, he now manages in Mexico and his middle name is German. Italy won the World Cup in 2006 with the Argentinian Mauro Camoranesi in their squad . Roberto Mancini, the former Manchester City manager, said the Italian national team should be Italian only . Italy's casual approach to 'Italianness' when it comes to football stretches back nearly 100 years: midfielder Luis Monti played in a World Cup final for Argentina in 1930, and then won the 1934 tournament with Italy. Italy of course are not the only ones. Spain called up Brazilian Diego Costa, and England have done it too: Raheem Sterling was born in Jamaica, but there is a difference. Sterling moved to England aged five. And this is an important point: Mancini is wrong to believe you have to be born in the country for which you play: there are circumstances which may lead to you being born in one country, but brought up in another. The truth is that Sterling is proud of his Jamaican roots, but feels English. 'Irish Blood, English Heart' sang Morrissey, summing up the complexity of identity in four words. Diego Costa is another high-profile player who was born somewhere other than the country he plays for . Raheem Sterling was born in Jamaica but has lived in England since the age of five . There are plenty of English-born players who feel Irish because of their family history – a father from Ireland perhaps. Would it be wrong to deny them the chance to play for Ireland? I think so. Back to Camoranesi, who even after winning the World Cup for Italy, said he felt Argentine. Italy and Spain are stretching credibility with their foreign internationals. And perhaps the worst of all is Gordon Strachan selecting Matt Ritchie. The Bournemouth star admitted he had not even been to Scotland before his call-up and debut last week. He belted out the national anthem like he was one of The Proclaimers. No rules were broken because his dad was born in Edinburgh, but how Scottish can Ritchie feel if at the age of 25 he had failed to make the effort to even visit the country of his father's birth? Good luck to him, but the whole mess raises questions about the nature and future of international football. Matt Ritchie of Bournemouth had never been to Scotland before making his debut for them last week . Ritchie's father was born in Edinburgh, making him eligible to play for Scotland . When one country faces another country on a football pitch, shouldn't the main purpose of that match be to see how 11 players from one nation fares against 11 players from a different nation? Isn't that a fundamental premise and prerequisite of international football? If it isn't, and the international game has become a free for all involving bending the rules so that it no longer matters where you were born and which nationality makes your heart beat stronger, then what is the point of it. When I go to see England play against Italy I want to see the best English players play against the best Italian players. Not a few ringers who aren't good enough to play for other countries. Of course, clinging on to a view that footballers should only play for the country in which they were born will these days lead to accusations of xenophobia or discrimination. But those accusations are lazy and unintelligent. International football should always be about one country against another. There is nothing wrong or racist about that. But a Brazilian playing for Spain, an Argentine for Italy and several Englishmen playing for Scotland dilutes the passion of the occasion. It's become more about players enhancing their careers when it should be about the passion you feel for your country. And that just isn't right.","National teams increasingly field players born outside their country .

"Steve Howey was in England’s Euro 96 squad that reached the semi-finals. Wolves’ striker Steve Bull was in the England squad that only missed out on a World Cup final in 1990 after another penalty shootout failure. I applaud them, and I certainly don’t mean any disrespect, but if you’re honest you’ll agree it’s hard to believe what Steve and Steve achieved. England are looking strong and should have a good chance at the European Championship next year . Roy Hodgson has an exciting squad at his disposal and England should go deep into the tournament . England players head out of the Wembley tunnel for the second half of their Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania . What it shows is that you don’t have to have 23 truly top class players in your squad to make an impact at a tournament. So what’s stopping England next summer? History – that is all. And the right partner for Gary Cahill. If one of John Stones, Phil Jones or Chris Smalling – or maybe a centre half who might burst on to the scene next season – can show the quality and consistency needed to make himself a regular in the England team then that’s Roy Hodgson’s last problem solved. All other departments are looking healthy, fitness notwithstanding. Goalkeeper Joe Hart is looking the best he’s ever looked. Finding a partner for Gary Cahill in central defence is Hodgson's main concern ahead of the tournament . Phil Jones played alongside Cahill against Lithuania but the place is far from nailed down . Goalkeeper Joe Hart has performed consistently well for club Manchester City and country . We have athletic young full backs who thrive in the modern game at club level; Cahill is still trusted by Jose Mourinho, and has another year of learning off John Terry to come . In midfield it’s now a shock if Jordan Henderson doesn't start for club and country; Adam Lallana is looking a class act after an injury-hit difficult start at Liverpool. Michael Carrick is at last being trusted by an England manager and if Roy keeps ignoring those who say he isn't quick enough (his reading of the game more than makes up for that) or doesn't score enough goals (the goal counters playing FIFA have a lot to answer for) he may well be rewarded. Fabian Delph looks at home in an England shirt if he keeps his discipline and then there are other talents like Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ross Barkley. Up front England have their best options since Euro 96. Danny Welbeck has work-rate in abundance, he also has quality and goals. Jordan Henderson has tied down his place in the centre of the England midfield . Michael Carrick appears to have won the trust of manager Roy Hodgson at last . Raheem Sterling was electric on Friday and if he can replicate that at the Euros, then he certainly is a player opponents will be scared of. Look at his trick and cross for Harry Kane’s goal – that’s top class. Wayne Rooney is on the brink of becoming an England legend, his focus and ambition has been sharpened by the captaincy and by the reality that he’s running out of time to make a significant impact at a major tournament. Theo Walcott’s pace could be useful, and of course Harry Kane is ripping it up whenever he sets foot on a football pitch. When I think about the players England have, I feel optimistic. These players are playing in a way that is pleasing on the eye, credit to Hodgson for that. But then I think of the World Cup and how horrible that was from the fans' point of view. And then I remember every other tournament we’ve been in since Euro 96 and we’ve either not played very well, or not got very far. Raheem Sterling capped an electric performance against Lithuania on Friday with a goal . Captaincy has improved Wayne Rooney even more and he is on the verge of becoming an England legend . Harry Kane, who scored on debut against Lithuania, provides further reinforcement up front . History demands a negative outlook and it’s up to the manager and the players to prove that wrong. They’re playing some good stuff, albeit in some straightforward qualifiers, but then some big nations are not sitting top of their groups right now - Germany, Italy, Holland, Spain and Belgium most notably. And England’s group may be comfortable, but arguably the best performance came in the toughest game since the World Cup, away to Switzerland, a team who got further at the World Cup and who are above us in the world rankings. The challenge for Hodgson is whether he can maintain those standards when the opposition is tougher in France 2016. There is one thing Hodgson has that so many previous England managers lacked. He has the trust of the players and that could be vital. England imploded in South Africa in 2010 when Capello picked the wrong players and then treated them appallingly at the tournament. Unlike Fabio Capello in 2010, Hodgson has the complete trust of his squad . Hodgson resisted calls to replace the in-form Danny Welbeck with Kane and was proved correct . For the Lithuania game on Friday, Hodgson ignored the calls to start Kane and that was exactly the right thing to do. Not because Kane isn't good enough – far from it. But Hodgson knew that if he dropped Welbeck the rest of the players would not – could not – respect that decision. Welbeck has been excellent in qualifying so far for England – there was no reason to drop a man who scored both goals in our toughest qualifier so far. If a player has done the job asked of him, there is no reason to drop him. If a manager drops that player, that decision instantly affects the relationship between players and manager. At international level, with limited time to nurture or repair relationships, a manager cannot afford to lose the trust of his squad. There are lots of positives about the current England situation. But as fans can we afford to be positive when we’ve been let down so many times in the last 20 years? I want England to win the European Championship, but until it happens it will always be an unrealistic dream.","England have their strongest and most talented squad in many years .

"I brought you the Manchester United haters test a few weeks ago – you can read it HERE. Now it’s time for the ‘Wayne Rooney Test.’ What’s the first thing you think about when you hear the name Wayne Rooney? a) How close he is to breaking scoring records with Manchester United and England . b) Any of the following - Being punched in his kitchen by Phil Bardsley, demanding a massive salary at Manchester United or barking into the camera at the 2010 World Cup and at West Ham. If you answered b) then I’d question your passion for football. Wayne Rooney played a key role in Manchester United's win over Tottenham on Sunday . Rooney scored the third goal for United in their win at Old Trafford . Liverpool can't expect any loyalty from Raheem Sterling if they are not prepared to offer him the same deal as Daniel Sturridge . Chelsea look knackered... Jose Mourinho must start putting his faith in youth or he'll blow the Premier League . One thing I have discovered about England is that if you come from humble beginnings, but go on to improve your lot in life, the reaction of the rest of the country will be split. As you drive by in your expensive car, some will say ‘good on him, he’s done well for himself.’ Others though will be less generous. They might say ‘Lucky sod’ or ‘he doesn’t deserve that.’ Jealousy is a terrible thing. These people will focus on anything but football. And Rooney is a classic example. I take one look at Rooney’s career and I’m seriously impressed. I find it hard to look at it any other way. Rooney celebrated by mocking the story that he was knocked out in a playful fight with Phil Bardsley . Rooeny collapsed to the floor after scoring in reference to being 'knocked out' by Bardsley . VIDEO Van Gaal refuses to discuss 'ridiculous' Rooney story . But others concentrate on things away from the football pitch and twist them into a reason to condemn Rooney. They see a working-class kid who played football in the streets of Liverpool, who made it big because of his talent, demanded big wages, lives in a massive house and they can’t stand him for it. They can’t handle that he did something they didn’t. They refuse to applaud someone who has made the most of his talent, realised his dreams and become very wealthy in the process. I even had one Twitter clown so obsessed with bringing Rooney down that he told me he had a violent streak – just because he fouled someone. So if you are a football lover, what was the big story on Sunday? Was it Rooney leading Manchester United superbly, scoring a brilliant goal and getting three crucial points against Spurs? Rooney was criticised by some fans for swearing into a TV camera after scoring at West Ham in 2011 . Rooney is closing in on goalscoring records for both Manchester Untied and England . Or was it Rooney messing around in his own home with a mate and doing absolutely nothing wrong? Rooney’s celebration said it all. It’s a joke. I understand why it’s a story of course – it’s a great scoop. But is it a reason to hammer Rooney? And should he be judged as a footballer because of it? Those who can’t handle Rooney’s success need to look at themselves. Are they upset because he achieved in life while they didn’t? Or do they dribble and drool over their keyboards because they hate everything about Manchester United? Rooney gets into every team in the world – from Man United to Munich to Madrid and Man City. That’s my opinion, and of course, not everybody will share it. But he’s not done badly for himself in his career. He went to Manchester United and became a club legend – that’s not easy to achieve given the rich history of that great club. Sometimes he could have conducted himself better on and off the field, but I cannot see how any of that stuff deflects from his brilliance as a footballer. Unless you hate Man United, or you’re jealous of Rooney’s success and wealth.

"The Raheem Sterling contract situation at Liverpool is coming to the boil, after the latest snub from the player’s representatives, and an indication that talks won’t resume until the summer. Brendan Rodgers says he’s relaxed but I find that hard to believe. He won’t want to lose Sterling, a talent that he can rightly be proud of, and justifiably claim he has helped turn into a star quality player. But I can’t understand why Liverpool have consistently put the message out that there will not be a problem with the Sterling situation. The outcome of that policy is that Sterling looks greedy – why do the football club want to make one of their star players look bad in the eyes of the supporters? Raheem Sterling's contract situation at Liverpool is unlikely to be resolved until the summer . Sterling and his representatives are understood to have knocked back the latest £100,000-a-week offer . Chelsea look knackered... Jose Mourinho must start putting his faith in youth or he'll blow the Premier League . If you view Wayne Rooney as anything other than a fantastic player then you have no passion for football . So now there is a situation locally with fans and the press are questioning his representatives, with the Liverpool Echo declaring this week that Sterling ‘needs to ask who is looking after his best interests.’ The answer to that question is simple. In football terms, Liverpool have looked after him. In the same way QPR looked after him before he was snapped up by the Reds, and in the same way Real Madrid might look after him if they choose to pay big money. Liverpool Football Club can’t expect too much loyalty from a player who was happy to leave QPR after seven years at Loftus Road. What goes around comes around, I guess. In financial terms - his agent is looking after his best interests, obviously. He’s got a family, he wants to set himself up comfortably for the rest of his life, and I can’t think of a reason why a player shouldn’t be allowed to do that. Brendan Rodgers says he is relaxed about Sterling's contract situation at Liverpool . Sterling left QPR after seven years at the club . Sterling’s contract runs out in 2017 and there is no way Liverpool will want this impasse to continue. If he even approaches the final year of his current deal without this being resolved, Liverpool could lose out. The days of a player accepting less than he feels he is worth because he is at a great club that gave him a big opportunity are long gone. It’s naive to think otherwise. A five-year deal of £100,000 a week has been rejected by Sterling. Daniel Sturridge is on £150,000 a week. Is there a reason why Sterling shouldn’t be on the same as Sturridge? Sterling is younger, but I’m not sure why age should come into it. Sterling has proved he can be a match winner, a key player and is a regular starter for Liverpool – same as Sturridge. Sterling’s fitness record is considerably better, which is unfortunate for Sturridge, but when an agent is negotiating on behalf of his player it is definitely something which counts in Sterling’s favour. The big difference between the careers of Sturridge and Sterling is that Sterling has proved himself at a much younger age. Why should he accept a less lucrative deal because of that? Makes no sense. If a player is committing to a club long-term, then the deal has to be right. The figures are ridiculous – but this is the Premier League where players' salaries are abnormally high. That’s not news. And to expect Sterling to launch his own one-man crusade for fairer wages in football is laughable. Daniel Sturridge is on a contract believed to worth £150,000 per week at Liverpool . VIDEO Rodgers has eye on second place . It’s a harsh reality for some who haven’t quite caught up with how modern football works, but Sterling is an excellent footballer, and his agent is working for his player to get the best deal for him.

If the agent had accepted that then Sterling would surely have sacked him.","Raheem Sterling is stalling over signing a new contract at Liverpool .

"Being at Old Trafford on Saturday was a surreal experience – and I’m not even referring to the Wes Brown-John O’Shea red card cock-up. Manchester United dominated the game, were by far the better side, and they won comfortably. But their fans were not satisfied. At one point in the first half, a deep United corner found its way back to David de Gea in goal. Boos echoed around Old Trafford, and then a loud chant rang out: 'Attack! Attack! Attack, attack, attack!' Wayne Rooney leaps for joy after scoring a brace against Sunderland on Saturday as Manchester United won . United only took control of the game after Wes Brown was sent off against his former club . There is a lack of realism among United’s critics and some of the supporters this season. They need to understand and accept that it used to be champagne and caviar with Fergie; last season was bread and water; this season it’s a bag of chips with one of those little bottles of cheap, weak continental beer. David Moyes took the club in the wrong direction in so many ways. We’re waiting to see if Louis van Gaal is the right man, but United’s football doesn’t look good when compared with the recent greatness. Between 2007 and 2013 Manchester United had the most successful period in their history. They won the title five times in that period. They made the Champions League final three times in a four-year period, winning it once. It would not be wrong to say United in that spell were second only to Barcelona in the world, and that Barca side under Pep Guardiola is the best club side I have ever seen. In the years before Sir Alex Ferguson retired, United were phenomenal. That side was arguably their best ever. Despite the win there were sections of the home crowd that were not totally satisfied with the performance . The champagne and caviar days that supporters were used to under Sir Alex Ferguson are over . Some great players contributed to that run of success – Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Wayne Rooney up front. Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic – possibly the Premier League’s greatest ever centre-half partnership – were rocks at the back. Edwin van der Sar was the long-awaited replacement for Peter Schmeichel in goal. And of course Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs were still weaving magic spells on the pitch in that side, while Gary Neville was as solid and dependable off the pitch as on it. Of all those names only one is still playing for United, and he scored both goals in Saturday’s win. Another – Michael Carrick – has been injured for most of this season. There is an array of talent and character listed there, and that cannot easily be replaced. Shorn of such star quality, a massive rebuild job is now underway. And having sunk to an unimaginable low last season under frankly the wrong manager, expectations of Manchester United need readjustment. Many of Ferguson's title-winning team in 2013 have left the club and it is hard to replace those players . Ferguson celebrates winning his final Premier League title in 2013 before retiring . Some United observers seem to think that the signing of a £60million player should automatically return the side to the breathtaking football from a few years ago. It doesn’t work like that – it’s about building a team after that glorious side under Ferguson was decimated. The football has been far from brilliant but it will take time. Angel di Maria started life at Old Trafford on fire, but injuries affected him badly, and a burglary has unsettled his young family in a new foreign country, and that’s clearly impacted on the player (although his pass to set up Ander Herrera’s goal at Swansea was sublime). In the first half on Saturday he was pretty awful but he was also targeted by Sunderland. First Lee Cattermole, then Jordi Gomez, clattered into him, yet somehow escaped bookings. It’s too easy to break Di Maria’s spirit on the pitch at the moment. But as Gus Poyet said after Saturday’s game, United fans have nothing to worry about if they remember this is Di Maria, who is actually one of the world’s best players most of the time. Louis van Gaal is rebuilding the Manchester United team and it is a work in progress . Angel di Maria has been criticised in recent weeks and was awful in the first half against Sunderland . There are some surprising positives for United this season – notably Ashley Young, who has been consistently impressive and effective out wide. But it’s a work very much in progress. I understand that United fans want to play football the Fergie way. But you’re asking too much too soon. A few years ago the most successful United side in the club’s rich history dominated domestically and were the only side to challenge the brilliance of Barcelona. Fast forward a couple of seasons and that team has been ripped to shreds. The rebuild is underway. But it’s unfair to expect 'Fergie football' so soon.","Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 at Old Trafford on Saturday .

"Wouldn’t it be embarrassing for Jose Mourinho if he blew the title and gifted it to that ‘specialist in failure’ Arsene Wenger? Would the Special One be able to show his face in English football again after such humiliation? It’s a big call if you think the Gunners will win the title, but history suggests there is a chance Chelsea could implode. This time last year Mourinho was reeling from an unlikely 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa. That day at Villa Park Chelsea huffed and puffed, Ramires was sent off, and Mourinho was charged by the FA after he went on to the pitch to question referee Chris Foy. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho gestures to his players during the 1-1 draw with Southampton . Mourinho saw Chelsea draw with Saints in the same week they crashed out of the Champions League . Liverpool can't expect any loyalty from Raheem Sterling if they are not prepared to offer him the same deal as Daniel Sturridge . If you view Wayne Rooney as anything other than a fantastic player then you have no passion for football . They went on to drop points at Crystal Palace and at home to Sunderland and Norwich. In fact, in the world of hypothetical football that we all scoff at but all think about, if you add on even less than half the points Chelsea dropped in the last nine games of last season they would have won the title. A year on, Chelsea are huffing and puffing again, dropping points again, and Mourinho went early with his campaign against referees. Will history repeat itself, or has Mourinho learned from his mistakes? The Chelsea team looks knackered, doesn’t it? They’ve made a habit recently of drawing home games, and that cost them dearly in Europe. Why is it happening? Youth and energy are missing, and I’m thinking of three players in particular who might have made a difference, either off the bench, or pitched in to games here and there to energise the team. Those players are Kevin de Bruyne, Patrick Bamford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Arsene Wenger has seen Arsenal move to within a point of second-placed Manchester City . Mourinho has won a lot of praise for his transfer dealings and I can see why. In simple terms, he has improved his best XI and balanced the books at the same time. Chelsea may well go on to win the title and that has to be a successful season for them. But how can Mourinho explain that Champions League exit? How does he account for the lethargy his players have been displaying for the past two months? The answer lies in the quality of his squad – or rather the lack of it. And that’s down to errors made by Mourinho that have almost gone unnoticed. De Bruyne has been on fire for Wolfsburg this season to maintain their position as closest challengers to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. Chelsea's season unravelled last year when they lost away at Aston Villa and Mourinho was charged . Chelsea had a bad week by their standards last week after going out of Europe and drawing in the league . I can’t help thinking he might have provided some energy and quality at this stage of the season. Mourinho’s decision to sell seemed to be made in haste – the Belgian made fewer than 10 appearances for Chelsea. There was a suggestion that issues off the field could have forced De Bruyne out. I cannot believe that, not with Mourinho’s skills as a man-manager. Letting him go doesn’t look good on Mourinho and hindsight is a wonderful thing of course - but Jose is paid a lot of money to be the ‘Special One’ who spots the kind of things ordinary mortals cannot. I’m also a little sceptical of Jose’s insistence that he will put youth in the team some time soon. When he made that promise recently he was referring to academy product Loftus-Cheek, who has had game time for Chelsea this season of course, but not much – roughly 10 minutes in total. Even with Nemanja Matic out, deep playmaker Loftus-Cheek didn’t get a look in, Mourinho instead preferring to put a centre half in that position. Kevin de Bruyne was sold by Mourinho and the Belgian has been in excellent form for Wolfsburg . Patrick Bamford scored two excellent goals for promotion-chasing Middlesbrough against Ipswich . Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) has not seen much first-team action at Chelsea this season . Mourinho says the only reason he hasn't seen more action is because Chelsea have been under pressure to win lots of games in different competitions. I would have thought that would be the perfect reason to use a player like that rather than keep him on the sidelines. And what happens next season when Chelsea are competing on all fronts again? Will he be ready then? Strange logic from the Chelsea manager, and the fact they failed to make the quarter-finals of the Champions League this season proves that he didn't get it right. The reliance on Diego Costa up front has cost Chelsea. Loic Remy is decent enough, but looks like he needs to play regularly to be truly effective in the Premier League, and Didier Drogba will always be a club legend, but won’t always be the answer coming off the bench. When you need energy, a striker who has just turned 37 isn’t likely to be your best plan. Oscar was Chelsea's only outfield player on Sunday under the age of 24 while Didier Drogba is 37 . Did you see young Chelsea striker Bamford score two brilliant goals at the weekend on loan at Middlesbrough? His second came after a truly world-class piece of imagination that had me out of my seat. The ball came to him just inside the Ipswich half, he had his back to goal. He spun round, without the ball, deceived the bewildered defender, then chased the ball into the box and fired home. Remember the Pele moment in 1970 when he dummied the keeper? It had a hint of that about it. It was that kind of quality from Bamford, except the youngster finished the move off with a goal. It was the kind of creativity Chelsea have looked devoid of in recent weeks. VIDEO Mixed feelings for Mourinho over Saints draw . How the top of the Barclays Premier League looks . This kid has done his time on loan in the Championship before this season, so why send him back there? Surely his presence at Chelsea would have been no bigger a risk than re-signing an ageing Drogba? You could argue he’s too young and inexperienced - you could even suggest he might not be good enough. The truth is we don’t know if Bamford could have contributed to Chelsea’s push on four fronts this season. But we do know the striking options Mourinho went with were definitely not good enough. Has Mourinho done his mate at Middlesbrough Aitor Karanka a favour at the expense of his own club Chelsea? I’ll believe Mourinho’s commitment to the Chelsea Academy when I see it. De Bruyne, Bamford and Loftus-Cheek could have provided something currently missing from the Chelsea team. Two of them are doing it elsewhere, another is receiving high praise at Stamford Bridge, but has gone missing. Of Sunday’s outfield players who started for Chelsea only one – Oscar - was under the age of 24. If Jose’s tired team make the same errors in the run-in as last season then the title race is still wide open. CHELSEA . Hull (away) - March 22 . Stoke (home) - April 4 . QPR (away) - April 12 .

"Five years ago England beat Spain to win the Under 17 European Championships. The winning goal came from a striker who burst powerfully into the box, between two opponents, before firing home a sweet shot into the corner beyond the keeper. A cool finish on a big occasion. A few months later, I saw him come on as a substitute in the Championship and display some clever touches and neat footwork. He stood out as one of the more technically gifted players on display in the second tier game. Fast forward a few more months and that teenage striker - playing in the Championship - picked up the ball in his own half, ran towards the opposition goal, beat two defenders, wrong-footed the keeper and slotted into an empty net. Connor Wickham made a disastrous decision to move to Sunderland when his career was flying . In the Championship, he impressed and looked like one of the most technically gifted players on the pitch . Two weeks after that he scored a hat-trick. In the summer of 2011 he made what has proved to be a catastrophic career move. He signed for Sunderland. To those who didn't follow Connor Wickham's career before he went to the North-East, all they will know of him is that he is highly-paid, and not exactly outstanding. Sure, there was a flurry of goals to help Sunderland stay up at the back end of last season, but that has been it. Stories emerged last season of his big spending - £17,500 on a gold bottle of champagne, and a £140,000 Ferrari. These barely make a dent in his £60,000-a-week salary, and they look cheap compared with team-mate Steven Fletcher and his £260,000 Lamborghini parked next to his £160,000 Bentley. These underachieving Sunderland players don't mind showing off their wealth, do they? Stories have emerged of Wickham's extravagant spending - £17,500 on a bottle of champagne, for example . In a loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, he also impressed - there is no mistaking his ability as a footballer . Is it something about the club that means these players have no self-awareness whatsoever? Is nobody at the club telling them that all the time they're so truly terrible on the pitch, it might be a good idea to keep things on the down low off the pitch? One of Wickham's managers called him 'a playboy model,' and said he needed a 'slap in the face' to help him realise his talent. And make no mistake, Wickham is a very talented footballer. Unfortunately he chose the wrong club. Since Wickham joined Sunderland he has had 10 different managers at club level, including his loan spells. That is not the ideal environment for young talent to be nurtured and flourish. Managers come and go so quickly that the pressure for immediate results is huge, so the time a manager can devote to individual players on and off the pitch is restricted. Wickham should be spearheading England Under 21s' Euro campaign but he has not been selected . The 21-year-old has been stuck out on the left for Sunderland when he is clearly a centre-forward . At a more stable club, the chances are that Wickham might have a better environment to succeed. On the pitch he has been stuck out on the left when he is obviously a centre forward. That's where he did so well at the end of last season. Off the pitch, has the so-called 'playboy model' been guided properly? Evidence suggests not: Gus Poyet even admitted he ignored Wickham when he first arrived at the Stadium of Light as manager. He revealed he didn't even sit down and talk to the player. Sunderland signed Wickham but their duty doesn't stop there. They need to provide that player with every chance to succeed. Hopefully stability will reign at the Stadium of Light in the near future, Wickham will get the right guidance off the field, and he will be allowed to play to his strengths on the field. Sunderland need to provide their players with a chance to succeed but Wickham has not been guided . Sunderland are a basket case of a club and Wickham made the wrong decision when he joined them . Five years on from scoring a wonderful goal to win the European Championship for England I am disappointed Wickham is nowhere near the senior squad as we prepare for a Euro 2016 qualifier this week. Even more worrying, repeated pull-outs from the Under 21 squads mean he's way down the pecking order, even with injuries this week. He should be spearheading our charge to the Euros in the Czech Republic this summer. The ongoing debate about English talent failing to develop after promising early signs needs to look at examples like Wickham. All the ability, but no significant strides made. He should have made that progression. The fact that he hasn't is down to Sunderland being a complete basket case of a club. Let's hope for Wickham's sake – and England's – the next chapter for Sunderland will help him become the player he should be.","Connor Wickham's career was flying while he was at Ipswich Town .

"Kenny McDowall would welcome Ally McCoist back into the Rangers dug-out were he to make a surprise return from gardening leave. The question of who leads the squad for the remainder of a flagging promotion campaign is high on the agenda for Dave King and the new Ibrox directors. McDowall became caretaker manager when McCoist left under the previous regime before Christmas, but began working his own notice period in January. Kenny McDowall and Ally McCoist (right) worked together before the latter left Rangers on gardening leave . Interim chairman Paul Murray has stated that new board — which has already been approached by number of managerial candidates as they weigh up a longer-term appointment — will have to speak to both men to ‘ask what they want to do’ given that they remain employees. A financial agreement over McCoist’s remaining contract may well be the more likely outcome, but McDowall would be happy to see his old colleague back for the Championship run-in were that to transpire. ‘I was working with Ally, so obviously that would appeal to me,’ said McDowall. ‘But it’s a difficult one to answer because the board will obviously have their own ideas.’ McDowall said it wasn't for him to decide but that he would welcome Walter Smith back to the club too . Another former Ibrox boss, Walter Smith, refused at the weekend to completely rule out what would be a third stint in charge, but stressed that he wasn’t looking for it ‘in any way, shape or form.’ McDowall was first-team coach during Smith’s hugely successful second spell and admitted his presence would provide a guaranteed boost. ‘It’s not for me to decide,’ said McDowall, who is keen for coach Ian Durrant to return to first-team duties after being demoted by the old board. ‘It’s for Walter to discuss with the board, if that’s the case. ‘But Walter Smith going anywhere would absolutely give the place a lift. He is a great man and has done so much in the game. Why would you not, at the end of the day? But, as I say, it’s not my call. McCoist left the Ibrox club before Christmas on gardening leave and McCall later did the same . ‘We had a very successful time when he was here but times are different. It’s been a tough, tough time we’ve had since he left. ‘Ally did a fantastic job without getting a whole lot of credit. But that will come eventually.’ The new directors are likely to speak with McDowall about his own future once tonight’s game against Queen of the South is out of the way. They met yesterday with former Fulham boss Felix Magath, who is a Rangers shareholder and has ideas on how the footballing department could move forward. But he is not thought to be an immediate candidate to replace McDowall. Felix Magath is not thought to be an immediate candidate to replace McDowall despite a meeting with the club . ‘Every day, there is someone else being quoted — Walter, Felix Magath, Billy Davies, Stuart McCall, Terry Butcher,’ said McDowall. ‘All of those guys are out there and it’s the board’s right to talk to whoever they want. It doesn’t really affect me, because talk about replacing me has been there since I took the job as caretaker manager. ‘I’m here and ready to meet the new board whenever they want to meet me. I’m working my notice. If they want to keep me, they can keep me. If they want me to go then I’ll go. ‘There is nothing tricky about it. I’m here and I’m doing my best to try and get the team through a difficult period.’","Kenny McDowall would welcome Ally McCoist back in the Rangers dug-out .

"Professor David Nutt was sacked from his job as the UK Government's chief adviser on drugs after saying saying ecstasy and LSD were less harmful than alcohol . A British scientist trying to reveal what the human brain looks like on LSD is asking the public to fund his research after official channels refused. In the controversial study, 20 British volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on LSD. Early results are said to be 'exciting' but the full findings must wait until funding can be found to complete the research. The research, being conducted at Cardiff University, is being led by the former drugs tsar David Nutt. Professor Nutt was sacked from his job as the Government's chief adviser on drugs in 2009 after saying saying ecstasy and LSD were less harmful than alcohol. At a briefing in London this week, he spoke out against restrictions on research on recreational drugs which he called 'the worst censorship in the history of science'. Having been turned down by 'classic funders', he is now campaigning to raise the £25,000 needed to carry out analysis of the brain scanning data from the science crowdfunding site Walacea.com. He compared current attitudes to studying recreational drugs with the Catholic church's clampdown on pioneering Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in the 17th century. 'The only comparable example is when the Catholic church banned the telescope in 1616,' said Professor Nutt, who is based at Imperial College London. 'We've banned research on psychedelic drugs and other drugs like cannabis for 50 years. 'Truly in terms of the amount of wasted opportunity, it's way greater than the banning of the telescope. This is a truly appalling level of censorship.' The LSD study involved giving the volunteers injections of a 75 microgram dose of LSD before probing the activity of their brains. Two kinds of scans were used, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (Meg), which measures small magnetic fields generated in the brain. None of the participants reported having a bad experience, but three described some anxiety and temporary paranoia. Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, also from the Imperial College team, said the dose of LSD given to the volunteers was a 'tiny speck'. But he added: 'The effects are quite profound. It would be described as a moderate dose, but a moderate dose of LSD can still produce a profound state of consciousness. In the controversial study, 20 British volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on LSD . 'I wouldn't say that it's a dangerous experiment, but I would say that LSD has potential negative effects. 'Probably the crucial one is a bad trip. It's not uncommon for people to have anxiety during a psychedelic drug experience .. the experience can be nightmarish at times. 'What's especially intriguing.. is that people can have a very challenging experience yet afterwards they seem to be somehow psychologically refreshed by the experience. That's how they describe it.' He said there had been no evidence of psychedelic drugs such as LSD triggering psychosis in research studies, although there were anecdotal reports of this occurring through recreational use. Professor Nutt said LSD was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating 'many conditions', in particular alcoholism. Since it was made illegal in 1967 it had only been the subject of one clinical study in Switzerland and two neuroscience studies. 'That is an absurd amount of censorship,' Professor Nutt added. He stood by the claim that got him into trouble with the Government - that psychoactive drugs such as ecstasy and LSD were considerably less harmful than alcohol. 'Interesting drugs that we've been researching like MDNA (ecstasy) and LSD, are relatively low in terms of harms, considerably less even than cannabis and very much less than alcohol,' he said. 'But no research is done on them. 'The law is actually wrong. The law is supposed to be based on evidence of harm but isn't.' He maintained that the risks of taking LSD had been 'massively exaggerated' by the CIA and US Drug Enforcement Administration. Initial funding for the LSD study came from Imperial College and the Beckley Foundation, which promotes drug policy reform and research into the medical benefits of psychoactive substances. Professor Nutt said LSD (a molecule of the drug is pictured) was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating 'many conditions', in particular alcoholism . Professor Nutt said he approached the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust for the outstanding funding to no avail. 'The issue always comes 'well look, these are recreational drugs', and the recreational label is so powerful I think it scares people off,' he said. 'I personally think the neuroscience that's been uncovered by these drugs is revolutionary. 'This research is so important it should be funded to the tune of millions.' Dr Carhart-Harris said: 'This is the first LSD brain imaging study that's ever been conducted. 'We think it's essentially important to understand how these drugs that are widely used and seem to have this therapeutic potential work in the brain. Once we've done that, we want to look at how these drugs can be put to good use.' A previous brain scanning study was carried out by the same team on volunteers under the influence of the magic mushroom active ingredient psilocybin. It showed that the drug affected the brain's 'hub structure' and led to more connections between regions that are not normally linked. This, it is thought, may have a bearing on creative thinking. In May, the team is planning a study, funded by the Medical Research Council, looking at how psilocybin might be helpful in treating depression.","David Nutt was sacked from his post of the Government's chief adviser on drugs after saying saying ecstasy and LSD were less harmful than alcohol .

"Ashley Judd is vowing to press charges against anyone who used vulgar and threatening language to harass her on Twitter last Sunday during the Southeastern Conference basketball championship. The 46-year-old Insurgent actress and longtime University of Kentucky fan received violent threats on social media after she posted a tweet saying that she thought the University of Arkansas was 'playing dirty' while watching the team play her alma mater. 'I am pressing charges,' she told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts on Monday. Scroll down for video . Taking a stand: Ashley Judd told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts that she plans on pressing charges against those who harassed her on Twitter during the Southeastern Conference basketball championship . Online trolls: Ashley explained that after she tweeted that she thought the University of Arkansas was 'playing dirty' during the game, she received hateful comments that were extremely explicit and offensive . Ashley explained that if she was in a 'more calm state of mind' she would have perhaps phrased her initial tweet about Arkansas differently but noted that people should not be aggressively harassing one another on social media . She responded to the graphic and hateful comments she received that day reposting them on Twitter. 'When I express a stout opinion during #MarchMadness I am called a w****, c***, threatened with sexual violence. Not okay,' she tweeted. She added: 'I am sorry to retweet but this is a typical example. “@Leeroy_MAX: @AshleyJudd Go s*** on Cal's two inch d*** ye B**** w****.”' Shameful messages: Before the premiere of her new film Insurgent, the 46-year-old also sat down with NBC's Craig Melvin to discuss the amount of gender violence directed toward her on social media . 'Everyone needs to take personal responsibility for what they write and not allowing this misinterpretation and shaming culture on social media to exist,' she said on MSNBC, before insisting that she was going to file legal complaints against every Twitter user who sent her violent or abusive messages. Ashley also spoke to NBC national correspondent Craig Melvin before last night's premiere of her upcoming movie Insurgent. 'The amount of gender violence that I experience is absolutely extraordinary,' she said. 'And a significant part of my day today will be spent filing police reports at home about gender violence that's directed at me in social media.' Outrage: Ashley took to Twitter to speak out against the violent threats that she received during and after the game . Hitting back: The star wanted to highlight the sort of abuse that she received and shine a spotlight on those who think it is acceptable to use such violent language on Twitter . Super fan: Ashley can be seen cheering on the University of Kentucky during the SEC tournament final last Sunday . 'That many people?' Craig asked her. 'That many people. That explicit. That overt,' she replied. Since speaking out about the abuse, Ashley has received an outpouring of support from her fans on the social media site, many of whom have praised her for having the courage to pursue action against her abusers. 'Great interview w/ Thomas Roberts. The ""c"" words I choose are caring and classy!! Oh and go cats!!' one person tweeted. Another another added: 'As [an] Arkansas Razorback fan, I am very sorry for the pain that any Hog fan might have caused you. Simply unacceptable!!!' Number one fan: The 46-year-old stood in the stands as she watched her alma mater play the University of Arkansas during the championship game . Big smooch: ESPN broadcaster Dick Vitale gave the University of Kentucky fan a kiss before the game started . Shake it off: The next day, Ashley attended the New York City premiere of her upcoming movie Insurgent . Despite having to endure such a horrific spate of abuse at the hands of the Twitter trolls, the game wasn't all bad for Ashley, who was able to watch her team claim a 78-63 win over their opposition. The screen star also ended up on the receiving end of a very enthusiastic pre-game kiss from ESPN announcer Dick Vitale. Shortly before the teams took to the court, Dick was pictured leaning in to kiss Ashley smack dab on the lips while she leaned away, her face in a tortured expression. She later took to Twitter to insist that the less-than-romantic smooch was actually her idea: 'Only surprise in my planting one on dear @DickieV is I've adored him for 10 years.

Father to son: NBC Nightly News host Lester Holt, right, shared a sweet exchanged with his son Stefan, left, who handed over to him after a 5pm newcast . The two also traded jokes about Stefan's bedtime, as the younger Holt was already 'up late' covering the evening newscast for a colleague. Indeed, both Holts crossed paths on the airwaves because they were filling in for somebody else - Lester Holt for the scandal-hit Brian WIlliams. Holt, previously the Nightly News weekend anchor, stepped up to the weeknight job after Williams was yanked off the flagship newscast by NBC bosses. It followed repeated revelations that Williams had lied about his personal involvement in stories, including being hit by an RPG over Iraq. NBC, which said he had violated the trust of their viewers, suspended Williams for six months without pay. He is one month in to the punishment. In his absence, Holt has managed to keep ratings steady at the Nightly News program.

"A lot of Gareth Bale’s friends and fans are letting their hearts rule their heads and are making themselves look spectacularly naive. Bale was stunning again for Wales in Israel. With a little bit of help from his friends – notably Joe Allen, Aaron Ramsey and Joe Ledley – he has spearheaded the charge to the top of Group B. Chris Coleman is arguably the luckiest manager in international football – Bale is shining for Wales at exactly the same time as the European Championship has been expanded, and it would be a huge failure if Wales didn’t qualify for the finals in France next year. Coleman is well on course to make history with his current squad. Gareth Bale scored two goals for Wales in Israel but has not been up to scratch for Real Madrid this season . Bale celebrates one of his two goals in Israel as Wales won their Euro 2016 qualifying match in Group B . Bale has been brilliant for Wales but his form for Real Madrid has left a lot to be desired in Spain . International football should be the best of one country against another... not a Brazilian playing for Spain, an Argentina in Italy colours or an English-born Scot . England's exciting squad and flawless form give real reasons for optimism ahead of Euro 2016... but only if Roy Hodgson can instil a positive mentality . But as brilliant as Bale has been for Wales, his form this season for Real Madrid is still a subject for debate. He hasn’t been good enough, and needs to step up to the plate between now and the end of the season to keep his reputation at the Bernebeu intact. His supporters have expressed their disgust at anyone who dares to question Bale’s Real Madrid credentials. Honestly, did these people think that Bale or any player for that matter, could go to a club the size of Real Madrid and not be scrutinised? It seems these people are unaware of the amazing history and traditions of this great club – and the demands that go with it. This isn’t the Welsh national team, where a couple of goals in Israel makes you a national treasure. This isn’t Spurs where reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League is a once-in-a-lifetime achievement. Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo vents his frustration next to team-mate Bale during a La Liga match . Bale has failed to meet the high standards at Real Madrid this season in front of football's harshest critics . No, this is Real Madrid, where they win their 10th European Cup and immediately ask if the players are good enough to win it again the following season. Where finishing behind Barcelona is almost regarded as a crime. Where finishing third last season behind Atletico Madrid AND Barca was seen as utter humiliation. Standards are spectacularly high at Real Madrid and it’s hard to make a case to support the notion that Bale has maintained the level he reached last season. As far as his Bernebeu future is concerned, Saturday’s man-of-the-match display in Haifa will have done nothing to appease the Madridistas. In a Wales shirt Bale is everywhere – it’s exhausting watching him. He scored two, he set up the other, he created more chances with some awesome passing. He ran at defenders, committing them, forcing fouls or mistakes from them. In short he was brilliant. Compare that with the Bale who shrunk, disappeared (dare I say hid?) in the Nou Camp in the second half of El Clasico the week before. Now you can see why Real Madrid fans are so frustrated with Bale. Unless his form and impact changes at club level, Bale could be on the way out of Real Madrid this summer. Bale scored recently against Levante to end a goal drought and covered his ears as if to mute the criticism . Bale could be on the way out of Madrid this summer if his form does not pick up by the end of the season . The club demands big-name signings every summer and Bale’s second-season slump may be enough to render him dispensable. It might seem harsh to some, but if you know how high the standards are at Real Madrid, then it’s perfectly normal. Bale should come back to the Barclays Premier League. He’d be the perfect signing for Arsenal in so many ways, but he’d also fit perfectly into Jose Mourinho’s way of thinking at Chelsea. Manchester City’s inertia in evolving their team could be tackled by the signing of Bale. But Manchester United should blow the others out of the water – they have bargaining chips in David de Gea or possibly Angel di Maria who has struggled to settle after his blistering start. Bale has the energy to raise United’s tempo and take them back to the big time. Whatever happens to Bale he should feel proud of his achievements. He has helped create special history at Real Madrid, and he’s on the brink of doing the same for Wales. Angel di Maria has struggled at Manchester United this season so far following his £59.7million move . United goalkeeper David de Gea could be used as a bargaining chip for Bale to leave Madrid this summer .","Gareth Bale shrunk, disappeared and even hid against Barcelona last week .

"Arsene Wenger never knows when he is wrong, and that flaw has cost the Arsenal manager, according to his former midfielder Emmanuel Petit. Petit, who was part of Wenger's team at Tuesday night's opponents Monaco before joining him at Highbury in 1997, won the double under the Frenchman the next year, and has known the Arsenal boss for three decades. But as well as praising his former manager's work ethic, the former Gunners star, 44, also questioned Wenger's stubbornness and inability to switch off. Arsene Wenger is preparing to take Arsenal back to his old club Monaco in the Champions League . Petit (right) worked with Wenger at both clubs, but says his former manager has a striking fault . 'He's a workaholic, someone who lives for the job,' Petit told France Football. 'He has a passion, almost pathological, for football. He almost forgets to live his own life. He never disconnects. 'For 35 years he has coached, I've know him for nearly 30, and he has never changed. He has another flaw: he does not recognise when he is wrong.' Petit revealed that, at times of stress, Wenger can be found walking barefoot around the training ground to get back in touch with nature. 'He has tics,' the Premier League winning midfielder continued. For example, when he's fuming and needs to think, he must walk barefoot in the grass. He needs to be in contact with the elements, like in The Matrix!' Petit signed for the Gunners in 1997, alongside Marc Overmars (right), and won the double under Wenger . The Frenchmen celebrate winning the league in 1998, but Petit has said Wenger can be too stubborn . However, the former Gunners midfielder did praise Wenger's man management and his work ethic . Wenger's great strength, however, according to Petit, is his ability to get the best out of his players by understanding them on a personal level. 'Before you are even interested in the football player, he is interested in the individual,' said Petit. 'He attaches great importance to human relations. He is very attentive to detail.' Petit departed Arsenal in 2000 for a short stint at Barcelona, after playing just one season with the man who would go on to become the club's record goalscorer, Thierry Henry. But Petit was quick to stress that his compatriot, who has been working back at the club while doing his coaching badges, should not be talked about as Wenger's successor yet. Thierry Henry, Arsenal's record goalscorer during two spells at the club, has been tipped to succeed Wenger . But Petit says Henry, who was part of the 2004 Invincibles, should not be thought of as a manager yet . 'It's way too early to tell [if Henry can succeed Wenger],' he told RMC Sport. 'We live in a society where fast food is consumed very quickly and we also quickly discard what was consumed. For Henry, as with Zidane, he needs time. 'You do not become a coach just because you pass your degrees. It's like when you become a parent. One becomes a function of his children, we adapt, we learn about ourselves. So getting the degree is one thing. Become a coach week after week, that's something else.'","Arsenal face Monaco on Tuesday night in the UEFA Champions League .

"Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat will not come up against old adversary Louis van Gaal during the final nine matches of the Premier League season. It is thought the Dutch pair - who famously posed with models painted in their clubs' respective strips during the 1995-96 Eredivisie season - have a good relationship despite a rivalry which dates back to the mid-Nineties when Advocaat’s PSV and Van Gaal’s Ajax were vying for domestic honours. But the new Black Cats coach has had his say on his compatriot’s first season at Manchester United. Dick Advocaat and Louis van Gaal, pictured posing with models in 1995, are said to have a good relationship . Advocaat and Van Gaal were in charge of Dutch giants PSV and Ajax respectively twenty years ago . Advocaat, pictured celebrating an AZ Alkmaar goal in 2013, has been named the new Sunderland manager . Speaking on Studio Voetbal in Holland last month, Advocaat said: ‘Firstly, let’s be clear, Louis is a fantastic coach. ‘But after spending €200m in the summer, he should not be complaining and should have made sure that his team were in the top two. ‘And it hasn’t happened.’ It was Advocaat who replaced Van Gaal as national-team boss when Holland failed to qualify for the World Cup in 2002, subsequently guiding them to the semi-finals of Euro 2004. But it is the Old Trafford chief who has the edge when it comes to silverware in their homeland. Van Gaal has four titles and one Dutch cup, while Advocaat has just one league crown and one cup success. They have each won the Johan Cruyff Shield three times.

"Yaya Toure believes Manchester City will have to be wary of trying to 'run after the score' as they look to overturn a 2-1 Champions League last 16 aggregate deficit against Barcelona on Wednesday.

"Sunderland will ‘review its position’ regarding suspended winger Adam Johnson after police extended his bail following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. The club suspended the 27-year-old ‘pending the outcome of the police investigation’ when he was arrested at his £1.8million mansion in County Durham on March 2. It was confirmed on Tuesday that Johnson has now been told to report back to a Durham police station at 10am on Thursday, April 23. Adam Johnson, pictured with girlfriend Stacey Flounders, has had his bail extended until April 23 . Johnson, pictured with his girlfriend, was arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl . The gates at Johnson's £1.8million mansion were shut following his arrest earlier this month . And the club said in a statement: ‘Following the decision by the police today (Tuesday), the club will be reviewing its position and will not make any further comment at the present time.’ Johnson has missed their last two matches but could now be available to new boss Dick Advocaat if the club decide to lift the player’s suspension. Sportsmail reported on Tuesday that Johnson has been training at home with a fitness coach in the hope that the case would be dropped. Meanwhile, Durham Constabulary issued a warning to those using social media that identifying the alleged victim is a criminal offence. A spokesman said: ‘Durham Constabulary is aware this investigation has resulted in considerable rumour and speculation, much of it on social media and in relation to the victim. Former Manchester City man Johnson has been suspended by Sunderland since his arrest . Johnson played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . ‘This has caused distress to the victim and her family and is very unhelpful while we still have a number of actions to carry out as part of our enquiries. ‘We stress again the warning we have already given, that anyone who publishes anything which may identify the victim of a sexual offence is committing a criminal act and will be dealt with accordingly. ‘At the time of the man’s arrest, media reports suggested a weapon had been recovered from the house.

"Barcelona may never have been here today. Not the team harboring the awesome power of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez up front. Not the club who have won four European Cups and so many domestic trophies they require a small cave rather than a mere cabinet to hold them. Irishman Patrick 'Paddy' O'Connell is credited with rescuing Barcelona from extinction . The awesome trio of Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez may not have been assembled if not for O'Connell . Not Luis Enrique's side who are aiming to knock Manchester City out of the last 16 of the Champions League. All of that is unlikely to have existed were it not for Irishman Patrick 'Paddy' O'Connell, who as a player captained the red side of Manchester during five years at United from 1914 but has inadvertently played a crucial role in setting up City's two-legged fixture with Barcelona a century later. O'Connell is credited with rescuing Barcelona from extinction during his time in charge between 1935 and 1940. Barcelona have enjoyed great success in recent years but it was O'Connell that saved the club . In Spain, he became known as 'Don Patricio' - a title reserved for royalty or noblemen - for his successes after moving over aged 35 and first leading Racing de Santander to five regional titles before becoming one of the founding members of La Liga. He took charge at Real Oviedo and then won the Spanish title at Real Betis, but his greatest legacy was shaped when Barcelona came calling. After just one season at the Catalan club, the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936 and the country was in chaos. O'Connell (back row, far right) pictured for Ireland against Wales in 1914/1915 . On the streets of Barcelona, anarchy was escalating. As the tanks rolled in, football was flattened in the country. La Liga was suspended and, despite playing in and winning the Mediterranean League, cash was running out fast. The club were facing financial ruin. O'Connell orchestrated himself and the players taking a huge wage cut - reducing his salary by a third from $1,500 to $1,000 - but Barcelona were still heading out of business, until the wily Irishman had a bright idea. Barcelona celebrate with the Champions League trophy following victory over Manchester United in 2009 . Former Barcelona captain and defender Carles Puyol  holds the Champions League trophy in Rome . He took the team on a tour of Mexico and America, playing 14 games and raising $5,000 - the equivalent of $83,000 today. It was little, but enough to survive. By the time the war ended in April 1939, O'Connell had dragged the team back from the brink of oblivion. Why then would this Barca legend  come to die alone and penniless in London 20 years later? While O'Connell is remembered so fondly in those sunnier climes, on our own shores an entirely different character is recalled by those he should have loved dearest. 'He was the hero in one way but also the swine who left his family in poverty,' his grandson Mike remembered. 'There are two sides to it, a sad family story, but I'm proud he was my grandfather.' O'Connell (back row, one from the left) as part of the Hull City team in 1913-14 . O'Connell was a gambler and a misogynist; a chancer, swindler and trickster. He played for Belfast Celtic, Sheffield Wednesday and Hull City before impressing Manchester United enough for them to pay £1,000 for his services in May 1914. The same year he captained Ireland to the British Home Championship, playing the final game against Scotland with a broken arm. O'Connell was a brash, brazen, no-nonsense centre-back and was made captain of United straight away. However, the first season was a catastrophe and they avoided relegation from Division One by a single point. Even worse - a victory against Liverpool in April was deemed fixed. Puyol holds up the Club World Cup trophy after victory against Santos FC at the tournament in Yokohama . Sandy Turnbull and Enoch 'Knocker' West photographed in 'cricketing' pose at Old Trafford in 1911 . The First World War had broken out and no football was to be played the following season. A group of United and Liverpool players, fearing unemployment and what the future held, met in a pub the day before the game and agreed to the more unlikely 2-0 United win and bet on it at odds of seven-to-one. The scam was uncovered when the Football Association investigated claims of a lack of effort from Liverpool players. United's Sandy Turnbull, Enoch West, Arthur Whalley, and Liverpool's Thomas Fairfoul, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Jackie Sheldon were banned indefinitely by the FA. Former Barca man Cesc Fabregas holds the  UEFA Super Cup after beating Porto at Louis II Stadium . Bob Pursell was banned after rigging a game to win money when Liverpool faced Manchester United . Liverpool's Jackie Sheldon was one of those players banned indefinitely by the FA . Liverpool's Thomas Fairfoul was also banned for his part in the corrupt game between the rival teams . O'Connell struck a penalty well wide with the score at 2-0, but somehow avoided punishment. Yet O'Connell's family admit that maverick streak ran through him. It was these scrapes and scraps which shaped an eventual legend. 'He was an incredible success as a footballer but as a man he was probably a bit of loveable rogue,' Mike's wife Sue explained. 'As a father he was a non-starter.' He remained a United player through the war and after it ended had a year at Dumbarton before moving to Ashington in 1920. David Beckham is one of 40 players who have supported a fund  to raise money for a fitting memorial . O'Connell was determined to find success in football and would let nothing stand in his way. Not even family. He left his wife Ellen at Newcastle station in 1920 after she had travelled there to plead with him to return home. It was the last time O'Connell would see her and he married again in Spain, another Irishwoman called Ellen. At Ashington, he was made player-manager and had his first taste in running a club, before the sniff of adventure took him abroad. Johan Cruyff has also supported the plea to get O'Connell a more fitting memorial following his death . But for all his heroics in Spain, when O'Connell returned to England in 1958 he faded into destitution before he died in London a year later where he remains in an unmarked grave. Last year, a fund was set up to raise money for a more fitting memorial. So far, more than 40 notable football names have supported it, including Sir Bobby Charlton, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Paolo Maldini and David Beckham. There is a bust of O'Connell in the FC Barcelona Museum. There, he will always be remembered as the man who saved the club. AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini is one of more than 40 players to support the memorial idea .","Patrick O'Connell is credited with rescuing Barcelona from extinction .

"Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen admits it took longer than they expected to turn their season around but he now has every confidence they can make it a success. A dreadful start to the campaign saw them slip to 10th, seven points off the minimum requirement of a top-four place, in mid-December and exit the Champions League at the group stage. Since then, however, they have taken 30 points from their 12 subsequent Premier League matches to put themselves firmly in the mix for a top-four place and have an FA Cup quarter-final replay against Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn to face next month.

Allen (left) trains with team-mate Steven Gerrard and right back Glen Johnson (centre) 'We always knew we'd turn it around but we wondered how long it was going to take. It did take longer than we expected, I think,' said Wales midfielder Allen. 'Losing Luis Suarez in the summer (to Barcelona) and Daniel Sturridge being out (injured) for so long as well and the change we had, we always knew there'd be a little bit of a rocky patch but we didn't expect it to go on so long. 'We put expectation on ourselves because we think we're good enough to go on runs like this. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is trying to tie down a number of his first-team stars to longer deals . Emre Can and Kolo Toure (right) battle each other as they go for a sprint during training . 'With the players we've got, and the confidence we're playing with, I think it's a case of long may it continue.' The turnaround came after their Champions League failure was followed immediately by a 3-0 defeat at Manchester United, their main rival for a top-four spot. A change in system to a 3-4-2-1 formation has brought the best out of a number of players, particularly 22-year-old playmaker Philippe Coutinho and utility man Emre Can, who recently turned 21.

Martin Skrtel works on his fitness and conditioning with Liverpool coach Ryland Morgans (left) 'People forget sometimes that we're a pretty young team and squad,' Allen, who is fit again after a hip problem to face former club Swansea this evening, told liverpoolfc.com. 'The beauty of that is that we will get better. We've shown that as the season has gone on. 'With this run of games we're going on, we're really looking forward to Monday night's game and we'll be setting our stall out to go there and pick up three points. 'We've grown massively and I think you can see the change in formation. We've taken to that really well and quickly, which is important. 'I think we seem to have that edge back, even if we're not playing the most flowing football or things aren't going 100 per cent to plan, we still look like we're going to get the result and I think that speaks volumes about how much everyone has taken things forward.' Manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to keep the nucleus of this young side together, and while contract negotiations with Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson have dragged on for several months now they have just opened talks with the 24-year-old Allen over a new deal. 'We're at the early stages at the moment but the signs are good,' he told BBC Wales Sport. 'From my point of view I'm looking to commit my future here and hopefully I can be here for years to come. 'For me it's just a case of playing regularly and putting in consistent performances. I've always been confident that I'll be able to be successful here.' CHELSEA . Hull (away) - March 22 .

"Israel coach Eli Guttman has claimed Gareth Bale cares more about Wales than Real Madrid ahead of his side's crunch Euro 2016 qualifier against the Dragons. Guttman's astonishing claim comes on the back of Real Madrid's dramatic slump in form and £85.3million world record signing Bale being booed by his own fans at the Bernabeu. The European champions suffered their fifth defeat of 2015 when they lost 4-3 at home to German side Schalke on Tuesday night, and although that was enough for Real to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League 5-4 on aggregate, it did not spare the players from the wrath of angry Madridistas. Gareth Bale endured a frustrating evening on Tuesday night but Real still qualified for the quarter-finals . Fans waved white handerkerchiefs - the traditional symbol of disgust at a bad performance - with Bale once again made the scapegoat for Real's problems. Bale was branded selfish and castigated in the Madrid media after choosing to shoot rather than pass to Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema against Espanyol in January and the Welshman has since suffered a dip in form with no goals or assists in his last eight games. And now Guttman has added fuel to the fire by insisting Bale is saving his best for Wales' visit to Israel on March 28, when the top two sides in Group B meet in Haifa. Bale celebrates scoring a late winner for Wales against Andorra back in September last year . Israel coach Eli Guttman (right) believes Bale (left) cares more for playing for his country than Real Madrid . 'I feel that Bale is saving himself for the national team,' Guttman told sports.walla.co.il. 'The level of the miles he does and the level of his commitment to the national team is nothing like how he plays for Real Madrid. 'When they had a player injured [George Williams, who revealed he is out for six months after requiring knee ligament surgery] Bale was the first to [tweet] 'get well soon'. 'They are like us, they are one group, but Bale is the one that gives them balance.' The Welshman, playing against Schalke on Tuesday, has struggled for form in recent weeks for Los Blancos . Cristiano Roanldo scored twice as the Champions League holders advanced 5-4 on aggregate on Tuesday . Israel and Wales are the early surprise front-runners in Group B, with Guttman's leaders having won their opening three games against Cyprus, Andorra and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Second-placed Wales are a point behind Israel and unbeaten after four games, and confidence is high in Chris Coleman's squad after the goalless draw against group favourites Belgium in Brussels in November. Guttman admits that stopping Bale is key to Israel staying top of the section, but he takes heart from keeping the Welshman's Real team-mate Ronaldo off the scoresheet in a 3-3 draw in Tel Aviv two years ago. Real Madrid fans were pictured waving handkerchiefs after the final whistle against Schalke on Tuesday . In that 2014 World Cup qualifier, only an injury-time equaliser from Portugal full-back Fabio Coentrao prevented Israel from recording a famous victory. 'I remember how Sheran Yeini [Maccabi Tel Aviv midfielder] was able to stop Ronaldo.' Guttman said. 'Whenever Ronaldo was on the side of the pitch, somebody else guarded him. 'We have to be close and don't let Bale empty space. If we won't do it, it will kill us.'","Real Madrid were beaten 4-3 by Schalke in the Champions League .

"Bumbling: Natalie Bennett on stage at the spring conference in Liverpool . The Greens like to do things differently. One of their deputy leaders had just blown a few billion pounds more from their wish-list budget when the chairwoman – who could hardly be seen in her green jumper against the vast green background – announced an ‘attunement’. This turned out to be a reflective – and to my mind rather long – minute’s silence. ‘It’s incredibly successful if people get stressed,’ explained our host, although several people around me merely used the pause to check social media on their smartphones. Welcome to the world of Britain’s wackiest political party, on display this weekend at its spring conference in Liverpool. There is something mildly amusing about a party that insists on meditative breaks, has a keynote speaker identified as ‘a non-binary person from Belarus’ and chairwomen who say things like: ‘I would like to hear from someone who does not identify as a man.’ And a party that uses such a contorted form of internal democracy it ends up with daft policies to ban most cars and seriously debates proposals to extend human rights to all animals. Yet this is currently the country’s most successful political party, attracting 100 recruits a day from people dismayed by traditional party politics. Bizarrely, the duffest interviews given by its bumbling leader Natalie Bennett only drive up membership. Joining the hundreds of enthusiastic delegates – a mixture of grizzly bearded hippies, elderly ideologues, earnest young recruits and well-spoken women in charity shop chic – offered fresh insight into what is now the third biggest party in England and Wales. They proclaim the politics of the future. Yet much of the time it felt like I had stumbled into an Alan Bennett sketch filled with middle-class people munching on non-meat sandwiches as they debated how to save a world wrecked by austerity, bankers and Conservatives. Scroll down for video . Bennett (the leader, that is) told her adoring followers the Greens had gone from 13,000 members a year ago to 55,000 members today. This is undoubtedly impressive. But it also means they might play an influential role in determining who runs the country after the next Election. Many of these new members – half of whom voted Liberal Democrat at the last Election – are young people inspired by the idea of reshaping politics. They were given special badges declaring their status and enthusiastically snapped up green T-shirts on sale. Presumably they were not the people targeted in a seminar explaining how to use email. Yet for all these new recruits rushing around excitedly, there were also the same old stalls offering vegan recipes for raspberry cake, T-shirts emblazoned with ‘Still Hate Thatcher’ and angry leaflets denouncing the monarchy. Bennett  told her followers the Greens had gone from 13,000 members a year ago to 55,000 members today . On one, I found Jon Liebling, a friendly 47-year-old dancer promoting the medicinal use of cannabis. He said he had smoked the drug for 26 years to curb anxiety attacks. His stall proclaimed ‘United Patients Alliance with Norml Women’s Alliance’. When I asked about Norml Women, he said its founders ‘felt there was too much testosterone in the cannabis movement’ – but they had not turned up and he had forgotten the acronym’s meaning. The Australian-born Bennett promises a new style of politics – which many people might say she exemplifies with her stumbling interviews and inability to explain key policies. Yet after she spoke on Friday, managing to avoid ‘mind blanks’ as she promised lots of new taxes, the grey-haired woman next to me could not stop gushing: ‘I am so excited. I am overwhelmed. I feel like I belong here.’ She turned out to be a Labour deserter. And this is why the sudden Green surge is giving her previous party palpitations as it is outflanked on the left. Indeed, electoral mathematics mean it is possible the Greens might not just impact on voting outcomes in May but even be in position to join a coalition led by Ed Miliband. This is a party that wants to ban the monarchy, House of Lords, much of the Armed Forces, free schools, foie gras and fur – while freeing up drugs, borders, brothels and, said its leader, allowing people to join terror groups such as Islamic State. Yesterday they chucked in free university undergraduate education, joining the Greens’ desires for free social care, free universal childcare, 500,000 extra new homes and a basic income for everyone costing almost three times the budget of the National Health Service. Since they also want to end economic growth, I asked their press team how these policies would be paid for. ‘There’s lots of money around,’ replied one party veteran, looking at me as though I was stupid. A younger colleague said children would not start schooling until six under a Green government – although it is hard to believe this would raise the requisite £350 billion or so needed to close the annual gap between their policies and economic reality. The Green Party’s emphasis on ultra-democracy is admirable, giving all members a voice – but it means scores of strange ideas end up on its statute books since anything is possible with its Alice in Wonderland politics. Among the proposals considered this weekend, for instance, is the extension of human rights to ‘all sentient life forms’ with ‘the murder, torture and kidnapping’ of dogs and dolphins carrying the same penalties as when such crimes are committed against people. Leader Natalie Bennett is embraced by Green MP Caroline Lucas . I went to one meeting where 19 people were determining a ban on foie gras due to the force-feeding of geese. One young man dissented on the grounds this was discriminatory to dairy cows that were being ‘raped’ and their calves ‘murdered’. ‘To have a ban on the dairy industry would not be popular with the public. It would be a vote loser,’ responded session leader Ronnie Lee – although hastily adding he had been a vegan for 44 years in case anyone might think him unsympathetic to animals. Then there was the well-attended gender group, which agreed people should be allowed ‘a third option of X gender’ on passports – although the discussion leader then confessed this might create risks for people publicly identified as transgender in many countries. The meeting also agreed parents should be allowed to avoid putting children down as either male or female on birth certificates. One elderly Green from Tyneside, doing his best to keep up, admitted he was confused by the latest terms for transgender people. He was not the only one, with talk about LGBITQ people – the ‘I’ turned out to be for Intersex and the ‘Q’ for Questioning. At the peace and defence group, software engineer Chris Burdess said they needed to review policies that were ‘unnecessarily inflammatory and aggressive’ towards diplomats and members of the armed forces. ‘We don’t want to single them out as evil,’ he said. But their policy-making process is so ponderous, Burdess admitted this could not be achieved before the Election. Mind you, they have pledges to pass measures that were actually passed nearly two decades ago. Such eccentricities might be endearing if the Greens had not suddenly emerged as a semi-serious force in British politics. Yet its leaders brush aside criticism of policy absurdities by saying they are merely promoting new ideas and looking long-term. Downstairs in the Liverpool convention centre was a gathering for fans of fantasy games. Upstairs, they seemed to be playing fantasy politics. But if this shambolic bunch ever got a sniff of power, the entire country would be losers.","The Green Party is the third biggest political party in England and Wales .

"Ben Amos has confirmed he expects to leave Manchester United this summer. The 24-year-old goalkeeper is on loan at Championship side Bolton but out of contract at Old Trafford at the end of the season. Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Amos has made six appearances on loan at Bolton . He said: 'Being a United fan, I’ve always believed I can play for Manchester United and always aspired to be a Manchester United player. 'Pre-season, I was told I was number two. With the cup games, if I'd got a sniff of that, that would have made it worthwhile sticking around for.

"Spain goalkeeper and captain Iker Casillas is unlikely to lose his place in the national side despite a recent poor run for his club Real Madrid, coach Vicente del Bosque said on Wednesday. Casillas is one player, along with Wales winger Gareth Bale, who has been blamed by Real fans for the European champions' slump and he was again the target of their ire during Tuesday's 4-3 Champions League loss at home to Bundesliga side Schalke 04. Although they squeezed through to the quarter-finals 5-4 on aggregate, Casillas and his team mates were whistled off the Bernabeu pitch by their angry supporters, already fuming after Real gave up the La Liga lead to Barcelona with a loss to Athletic Bilbao. Iker Casillas was blamed for this goal as Schalke's Klaas-Jan Huntelaar pounced on his poor parry . Huntelaar buried his finish and the Real Madrid fans booed their keeper after the 4-3 Champions League loss . 'He did not play well and he admitted that,' Del Bosque said in an interview with Radio Marca. 'He also saved Madrid at the end,' added the 64-year-old, who coached Casillas when he was in charge at Real between 1999 and 2003. 'We don't have to make a change unless the dip in form is alarming. I think he is in good shape.' Del Bosque has plenty of options if he decides to call time on Casillas's international career, with the likes of David De Gea (Manchester United) and Kiko Casilla (Espanyol) pushing for a starting place. Casillas's apparent drop in form doesn't bother Spain coach Vicente del Bosque who's back his keeper . Casillas (left) shows his disappointment alongside Toni Kroos after Real's loss to Schalke . However, he has consistently backed his captain during several difficult periods in recent years and is unlikely to drop him unless he suffers a sustained slump. Casillas has made 160 appearances for Spain, more than any other player, and led the side to back-to-back European crowns in 2008 and 2012 with the nation's debut World Cup triumph in between in 2010. Spain's next game is a Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Ukraine on March 27. With four matches played, Spain are second in Group C on nine points, three behind leaders Slovakia, who beat them 2-1 in Zilina in October, and level with Ukraine.

"The Oklahoma Sooners football team made their stance against the university's racist fraternity chant row known on Thursday, as they have every day since Monday, by declining to take part in a scheduled practice. Instead, the team took to the field--all of them dressed in black--and stood arm-in-arm in a silent vigil. Coach Bob Stoops said in a statement that letting the world know the team's stance was more important than their  practice. Scroll down for video . Vigil: The University of Oklahoma football team stands arm in arm on Owen Field on the campus in Norman, Oklahoma on Thursday in response to the recent racist video from a now-closed campus fraternity . Quarterback Trevor Knight also made his personal thoughts on the disgraceful video, in which members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon's University of Oklahoma chapter sing a song that used a derogatory term for black people and referenced lynching. 'Extremely proud of our guys right now for the way WE have handled this issue! I love this university and I love this team! #WeAreOne,' the 21-year-old posted to Twitter. Saying they were committed to curing the 'disease' of racism, Oklahoma football players called Thursday for the expulsion of fraternity leaders tied to a racist video and vowed to help the mostly white campus end its 'culture of exclusivity.' 'Our hope is to shed light on this issue and promote meaningful change at a national level,' the players said in a statement many released nearly simultaneously on their social media accounts. 'But before we can change the nation, we make it our mission to change our campus.' Two students have been expelled and university President David Boren ordered the chapter house to be shut down. Not practicing: The Sooners have silently protested while clad in black all week long while declining to participate in scheduled practices . Boren plans to meet with team captains after spring break, but the players haven't waited to express their displeasure. They banded together Monday and marched arm-in-arm into the school's indoor practice facility, wearing all black, with coach Bob Stoops front and center. The team has not practiced all week, instead silently demonstrating at Owen Field during its normal practice time. Two students have been expelled and university President David Boren ordered the SAE chapter house to be shut down after the video went viral . The university has about 27,000 students, about 5 percent of whom are black. The players said they want SAE leadership 'expelled, suspended or otherwise disciplined severely.' 'Allowing this culture to thrive goes against everything it means to be a Sooner,' said the players, who vowed to raise awareness of racism and show 'we are defined by more than the numbers on our jerseys and that we are human beings that desire to get to know our classmates.' The situation already has hurt the football program, usually a national power. North Mesquite (Texas) High School football star Jean Delance, a top offensive lineman prospect who had verbally committed to Oklahoma, said he would not attend the school because of the video. Two other verbal commitments from the Class of 2016, both black, will stay. Jon-Michael Terry, a tight end from Victory Christian High in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Adrian Hardy, a quarterback from Dekaney High in Houston, have not changed their plans. Boren's strong response played a role in keeping Hardy's mother, Umeki Davis, from becoming concerned. 'As long as they (those leading the chant) were escorted off, and they have nothing to do with OU, and OU stood up for their kids - I'm OK with that,' Davis, said. 'It would have been different if OU wouldn't have stood up for what was right. What was right to me was when they stood up and those students were removed from the school. I'm fine with that.' Victory Christian football coach Brent Marley said he discussed the situation with Terry, and nothing changed. #WeAreOne: Sooners quarterback Trevor Knight tweeted this week, 'Extremely proud of our guys right now for the way WE have handled this issue! I love this university and I love this team! #WeAreOne' Oklahoma's former players said the incident was not an overall reflection of the campus. 'I just believe that doesn't represent the school,' former defensive end Chuka Ndulue said during his Pro Day workout this week. 'No matter where you go, it's just - stuff like that happens. It's just because we're in this day and age where social media runs everything where they happened to catch the guys on camera. It doesn't reflect the student body. That's not the image of the University of Oklahoma.' Former Oklahoma offensive lineman Adam Shead said he was glad to see things that normally get swept under the rug out in the open. He said he was encouraged when the team marched on Monday. 'I was proud,' he said. 'I was happy to see coach Stoops right there in the front, leading the pack, and all the rest of the coaches right there behind him. I'm proud to have been a part of the program that thinks like that and does things like that, who believes in doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do.'

"Arsenal, for a change, performed with a trace of discipline. They played with poise. For once, Arsene Wenger’s team refused to be lured into the high-speed pursuit of glory. They went about it all in a sensible manner. That has not always been the case. Perhaps lessons had been learned from the Charge of the Lightweight Brigade three weeks earlier. Fifteen consecutive years of Champions League knockout football and still learning important lessons. Talk about slow on the uptake. Such qualities should be ingrained in the club’s fabric by this point. Arsene Wenger looks on as his side win in Monaco - but it was not quite enough to progress to the last eight . Olivier Giroud gave the Gunners hope, finishing with aplomb to increase the nerves among the home side . Aaron Ramsey stepped off the bench to latch on to a loose ball in the box to level the tie on aggregate . After the debacle at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg, they learned not to repeat their mistakes but it did them no good. Wenger’s team kept a clean sheet and scored twice against a defence which had conceded only once in its previous 12 home games, but it was meaningless. Instead, here was another spectacular near-miss to file away in the collection. There was Robin van Persie’s red card and Nicklas Bendtner’s late chance in Barcelona and that 2-0 win in Munich against Bayern, a carbon copy of this tie, two years ago. There were the Lionel Messi four goals in 2010 when Pep Guardiola’s Barca were at their peak, the penalty conceded by Kolo Toure at Liverpool and a near-miss against AC Milan, when Wenger raged at the referee, having lost by four in the San Siro. Again, there were what-ifs. What if Alexis Sanchez had been awarded a penalty instead of booked for diving? What if Danny Welbeck’s shot had not hit Aymen Abdennour and deflected wide before half-time? What if Danijel Subasic had not clawed that one out of the top corner in the dying minutes? What if Arsenal learned how to cope with two-legged knockout ties against quality opposition? For a team who aspire to win major trophies, they have failed to make it past this stage for five successive years. They have not won a first knockout round tie since beating Porto in 2010. In this sense they have slipped backwards and next season they are likely to lose their privileged status as top seeds. They are not alone. In this last-16 round, it is France 2 England 0. Laurent Koscielny clatted the bar from close range in the first half as Arsenal showed their intent . The Edge, Larry Mullen Jnr and Bono were among the attendees at the Stade Louis II . Sure Monaco wobbled, seemingly petrified by the proximity to such a huge result, but they did just enough to dispel the myth that it takes time to adjust to this competition. The French club are in it for the first time in nine years, having lost key players last summer, and still Leonardo Jardim has forged an effective unit from a few old-timers and some promising youngsters. They seized on Arsenal’s frailties in London and clung to their lead. Little wonder they erupted in triumph at the final whistle. History would not be rewritten. In the Champions League era, no team has recovered from losing at home in the first leg by two or more goals. There would be no Miracle in Monaco, under the terracotta tiles of Stade Louis II, where Irish rock band U2 came to watch on St Patrick’s Day, and might have played Arsenal out with a chorus of Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For. Wenger’s selection was typically bold — four at the back, shielded by Francis Coquelin, who was later discarded for Aaron Ramsey. There was no shortage of attacking options, but it would take a night of clinical finishing to get out of this corner. An early goal might have exerted more pressure on a team in unfamiliar territory and made them anxious, but 35 minutes had elapsed when Olivier Giroud struck. To score before the interval was important. Arsenal at last had exposed Monaco’s nerve ends and the Monegasques shifted uneasily. Giroud perhaps epitomises the Arsenal riddle better than anyone. His goals have fuelled an upturn in form since the turn of the year. VIDEO Arsenal paid price for first leg - Wenger . Alexis Sanchez reacts after missing a chance on an ultimately frustrating night for the visitors . The Monaco bench erupts after the full-time whistle after the elimination of Wenger's side . He showed mental strength to overcome the disappointment of missed sitters in the first leg but chances went astray again: a header nodded wide early in the game and another into the goalkeeper’s hands. By the end, he was getting in a muddle with Sanchez as the impossible briefly promised to materialise. Mesut Ozil went close, but not close enough, and the German did not manage to provide an image to eclipse the one of him swapping shirts with Geoffrey Kondogbia on his way off the pitch at half-time. Half-time shirt swaps do not go down well, especially during a defeat. Just ask Andre Santos. Theo Walcott shook the woodwork and substitute Ramsey levelled the tie at 3-3 but this was the stage they reached two years ago, against Bayern Munich. Still more was required. Time ran out on Arsenal. Time runs out on Wenger’s dream of ever winning the Champions League.","For a change, Arsenal performed with a trace of discipline. They played with poise .
For once, Arsene Wenger’s team refused to be lured into the high-speed pursuit of glory .
Wenger’s players proved they have more maturity than in evidence during the pathetic first-leg .
Olivier Giroud, too, proved that night of missed opportunities was something of an aberration amid a hot streak of form ."
"FA chairman Greg Dyke has described as ‘pretty scary’ the increase in disciplinary cases brought against players surrounding referees to try to influence decisions. Dyke was speaking out a week after Chelsea’s Champions League defeat by Paris Saint-Germain during which nine Chelsea players crowded around the Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers following Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s challenge on Oscar which resulted in the Swedish talisman being sent off. The FA clampdown on such incidents has seen an increase in clubs in the top five divisions – from the Premier League to the Conference - charged with 'surrounding match officials' (three or more players from one club approach a match official in a confrontational manner) from six last season to 16 with another three months of the campaign still to go. John Terry, Cesc Fabregas and their Chelsea team-mates surround referee Bjorn Kuipers . All nine outfield Chelsea players remonstrate with Kuipers as Oscar is left in a heap on the floor . Warnings or reminders are also up from 23 last campaign to 29 during 2014-2015. Dyke said: 'We have seen a pretty scary increase this season in the number of clubs charged with their players surrounding referees. As a result we have written to the clubs in the top five divisions reminding them of the rules and their responsibilities. 'I believe it is particularly important for professional cubs to set an example so that this kind of conduct is not replicated at grassroots and youth level. The whole game needs to ensure it is addressing this issue.’ The rapid increase in FA charges follows not only the December letter sent to 116 teams but also visits to clubs last summer when this issue was raised directly with players who were told that it would not be tolerated. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off for his challenge which provoked an aggressive reaction from Chelsea . Chelsea captain John Terry moved to defend his side's actions during their clash against Paris Saint-Germain . The FA will now look at heavier fines than the current sliding scale of costs from £20,000-£500 or other options to address the worrying upward curve in harassing the match officials. Referees could also start to be more proactive themselves by showing yellow cards to the players surrounding them, which is within their powers. Ironically, considering that the Chelsea players' distasteful conduct brought this issue to the fore, UEFA do not have a similar charge in their rulebook. Chelsea captain John Terry admitted after the PSG match that the willingness to surround referees ‘doesn’t look good’. But Terry was adamant they would continue to do so if they believe opponents - such as PSG – are attempting to exert their own influence on the match officials. Terry said: 'For me, if I have to run 20, 30 yards, it doesn’t look great, but when you’re standing back and seeing five or six of their players surrounding the ref... for me, I think I support my team-mates. 'And once I go, four or five go with me. It doesn’t look good at all, but that’s part of the game.'","Greg Dyke was speaking a week after Chelsea's defeat against PSG .

"Mario Balotelli appears to be far from happy if the Liverpool striker's latest Instagram post is anything to go by. The forward missed his side's 1-0 victory against Swansea at the Liberty Stadium through illness and didn't travel  with his team-mates to the game.

The summer signing from AC Milan has been somewhat of a disappointment since his arrival - having scored only four goals in all competitions. The Italian forward has been less than impressive since his big money move from Serie A giants AC Milan . It remains to be seen if he'll still be at the club next season, with his acquisition failing to inspire the Anfield faithful.

"A black man pushed off a Paris Metro train by Chelsea fans chanting racist abuse last month says he can no longer take public transport and is depressed after the attack. The man, identified as Soulemayne S, says the incident, which happened before Chelsea played a Champions League match agains Paris Saint-Germain, has 'destroyed' him. He says coverage of the attack, for which five men have been handed court summonses, has 'traumatised' his children, and forced him to explain the concept of racism to them. Soulemayne S, the black man subjected to racist abuse on the Paris Metro last month, said the incident has left him depressed, unable to work, and has 'traumatised' his children . A video showed the men pushing Soulemayne before chanting 'we're racist and that's the way we like it' (pictured). Police say five men are due to appear in court in connection with the attack . Soulemayne was recorded being pushed off the Metro train by a group of supporters who then began chanting 'we're racist and that's the way we like it.' He told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'I'm here like a child. I have got a phobia of public transport. I can't take public transport to go to work - since what happened I have been under a lot of pressure. 'I have been referred to a psychologist. I can't sleep any more. Every hour, every instant, I think about what happened. I think about the ordeal.' He said his family had been 'divided' by the 'humiliation' he experienced, adding : 'I am obliged to tell [my children] that there are people who aren't very nice, and that there are people who don't like black skin.' Speaking about Chelsea's offer of a free ticket to last night's second leg match at Stamford Bridge, he said: 'This offer to go, this invitation, is just an attempt to make things up. For the moment I don't want to come because of what they've caused, the team and their fans. 'The Chelsea supporters have destroyed me. Even when I drive my car I feel like I'm being followed. I don't know if I am being followed by Chelsea fans, or police or the media. 'Even when I go and see my lawyer I am followed, when I go to see my therapist I feel like I'm being followed, and I've never had that in my life. 'The only problem I have in my life right now is because of Chelsea and their fans.' On his decision to reject the invitation to tonight's game, Soulemayne S previously told RTL radio: 'I don't want to sit in that stadium next to those people who pushed me. This is the moment Chelsea fans were recorded pushing Soulemayne off the Metro ahead of a clash with Paris St-Germain, an incident which Soulemayne says has 'destroyed' him . Soulemayne refused to attend last night's second leg clash between Chelsea and Paris St-Germain in London, which Jose Mourinho's men lost, knocking them out of the Champions League . 'I won't go. They can't buy me with a little piece of paper. I'm not a child.' A Chelsea spokesman said: 'We appreciate he doesn't want to come to this particular game, however, our offer remains open and we hope he'll take us up on it so he can meet real Chelsea fans and experience the true spirit of the club.' Five men involved in the incident were today and yesterday served with summonses over the issue, Scotland Yard said. The men will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders'. Football banning orders are issued by courts following a conviction for a football-related offence after a complaint by the Crown Prosecution Service or local police, the Home Office website says. They can last for between three and 10 years. Breaches of the orders can result in a sentence of up to six months in prison. Chelsea FC said previously it was 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved. Fans were again accused of racism this month after claims a group were heard using the N-word and anti-Semitic slurs on a train from London to Manchester. One supporter was allegedly overheard saying 'Paris, Paris, Paris, that's the way we like it, a n***** on the door' after their victory over Tottenham in the Capital One Cup.","Soulemayne S says attack has left him depressed and seeing psychiatrist .

"An Australian ex-pat who runs a successful sail boat tour company on the tourist island of Phuket in Thailand has been charged with murder. Mark Pendlebury - known affectionately by locals as 'Captain Mark' as he is never without his captain's hat and pipe - was trying to break up a fight outside Taipan nightclub on Wednesday night. The former Perth businessman, 59, was on his way home from a Patong Rotary meeting when he came across the scuffle, Phuket Wan reported. Mark Pendlebury (right) runs a successful sail boat tour company on the tourist island of Phuket . The 59-year-old man who is from Perth was charged with murder after he tried to intervene during a scuffle . It is alleged Pendlebury stabbed security guard, Sanya Khluewaengmon, after he tried to stop the Australian from filming the fight outside the nightclub about 12.30am local time on Wednesday. 'Before I knew it, I was being badly beaten up. I pulled out my knife and waved it back and forth to defend myself,' Pendlebury told local media from his jail cell at Kathu Police Station. 'A couple of Indians jumped in and with their help I was able to escape a little distance down the street. If the Indian tourists hadn't rescued me, I reckon I would be dead.' Pictures have emerged of Pendlebury that show him with a bloodied arm in a hospital bed, while being interviewed by police.

"Authorities in the Cayman Islands have ended a search for a U.S. Marvel/DC comic book artist who went missing while snorkeling with his wife on a vacation. Norman Lee, who worked on Avengers and X-Men, were about 250 yards off the coast of Grand Cayman on Thursday afternoon when he became separated from wife of fives years, Jan. Despite round-the-clock helicopter, diving and boat searches, investigators have found no sign of the 47-year-old from Weymouth, Massachusetts. Tragic: The search for Norman Lee, an inker for Marvel/DC Comics, in the Cayman Islands has been called off . Went missing: He was snorkeling with his wife Jan on Thursday when they became separated . On Saturday evening, the search was called off after chief inspector Brad Ebanks said the currents are so strong it is 'unlikely that we will make any recovery at this stage.' Lee started working for Marvel and DC Comics in 1995 as an 'inker', drawing over pencil sketches in pen before the comic goes to print. He is scheduled to appear at Boston Comic Con this summer. Long career: Lee, from Weymouth, Massachusetts, worked on Avengers and X-Men during his career . He was a permanent fixture at Comic Con events and is scheduled to appear at Boston's this July . Tributes have flooded in on Lee's Facebook page.

"Back on form, back on top and no need for the Bournemouth bean counters to worry about the cost of their goal rush. As their manager, Eddie Howe, put it: ‘We don’t pay goal bonuses.’ On nights like this, that will make for a healthy saving. Across the course of this remarkable season, in which their tally of 74 goals is more than any other side in the top four divisions, it must be worth a fortune. Bournemouth midfielder Matt Ritchie hit two as the Cherries romped to an easy victory over Fulham . Striker Brett Pitman celebrates scoring his second goal of the game at Craven Cottage . Steve Cook (second left) is congratulated by his team-mates after rifling home the Cherries' fifth goal . Cherries manager Eddie Howe has guided Bournemouth back to the summit of the Champions table . Fulham (4-1-3-2): Bettinelli, Hoogland, Hutchinson, Bodurov, Amorebieta, Parker, Tunnicliffe, Kavanagh (Fofana, 72), Ruiz (Stafylidis, 72), Rodallega (Smith, 45), McCormack. Subs: Kiraly, Stafylidis, Voser, Woodrow, Burn. Scorer: Smith, 66 . Booked: Fofana . Sent off: Amorebieta . Bournemouth (4-4-2): Boruc, Francis, Elphick, Cook, Daniels, Ritchie (Stanislas, 86), Surman, Arter, Pugh (Smith, 81), Pitman, Wilson (Rantie, 77) Subs: Camp,  MacDonald, Kermorgant, Ward. Scorers: Pitman 29, 61, Ritchie, 37, 61, Cook, 84. Attendance: 16, 317 . Referee: Andrew Madley (West Yorkshire) And yet it will be nothing compared to the kind of windfall that will head Bournemouth’s way if they somehow stay the course. Can they do it? Really? With their 12,000-capacity ground and 125-year history of never coming close? The assumption has long been that this club will slip away quietly. But it isn’t quite working out that way. They had their blip in the past few weeks, at one stage going five without a win. But with two straight wins, it is looking increasingly possible that Howe will be a top-flight manager next season. For most observers of this bright, English coach, that status has only ever been a matter of time in the coming. He has taken Bournemouth to this point from League Two and last night led an annihilation of a side not afraid to spend. Brett Pitman and Matt Ritchie shared four goals between them and Steve Cook scored a fifth but, truthfully, the rout could have been greater. Suddenly, Howe has to manage expectations of automatic promotion. He said: ‘The (Championship) lead has changed so many times. It is almost the tag no one wants. ‘Our best finish is 10th in 130-odd years of football, so to say it’s a failure if we don’t make top two, I don’t buy that.’ Bournemouth defender Tommy Elphick is late to slide in as Fulham frontman Ross McCormack shoots . Bryan Ruiz controls the ball and holds off the challenge of Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter . For Kit Symons, the only consolation was that Matt Smith briefly brought the score back to 3-1. The rest of the game, like Fulham’s season, was a misery. He said: ‘No one is under any illusions. Look at the table - we know where we are.’ Symons added: ‘We never got going here. They were a different level all over the pitch from start to finish. Three games in a week against three top sides affected us. We got up for the first two but we couldn’t get going in this one. It looked top against bottom.’ Fulham have an eight-point cushion on the relegation zone, but Symons said: ‘Until we are mathematically safe we have to be conscious of what is below and behind us.’ They were struggling from the start here. Within nine minutes, Bournemouth’s Marc Pugh saw a shot nudged over and moments later Ryan Tunnicliffe cleared Brett Pitman’s effort off the line. From there, it only got worse for Fulham, a side that might well find itself two divisions removed from Bournemouth in a few months. They were woeful, a disjointed mess of a team that was summed up early on when Hugo Rodallega flicked the ball and realised no team-mate was anywhere nearby. Fulham defender Tim Hoogland and Bournemouth frontman Callum Wilson tussle for the ball . Wilson evades Fulham's Nikolay Bodurov before racing forward with the ball during Bournemouth's victory . They have won one in 11 in all competitions and that form really is no great mystery. They fell behind after 29 minutes here when Pitman was given too much space by Nikolay Bodurov and buried a Charlie Daniels cross. Luck was against Fulham seven minutes later when Matt Ritchie’s deflected in off Bodurov. Pitman scored a brilliant third shortly after the hour mark, taking possession in his own half before embarrassing Shaun Hutchinson and Scott Parker and nailing the finish. Matt Smith pulled a goal back for Fulham but Fernando Amorebieta’s red card for tripping Callum Wilson in the 70th minute killed the home side. Ritchie was teed up from the resulting free-kick and scored Bournemouth’s fourth from the edge of the area. Cook then rocketed Bournemouth’s 74th goal of the season for good measure.","Brett Pitman and Matt Ritchie both scored braces in Bournemouth win .

The country's top scorers marched back to the top of the Sky Bet Championship courtesy of two goals apiece from Brett Pitman and Matt Ritchie followed by a late cracker from Steve Cook to seal a thumping 5-1 victory. 'I'm delighted with the win,' said Cherries boss Howe. 'We felt it was going to be a difficult fixture when you see players Fulham have, but we started well, we were very positive, we scored at good times and could have scored more.

'Thankfully we don't have goal bonuses in the contracts. We took them out.' Pitman, only in the side due to an injury to Yann Kermorgant - who hit both goals in their midweek victory over Wolves - got the ball rolling just before the half-hour mark with his first goal since Boxing Day. Ritchie doubled the advantage before half-time with a deflected effort and Pitman helped himself to a fine solo goal on the hour. Matt Smith pulled one back with his first goal in Fulham colours, but any hopes of a home comeback were extinguished when Fernando Amorebieta was sent off for fouling Callum Wilson and Ritchie blasted in the resulting free-kick. Cook then crashed in number five with six minutes remaining to put the icing on the cake for the Cherries, who made it back-to-back victories after five games without a win to put their promotion bid right back on track. Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson (centre) rounds Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli (right) Brett Pitman (centre) breaks away with the ball for Bournemouth while Fulham's Scott Parker (right) chases . 'During the five games we didn't win the performance levels were still strong,' added Howe. 'I didn't think there was anything wrong with the team and I think we have proved that. When we have that ruthlessness we are hard to stop. 'The lead has changed so many times it's almost become the tag no one wants. That's been the nature of it and it may stay that way until the end of the season, so back-to-back wins are so important.' Fulham, by contrast, are looking over their shoulders at the relegation battle - their cushion could be cut to five points by Saturday evening. 'It looked like top against bottom,' admitted manager Kit Symons. 'All credit to Bournemouth but we are bitterly disappointed with the performance. 'Until we are mathematically safe we have to get as many points as we can. We are conscious of what's below us. No one is under any illusions, you only have to look at the table.

"Sergio Aguero is a modern day football genius who always plays the game with a smile on his face, according to Manchester City team-mate Frank Lampard. Lampard says he is quite an intense player who can get quite down if things are not going his way, but revealed the Argentina international is quite the opposite. Aguero has been in good form this season, scoring 23 goals in all competitions, and City will hope he is at his best again this week when they travel to the Nou Camp in the second leg of their Champions League tie with Barcelona. Frank Lampard says Sergio Aguero always plays and trains with a smile on his face . City players train ahead of their second leg game with Barcelona . Frank Lampard (middle) warms up during training ahead of his final game at the Nou Camp . Manuel Pellegrini's side trail 2-1 after the first leg in Manchester and face an up hill task if they are to overhaul the La Liga leaders. Lampard in Match of the Day magazine: ‘Football comes easy to him – he bounces into training without a care in the world, then plays like a genius. I’m intense about my football and if I have a bad day I can get quite upset, so it’s always nice to see someone like Sergio, who also has bad days but just smiles it away!’ After spending 13 years at Chelsea, Lampard moved north to Manchester City and says he is getting on well with his new teammates. Lampard would like to play more games for Manchester City before he heads to play in MLS . Lampard has had some memorable moments at the Nou Camp with Chelsea . Match of the Day magazine is available now . He added: ‘I get on with them all but David Silva is a fantastic bloke. I’ve loved him as a footballer from afar, but when you meet him you realise how humble he is.' Lampard will head Stateside at the end of the Premier League to link up with new MLS franchise New York City FC and so this is likely to be his last game at the Nou Camp. He added: ‘It’s one of football’s great arenas. I’ve had the runaround there, but I’ve also been fortunate to have some of my best nights there. The old stadium, the size of it, the fans – you can feel the magic and the history. I’ll be delighted to go back. ‘Football is like a religion in Spain, but what I will say is that all the Spanish players who come here never stop talking about how great it is to play football in England – the fans, how every stadium you go to has a great atmosphere, so we can't complain.’ And with Lampard’s time in England coming to an end, he is able to look back on his years in the Premier League with fondness – even though he would like a few minutes on the pitch before he heads to New York. He said: ‘I’d like to play more minutes and games – that would be a start! Football is not always about fairytales, but my career as a whole has been a fairytale. I never dreamed I’d get to win the Champions League with Chelsea and play for my country over 100 times. I’m pretty happy with that.’ For the full interview with Frank Lampard make sure you pick up a copy of Match of the Day Magazine, which is on sale between March 17-23 .","Sergio Aguero makes football look so easy, according to Frank Lampard .

"Three Delaware teenagers involved in videotaped assaults of a mentally disabled man have been sentenced to probation and house arrest, followed by placement in a secure juvenile facility. The teens were sentenced Monday after each pleaded guilty to a single felony count of crime against a vulnerable adult. The boys, two 15-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were sentenced to probation and house arrest for the rest of the school year, followed by summer placement at a juvenile facility. Videos posted online showed the 27-year-old victim being body-slammed to the ground, stomped on and kicked, and repeatedly punched in the head. Scroll down for video . Attack: The victim (in gray) can be seen trying to stop the youths from attacking him . Violent: One of the boys picks the man up before throwing him to the ground. Others can be heard laughing . Hurt: The man, who can be heard groaning, was reportedly treated at the hospital afterwards for injuries . The defendants were charged with offensive touching, assault of a vulnerable adult, and conspiracy. Prosecutors later added hate-crime charges, which were dropped along with other charges following the guilty pleas. A video that was posted to YouTube shows a group of teenagers pursuing the victim as he shouts: 'Leave me alone!' One boy swings at the man, repeatedly punching him, before picking him up and throwing him to the ground on at least two occasions. The boys then crowd around the man - while one teenager who is filming the attack on his cellphone nears the man to get a closer shot as he writhes on the floor. A separate video reveals them attacking the man in a wooded area, Fox29 reported. In that attack, the victim can be heard crying, while a female voice says: 'You guys are so mean to him.' In September, the victim's mother Yana told WPVI that while initially seeing the video she felt 'Rage, anger - because of the situation, with him being mentally disabled, he doesn't do anything to anyone but be kind.' Yana told the television station her son Karon has Williams Syndrome. Those with Williams Syndrome often have an intellectual disability, heart defects, a slight stature and distinctive facial features, including a flat nasal bridge. Sufferers are often extremely friendly. 'He's not doing too good,' his godmother Debra Jackson told CBS3 in September. 'One, he's ashamed about it happening, he’s embarrassed.' She added that her godson thought the teenagers were his friends. That same month, one teenager who appeared in footage told CBS 3 that he assisted in reporting what happened. He said the assaults were filmed in Newark. He told the television station at the time 'The right thing to do was call the cops. If you beat up a mentally disabled person, you should be locked away for good.' Cruel: As the group surround him, one of the teenagers (with the backpack) is more concerned about getting a close-up snap of the victim than helping him .

"Manchester United sent scouts to watch Brazilian attacking midfielder Roberto Firmino at Hoffenheim this weekend. The 23-year-old, who has been in fine form in the Bundesliga, is in high demand, with United the latest in a string of Premier League clubs to show an interest. Everton, Liverpool and Arsenal have all considered bids for the 23-year-old Brazilian who has a release clause reputedly set at £14.5million. Sportsmail tells you everything you need to know about the Hoffenheim forward. Roberto Firmino celebrates scoring a late winner for his Hoffenheim side against Eintracht Frankfurt . Firmino scored the winning goal for Brazil in just his second international game against Austria last year . A skillful dribbler - in the past two seasons only Lionel Messi and Eden Hazard have embarked on more succesful dribbles in Europe's top leagues - and with all the tricks and flicks you might expect from a Brazilian international forward, Firmino is an attacking midfielder with an eye for goal. He is not an out and out goalscorer, as his record of 6 goals in 25 Bundesliga games this season shows, but Firmino is a capable finisher when the chance arises. Last season's tally of 16 goals for Hoffenheim earned him his first Brazil call-up early this term, and he announced himself in the international stage with a stunning 25 yard strike into the top corner to earn the selecao a win against Austria in just his second game. The Brazilian's shot from 25 yards flew into the top corner to earn him a first international goal . The Brazilian shows off his excellent first touch as he keeps the ball away from two Stuttgart defenders . However, it is not for his goalscoring exploits that Louis van Gaal will want the 23-year-old, but his playmaking. Firmino loves to pick a pass, sliding through balls into the strikers from his position in behind, and has racked up 18 league assists since the start of last season. To put that number in context, that's as many as Manchester United's entire midfield against Tottenham - Juan Mata, Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini, Daley Blind and Michael Carrick - have managed in the Premier League over the past two seasons. The Brazilian is usually deployed behind the central striker, but can operate out wide on the left, where his pace and quick feet allow him to beat a man before picking out team-mates. With Neymar, Coutinho, Oscar and Willian in his position, Firmino has done well to earn a Brazil call-up . The playmaker holds off a tackle as he embarks on one of his trademark runs in a recent game . As well as running past defenders with the ball he has a knack for making attacking runs from deep without it, posing a threat in behind whether coming from central areas on the wing. And, when stationed wide on the left, Firmino has the ability to cut inside and unleash a strike at goal with his favoured right foot, or trouble the full back down the outside with his trickery, causing defenders plenty of problems. It remains to be seen if he is quick enough to be a dynamic No 10 in the Premier League, but the performances in Germany have earned praise from the likes of Bayern Munich sporting director Mathias Sammer. Firmino's dribbling, goals and assists have made him one of the hottest properties in the Bundesliga . 'Firmino is a great player,' said Sammer this week, although he ruled out the player moving to Bayern. But the player, his agent, and Hoffenheim have all admitted he could well leave this season, alerting Premier League clubs to the possibility of nabbing a star who is undoubtedly one of the Bundesliga's hottest prospects.","Roberto Firmino has been at Hoffenheim for four years .

"Atletico Madrid will try to re-sign Chelsea defender Filipe Luis at the end of the season and hope his lack of opportunities at Stamford Bridge persuade him to push for a return to the Spanish capital. Atletico saw three players leave the club for Chelsea last summer but despite attention focusing on how they would replace the goals of Diego Costa and the saves of Thibaut Courtois, Luis has been the most difficult to replace. Guilherme Siqueira has struggled for form and the Argentine Cristian Ansaldi has spent most of the season injured.

"Denis Irwin remains convinced Luke Shaw will be a big star at Manchester United. Irwin, one of the most decorated defenders in United's history, tipped Shaw to star for United shortly after he signed for the club, but the teenager has had a mixed maiden campaign so far. Shaw has impressed on a few occasions, but injury has prevented him from fulfilling his potential. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Denis Irwin: No doubt that Luke Shaw will be a top United player . Luke Shaw tussles with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain during Manchester United's FA Cup clash defeat by Arsenal . The former Southampton defender has failed to replicate his form for Southampton last season . The 19-year-old was made to train on his own after turning up to pre-season out of shape and he was then hit by hamstring and ankle problems. The left-back has started just 12 Premier League games so far, but Irwin is sure the club will start seeing a return on their £31.5million investment once his injury troubles are over. 'I have no doubt he will be a great player for us in years to come,' Irwin told Press Association Sport. 'Until he gets a run of games I don't think you are going to see the quality Luke Shaw can bring to a side. 'When he gets that under his belt you will see the best of him. 'Hopefully he will stay injury-free for us for the rest of year and get a run of games.' United beat strong competition from Shaw's boyhood club Chelsea to sign the defender from Southampton last summer. Denis Irwin played for Manchester United for 12 years between 1990 and 2002 . Shaw jokes about with Marouane Fellaini during a United training session last week . Irwin believes it is unreasonable to expect too much too soon from a player who only made his Premier League debut in November 2012, regardless of how much United paid for him. 'He has had a big couple of years,' said Irwin, who played 529 times for the club. 'He had a couple of years at Southampton, he had a big-money move here and he was involved in a World Cup at just 18-years-old so the spotlight has been on him through no fault of his own. 'When you are 19 you will make mistakes and you will learn from them. 'I have no doubt he will be getting plenty of advice from the coaches and the manager.' Shaw, who has been suffering from another hamstring injury recently, sat out United's 3-0 win over Spurs on Sunday. The win tightened United's grip on fourth place and they now sit just two points behind second-placed Manchester City. Irwin (left) celebrates with Roy Keane and David Beckham after scoring a penalty against Liverpool in 1999 . The long-time United left back slides into a challenge with a young David Dunn against Blackburn in 1999 . Irwin was impressed by the performance against Spurs and he now hopes the team will produce similar performances against their top-four rivals in the coming weeks to secure the Champions League football which they have missed so dearly this term. 'It was a big loss for us when we didn't qualify for the Champions League. It's been a strange year,' said Irwin, who was part of the team that won the trophy in the most dramatic fashion in 1999. 'We have missed Champions League football, I have missed big teams coming here. 'There are some big matches coming up in the round of 16. We are not involved and it's not nice watching. 'City go to Barcelona this week and we watch that and wish we were part of it because it's the best club competition in the world.'

"Manuel Pellegrini admits Manchester City need a 'crack' player to take them to the next level. The term is used in Spain to describe a world star, a galactico, who can transform the team. The reigning Premier League champions saw their hopes of retaining the title diminish after a shock 1-0 defeat by Burnley on Saturday. Here Sportsmail identifies five names City have considered as they approach a pivotal summer in their development. Manuel Pellegrini insists Sergio Aguero needs another 'crack' player to support him at the Etihad . Despite his expensively assembled squad, Pellegrini still thinks City need more star quality . Aguero failed to score as the champion's hopes of retaining the title suffered a blow against Burnley . PAUL POGBA . Juventus £55m . City have trailed Pogba since he was on their doorstep at Manchester United. The 22-year-old can be the dominant force in City's midfield for years to come and add the extra energy they have lacked this year. Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta said: 'There are many suitors for Pogba, but we do not want to open negotiations and we want him to stay with us.' That said if clubs offer £55m it will be difficult for the Italians to reject. Chances: 4/5 . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has become one of the world's best midfielders at Juve . The Italians insist Pogba is not for sale but an offer in excess of £55m could prove too tempting . KEVIN de BRUYNE . Wolfsburg £35m . Has grown into one of the best midfielders in Europe on current form. He is playing as a No 10, dominating games, creating chances and scoring goals. The Belgian could prove to be one of Jose Mourinho's biggest mistakes. Yes, Chelsea made a profit when they sold him but he now looks a player who can have greater influence on a game than Oscar and Willian. City have watched him closely this season and Wolfsburg expect a bid. Chances: 4/5 . The Belgium international has been starring in the Bundesliga since his move from Chelsea to Wolfsburg . The Belgium international's recent form has raised questions over why Jose Mourinho let him leave Chelsea . KOKE . Atletico Madrid £44m . The jewel in the crown of Atletico Madrid. Managers have gone to watch him and questioned whether he was big and strong enough for the Premier League but he is 5ft 10ins and, like the smaller Marco Verratti at Paris St Germain, Koke has the athleticism and strength which allows him to handle the rough treatment. Has proven at European and domestic level he is a player of repute. Much will depend where Diego Simeone ends up. Chances: 2/5 . Atletico Madrid's pass master Koke is seen as the heir in waiting to Barcelona's Xavi in Spain . Koke celebrates his goal against Valencia with former Chelsea striker Fernando Torres (right) GARETH BALE . Real Madrid £75m . Bale is determined to ride out the storm in Madrid but won't be short of admirers should he opt to leave. Despite the fuss over Manchester United's overtures to him, Bale was aware of City's interest prior to his departure from Tottenham and would listen if his time at Madrid was up. A homegrown player to boot, he has matured since leaving White Hart Lane and would give City the pace and direct dynamic they have lacked this season. Chances: 3/5 . Gareth Bale's struggles to win over Real Madrid's fickle fans could lead to a return to the Premier League . Bale scored twice in the weekend win over Levante, which will have pleased some fans if not Cristiano Ronaldo . VIDEO Bale double silences critics . CRISTIANO RONALDO . Real Madrid £80m . Surely not? The chat among some City players last week was that Cristiano Ronaldo was destined for Manchester and not the Old Trafford side.

"Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has called on Renault to get their act together and help save his organisation's season. Horner was left fuming following the opening race in Australia on Sunday after Red Bull found themselves severely handicapped by power-unit supplier Renault over the course of the weekend. Initially, the Milton Keynes-based marque were forced to change the power unit on Daniel Ricciardo's car in between practice sessions on Friday due to a problem with the engine. Red Bull chief Christian Horner has accused engine supplier Renault of going backwards this season . Daniel Ricciardo could only manage a sixth-placed finish for Red Bull during the Australian Grand Prix . Red Bull's second driver Daniil Kvyat pulled out of Sunday's opening race with a gear box failure . Come the race further embarrassment followed as Daniil Kvyat, on his debut for the team following his promotion last year from Toro Rosso, retired on the formation lap with a suspected gearbox failure. Horner has already called on the FIA to introduce equalisation rules as he fears Mercedes will continue to dominate after their easy one-two around Melbourne's Albert Park, spearheaded by Lewis Hamilton. More pertinently, though, Horner knows Renault have to up their game otherwise the rest of the campaign will be a washout. 'Renault need to have a clear vision and they need it quickly,' said Horner. 'You can see Ferrari have made a good step forward, whereas Renault at this stage appear to have made a retrograde step. 'It's frustrating we are effectively further back than we were in Abu Dhabi in both power and driveability. 'It means we haven't seen the potential of our car yet because it's masked by the engine issues we have.' Max Verstappen (centre) walks back to Toro Rosso team garage after retiring from the Australian Grand Prix . Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg finished first and second respectively at the Australian Grand Prix . VIDEO Hamilton cruises to victory in Australian GP . As to the steps required over the coming weeks, Horner added: 'First we have to understand what the problem is in order to address it. 'Until Renault get to the bottom of what the issues are they are very difficult to address. A lot of dyno running needs to be done in order to understand. 'It's important we regroup with Renault and offer support where we can because it's obviously in a bit of a mess at the moment. 'But we need to understand things quickly. Across the four cars (Renault also supply Toro Rosso) we had two engine failures - one within five laps - and a whole bunch of reliability problems. 'It's not the start Renault can afford to have.' After an abysmal start to pre-season a year ago Red Bull recovered to claim three wins and finish second in the constructors' championship, albeit a long way adrift of Mercedes. Red Bull struggled to keep up with Mercedes, WIlliams and Ferrari at the Australian Grand Prix . Red Bull and Renault were expected to take a step closer this season, but instead Horner fears they will be cut adrift. Asked whether Renault were capable of producing a championship- challenging engine, Horner replied: 'This year, no. 'But we need to be doing a lot better than we are. We need to be challenging Ferrari and Williams. 'If we sort the issues out then we can do that, but the drivers need to have a fair run at it and they didn't have that over the weekend.'","Red Bull chief wants engine supplier to Renault to improve their reliability .

"Atletico Madrid's comedown from being seconds away from winning last season's Champions League final only to concede in the 90th minute and finish up losing 4-1 will reach a new low on Tuesday night if they go out of this year's tournament at the hands of Bayer Leverkusen. Coach Diego Simeone is counting on the spirit that got them to last year's showpiece in Lisbon to pull them through and for the Mario Mandzukic Antoine Griezmann parternship that produced 14 goals and eight assists in January and February before hitting something of a wall in March to fire them into the last eight. If those two fail he will have to call on Fernando Torres who insisted in an interview in El Pais on the eve of the game that he did feel part of Chelsea's Champions League success in 2012. Diego Simeone has called on the home support to lift his side as they attempt to come from behind . Atletico Madrid have not been at their best of late, but need to bounce back against Bayer Leverkusen . He said: 'I had made some important contributions. I scored in the semi-final against Barcelona and I come on for the last eight minutes of normal time against Bayern in the final and I think I played my part in the comeback. I am very proud to have won the Champions League.' He would dearly love to repeat his success for Chelsea with a repeat run to the final for his hometown club but Atletico have given themselves a difficult job after a poor first leg performance that ended with Bayern Leverkusen winning 1-0. The failure to find an away goal three weeks ago makes them outsiders tonight despite the battle cry from Simeone that there should not even be so much as a minute of quiet in the Vicente Calderon before and during the game. Sergio Ramos' 90th minute header denied Atletico their first ever Champions League title last summer . Carlo Ancelotti, rather than Diego Simeone, was left to lift the famous trophy in Lisbon . Simeone has never won a knockout tie after losing the first leg, but must turn that around on Tuesday . Despite the motivational magic of Atletico's charismatic manager, the Argentine has never over-turned a first leg deficit since he has been at the club. Under his stewardship Atletico have won 16 of 19 knockout matches but the three times they have suffered first leg defeats they have been eliminated. The coach's biggest concern will be that in the pusuit of goals they will concede. They have gone five Champions League games without letting in a goal but there are cracks appearing in their defence. Karim Bellarabi, Hakan Calhanoglu and Son Heung-min will provide a serious test for out of sorts holding midfielder Gabi, veteran right-back Jesus Gamez – filing in at left-back in the absence of any better alternative – and central defensive partnership of Jose Gimenez and Miranda forced on Simeone through Diego Godin's suspension. Around 1,300 supporters have travelled from Germany to Spain for the game. 'We know they have a strong mentality,' says Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt of Atletico. 'But we have to keep a cool head in what will be a very hot atmosphere.' VIDEO Atletico game tough despite lead - Schmidt . Gabi (left) has been out of form, and will be up against a formidable Bayer Leverkusen front line .

'Atletico will provoke, bite, scratch and kick us,' Bayer director Michael Schade was quoted as saying in the Madrid press while Marca called for 50,000 Simeones on its front page on Tuesday. When Atletico Madrid reached the European Cup final in 1974 and lost in a reply to Bayern Munich having been just seconds from winning in the first game before a late equalizer, it took them 40 years to get back to another final. They don't want the same fate this time.

"Sunderland finally cut ties with manager Gus Poyet on Monday after a 4-0 home defeat by fellow strugglers Aston Villa left the Wearside club just one point above the relegation zone in the Barclays Premier League. With that in mind, Sportsmail have Sunderland fan Joe Cooper of 90min.com to tell us what he makes of the situation. Is Dick Advocaat a suitable short-term replacement for Poyet? Let's see what he had to say. Gus Poyet's sacking as manager of Sunderland couldn't have come soon enough. Chairman Ellis Short took the decision on Monday and it's hard to argue that it wasn't the right call. The relationship just wasn't working, our supporters know it and they didn't hesitate to show the Uruguayan their dissatisfaction on a grim afternoon on Wearside on Saturday. There's a better fit out there. And while we've been clamouring for a change at the helm over the course of the last few months, it's become glaringly obvious that Poyet himself didn't want to remain in charge either. Gus Poyet's sacking as Sunderland manager could not come soon enough for the struggling club's fans . The relationship between Poyet, the club's board and their fans was not working and the move was correct . Angry Sunderland supporters attempt to confront Poyet during the 4-0 defeat to Aston Villa on Saturday . Additionally, Poyet's moniker of 'head coach' meant he was not in primary charge of signing players. He'd made it obvious that it wasn't something he was comfortable with. An unhealthy relationship at the top rolls downwards, as with any business. Poyet's attitude had transcended onto the pitch and it has been having a terrible effect. Saturday was the cast-iron evidence of that. We are just a point above the Barclays Premier League's relegation zone following the home 4-0 drubbing to Aston Villa. Bear in mind that this was a team with the league's worst attack and they'd put four past us before half-time. Poyet's position had become untenable. Dick Advocaat comes to the Wearside club with a wealth of experience from around European football . Advocaat has never managed in England before but is reportedly in line for a £500,000 survival bonus . The decision to remove Poyet doesn't reek of desperation, given  Advocaat's appointment within 24 hours . Our situation looks precarious, but it's worth remembering that it could be far worse. It's the right time for Poyet to leave. Something needed to be done before it was too late. Luckily, we've not quite reached that stage yet - there's nine games to save ourselves. We've moved swiftly in hiring a replacement, which is always promising. The decision to remove Poyet doesn't exactly reek of desperation, given former Rangers and Dutch national coach Dick Advocaat was brought in within 24 hours. Jermain Defoe and Steven Fletcher look disconsolate for Sunderland upfront on Saturday afternoon . One fan roars towards the bench as Poyet's tenure as manager drew to its inevitable close on Saturday . Another supporter holds up a hand-written sign with the message 'Poyet out' - his wish was granted on Monday . Advocaat has been handed the job on a short-term basis. As well as the wealth of managerial experience he brings, the reported £500,000 he'll pocket to avoid relegation is enough of a motivation. He's no spring chicken at 67, but Advocaat has spoken of his own hunger to prove himself in the Premier League. He's got the knowledge under his belt to do that. There's enough reason for the fans to be confident that we can stay up. New managers inevitably inject a shot in the arm to their players in their first few weeks. It should be enough to carry us through to the end. You only have to look at Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion to see the impact that both new managers have had on the teams' fortunes. Sam Allardyce has been touted as a potential replacement after an impressive season with West Ham . Steve McClaren looks Premier League-bound either with Derby County or one of many interested clubs . Our long-term aspirations may be higher than merely fighting relegation, but it's now a case of seeing this season out before starting afresh again next term. It likely won't be Advocaat to take us beyond this summer, but with the likes of Sam Allardyce and Steve McClaren - who have both had promising seasons at their respective clubs - linked as Poyet's long-term successor, things are looking up. Poyet had reached the point of no return, so it's time to start afresh. Again. HULL . Chelsea (Home) - March 22 . Swansea (Away) - April 4 . Southampton (Away) - April 11 .

"There will be no German Grand Prix this year, Hockenheim circuit boss Georg Seiler said on Tuesday in a decision that ended months of uncertainty over the country's Formula One race. The absence of Germany, home of reigning world champions Mercedes, for the first time since 1960 leaves the calendar with 19 races. 'We have no hope any more of having a Formula One race here (this year),' Seiler told Bild newspaper. 'We did everything in the last few years to keep the fans happy.' Fernando Alonso, then of Ferrari, leads the field into the first corner at the 2010 German Grand Prix . Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg celebrates winning last year's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim . Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone had kept the door ajar but Seiler said time had run out because 'quality would now suffer' if they went ahead with the 10th round of the championship. 'We had declared ourselves willing to step in for Nurburgring, something we were contractually not obliged to do,' he said. 'There were talks with third parties over taking over the risk but they were not successful.' Ecclestone said that Hockenheim was the only option for the July 19 race despite it being the Nurburgring's turn under an alternation agreement. Hockenheim hosted last year's grand prix, and is also due to host it in 2016, but the circuit has made heavy losses due to poor attendances and is unwilling to shoulder the burden for three years in a row. Attendances have dwindled at the German race since legend Michael Schumacher retired in 2012 . The seven-time champion is pictured celebrating his triumph at his home race back in 2006 . The Nurburgring, one of the sport's most historic venues with the original track dating from the pre-World War Two years, also has financial troubles and has changed ownership since it last appeared on the calendar. German drivers have been among the most successful in Formula One, with Michael Schumacher winning a record seven world titles and 91 races while Sebastian Vettel is a four times champion. However attendances dwindled after Schumacher, who won five of his titles for Ferrari, retired in 2012 after an unsuccesful comeback with Mercedes. Only 52,000 fans turned up on race day at Hockenheim last year to see Germany's Nico Rosberg win the race for Mercedes. The victory was the first by a German driver in a German car on home soil since the 1930s.

"An Aston Villa fan has revealed he was covered in blood after being struck on the head by a chair flung from the West Bromwich Albion section in scenes Kevin Phillips described as life-threatening. Mark Villers was watching Villa’s 2-0 FA Cup win over their local rivals from the lower section of the North Stand when away supporters housed above began ripping out seats and throwing them down. He told how he required treatment from Villa’s club doctor, who needed to cut his hair and glue the grisly wound on the top of his head closed. Aston Villa supporter Mark Villers needed his hair cut and wound glued together on Saturday night . Villers, 20, shows his blood-stained trainers after being hit by a seat during the Midlands derby at Villa Park . ‘It was mental,’ said Villers, 20, who attended the game with two friends. ‘We could see them throwing down the chairs after we scored the second so we walked down to by the advertising boards. We didn’t think they’d be able to reach. ‘All of a sudden, everyone shouted, “Duck” and stupidly I turned around. It literally hit me bang on the forehad, head on. ‘It was a shock but I didn’t think anything of it. I carried on cheering. Then I felt the blood pouring down my face. It was really bad. I’ve never bled that much. It was pouring out all over my clothes. It was a bad cut. ‘The pain wasn’t that bad, it was the shock of seeing blood come down my face. I knew it had hit me quite hard but I didn’t think it would cut me. It must have been caught by the sharp bit. ‘There were quite a lot of seats. After we scored the second goal things started flying down. To guess at the end it must have been 20 or 25. One landed on the pitch. Villers claims that West Brom supporters threw chairs at Villa supporters during the FA Cup tie . The fan's jeans and shoes were seen to be covered in claret after the trouble . ‘I didn’t need to go to hospital. I went to the stewards and they ushered me down the tunnel where the paramedics were. They held the tissue on and then the Villa doctor came, took me into the medical room, and glued it up for me. ‘He had to cut my hair unfortunately so I’ve got a bit of a bald patch. He cleaned me up and sent me on my way. ‘At least I got to go down the tunnel! I was sat down on a stretcher and saw Jack Grealish come through after he got sent off. Then I saw everyone going mad with the pitch invasion. ‘The pitch invasion is bad but I don’t think it’s as bad as people throwing chairs.' Speaking on Match of the Day, Phillips – who played for both West Brom and Villa during his playing career – said such actions could have been fatal.

Those people should be found and banned.’ Villers, a business development manager at a futsal centre, questioned why Villa organise the away seating in such a fashion for Cup matches. ‘Having the away fans above the home fans for Cup games is pretty stupid and is asking for trouble in my opinion,’ he said. ‘They should change that. One of the paramedics said a fan had been hit by a 50p piece.’ West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner also appeared to have coins thrown his direction when taking corners near Villa fans.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"And then there was one. Arsenal were victorious in Monte Carlo, as many thought they would be. They didn’t win big enough to progress, however, as few thought they would do. Tasty side, Monaco. Well organised, disciplined, brave, resolute. The region may be famous for speculation and bold gambles, but Jose Mourinho would be proud of the side produced by his compatriot Leonardo Jardim. This was a pragmatic, impressive display against a team who knew they needed three goals and threw all they had at that task in the second half.

It was horribly tense for Monaco once Aaron Ramsey scored Arsenal’s second with 11 minutes to go — but, once again, in this competition Arsene Wenger’s team lost it in the first leg. That third away goal at the Emirates Stadium was the killer. It was the one Wenger’s players could not match. Monaco knew they had done the hardest yards in London and ultimately settled for heroic defeat. It was like watching one of Nick Faldo’s fourth-day specials. They played to par, laid up at the big one, didn’t take the course on, and won. As Arsenal threw more at it with the minutes slipping away, Monaco pressed forward and substitute Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco nipped one across the face of goal that could have ended the contest there and then. Instead, Arsenal were left with hope right until the end, a goal short of the last eight. It is the hope that does for you in the end, of course. It probably would have hurt less to have lost both legs. The goal that brought Arsenal to the brink of one of the greatest fightbacks in Champions League history came in the 79th minute after Theo Walcott hit a post with a side-footed shot. A rare moment of blind panic saw full back Layvin Kurzawa clear horribly straight to Ramsey. He took a touch and struck it low into the far corner. Cue pandemonium in the closing stages, not least when referee Svein Oddvar Moen, from Norway, signalled a generous period of five minutes additional time. Yet, really, Arsenal did little with it. They lumped it in, Monaco hoofed it out. Predictably, Monaco’s hoofs were better than Arsenal’s lumps. It really isn’t their game. Nor is the high-tempo, high-energy, gung-ho rollercoaster that was Tottenham Hotspur’s famous comeback against Inter Milan in the San Siro, a repeat of which may just have rattled the French side. Four goals and a goalkeeper down at half-time, Tottenham pulled it back to 4-3 and would surely have drawn level had they not run out of time. Giroud scored in the first half at the Stade Louis II to give Arsenal hope of pulling off a comeback in their last-16 tie . The French striker picked his spot from a tight angle to give Arsenal the lead over Monaco in the last 16 second leg . Monaco's defenders on the line cannot stop Giroud's 36th-minute shot from hitting the roof of the net . Giroud's goal left Arsenal needing two more to progress in the remaining 55 minutes in the French principality . Yet they had Gareth Bale in the ranks that night. Arsenal have lovely passers and schemers but nobody who is going to terrify a back four as Bale did. The best they could offer was Olivier Giroud trying to pretend he was Marouane Fellaini, with Mesut Ozil in the Michael Carrick role. Monaco lapped up his timid floaters. A more furious approach might have disturbed them, but Arsenal lacked that verve. Equally, Monaco’s centre halves, Wallace and Aymen Abdennour, were exceptional — a different league from the Inter team that Tottenham faced. So it is now down to Manchester City, the last Premier League team standing, to restore English pride and claim a place in the Champions League quarter-finals. They trail 2-1 with a return leg in Barcelona’s Nou Camp. Nobody is holding their breath. They were the rank outsiders going into these rematches. Aaron Ramsey came off the bench to score Arsenal's second in the 79th minute to set up a grandstand finish . Ramsey celebrates his goal with Per Mertesacker to pull Arsenal within one goal of pulling off an unlikely comeback . Laurent Koscielny celebrates Ramsey's goal as Arsenal pushed their opponents all the way in their last-16 contest . Aaron Ramsey's strike in the 79th minute was the 300th goal in European competition that Arsenal have scored under Arsene Wenger. England did not have representation beyond the second round in 2013, either, but twice in three years will be a bitter pill to swallow. Arsenal were the better team last night but then they had to be. They had significant levels of possession in the second half without really threatening goalkeeper Danijel Subasic for long periods. For Monaco to progress on away goals appears close but, once again, Arsenal deceive. They were never in a winning position, on aggregate, in the 180 minutes of the tie. Arsenal grew into the game after a flat opening 15 minutes enlivened only by a cross from Hector Bellerin that Giroud headed wide. Cazorla, whose heat map is shown above, was at the centre of most of Arsenal's attacking play. CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE . Alexis Sanchez goes down in the Monaco penalty area after being pursued by Nabil Dirar . Arsenal's Chilean forward Sanchez is booked by referee Svein Oddvar Moen for simulation . The yellow card given to Arsenal striker Alexis Sanchez for diving after 41 minutes was a poor decision by Norwegian referee Svein Oddvar Moen. Maybe the contact wasn’t enough for a penalty but it wasn’t a dive. You can see what Sanchez thought of the referee’s decision! From there, however, the game began to progress along familiar lines, Arsenal in the ascendancy, Monaco retreating to massed ranks of stout defence. For a while it looked as if they were more than capable of holding out — Monaco are a tight defensive unit with that most old-fashioned of qualities, a couple of big units who don’t mind putting a foot in — but Arsenal got a breakthrough after 36 minutes. It was Danny Welbeck who set up the goal, driving forward and slipping his final pass to Giroud, who was left with only Subasic to beat. Giroud’s shot was blocked, but the ball rebounded and struck him on the shoulder. With Subasic stranded on the floor, Giroud reacted quickest and after scanning the immediate area, seized on the loose ball, rifling it into the roof of the net with Monaco’s covering defenders helpless. After his travails in the first leg — hooked by Wenger to utter derision, having missed enough chances to put Arsenal in the quarter-finals – this was a perfect response. He had at least guaranteed to outstrip the two marks out of ten he previously received from French newspaper L’Equipe. Just two minutes later, Arsenal could have been further ahead. Alexis Sanchex hit a cross which was cleared under pressure from Giroud and fell to Welbeck whose shot was blocked, sprawling, by Abdennour. Even then, it spun and almost squeaked over the line as Subasic scrambled to recover. Sanchez was booked for diving, which seemed harsh — it didn’t look like a foul, but not a dive either — and Wenger may take a dim view privately of Ozil’s decision to swap shirts with Geoffrey Kondogbia at half-time.

Sure enough, one of Kondogbia’s first acts of the second half was to go in late on Santi Cazorla, provoking a scream that could be heard all around the Stade Louis II. That was a different kind of souvenir to take home. From the free-kick Ozil’s dipper was flicked over by Subasic, in no mood to return any favours. So one it is.

"Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil came under criticism as the German international swapped shirts at half-time during the Champions League last-16 clash with Monaco.

"Seven years ago, Nathan Bracken was the world’s number one bowler in one day international cricket and was on his way to becoming a cricket legend. Today, he has a permanent disability, cannot straighten his right leg and can barely carry his baby son for fear that it will buckle under him. He and his family say they face financial ruin because of the tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills they face after an injury he suffered playing for Australia. His wife, Haley Bracken has spoken to Daily Mail Australia about her family's struggles as they continue to fight Cricket Australia during an exhausting five year legal battle. Scroll down for video . Nathan Bracken (far left) and his wife Haley (far right) have been facing constant legal and medical fees for more than five years and are concerned for the impact on their family, including their sons Tag and Chase . Nathan Bracken (left playing for Australia in 2009, right with wife Haley) walks with a limp after suffering a debilitating knee injury whilst playing cricket for Australia. His wife has spoken out about the impact . The Brackens have already been forced to sell a property and two cars and fear they will lose 'everything' ‘Nathan has suffered severe depression. There have been times that he’s been balled up on the couch crying, so stressed,' Haley Bracken told Daily Mail Australia. ‘He’d say to me “What am I going to do? I can’t support our family”. 'We haven't spoken out for sympathy but the truth is, I have experienced anxiety attacks and we worry about our future everyday. 'This situation has impacted on the family in a very negative way,’ said Haley, a model, dancer, presenter and mother. When Nathan's career ended instantaneously, he was left with no other job prospects and no income. He had never finished his degree, a Bachelor of Communications, due to his international travel commitments with cricket and had anticipated he had years of cricket ahead of him. A role was made for Nathan in his father-in-law's recruitment company. Haley Bracken arrives at the 2010 Allan Border Medal at Crown Casino . Haley with their beautiful little boy Tag, now aged one. She worries about the impact of the financial worries and intense stress on their two sons . Nathan (left) with their seven-year-old son, Chase. Chase is a 'sweet, sensitive boy' who has already said he does not want to play cricket after seeing the impact it has had on his family's life . The couple, parents of two young boys, have already sold a property and two cars to make ends meet and fear that their little family could have to sell their home. ‘My parents have already offered that we can all move in there if we need to,' Haley said. 'We already sold the land where we’d planned on building our dream property and had a garage sale to get rid of belongings. We have to drive past that property every day on the school run.’ The couple allege that Nathan approached Cricket Australia one year after his career-ending knee injury to enquire about what policies were in place to assist with his medical costs. CA officials allegedly refused to help him. ‘That’s when we knew it was going to be very difficult,’ said Haley. Their lives changed immediately, descending from the glory of first class cricket to no source of income. Nathan had no other job opportunities and an endless pile of medical and legal bills, which continue today. ‘The letters keep on coming. Every time I look at a new lawyer’s letter I feel sick because I know it’s just another massive bill. I just have to try and think about it all one day at a time,' said Haley. Haley says it hurts to see how depressed the ordeal has made her husband after a life loving cricket . Haley says she wants people to stand up for themselves and others and to question big corporations . Haley is proud of her resilient family and frequently posts about them on social media . Nathan Bracken first launched his lawsuit in 2011 against Cricket Australia, seeking compensation for lost wages, medical expenses and damages. He had been forced to retire that year at the age of 31. Although it is not the easy option, Haley says she knows it was the right decision to take a stand. 'I want people to see that if we can stand up for our rights, they can too. To question those in authority and question what happens in big corporations.' It hurts Haley to see the impact it has on her husband who found so much happiness playing cricket. 'What breaks my heart the most is that Nathan gave his heart and soul to cricket,' she said. 'He was away a lot and there was a lot of sacrifice. For them to turn around and wipe their hands of him breaks my heart' The couple try to stay strong as they are incredibly concerned for their two young sons; Chase, seven and Tag, one. ‘My eldest son is the sweetest, most sensitive soul. It does make this process hard because he is so sensitive,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. ‘This has unavoidably had a huge impact on my family. ‘We try to keep him out of it. But Chase said to us, “I don’t want to play cricket”...’ Seven years ago, Nathan Bracken was the world’s number one bowler in one day international cricket and was on his way to becoming a cricket legend (pictured playing for the Blues in 2010) Haley and Nathan Bracken desperately want the court case to be over for the sake of their family; particularly their sons Chase (left) and Tag . He told us, “Dad, you hurt your knee playing cricket, I don’t want to do that.” This whole thing has skewed his view, he’s just a kid.’ Haley says she and her family have become stronger through the process, . Her husband has battled debilitating injuries after his incredible cricket career and has been left with a permanent disability. Haley says the impact of those injuries has been immense, to the point that her husband would not carry their baby down stairs, terrified his injured knee would buckle. Nathan is unable to straighten his knee so he cannot do an exercise as simple as kicking a football in the backyard with their two little boys. ‘Nathan had an ankle operation on the other leg (not the knee which currently needs surgery) and he collapsed on the floor. ‘He just couldn’t get up. I tried to help him up but there’s quite a height distance between us so I couldn’t. ‘So I just sat on the floor and cried with him, thinking: “this is our future”. I don’t want that to happen, where I can’t lift him or help him in any way.’ Nathan is unable to straighten his knee so he cannot do an exercise as simple as kicking a football in the backyard with their two little boys . Haley is grateful for her resilient family and relieved that they will soon have certainty about their future. ‘We know that no matter what we’re going through, we’ve got our family. ‘I say to Nathan that even if we’re living in a cardboard box we’ll always have each other.’ Nathan and Haley also allege that Cricket Australia are not fulfilling their responsibilities as an employer, neglecting him once he was injured. They are concerned that Medicare and private health insurance have been allegedly paying for cricketer's injuries, accusing Cricket Australia of not having adequate insurance schemes. 'Those resources are being taken away from people who have no other option,' Haley claimed.

'It’s important to stand up for your own rights but it’s particularly important to stand up for other’s rights as well.' Cricket Australia were contacted by Daily Mail Australia but said they could not comment on legal grounds.

Goals: Suarez 27' Bayer Leverkusen: Leno, Hilbert, Toprak, Spahic, Wendell, Bellarabi, Castro, Bender (Papadopoulos 114'), Son (Rolfes 76'), Calhanoglu, Drmic (Kiessling 68') Subs not used: Kresic, Reinartz, Boenisch, Brandt . Booked: Spahic, Toprak, Calhanoglu, Papadopoulos, Wendell . Referee: Nicola Rizzoli (Bologna) Antoine Griezmann stepped up and showed everyone how penalties should be taken scoring high into the roof of the net. Simon Rolfes did likewise to level the scores and Mario Suarez scored his second goal of the night having put Atletico ahead in normal time. When Omer Toprak put his kick nervously over the bar Atletico looked to have the finish line in sight only for Bernd Leno to save Koke’s kick. Gonzalo Castro then scored but after Torres had snuck his penalty just inside Leno’s right hand upright Kiessling missed and the Calderon erupted with joy. Atletico came into the game one goal down from the first leg and struggled to make in-roads early on with a Koke free-kick not really testing Leno. Simone’s team knew one lapse on the break would need them leaving to score three and when Son Heugn-Min was put through by Bender on 22 minutes it was his miscontrol that prevented him getting a shot on target. As he came out to close down Son, Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Miguel Moya pulled a hamstring and had to be replaced by Oblak. Losing their keeper and having to use a substitute so early was a major set-back for Simeone but four minutes later he was running along the touchline as Atletico Madrid took the lead. Cani headed the ball down for Mario Suarez and his shot through the crowded penalty area caught and went past Leno to put the home side ahead on the night. With their next attack Atletico could have got the all-important second goal but a brilliant tackle from Wendell denied Mario Mandzukic. It was Arda’s pefect through ball that put the Croatian striker through but as he delayed his shot the Brazilian defender clean swept the ball away from him to safety. It was brilliant defending but would any of Atletico Madrid’s previous strikers – Sergio Aguero, Radamel Falcao, Diego Costa – have buried it before the defender could react? Probably yes.

Battering ram Mandzukic perhaps has other qualities but he was battered himself just before half time and left the pitch limping at the break. Surprisingly when the two teams emerged for the second half he was still on the pitch and Simeone had taken off Cani and put on Raul Garcia. The midfield so nearly turned the ball past Leno from Koke’s cross in Atletico Madrid’s best chance of the second half. Koke had been inspirational throughout as Atletico took the game to Bayer. And as the clock showed 20 minutes of normal time left the crowd responded by cranking up the Vicente Calderon noise levels. It spurred the team on and Griezmann hurtled down the left and crossed for Turan who flicked the ball behind him where there was no runner to finish the move. Griezmann then crossed again for Turan and this time he got his shot away only for Leno to save. Raul Garcia went down in the area under a challenge from Toprak but the referee waved away appeals. Raul Garcia stayed down, Simone urged him to get up and turned to Atletico supporters once more to lift his team. Everyone in the Calderon got a lift with eight minutes left when Fernando Torres was roared on to the pitch to replace Mandzukic. Could El Nino win the game for them?

Atletico Madrid had also picked up three yellow cards and there was no let-up as the clock ticked down. Wendal became the seventh player to be booked when he chopped down Torres as he charged down the right with a minute left. The free-kick came to nothing but Torres kept going and forced a corner but Koke’s near-post kick was cleared and the referee blew for full time. Stefan Kiessling was booked at the start of extra time – the German team’s fifth on the night – and they then had to take off the injured Lars Bender replacing him with Kyriakos Papadopoulos. Torres was still stretching the opposition and with Leverkusen on the back foot a stinging shot from Raul Garcia was pushed away for a corner by Leno but over the two legs the Germans had proved as good at defending them as Atletico Madrid at taking them. With five minutes to go Torres so nearly won it with a diving header from Koke’s cross. There was direction on the effort but not enough power to beat Leno. It didn’t matter, he scored his penalty and his dream of reaching another Champions League final - this time with his home town club - lives on.

"Europes largest budget airline has just been granted approval to develop a transatlantic service between Europe and America. Ryanair, the Ireland-based budget carrier, plans to run services between key European cities and the US with one-way tickets costing from as little as $15. The idea is part of an aggressive growth strategy, connecting airports such as London Stansted and Berlin with New York, Boston and Miami. Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, has received board approval to develop a transatlantic service for budget passengers, with one-way tickets between the US and key European cities costing as little as $15 . The airline first mooted the idea of offering transatlantic flights back in 2008 and board approval comes after the airline has invested 18 months in cleaning up its image and improving customer service. It is believed it could take up to five years to realize the plan, as the airline needs to source appropriate long-haul aircraft for the routes. Last year, Michael O’Leary, the airline’s chief executive, told the Irish Hotels Federation conference in Meath that Ryanair would offer the $15 flights to Boston and New York. However, he admitted that passengers would pay extra for everything from meals to baggage. He said: 'We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe. Michael O'Leary  previously said the airline has long been looking at long-haul flight plans, but is held back by a lack of aircraft availability . 'Not every seat will be ($15) of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats.' In a separate conversation, Mr O'Leary admitted: 'We've had a business plan ready to roll for a transatlantic, low-fares airline. 'The difficulty is, I keep cautioning, is that there's no availability of long-haul aircraft for another four or five years.' Sir Freddie Laker revolutionised air travel with his idea for budget flights between Europe and the US, but his airline failed in 1982 . Ryaniar isn't the only airline to consider offering budget transatlantic flights. Previously, Sir Freddie Laker launched Skytrain in the late Seventies to offer 'no frills' flights to the US, but his carrier Lake Airways failed in 1982. Zoom Airlines tried a similar concept in 2002 but was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2008. More recently, Norwegian has launched its own budget flights between London Gatwick, New York, Boston and Los Angeles from as little as £389 ($415) return.","Ryanair is Europe's largest budget airline carrier .

"Footage has emerged of doomed Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan speaking about second chances just hours after the first round of executions on January 18. The heartbreaking video shows Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail. Behind him prison bars are visible as he looks tearily into the camera and talks in soft spoken tones. Scroll down for video . The heartbreaking video shows Andrew Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail . The 30-second video was aired on Channel Seven's Sunday Night. 'My name's Andrew Chan,' the convicted drug smuggler said. 'It's a day - pretty much a few hours - after the execution of six innocent lives. 'Guess what runs through my head is about how precious life really is.' On January 18, five people were executed by firing squad on Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island - in Central Java. Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, Malawi's Namaona Denis and Indonesia's Rani Adriani were killed that day. Another woman Tran Bich Hanh, from Vietnam, was also put to death nearby. Myuran Sukuraman (right) revealed he knew the identity of ringleader Mr Big and tried to strike a deal with Indonesian police to spare his life, while Chan (left) denied he knew anything about him . Kerobokan prison had been the Bali Nine duo's home for 10 years after they were found guilty of drug smuggling . Their deaths triggered Chan to ask: 'I guess sometimes you kinda got to think, what does it take to get a second chance? 'People get second chances within their lives on the outside, but how much can you get when you’re a convicted criminal.' Since they were sentenced to death, Chan converted to Christianity and studied to become a pastor while behind bars. At the same time, Sukuraman - under the tutelage of Ben Quilty - has become an artist, even teaching inmates how to paint. This turnaround in the pair has led many to believe they have been rehabilitated. Sunday Night also revealed fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukuraman knew the identity of 'Mr Big' - the ringleader of the group - but did not want to name him publicly as he feared for the safety his family. Sukuraman told the news program he had tried to trade this information to avoid the death penalty, but Indonesian police refused the offer. Myuran Sukuraman (left) and Andrew Chan (right) are being led to an armoured vehicle at Cilacap airport in Central Java on Wednesday . 'We tried with the police to get some sort of co-operation thing but there weren't really like that was our only card that we had to play,' he said. 'They wouldn't and then the lawyers advised us not to go that way.' While Chan said he did not know the identity of the mystery ringleader. Sukuraman also admitted he had thought about hanging himself or getting someone else to shoot him. 'I don't really think I'll enjoy the process of being dragged in front of a firing squad,' he said. The pair are being held on Nusakambangan where inmates are held before they executed . The duo have been on Nusakambangan since Wednesday. The pair were transferred just after 5am in heavily armoured vehicles to Denpasar airport, where they flew to Cilacap - the port nearest to Nusakambangan - where they were ferried over to the island. Their executions have been delayed indefinitely as a number of inmates await the outcome of court proceedings. Chan and Sukuraman's second challenge for clemency was rejected in January but their lawyers hope Thursday's hearing in a Jakarta court. This latest action hopes to see the president reconsider their execution as Joko Widodo did not have documents charting the pair's rehabilitation in prison, according their lawyers.","Video surfaces of Andrew Chan reflecting on life after January's executions .

"Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey handed Arsenal a 2-0 win away in Monaco, but it wasn't enough as Arsene Wenger's side crashed out of the Champions League. French striker Giroud struck in the first half to give travelling Arsenal fans a glimmer of hope at the Stade Louis II before Ramsey grabbed a second. However, a resilient Monaco defence refused to let in another and the French side progressed to the next round on the away goals rule. Sportsmail's Rob Draper was at the game to give the lowdown in France... Arsenal . David Ospina 6 . So little to do, the Colombian effectively took the evening off for much of the game. Hector Bellerin 5.5 . Loves to get forward, can’t be faulted in his running. But still partial to panicky moments in his own penalty area. Monaco's Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho vies with Arsenal's midfielder Francis Coquelin . Per Mertesacker 6 . In control, assured. A different player altogether to the man who fell apart in the first leg. Laurent Koscielny 6.5 . Almost opened the scoring with a prod on to the bat from very close range. Had less to do at the back. Nacho Monreal 5.5 . Pushed on, got forward, but his delivery on the cross lets him down at times and was exposed at times. Francis Coquelin 6.5 . Taking his enforcer role to heart. Twice he crunched Joao Moutinho in half in the first half but avoided a yellow card. Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla attempts a special effort during the UEFA Champions League . Santi Cazorla 6.5 . Adequate but not quite the little magician that you were expecting given that he has been Arsenal’s best player of late. Alexis Sanchez 5.5 . Strangely lackadaisical in his passing which almost let in Monaco in the eighth minute. Booked – harshly – for a dive. His energy was impressive as ever. Mesut Ozil 7 . Never stopped trying to create, always looking for the killer pass – had an extremely organised Monaco midfield with which he had to contend. Arsenal's German defender Per Mertesacker vies with Monaco's French defender Layvin Kurzawa . Danny Welbeck 7 . A veritable bundle of energy, driving into the Monaco penalty area. His pass set up Giroud’s goal. Came off on 71 minutes as influence faded. Olivier Giroud 7.5 . Really excellent finish to open the scoring. His reaction and poise once the ball bounced off his head was superb. Redemptive after the first game. Subs . Aaron Ramsey (for Coquelin 62) 7 - Fine reaction and finish when Kurzawa inexplicably gave the ball to him on 79 minutes. Walcott (for Welbeck 72) 6 . Gibbs (for Monreal 82) 6 . Monaco defender Wallace vies with  French striker Giroud during the match  at Louis II stadium . Manager . Arsene Wenger 7 . Game plan was assured, defence was solid and they gave themselves the chance. It did beg the question why they couldn’t have done that in the first leg? Monaco . Danijel Subasic 8 . Solid taking crosses and produced good saves, notably from Ozil’s second half free-kick. Unfortunate for Giroud’s goal. Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin vies with Monaco's French forward Anthony Martial during the  match . Fabinho 5 . Struggled to maintain composure at times as Arsenal poured forward. A difficult night. Aymen Abdennour 6.5 . Was the leader at the back, forever cajoling and generally anticipating much of Arsenal’s attacking intent. Wallace 6 . Preferred to the much more experienced Ricardo Carvalho and didn’t let his side down. Layvin Kurzawa 4 . Looked vulnerable, especially when Welbeck switched to the right. Dreadful error giving the ball away for the second goal. Monaco's Bulgarian forward Dimitar Berbatov  vies with Arsenal's French midfielder Coquelin . Geoffrey Kondogbia 7.5 . Fought, tackled and ran. Did as much anyone to secure Monaco’s passage to the quarters. Jeremy Toulalon 7 . Composed, robust, provided leadership, especially in those tricky final few minutes. Nabil Dirar 7.5 . Remained a threat even with Monaco camped in their own half. Terrific speed and desire. Joao Moutinho 6.5 . Not as influential as the first leg but still fulfilled his duties and brought composure when necessary. Giroud celebrates as he gives Arsenal a glimmer of hope against Monaco at the Louis II stadium . Anthony Martial 5 . Strugled to make an impact and taken of on 59 minutes. Dimitar Berbatov 7 . The touches were just as exquisite as always; did what he does and then departed after 76 minutes to make way for younger, fitter men. Subs . Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco (for Martial 59) 7 . Bernado Silva (For Berbatov 76) 6 . Nabil Dirar (for Edelson 85) 6 . Arsenal's Chilean ace Alexis Sanchez vies for the ball with Monaco's French defender Kurzawa . Manager . Leonardo Jardim 7.5 . So they lost 2-0 – but over two legs Jardim has been masterful. Even last night his team were superbly set up. Ref . Svein Oddvar Moen 6 . Perhaps harsh on booking Alexis Sanchez for diving; otherwise avoided major controversy for the most part and refereed sensibly.","Giroud fired Arsenal into the lead in the first half against Monaco .

"It's been a long journey from Australia to Bradford City and the brink of the FA Cup semi-finals for James Meredith. At one point, during a break between his seven English – and one Irish – clubs, the defender found himself training alone in a park in Derby ‘like Rocky Balboa’. Amazingly, Meredith will be looking forward to his fifth Wembley appearance if League One giantkillers Bradford can deliver another knockout blow to Reading in Saturday’s quarter-final tie at Valley Parade. James Meredith holds of then-Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah during their FA Cup clash in west London . Jon Stead scores in a remarkable performance as the Bantams beat Chelsea 4-2 at Stamford Bridge . The 26-year-old Aussie played at the national stadium three times with York City – twice in the FA Trophy final and once in the Conference Play-off final – as well as Bradford’s 2013 League Two Play-off final win over Northampton Town in 2013. But reaching Wembley in the FA Cup after beating Chelsea and Sunderland in the earlier rounds would top the lot. ‘I’ve been to Wembley six times now and played in four of them and they’re all fantastic occasions, but this would be even more special because it is the FA Cup,’ said Meredith. ‘We don’t get the coverage in Australia like you do over here obviously, but everyone follows the FA Cup. Everyone knows it’s the biggest domestic cup in the world and the great stories that came out of it, my favourite being the Crazy Gang. ‘Now it’s the quarter-finals, people are starting to get excited. I think it’s being shown on Setanta. I know all my family and friends are going to watch it, they’ve worked out a way to stream it. They’re excited about the game and they’ re all getting together to have some food and drinks. Meredith, who has played for seven different English sides since moving from Australia, against Sunderland . ‘One of my best mates flew over for the Chelsea game and it was fantastic because when we scored that fourth goal, somehow I managed to spot him in the away fans and we were cheering really hard at each other. ‘My dad said if we get to the semi-finals, he’ll fly over. It’ll probably just be my dad and my brother or sister. The plane tickets aren’t cheap.’ Meredith left his family home in Australia where he lived with his parents, two younger brothers and sister, to travel to England at the age of 16 and sign as an apprentice at Derby County after being spotted at the club’s academy in Melbourne. After loan spells at Cambridge United and Chesterfield, it didn’t work out at Derby and he went on to have brief spells at Sligo Rovers, Shrewsbury Town and Telford United before joining York. ‘I signed pro at Derby but then I was released,’ Meredith recalled. ‘At that time I really struggled to get a club, like a lot of players do when they have no experience as a professional. The 26-year-old has been to Wembley Stadium six times and played on four of those occasions . Meredith holds off Lukas Podolski during Bradford's win against Arsenal in the 2012 Capital One Cup . ‘I was in the country on my own. At one point I was without a club for six months. I was running in a park in Derby every day on my own like Rocky Balboa. ‘I found it really difficult and I was faced with the decision: do I go back home to Australia or do I really give it a good go and try to make something of myself? ‘I decided to give it a good go and I ended up going all the way down to the Conference North. From there, I’ve had to work as hard as I can to build my career to get to a notable league to do the best I can for myself.’ Meredith is not the only one among a Bradford squad that has exceeded all expectations under manager Phil Parkinson. He added: ‘It’s the whole ethos of the club. It’s what is bred into us by the management staff. They are tough and hard and they want workers. We’re in a working-class city. We have to work hard, do the right thing and look after ourselves properly. That’s what has built this team spirit and enthusiasm. ‘There are no Big-time Charlies at the club, we all work hard for each other.’","Bradford City face Reading in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday .

"A disciplined Blackburn frustrated Liverpool as the Championship side held their Premier League opponents to a scoreless draw and forced an FA Cup quarter-final replay. Gary Bowyer's side kept the Reds plethora of superstars at bay and will host them again at Ewood Road, with his towering striker Rudy Gestede proving tough to contain for Brendan Rodgers' men, especially after the departure on a stretcher by Martin Skrtel following an ugly fall early on. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates every player's performance at Anfield. Blackburn Rovers' Rudy Gestede proved a handful for Liverpool's defence in their FA Cup draw . LIVERPOOL (3-4-2-1) SIMON MIGNOLET - 6.5 . Looked shaky under his first high ball, but settled and produced a fantastic save to keep out a goal-bound header from Baptiste. Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet makes a reflex save after Blackburn's Alex John-Baptiste heads on target . GLEN JOHNSON - 6 . Almost turned a cross into his own goal in the first half but got forward well as Liverpool seized the upper hand. MARTIN SKRTEL - 6 . Knocked out inside two minutes after falling awkwardly when challenging Gestede and carried off on a stretcher. Martin Skrtel gives fans a double thumbs up as he left the pitch on a stretcher after a nasty fall . DEJAN LOVREN - 6 . Had his hands full with Gestede after Skrtel’s exit and struggled with the big Blackburn striker at times. Reds defender Kolo Toure hits this close-range chance into the back of the net but was judged offside . LAZAR MARKOVIC - 6.5 . Lively down the Liverpool right but faded and replaced by Balotelli just before the hour mark. JORDAN HENDERSON - 6.5 . Another reassured display from the Liverpool skipper. Unlucky not to break the deadlock with a late effort. Lazar Markovic (centre) was lively for the Reds down the right side but was replaced by Mario Balotelli . EMRE CAN - 6 . Played in midfield again and looked solid enough without producing anything spectacular. RAHEEM STERLING - 5.5 . Didn’t make as much of an impression as he can and struggled to get into the game. Headed late chance wide. Raheem Sterling turns inside Rovers' Adam Henley during their FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday . PHILIPPE COUTINHO - 5.5 . The little Brazilian has scored some memorable goals recently but didn’t have his shooting boots on, twice firing well off target . ADAM LALLANA - 5 . Guilty of poor distribution in the first half and did not have a big enough impact on the game for a player of his calibre. Adam Lallana appeals for a penalty but he was legally dispossed by Blackburn's Matthew Kilgallon . DANIEL STURRIDGE - 6.5 . Became more of a threat as the game wore on, and had one great effort on goal end of first half, but will be disappointed not to trouble Blackburn more. Subs: Ward, Toure (for Skrtel 11, 6) Lambert, Moreno, Sakho, Balotelli (for Markovic 59, 6), Williams. Booked: Can . Manager: Brendan Rodgers – 5 . Brendan Rodgers (right) issues directions to Raheem Sterling during the frustrating draw . BLACKBURN (4-2-3-1) SIMON EASTWOOD - 7 . Had less to do than he might have expected early on but produced great reflex saves to deny Sturridge and Henderson. ADAM HENLEY - 6.5 . Battled well throughout but fortunate to avoid a booking for a late challenge on Can. Adam Henley gets tight on Sterling during a committed performance from the battling Blackburn defender . MATTHEW KILGALLON - 7.5 . Made some great challenges, including one interception on Lallana in the first half, but rode his luck by holding back Sturridge in the box. ALEX BAPTISTE - 7 . Declared fit after hamstring problem and so nearly emerged as Blackburn’s hero but his header was saved by Mignolet. Defender Alex Baptiste (right) makes a lunging tackle on Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge . Baptiste heads Blackburn's best chance of the match only for it to be denied by Mignolet . MARTIN OLSSON - 6.5 . Kept on his toes by Markovic but coped well on the whole to make sure Liverpool were limited to hopeful balls into the box. LEE WILLIAMSON - 7.5 . Worked tirelessly in front of his defence to ensure that Liverpool did not have the time and space to pick off their Championship opponents. Lee Williamson (right) worked tirelessly against the Reds' star-studded attack, including Philippe Coutinho . CORRY EVANS - 6.5 . Hasn’t been the best weekend for the Evans family, but he’ll be more than satisfied with a solid performance here . CRAIG CONWAY - 6 . Had Blackburn’s best chance of the first half but blazed high and wide with only Mignolet to beat from just inside the box. TOM CAIRNEY - 6.5 . Impressed in a central role behind Gestede, particularly in the first half when Blackburn were more not pinned back in their own half. Booked for high challenge on Balotelli. Blackburn's Tom Cairney (right) impressed for his side in behind Gestede . BEN MARSHALL - 6 . Replaced by Taylor midway through the second half after putting in a decent shift on the left side of Blackburn’s midfield . RUDY GESTEDE - 8 . Posed a real problem for the Liverpool defence from the moment Skrtel was injured. Won almost every high ball and provided a vital outlet for his team. Blackburn's Rudy Gestede endures close attention from Emre Can as the Rovers held the Reds to 0-0 . Subs: Spurr, Brown, Rhodes, Taylor (for Marshall 68, 6), Henry, Lenihan, Steele. Booked: Cairney .

"Phil Parkinson may have snubbed Jose Mourinho’s offer of a handshake before the final whistle sounded on Bradford City’s shock FA Cup win over Chelsea, but the 47-year-old will gladly borrow some of The Special One’s tricks as he tries to guide the League One club to Wembley again. Parkinson faces Reading – where he spent 11 years as a player – at Valley Parade on Saturday knowing that another upset would see Bradford return to the national stadium in the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time in more than a century. Remarkably, he has already taken Bradford there twice in the Capital One Cup final and League Two Playoff final in 2013. Bradford boss Phil Parksinon (centre left) rebuffed Jose Mourinho's (right) handshake during their FA Cup tie . Parkinson did not want to be distracted by Mourinho’s premature offer of congratulations when Bradford came from behind to record a stunning 4-2 win at Stamford Bridge in January, before going on to take another Premier League scalp in Sunderland in the fifth round. But the Bradford manager cannot help but admire the Chelsea manager’s win-at-all-costs mentality compared with some managers (look away Louis van Gaal) who are obsessed with imposing their ‘philosophy’ on a club. ‘I like the fact that he will do whatever it takes to win,’ said Parkinson. ‘We are in an era of managers who sometimes their own philosophy gets in the way of what’s the most important thing to win each individual game. Phil Parkinson believes the big teams in the Premier League are jealous of Bradford . Chelsea were beaten 4-2 by League One outfit Bradford during the fourth round back in January . ‘Mourinho sets up his team to win. The Capital One Cup final (against Tottenham) was a good example of that. ‘For me, that’s what management is about. Not just saying “we’ve got good players, go and play”. It’s about what tweaks and adaptations are we going to make today to give us the best chance of winning? That’s why I like looking at what Mourinho does because he has great skill at that.’ It’s one reason why Parkinson is happy to let talk of the poor playing surface at Valley Parade carry on ahead of Reading’s visit. He believes that it got into the heads of Sunderland’s players in the last round and contributed to Bradford’s 2-0 win. ‘I think more was made of the pitch for the Sunderland game,’ he added. ‘By the time their lads came to the game it was probably a bigger thing than it actually it was. We’d had a dry week and it wasn’t too bad. ‘If you look around, a lot of pitches are not in a great state at the moment and we’ve got some good technical players. ‘We’ve found that rather than saying “God, I just need big strong physical players on the pitch”, you need technical players that can handle the bad pitch and we’ve tried to get our best technical team out there.’ Filipe Morais, pictured after scoring against Chelsea, faces a late fitness test on a knee injury . Mourinho isn’t the only Premier League boss that Parkinson admires. The ambitious Bradford boss has also modelled his managerial style on Sir Alex Ferguson and was able to study Arsene Wenger’s situation while scouting for Arsenal in 2011 following his departure from Charlton. ‘Obviously I’m ambitious like every player in the squad and every member of staff,’ said Parkinson. ‘You’ve got to want to be right at the top of your game, and I’m no different. ‘There are many managers I look at. The Arsenal experience was great for me because I’d just left Charlton and they gave me the opportunity to work within their scouting network. ‘The longer that went on, the more senior Premiership targets they sent me to watch. It’s a great insight into how a club like Arsenal have to operate because obviously they can’t compete with Manchester City and Chelsea so they had to look at the level underneath or the players that weren’t obvious to everybody else. ‘I really enjoyed that and learned a lot from it. I got offered a couple of jobs within that period but I wanted to see that short-term through with the Arsenal experience. ‘In terms of managers, Sir Alex Ferguson is an obvious one. His leadership qualities but also the way he evolved as a manager. ‘Myself and (assistant) Steve Parkin, the rest of the staff, try to have a modern approach with the way we do everything but with an old school mentality of discipline, honesty and commitment. We expect those old school demands from the players. ‘With Sir Alex and Manchester United, you look at the discipline and the way the players drove on to the end in every game, and the pride they had in wearing the shirt, but also how he evolved all the time in progressing the club. I think he’s a great one to look at.’ So having won the playoff final with Bradford in 2013 just three months after losing the Capital One Cup final 5-0 to Swansea, what are Parkinson’s priorities this time around as he tries to take the West Yorkshire club to the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 2011? He said: ‘It’s difficult because when we had the Capital One Cup final, all the way I was saying “the league is more important”. But when we got to the semi-final we were on the point of making history. ‘I want to do both but at this stage, when you’re so close to being in an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley, this has got to take priority at the moment.’","Parkinson snubbed Mourinho's offer of a handshake before final whistle .

"Arsene Wenger was accused of disrespecting his former club Monaco as Arsenal produced yet another familiar evening of agonising failure in the last 16 of the Champions League. Despite winning 2-0 in Monaco and producing an exhilarating finale as they pushed for the elusive third goal they needed, Wenger's team ultimately ended up out of the competition at this stage of the Champions League for the fifth successive year. And to add to their woes Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim accused Wenger and Arsenal of disrespecting him and his club after not congratulating Monaco following their 3-1 victory in the first-leg at the Emirates.

Arsenal manager Wenger complains to the officials as his side crashed out of the Champions League . The Portuguese manager left without shaking Wenger's hand after his side's progressed to the quarter-finals and said: 'It's true in first leg when I wanted to shake a hand, Wenger didn't thank me and shake my hand. So this time even though Monaco did everything for Arsenal, I decided not to thank him. Asked whether Wenger was disrespectful, Jardim said: 'I think so and right now we're celebrating and we think that Arsenal maybe didn't show all the respect that they should have in the first leg. 'Arsenal were very happy to play Monaco as we were supposed to be one of the weakest teams. All the teams in the last 16 wanted to play against Monaco. Maybe Arsenal thought they had qualified already.' The row completed a bitterly disappointing night for Arsenal which ended in the usual glorious defeat over the two legs with Wenger admitting that his team had paid the price for a calamitous first-leg performance.

Olivier Giroud's 36th minute goal and Aaron Ramsey's strike in 79th minute gave Arsenal hope in a night on which they attacked throughout and did their utmost – but ultimately the damage had been done three weeks ago. The Arsenal manager said: 'Football is not a fairytale. It's just a matter of being realistic and clinical and Monaco were clinical in front of goal and maybe a bit lucky as well. The performance was enough today but of course we had difficult task I believe as well it could have been over at half time with the chances we had. 'Overall we paid for fact that we didn't produce game we wanted in the first leg. They surprised as first leg too sure of ourselves. But Monaco played at home tonight and had zero shots on target. We knew before game we had a 98 per chance to go out. We did fight but I felt some players were jaded offensively as given a lot of Saturday and lacked bit of freshness.' The anguish of their repeated failures at this stage of competition was expressed by defender Laurent Koscielny, who said: 'We say same thing every year. Our first game is catastrophic. We have to put it right and play well in two games.' Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim reacts on the pitch at the end of their Champions League win on aggregate . It proved a good night for Monaco president Dmitry Rybolovlev (right) and his daughter Ekaterina (left) Wenger's team have now gone out in the last 16 for five years running with their exit often accompanied by lamentable first legs and spectacular yet fruitless comebacks. Ultimately Monaco will be filed alongside the 3-0 home win against AC Milan in 2012 and the 2-0 win at Bayern Munich in 2013 as yet another brave failure. Wenger said: 'It's difficult to compare to the previous years because before we played against Bayern and Barcelona. We're very disappointed to be out tonight but overall we're on positive trend and this game on line with what we did recently. Ramsey said: 'We came here and have nearly done it but that seems to be the case every year.'","Arsenal won 2-0 against Monaco but went out 3-3 on aggregate .

"It's a good job political scion and TV reality star Bristol Palin enjoys being in the spotlight. Video uploaded to the 24-year-old's Instagram account shows how her Medal of Honor winning boyfriend Dakota Meyer took a very public approach to their wedding engagement last Friday night. The clip shows Rascal Flatts lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicating a song to the couple in front of hundreds of spectators at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas before Meyer pops the big question backstage. Show-stopper: Video uploaded to Bristol Palin's Instagram account shows how her Medal of Honor winning boyfriend Dakota Meyer took a very public approach to their wedding engagement last Friday night - popping the big question at a Las Vegas concert . Luckily, Palin said 'yes' and LeRox tells fans, when he gets the go-ahead, the happy news. 'Hey Vegas, she said yes!' he exclaims, triggering rapturous cheers. The following day Palin uploaded a shot of her passionately kissing 26-year-old Meyer to her Instagram account, captioned: 'Truly the luckiest girl in the world, cannot wait to marry this man!' The mother-of-one then uploaded a picture of her engagement ring and wrote a piece on her Patheos blog. 'He’s so romantic!' she said of her husband-to-be. She continued: 'He asked me to marry him at a Rascal Flatts concert. The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated “Bless the Broken Road” to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed! 'It’s amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God’s hands. He really is good and His plans are so much greater than our own.' Romantic: Bristol Palin, the 24-year-old daughter of the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin shared the news of her engagement to Dakota Meyer on her Intsagram page on Saturday . Happy: She then uploaded a picture of the engagement ring followed by a string of heart symbols . Palin and Meyer met on the set of Sarah Palin's Amazing America TV show. They have apparently been dating for less than a year but clearly felt it was the right time to take their relationship to the next stage. Kentucky native Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, also shared his excitement on social media over their upcoming nuptials, saying: 'I'm definitely the luckiest guy ever to be able to spend the rest of my life with [Bristol].' The couple only recently started positing pictures together. Last week Palin uploaded an image of the pair playing in the snow with her six-year-old son, who she had with former fiancé Levi Johnson when she was just 17. Since her mother's failed bid to become vice president in 2008, Bristol has appeared on Dancing with the Stars and featured in her own Lifetime show about raising her son, titled Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp. She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far. Excitement: Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, also shared his excitement on social media, saying: 'I'm definitely the luckiest guy ever to be able to spend the rest of my life with [Bristol]' Reaction: Sarah Palin congratulated the pair on Twitter after their announcement . Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four of his missing Marines. He was able to rescue 36 troops and kill eight Taliban attackers despite being shot in the arms. Tragically he was not able to save his four fellow Marines and friends who he went in search of, but went back and carried each of their bodies to safety. He caused a stir in December for taunting ISIS members on Twitter on Facebook - calling them cowards. He also wrote: 'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club.' Bristol broke up with ex-partner Johnson in 2009 and started an intense custody battle. However, in the midst of the battle, they also briefly reunited and got engaged again. The engagement was short lived when they broke up for a second time in the summer of 2010. Johnston has been married to Sunny since October 2012 and have two children together. Family: A picture of Meyer with his arm around his future mother-in-law Sarah Palin was also uploaded . Esteemed: Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor bny Barack Obama in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four of his missing comrades .

"The FA are set to decide Jonny Evans’s fate today after the Manchester United defender denied allegations of spitting at Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse. A disciplinary hearing was hastily set up last night after Evans confirmed his intention to fight the charge which will carry a six-game ban if he is found guilty. The FA wanted to make sure the matter was dealt with swiftly before the Northern Ireland international played in United’s FA Cup quarter-final clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford on Monday night. Jonny Evans has decided to contest the FA charge of spitting on Newcastle forward Papiss Cisse . Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates . Evans and Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Arsenal (h), Monday; Tottenham (h), March 15; Liverpool (a), March 22; Aston Villa (h), April 4; Manchester City (h) April 12; Chelsea (a) April 18. They tweeted confirmation of Evans’s decision on Friday, just over an hour after the 6pm deadline he had been given to respond to the charge. It read: ‘Manchester United’s Jonny Evans denies FA charge in relation to incident involving Papiss Cisse. Independent Regulatory Commission hearing tonight, decision expected tomorrow.’ It is understood that United will submit video evidence to support Evans’s claim that he did not spit directly at Cisse. Both players were charged over the unsavoury incident in United’s 1-0 win at St James’ Park on Wednesday night. Cisse issued a public apology and accepted his guilt, triggering an immediate seven-match ban. The Senegal striker’s suspension is one game longer because he had already served a three-match ban earlier this season. Evans was expected to contest the charge after issuing a statement on Thursday denying any knowledge of a spitting incident, which followed a tackle between the two players in the first half. He said: ‘Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night’s match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. ‘I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. Cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the FA on Thursday . Tempers threaten to boil over as team-mates from Newcastle and United gather on the pitch . Cisse was banned for an extra game after being sent off for elbowing  Seamus Coleman in December . ‘During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. ‘It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.’ United boss Louis van Gaal also defended his player, insisting that he believed Evans’s version of events. Spitting is understandably reviled among the majority of Premier League players, but Stoke striker Jonathan Walters mounted a surprisingly robust objection on Friday by threatening to leave any opponent who targeted him in such a manner ‘eating through a straw’. The FA are unlikely to take any action against Walters but will not welcome any talk of physical violence on the pitch. Walters told talkSPORT: ‘As a player you take anything off the ball; pinches and kicks that are meant to wind you up. Little things like that go on in any match. ‘But spitting is pretty low. If it happened to me and someone spat at my face or towards me then I think he’d be eating his supper through a straw that night. I wouldn’t be that happy. It’s the lowest of the low.’","Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse involved in spitting row on Wednesday .

"Heather Watson's run in the Californian desert ended  when she became distracted by a supposed injury to her opponent Carla Suarez Navarro. The British No 1 went down 7-6, 3-6, 6-1 to the experienced Spaniard in the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. Watson looked in command in the first set when the world No 13 turned an ankle and called on the trainer for extensive treatment. Heather Watson was knocked out at Indian Wells after losing to experienced Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro . Suarez Navarro was troubled with an ankle injury throughout and it appeared to affect the British No 1 . Yet, as is so often the case in tennis, the unaffected player seemed to be put off by what was going on with her opponent. From 5-3 up she lost the next three games and then went down in the tiebreak as the Spaniard recovered quickly from whatever discomfort she was suffering. After getting level the decider turned when Watson lost the fourth game from 40-0 up and she became disheartened after that as the heat took its toll. However the points garnered from this week and an attacking form of tennis will embed Watson in the top 50 and put her close to the 40 mark.

"As enthusiasts patiently explain, motor racing is a team sport. We think it’s all about the best driver, true aficionados see beyond to unsung heroes in overalls glimpsed during pit stops and others who sit at drawing boards and laptop computers. The most committed Formula One fans are never outraged by team orders and regard the constructors’ championship as equally compelling. So why the fuss about Mercedes? If the rules state that a designer must be limited or regulated if he gets too good, what is the point in having a constructors’ championship at all? Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton celebrates his win at the season-opening race in Melbourne, Australia . Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg were in a class of their own as they dominated the race . Hamilton, the reigning world champion, is the overwhelming favourite to defend his Formula One crown . Give everyone the same car, forget teams and make F1 about drivers only. The problem is, who would then pay for all that expensive equipment to be ferried around the world? One can hardly imagine Lewis Hamilton trundling his wheels off a ferry at Cherbourg before making his way down to the Monte Carlo Grand Prix via the toll roads. Yes, we may be in for a boring F1 season but not for the reason many imagine: the dominance of Mercedes. This is shaping up as a dull one because the narrative is now set at one team being too good and Hamilton being the best only because he has the fastest car. Critics then seek to devalue his achievements. Yawn. Naturally, the man with the fastest machine often wins — but not always. In the past 30 years, there have been four occasions when the top driver wasn’t in the top car and Hamilton is the only one to achieve that feat this century. Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo finished sixth at the first race of the season, one lap down on Hamilton . Christian Horner oversaw Red Bulls dominance from 2010-2013 as they won four consecutive championships . Helmut Marko, motorsport advisor of Red Bull, has speculated that his team could pull out of Formula One . VIDEO Red Bull threaten exit over 'boring' rules . In 2008, Hamilton won the drivers’ championship in a McLaren but Ferrari took the constructors’ title. Before that, Mika Hakkinen (1999), Michael Schumacher (1994) and Alain Prost (1986) also pulled it off. So when Hamilton said if everyone had the same car he would still be champion, he is probably right. F1 isn’t like that, though. It’s a team game, and Mercedes deserve their glory, too. Helmut Marko, motorsport advisor of Red Bull, has speculated that his team could pull out if Mercedes are allowed to dominate and some are troubled by that threat — but what if Mercedes walked instead? What if, instead of losing the also-rans, the team with the best driver and the best car grew sick of the artificial manipulation, and withdrew? Red Bull dominated for four years and each season changes were made to try to rein them in, but after one race? That is a pathetic attitude. ‘Just get your head down, work hard and try to sort it out,’ was the advice from Mercedes chief Toto Wolff and he is right. If this season is about Hamilton versus his team-mate Nico Rosberg, tough. Last year, F1 risked a lottery by awarding random double points for the final Grand Prix. This is worse — a sport that seeks to put the brakes on excellence for the sake of mediocrity is not much of a sport at all.","Lewis Hamilton won in Australia ahead of team-mate Nico Robserg .

"The way is now clear for Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore to be promoted to executive chairman following the removal of one potential source of embarrassment. His former temporary personal assistant Rani Abraham made a claim last June of sex discrimination and harassment after she caused a furore by leaking a sexist email exchange between Scudamore and TV rights lawyer Nick West. But Abraham, 41, now wants to move on, according to a friend, and a planned employment tribunal case will not go ahead. Scudamore is expected to have his elevation rubber-stamped at the Premier League summit a week on Thursday, especially as the clubs are flush with the proceeds of the £5billion domestic TV rights deal orchestrated by Scudamore and have more billions to come from the overseas market. The appointment of an executive chairman will need a statute change and to ensure there is some counterbalance to Scudamore getting everything his own way, it’s likely the Premier League will also appoint two new independent directors.

The UCI are putting on a trial involving British Under 23 riders at their Aigle HQ in Switzerland on Friday, when they will experiment with sprints and other races. Data from sports scientists show men are 10 to 15 per cent stronger and fitter than women cyclists. Thomas Bach has promoted the idea of men and women competing together in future Olympics . World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper feels no need to apologise for his pro-England tweet that upset sensitive fans of pool rivals Wales. After seeing Eoin Morgan’s cricketers fail to get out of their World Cup group, the 55-year-old Aussie posted: ‘England fail to exit pool in World Cup... Not the words we want to hear during #RWC2015.’ Speaking at the Sport Industry Breakfast on Tuesday, Gosper said every event organiser wants the host nation to do well, but is confident of England hosting the most successful ever global rugby tournament whatever the fate of Stuart Lancaster’s team. World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper sparked controversy for his comments about England qualifying . Drawing pools for the Rugby World Cup three years before the kick-off led to the farce of Wales, who had briefly slipped out of the world’s top eight, being in the same group as England and Australia when the three are currently ranked fourth, fifth and sixth. That is going to change for Japan 2019, with the draw moving back by at least a year. World Rugby chief Brett Gosper would also like bidding contracts for the 2023 World Cup to forbid the online secondary sale of tickets. ITV get a 2015 drive on . Land Rover, whose serious upset over the way England rugby players behaved on an infamous sponsors day during the 2011 World Cup resulted in them not renewing their RFU official vehicle sponsorship, are nevertheless still sufficiently engaged with the sport to be backing ITV’s coverage of this year’s tournament. Seven players involved in driving Land Rovers that day are either still in or on the fringes of Stuart Lancaster’s squad. One player wrote in the leaked RFU World Cup report: ‘It was four hours of being stuck in a car driving slowly to satisfy following TV cameras — there were even TV cameras filming from helicopters. There was no fishing, no surfing, no BBQ and more importantly no R and R.’ Another player added: ‘We were told we weren’t allowed to do any commercial stuff during the World Cup but here they (Land Rover) were exploiting us on our day off to promote their brand.’ Land Rover will be sponsoring ITV's coverage of the 2015 Rugby World Cup later this year . Land Rover did not renew their deal with the RFU in the wake of England's 2011 World Cup campaign . The speedy turnover in the international cricket calendar that sees England’s Test squad named on Wednesday after Tuesday’s debrief of the World Cup shambles is very fortunate for head coach Peter Moores and managing director Paul Downton. It allows them to move quickly on to the West Indies tour when a more lengthy analysis of England’s dismal failure to get out of their group at the World Cup after six months of uninterrupted one-day cricket would surely have resulted in both men being axed.

"Have you ever been so excited by scoring a goal that you felt the need to celebrate by aggressively pulling a goat by its horns? No, me neither, but Cologne's Nigerian forward Anthony Ujah certainly as the 24-year-old celebrated scoring his side's fourth goal against Frankfurt by doing exactly that. The goat involved was Cologne mascot Hennes VIII who was quietly minding his own business on the sidelines while watching the game with his handlers.

"Adam Johnson could feature for new boss Dick Advocaat in Sunderland's fight for survival after the club confirmed it will 'review its position' regarding his suspension. Sunderland banned Johnson, 27, pending the outcome of a police investigation after he was arrested on March 2 on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. On Tuesday Johnson's bail was extended by five weeks until April 23. The club said in a statement: 'Following the decision by the police, the club will be reviewing its position.' Adam Johnson, pictured with girlfriend Stacey Flounders, has had his bail extended until April 23 . The 27-year-old winger could feature for new manager Dick Advocaat in Sunderland's fight for survival . The gates at Johnson's £1.85million mansion were shut following his arrest earlier this month . Johnson  has been training with a fitness coach and if the club decide to lift his suspension the £10million winger could play his first match at home in the Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle on Easter Sunday. Johnson scored the only goal at St James' Park in the reverse fixture in December and it would prove a hostile environment in which to return. Before that, Sunderland travel to West Ham on Saturday with Advocaat in charge for the first time. Sportsmail understands that regardless of whether Advocaat keeps them in the Premier League, he will return to Holland in May. There is a feeling in his homeland that his wife, Dieuwke, has allowed the 67-year-old to fulfil his ambition of managing in England before he retires. Former Manchester City player Johnson has been suspended by Sunderland since his arrest . Johnson played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . Johnson, pictured playing against Switzerland in 2011, has 12 England caps to his name . Sunderland owner Ellis Short said: 'Dick has an incredible c.v. and vast experience of managing at the very highest level. We have one aim only now — to climb the table.' Advocaat said: 'Sunderland is a big club and I am very much looking forward to the challenge. I can't wait to get started.' But Sunderland do not see the former Rangers and Holland chief as a long-term option. It is understood sporting director Lee Congerton will speak to Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement — with whom he worked at Chelsea — about a summer appointment. At 42 and with a reputation as one of Europe's finest coaches, Clement is the sort of head coach the club want to bring stability and long-term vision. Peter Lovenkrands, who was signed by Advocaat during his time at Ibrox, told Sportsmail he is among the best managers he has worked under. Dick Advocaat, pictured here in charge of PSV Eindhoven in 2012, has taken over at Sunderland . Gus Poyet was sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the Premier League relegation zone . Sunderland supporters turned on manager Poyet after their side were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa at home . 'He was excellent at what he did,' said the Dane, who went on to play for Newcastle. 'When I first signed I had a lot of problems with injuries and I remember my hamstring going for about the fourth time. I was sat on the bench nearly in tears. He came across, put his arm around me and told me everything would be OK. It was a nice touch and he had that in him. 'A lot of people thought he was a dictator, and he could be quite intimidating, but deep down I thought he was a decent and nice man. 'He had a good sense of humour and the lads loved him. He used to swear all the time in training but we didn't have a clue and it was only the Dutch players who told us — we soon picked up the translation!'

"Fernando Torres has likened his struggles during his time at Chelsea as to 'swimming with wet clothes on'. The striker had a torrid time at Stamford Bridge following his £50million move from Liverpool, scoring just 20 Premier League goals over three-and-a-half years before being sent out on loan to AC Milan last summer. Torres failed to impress at the San Siro and, after the Italian club bought him outright, they loaned him to Atletico Madrid where he is yet to score in nine La Liga appearances, though he has scored three in four Copa del Rey matches. Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres has opened up about his difficult time playing for Chelsea . Torres joined Chelsea for £50m from Liverpool, but failed to make an impact for the London club . He struggled for form and managed just 20 Premier League goals over three-and-a-half-years . The Spain international told El Pais: 'The worst part of not playing is when you think you're prepared and ready to do it. I tried to get minutes at Chelsea and seize opportunities, but things do not always go the best way, and can drag on for weeks or even years.' Torres added: 'It was like swimming with wet clothes on. Now I know how I am, and I'm fine. At the end those doubts about your quality eventually disappear.' Atletico, who reached the last eight of the Champions League after beating Bayer Leverkusen on penalties, are currently fourth in La Liga with 56 points from 27 games, nine behind the pace of table-toppers Barcelona.

"Manchester City had long since been knocked out of the Champions League by the time the decision was taken to sack Roberto Mancini in the spring of 2013. European football was not the Italian’s speciality. However, as Manuel Pellegrini looks for a result to save his team’s season, other similarities between the reign of City’s current coach and the final, faltering weeks of his predecessor’s are strikingly relevant. Certainly the two men are different. Pellegrini is placid, Mancini explosive. Pellegrini is considered by some at City to be rather too nice while Mancini made enemies at every level. But, although Pellegrini may beg to differ, the warnings for the Chilean are to be found using football’s most fundamental barometer: results. Manuel Pellegrini is fighting to save his Manchester City job and needs a good result in Barcelona . Manchester City are looking to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit in the Nou Camp . Mancini’s final year at City saw a Barclays Premier League title win, a summer of faltering efforts in the transfer market and a subsequent championship defence in which his team’s levels dropped to the extent that they ended the 2012-13 season some way short of a rival — Manchester United — who did not have to be imperious to beat them into second. Sound familiar? Two years on and again City have failed to build on success. They have bought modestly, played well only sporadically and look destined to trail another less-than-convincing rival — this time it’s Chelsea — by some distance by the time they reach the finishing post. Did United win the title two years ago or did City simply fail to defend it properly? Perhaps a bit of both. Can we say the same again this time round? Almost certainly. Talk to people at City and they will stress that Mancini was not sacked because he failed to win a second league title. He was dismissed because City had failed to move forwards in Europe and because his style of management was, they feared, about to rip holes in the fabric of the club. Nevertheless, the similarities between what should have been Mancini’s consolidation season and this one are clear and that is why Pellegrini has every reason to feel anxious ahead of a mammoth task at the Nou Camp. On Tuesday at City’s hotel by the port, Pellegrini was in denial mode once again. ‘I don’t think my seat is in danger,’ he said. Manchester City's Premier League title challenge suffered a further blow with defeat at Burnley . Pellegrini finds himself in a similar position to Roberto Mancini before the Italian was sacked . Mancini left City after a failed Premier League title defence and another dismal season in Europe . Nevertheless, in the first leg of this tie at the Etihad Stadium three weeks ago we saw far too much of what is wrong with the modern City and not enough of what is right. Haphazard at the back, weak in midfield and mentally suspect by their own admission, Pellegrini’s team were overrun for 45 minutes. Only their own spirit, the excellence of Sergio Aguero and a rare moment of fallibility from Lionel Messi at the death kept City in touch. As such, if they are to overcome a 2-1 deficit they simply must show us something we have not yet seen from them at this level, under either manager. Those who point to wins at home against Bayern Munich and away at Roma as evidence that City are learning are clutching desperately at straws. VIDEO Pellegrini doesn't fear for City job . Yaya Toure and Pellegrini speak from their hotel in Barcelona on the eve of the second leg . Toure knows his team must improve if they are to stand any chance of progressing to the quarter-finals . Joe Hart's penalty save from Lionel Messi at the end of the first leg has given City a glimmer of hope . City were on the ropes for much of both games. Certainly they controlled neither and were aided by some good fortune. On Wednesday it must be different, something the returning Yaya Toure seemed to agree with when he spoke on Tuesday. ‘Last year everybody said we were a top team in Europe,’ said the Ivorian. ‘Now we have lost a couple of games and everybody says we are the worst. We can deal with that. The players know what they have to do.’ During their own media gathering earlier in the day, Barcelona coach Luis Enrique and midfielder Andres Iniesta spoke diplomatically. City remain a feared opponent, was the message. The truth, however, is that City have not remotely troubled the Catalan club in successive Champions League meetings, and given that Barcelona have won 16 of their last 17 games and are yet to be shut out in Europe this season, the size of the English club’s task is clear. Barcelona train at their Joan Gamper base on the eve of the second leg against Manchester City . Luis Suarez scored both Barcelona goals in the first leg at the Etihad Stadium . There was one item of good news for City on Tuesday when Enrique confirmed that his central midfield totem, Sergio Busquets, will not play. The great Spaniard is injured and that may offer the likes of Toure and David Silva some hope as they look to attack Barcelona’s back four. Nevertheless, Pellegrini must hope for a considerable improvement. City simply must find it from somewhere. There is absolutely no desire at City to sack Pellegrini. What would that say about the judgment of those who hired him? Like every manager, however, he will live or die by his results. Currently his win ratio at City is 62 per cent. Mancini’s was 59 per cent. This is game number 99 of Pellegrini’s reign. By the time he reaches his century at home to West Bromwich on Saturday, he will hope to have something significant to reflect upon.","Manchester City face Barcelona at Nou Camp in second leg of last 16 tie .

"Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong seemed to be struggling with his maths on Tuesday night. The 23-year-old asked on Twitter: ‘If Arsenal win 2-0 they go through?’ No, afraid not, Emmanuel. Arsenal officially had 1,200 fans in the Stade Louis II — but an estimated 5,000 were in the 18,000 crowd with Monaco having put the tickets on general sale. Despite their renaissance, the Principality, with a population of 38,000, unsurprisingly struggles to fill the stadium, even on big European nights. Five thousand Arsenal supporters packed in to the Stade Louis II for their tie against Monaco on Tuesday . It perhaps should come as no surprise that a tax haven inhabited by the super rich should lack passion — but it was difficult to avoid the comparison with the ferocious atmosphere of Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon Stadium, the other venue hosting a Champions League fixture on Tuesday night. Monaco’s Stade Louis II stadium had all the intensity of a yacht club soiree. This was Arsene Wenger’s first win as a manager against Monaco. He had previously drawn four and lost three.

"Simon Mignolet summed it up for Liverpool. The goalkeeper, widely derided earlier this season, has been part of a major turnaround in the fortunes of the club, sparked by losing to Manchester United in December. After Liverpool’s 1-0 win at Swansea on Monday, Mignolet hailed the fighting spirit of the side and welcomed the prospect of facing United in the Barclays Premier League at Anfield on Sunday. ‘We know there will be a huge build-up,’ he said. ‘But as professional football players we can’t get carried away. We have a good squad who are willing to fight for each other. We work hard and sometimes it is even more satisfying to get the three points in that way.’ Steven Gerrard and Simon Mignolet celebrate Liverpool's 1-0 win at Swansea on Monday . Mignolet was called upon a number of times in the first half at the Liberty Stadium and was up to the task . Liverpool are unbeaten in 2015 and are aiming for second place in the table after their upturn in form since December. In fact, they have already won as many league games this year (eight) as they did in the first half of the season, despite having played nine games fewer. They have also picked up more Premier League points since Boxing Day (32) than Merseyside rivals Everton have all season (31) and Monday’s win came courtesy of their sixth successive away clean sheet in the league. Their amazing form has seen them cut the gap to second-placed Manchester City from 17 points to four. Brendan Rodgers’ side remain the only unbeaten team in the top four English tiers in 2015. And in their past six matches they have picked up an average of 2.67 points per game, despite facing three of the current top seven teams.

"Sam Allardyce's uneasy relationship with the locals at West Ham United is down to the perception his teams play dull football. It is hard to see how the dour baggage carried by his proposed replacement David Moyes will have them putting out bunting in the East End.

"Former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat on successor Manuel Pellegrini by claiming the Chilean should be winning a trophy every year. Mancini thinks Pellegrini was 'really lucky' to inherit a strong side from him and he should be delivering continual success at the Etihad Stadium. But Pellegrini, who did win two trophies last season, is now under heavy pressure with City faltering in their Barclays Premier League title defence and facing an uphill task against Barcelona in the Champions League. Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure to save Manchester City's season and his job as well . Pellegrini has come under fire for City's faltering title defence and Champions League campaign . Manchester City will look to overturn a 201 first-leg deficit against Barcelona in their Champions League tie . Mancini, who was sacked by City in 2013 despite winning the Premier League title the previous year, told CNN: 'I think Pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players. 'I think City can win a title every year and have a chance - it should and must try to win a title every year.' Mancini's jibe came on the eve of the second leg of City's last-16 Champions League tie at Barcelona, which they will go into trailing 2-1. Roberto Mancini guided Manchester City to the Premier League title in 2012 after FA Cup success in 2011 .

But Mancini said: 'It's my opinion that City is the best team in the Premier League. It's in second and six points behind Chelsea but I think it's the best team.

"At the Etihad Stadium last month, one of the most gifted players of his generation was given the run of the place during Barcelona’s 2-1 victory. It was an exhibition from the very best. Andres Iniesta took 112 touches in Barcelona’s midfield, five more than his celebrated team-mate Lionel Messi and far more than any player in a Manchester City shirt. James Milner, anointed by Manuel Pellegrini as one of his team’s most important players, was the highest with 64. The numbers simply don’t add up, which is one of the reasons English football is struggling to make an impact over two legs in Champions League ties. When will our game learn? Probably never. Andres Iniesta, rested in Barca's  win over Eibar, is expected to return to the starting line-up against City . Barcelona's Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic controls the ball as Xavi and Pedro look on during training . Neymar aims a friendly kick at fellow Barcelona striker Luis Suarez after the Uruguayan had gone down . The Brazil captain was in high spirits as Barcelona prepared for their Champions League last 16 second leg . ‘We play in a comprehensive manner and we want possession so that they suffer,’ admitted Iniesta as he prepares to pull on the red and blue stripes of Barcelona once more. ‘We need to find our superior skills and minimise their potential. We want to control what goes on in every moment. We have to beat Manchester City with a complete performance.’ Barcelona are conditioned to play a certain way, all possession-based and keeping the ball in circulation until they can find a way through the gaps in City’s defence. Iniesta is a slave to the game, a man still seeking perfection even after three triumphs in the Champions League, plus two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup, in which he scored the winner for Spain. Barcelona will be hoping to reach the Champions League quarter finals by holding off Manchester Cit . Barca have not failed to reach Europe's last eight since 2007, and saw off  City at the same stage last season . His incredible strike against Chelsea in the 2009 Champions League semi-final, second leg at Stamford Bridge is one of the most dramatic goals in the history of the game. At the age of 30, he wants more. ‘We do not gather as a team to discuss what we can achieve, but the important thing is that we know what the possibilities are,’ he added. ‘There are no guarantees, but we know that we are doing well and we are prepared for this match.’ Luis Enrique’s team are in fine fettle, a point ahead of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga ahead of El Clasico on Sunday and on course for the Champions League quarter-final if they can protect their 2-1 advantage. The Barcelona players move the ball around during a training exercise ahead of the vital showdown with City . Manager Luis Enrique will be hoping his team take another step on the road towards Berlin . The final of the Copa del Rey awaits later in the season, when Iniesta can add to his extensive list of honours when Enrique’s team face Athletic Bilbao. ‘We don’t think beyond Manchester City because we have to concentrate, even if we had a good result in the first leg,’ he said. ‘Right now the team is in good shape, but this is a difficult period of the season. We are in the final of Copa del Rey, the Champions League and all the little details will play a role tomorrow. ‘On Sunday we have an important match against our rivals, but this is the Champions League and Manchester City have great players.’ Iniesta is wary of the threat posed by former Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure . Much will be expected of Yaya Toure, returning from suspension to play against his former team at the Nou Camp as City attempt to overturn a 2-1 deficit. This will be a tough night for a team who cannot keep the ball, but Toure’s goalscoring ability, along with those powerful runs that start from deep-lying positions, could give them a chance. Iniesta added: ‘He is very important for them, he is very powerful physically and he has important qualities because of all his skills. ‘We’ll try to minimise his potential.’","Barcelona train ahead of crucial last 16 second leg at the Nou Camp .

"Malky Mackay signed Troy Deeney for Watford so he knows exactly what the powerhouse striker can do. On Tuesday night, he scored twice against Mackay’s Wigan for the second time this season to send Watford top of the Championship and a step nearer the Premier League. It was the sixth game in a row that Deeney has been on the scoresheet, muscling in to beat Ali Al-Habsi with a header nine minutes into the second half and then converting a penalty in stoppage time. For Wigan and his old manager, however, the threat of relegation to League One looms large two years after the club dropped out of the top-flight. Watford striker Troy Deeney celebrates scoring against Wigan at the DW Stadium on Tuesday night . Watford forward Matej Vydra (left) tussles for the ball with Wigan Athletic's Emmerson Boyce (right) Watford's Marco Motta (top) jumps up to avoid the sliding challenge from Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (bottom) Wigan (4-4-2): Al Habsi 6; Boyce 5, Maguire 6.5, Pearce 5, Bong 5.5; Pennant 5.5 (Murphy 52, 6), Perch 6, Bo-kyung 6.5, Ojo 6 (Kvist 62, 6); Fortune 6 (Sinclair 82), Clarke 5.5. Booked: Perch . Watford (3-1-4-2): Gomes 6; Cathcart 6 (Paredes 71, 6), Ekstrand 6.5, Angella 6; Watson 6.5; Motta 5.5 (Forestieri 46, 7), Munari 6, Hoban 6.5, Guedioura 8; Deeney 7, Vydra 7 (Tozser 73, 6) Subs not used: Layun, Anya, Ighalo, Bond . Booked: Guedioura, Forestieri . Scorers: Deeney 54, 90 . Referee: David Coote . Attendance: 10,684 . They remain six points adrift of safety and fourth-from-bottom Rotherham, who now have a game in hand, after failing to win for the 16th successive home game – a miserable run stretching back seven months. ‘We’ve got eight games to go and we’ve got to win more than a couple of teams us, simple as that,’ said Mackay. ‘We knew that Deeney would pose a real threat. That’s why I bought him (for Watford) in the first place. He’s blossomed and he’s by far and away the best centre-forward in the division in my opinion.’ Despite the poor home form, Wigan had won their last four away games to give themselves a chance of survival and they had several chances to take the lead. Tommy Hoban had to throw his body in the way of Leon Clarke’s goalbound effort, Sheyi Ojo blasted over when unmarked in a good position and Marc-Antoine Fortune had two opportunities. Deeney beats the challenge of Wigan's Gaetan Bong to score his side's opening goal at the DW Stadium . Boyce fells Watford's Fernando Forestieri in the box to give away a penalty on a bad night for the hosts . But the promotion chasers went ahead in the 54th minute with a goal that was the product of classy build-up play and a brutal finish. Substitute Fernando Forestieri’s clever pass gave Adlene Guedioura the opportunity to swing a cross to the far post where Deeney was charging in like an express train. The Watford skipper powered through Jason Pearce to meet the ball and head the ball emphatically past Al Habsi. Guedioura and Matej Vydra both went close with shots after that, and Guedioura thought he had doubled Watford’s lead when his deflected effort beat Al Habsi but Emmerson Boyce hooked the ball away to safety from under his own crossbar. Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi is rooted to the spot as Deeney sends his second goal past him with a penalty . However Deeney made sure of victory in stoppage time, scoring from the penalty spot after Boyce had brought down Forestieri. Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic: ‘Troy’s in a good moment and that’s good news for us. His first goal, the way he attacked the ball and scored, was great. ‘You have to be happy with our situation.

"Arsene Wenger admitted Arsenal paid for their first-leg collapse as they crashed out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage for the fifth successive season. Their 3-1 first-leg defeat by Monaco at the Emirates came back to haunt them as they clinched a 2-0 win last night that sent them out on away goals. Wenger said: ‘Football is not a fairytale. It’s just a matter of being realistic and clinical and Monaco were clinical in front of goal and maybe a bit lucky as well. Arsene Wenger saw his Arsenal side crash out of the Champions League on Tuesday . Monaco celebrated a place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League at the expense of Arsenal . Santi Cazorla reacts to Arsenal's Champions League exit despite a 2-0 win in the second leg in Monaco . ‘The performance was enough today and it could have been over at half time with the chances we had. ‘We knew before the game we had a 98 per chance to go out. We did fight but I felt some players were jaded offsnsively as they gave a lot on Saturday and lacked bit of freshness. ‘Overall we paid for the first game when we didn’t produce the game we wanted. But when Monaco played at home they had zero shots on target.’ Olivier Giroud’s 36th minute goal and Aaron Ramsey’s strike in 79th minute gave Arsenal hope in a night on which they attacked throughout and did their utmost – but ultimately the damage had been done at The Emirates. Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny said: ‘We say the same thing every year. Our first game is catastrophic. We have to put it right... play well in two games’ Olivier Giroud scored Arsenal's first goal at the Stade Louis II to give them hope of a comeback . Aaron Ramsey's 79th-minute strike set up a grandstand finish, but Arsenal couldn't find a vital third goal . Wenger added: ‘It’s difficult to compare to the previous years because before we played against Bayern and Barcelona. We’re very disappointed to be out tonight but overall we’re on positive trend and this game on line with what we did recently . ‘I would separate it from other years in which we have gone out. We’re very disappointed to be out of course bu there were a lot of positives in the games. But overall situation is very disappointing . Captain Per Mertesacker said: ``The best team went through. They deserved it because they played much better in the first leg. We had to come back from a massive deficit. We played well today but it wasn’t enough. ‘You come here and try absolutely everything. You look at the game and we could have scored more than two. We don’t look back to the first game - that was already over - and we tried to do our best today but it wasn’t enough.’","Arsenal eliminated from the Champions League on away goals rule .

"There are few British sportspeople who have legitimate claims to being the best in the world in their field. In golden girls Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Jessica Ennis-Hill we have two who are likely to be battling for top billing over the next two years. British Athletics performance director Neil Black is not guilty of hyperbole when he claims their anticipated duels in the heptathlon, notably at the World Championships in Beijing this summer and the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016 represent a ‘magical time’ for the sport. Johnson-Thompson, 22, has risen to being the world’s number one in the absence of Olympic Champion Ennis-Hill, who took a break to have baby son, Reggie. The pair’s first competitive meeting since 2012, at the Hypo-meeting in Gotzis, Austria at the end of May promises to be one of the most gripping sporting duels of the year. Katarina Johnson-Thompson (far left) and Jessica Ennis-Hill (centre), pictured with Louise Hazel at London 2012, have been praised by British Athletics performance director Neil Black . Johnson-Thompson is expected to battle it out with Ennis-Hill for top billing over the next few years . Ennis-Hill took some time out of athletics following the birth of her baby son, Reggie . Johnson-Thompson’s first major gold medal in the pentathlon at the European Indoor Championships in Prague on Friday, where she missed out on the World Record by just 13 points, was the realisation of an incredible talent. As a teenager she beat Ennis-Hill’s junior records and is now seeing her own being broken by 17-year-old Morgan Lake. ‘I just think its an amazing set of circumstances,’ said Black, ‘I’m sure it’s partly coincidental and partly as a result of all the stimulus dating back many years, the, striving to beat each other and role models and so on. But to think that they are all going to be hopefully in Gotzis and they’re all hopefully going to be at the World Championships in Beijing in August and the Olympics next year, its just a kind of magical time. 'And what comes from it is just going to be spectacular. I can’t see that you can get much more exciting than that in any sport this summer. You have three incredibly capable, high performing, lovely personalities, with great teams around them, brilliant coaches, all vying for medals in competitions.’ Neil Black insists the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio present a ‘magical time’ for the sport . Ennis-Hill and her coach Toni Minichiello have been tight lipped about how her training at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield is going but she has posted pictures of herself on Twitter and she looks to be in supreme shape. ‘All the feedback that we’ve had is that her progression is great,’ said Black, ‘Peter Stanley (British Athletics head of combined events) is regularly there, meeting with Jess, Toni, and the javelin sessions, the biomechanical support, they’re all working together and it’s going well.’ Black also backed sprinter Richard Kilty - who added the European Indoor Championship 60m gold to the World title he won last year - to join the sub-10sec club over 100m. ‘He’s re-established himself as a serious sprinting candidate. Of course he was frustrated not to have cemented that at the same level outdoors and I’m sure that will be his target and that’s what we’re looking for going into the World Championships.’","Neil Black has praised Jessica Ennis-Hill and Katarina Johnson-Thompson .

"After a raucous Davis Cup victory over the USA, Great Britain must now decide which surface will give them the best chance of upsetting the French in the quarter-finals. As the home side, GB can choose the venue for the July 17 clash against last year's runner-up. It is tempting to stick with the indoor hard court in Glasgow where the local fans created a tremendous atmosphere last weekend, but, in this case, the grass is greener. Andy Murray has a good record on hard courts against France's fearsome quartet of Richard Gasquet, Gael Monfils, Gilles Simon and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, winning 18 and losing five. But on grass, he has been totally dominant, unbeaten against all four in six matches. Murray celebrates during his straight sets win over John Isner that clinched the Brits a quarter-final place . The Great Britain team celebrate their 3-2 victory over the USA in Glasgow last weekend . Doubles team Jamie Murray (left) and Dom Inglot have both experienced success on grass courts . Against Gasquet and Tsonga in particular, Murray can draw on the memories of some famous victories on the lawns. In 2011 the 27-year-old beat Tsonga in the final of the Aegon Championships at Queens. He also defeated the world No 13 in the Wimbledon semi-finals on the way to lifting the trophy in 2012. And it was a 2008 last-16 win against Gasquet on centre court that made the nation realise that this wild-haired Scot had something very special. A 21-year-old Murray stormed back from two sets down to win 5-7, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4. There is more good news for the doubles players. Julien Benneteau has reached 17 doubles finals but none have been on grass. Nicolas Mahut has won a tournament on the grass of Newport in 2013, but all of his other seven titles have come on an indoor hard court like Glasgow. Murray beat Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on grass in the 2012 Wimbledon semi-finals . The France team of Edouard Roger-Vasselin, Julien Benneteau, Gael Monfils, Gilles Simon and Nicolas Mahut celebrate after their win against Germany in Frankfurt . Britain's pair of Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot, meanwhile, have thrived on grass.

"Stuart McCall has agreed to make an emotional return to Rangers after answering the call to salvage their promotion campaign. The Nine-in-a-Row legend will take over as manager until the end of the season in a bid to steer the Ibrox club back to the top flight via the Championship play-offs. Caretaker boss Kenny McDowall, who handed in his notice in January, is not expected to play any role in the new first-team coaching set-up. Stuart McCall is a former manager of Motherwell and played for Rangers for seven years . That could open the way for McCall to bring in Kenny Black, his assistant during a successful stint in charge at Motherwell. McDowall admitted after Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Queen of the South that there was now a danger of Rangers missing out on the play-offs altogether if they didn’t find form. They have won just one of their last seven matches, dropping to third place in the table behind Hibs. That dismal sequence convinced Dave King and the new Ibrox board that they had to act, with McCall approached to see if he would be willing to agree a short-term contract. An extended deal contingent upon winning promotion could also be a possibility following a day of discussions. No official confirmation on McCall’s appointment was forthcoming from Rangers on Wednesday night but that is expected to follow on Thursday. McCall achieved back-back top-flight finishes during his time at Fir Park . It is also understood the players were told to report back to Murray Park early on Friday morning – after a day off – in preparation for meeting their new boss. McCall, who won six league titles in seven years as a Rangers midfielder, has been out of work since resigning at Fir Park last November after a slump in form. However, his overall record in Lanarkshire was hugely impressive, including back-to-back second-place finishes and a Scottish Cup final. The 50-year-old is also currently a member of Gordon Strachan’s Scotland backroom staff but admitted last month it may be an ‘impossibility’ to combine that role with managing a club of Rangers’ size. King flew back to South Africa via Heathrow on Wednesday, admitting in an interview en route that ‘the playing side is in need of a huge injection of energy’. He also added that the new regime would do ‘whatever it takes to give the club the best chance of promotion this season’. McCall is the man they have turned to for that purpose, with Saturday’s home game against Livingston set to open his tenure. Gordon Strachan has also used McCall as part of his coaching set-up with the Scotland national team . Dave King seized control of Rangers after a landslide victory at the club's most recent EGM . Speaking last week, Rangers midfielder and ex-Motherwell player Nicky Law welcomed the prospect of a McCall appointment. ‘For me personally, it would be great,’ said Law. ‘Not just for me, but for the club as well. ‘He’s a legend here and he knows about the club and the expectations. There would be no trouble with him there. 'With his character, it’ s something he would relish. It wouldn’t worry him at all. I’m sure he’d get a positive reaction straight away just with his demeanour and the way he is. If he’s lucky enough to get it I’m sure he’ll do a great job.’ Meanwhile, Sandy Easdale has agreed to step down from his position as football board chairman and will make an ‘amicable’ exit from Rangers. The Ibrox club announced on Tuesday that Easdale, Derek Llambias and Barry Leach had been suspended from their duties ‘pending investigation’. Any proceedings relating to the Greenock-based businessman have, however, been dropped.","Rangers have not yet clarified the position of Kenny McDowall .

"Swirling through the air in mesmerising saucer-like shapes, these exceptionally rare lenticular clouds are the most common explanation for UFO sightings. The remarkable-looking disc shapes were spotted by amateur photographer Glenn Spencer, 42, in the sky above Chester in Cheshire. The formations, also known as wave clouds, were scattered over miles, producing a stunning spectacle. Rarely seen in the UK, lenticular clouds are formed when a tall geographic feature, such as the the top of a mountain, obstructs a strong wind. The interruption in airflow creates a wind wave pattern in the atmosphere on one side of the mountain and at the top of these waves, moisture in the air condenses and forms a cloud. As air moves down into the trough of these waves the water evaporates again, leaving behind clouds in a characteristic lenticular shape. Mr Spencer noticed them while driving to the shops and was so amazed that he stopped the car to retrieve his camera from the boot. He said: 'I tried to follow them to higher ground to get a good view. They were just so mesmerising and I thought they looked amazing. It is easy to see why people mistake them for UFOs. They are brilliant. I've never seen anything like it.' Scroll down for video . Rare spectacle: These lenticular clouds, also known as altocumulus standing lenticularis, are hardly ever seen in British skies . Stunning: They form when wind blows over high ground and then undulates down in a stream of waves creating a rippled effect as the air cools . Commonly mistaken for UFOs: The clouds are sometimes reported as UFOs, particularly the flying saucer, because of their lens shape . How they form: They occur when the air meets obstructions such as mountains and the clouds' thickness creates incredible contrasts of light . Mesmerising: Amateur photographer Glenn Spencer, 42, noticed the flying saucer-shaped clouds as he was driving to the shops in Cheshire .

"Thousands of miles from the playground, real lessons of life and death are played out every day in what's left of the wild world. This was one such class in Kenya's Maasai Mara National Park, where a lioness taught her cubs how to hunt and kill a wildebeest to stay alive. Captured by South African photographer Mark Dumbleton, the lioness began by circling her prey before her cubs joined the hunt. The animal fought back - but outnumbered and separated from the herd, it was only a matter of time before it was overpowered. Mr Dumbleton, a wildlife photographer since 2007, said: 'It was amazing to watch a mother training her children for when they have to leave the pride. 'I couldn't believe the animal instinct they had. The lioness was roaring at them, but they knew exactly how to take down such a large animal. 'The whole experience only lasted a couple of minutes.'

Fear: As the rapid-fire sequence unfolds, the wildebeest kicks up dust in its frantic bid to escape . Weakening: The wildebeest then begins to slow, coming face to face with the animal which wants to take its life .

"All-rounder JP Duminy took a hat-trick as South Africa put one foot in the World Cup semi-finals by dismissing Sri Lanka for 133 in their last eight clash at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday. Bidding to win their first ever knockout match at a World Cup, the Proteas bowlers removed both openers inside the first five overs and never eased up the pressure thereafter. Duminy (3-29) dismissed Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews (19) with the final ball of the 33rd over and returned to send back Nuwan Kulasekara (1) and ODI debutant Tharindu Kaushal (0) with the first two deliveries of the 35th. The ninth World Cup hat-trick left the 1996 champions reeling at 116-8 after the loss four wickets for just two runs in three overs and when Kumar Sangakkara was dismissed soon afterwards, the writing was on the wall. Sangakkara, who had been looking for a fifth successive century, scored a measured 45 from 95 balls but was forced to throw off the shackles as the wickets tumbled around him and holed out to deep third man off paceman Morne Morkel. A heavy shower appeared out of the blue as if to mourn what looks like being the final one-day innings of one of the game's great batsmen and the players came off the pitch for a 23-minute rain break. It only delayed the inevitable, however, and Lasith Malinga (3) was the last man to depart, hammering the ball to David Miller at cover off South Africa's other main spin threat Imran Tahir. Tahir took 4-26, including the wicket of Mahela Jayawardene to leave another retiring Sri Lanka batting great with a tally of four runs in his final innings in the 50-over format. Sri Lanka, who won the toss and chose to bat, were never able to score at a pace that would have put pressure on the South Africans and test their mental resolve. While Sangakkara was at the crease, though, they would have fancied their chances of putting on some kind of tally for their bowlers to defend. Once he departed and the rain cleared, however, the semi-final appointment in Auckland against New Zealand or West Indies next week would now seem to be South Africa's to keep.

"The interior walls of training complexes are invariably decorated with motivational slogans. Simple truisms to feed the mind on days when the body is weak. For Craig Gordon, the old wisdom – fail to prepare, then prepare to fail – is more a way of life than a fleeting thought. To the uninitiated, tomorrow’s final will be settled over 90, maybe 120 minutes, with the lingering possibility of penalty kicks. Celtic keeper Craig Gordon is fully focused  ahead of the Scottish League Cup Final with Dundee Utd. But, long before the first ball is kicked in earnest, the Celtic goalkeeper fully expects to be ahead in the battle of wits. While much of what will transpire between Celtic and Dundee United will be random and instinctive, Gordon believes his slavish devotion to studying what’s liable to be thrown at him can significantly shorten the odds on his side coming out on top. ‘Every game,’ he replied when asked how frequently he’d dip into video analysis. ‘Free kicks, penalties, the way strikers like to finish the ball, how they strike the ball. ‘I just look at those things and keep mental notes on how they like to do things and what’s their favourite side. Notes are taken on different players so I know. All of that stuff. Gordon  fails to hold the ball allowing Rodrigo Palacio of Inter Milan to score in the Europa League . ‘It’s about taking that research out on the training pitch, too, and practicing for who you’re going to be playing against - a team that likes to put a lot of low, early crosses into the box, for example. ‘For the Rangers game, it was deep early crosses hung up to the back post so we focused our training around that. That played out during the game too as I was able to come and take the deep crosses that were taking the pressure off. Between all of us we come up with a plan for the game.’ And when that plan comes together in the form of a victory and a clean sheet? Gordon will be hoping to celebrates his first showcase occasion since Hearts earned cup glory in 2006 . ‘Absolutely, it’s satisfying,’ Gordon added. ‘It becomes a team effort with Woodsy (Stevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach) and the video analysis guys to ensure we’re as well prepared as possible. And that’s not just me - John Collins does it with midfielders and defenders, so it’s preparation. ‘What we’re trying to do is make the game as easy as possible for us so we know what we’re coming up against.’ Celtic have not reinvented the wheel with their forensic approach. Nine years ago, Gordon played in the Scottish Cup Final for Hearts against Gretna – his last major final as it would transpire. Few neutral observers fancied the Borderers to go the distance that day but they did just that. Gordon’s intervention in the final chapter was key, however. As Hearts hit four perfect kicks, he saved from Derek Townsley before watching Gavin Skelton sky the eighth and final kick over the top. Celtic goalkeeper Gordon celebrates their goal during the Scottish Premiership match against Aberdeen . ‘I had a fair idea of most of the Gretna penalty takers,’ he recalled. ‘I had seen penalties from them. Most were from memory. With penalties, nowadays everyone does their homework.’ That stop from 12 yards not only allowed Gordon to lift the only major honour of his career to date - it cemented his reputation as one of the finest goalkeepers Scotland has produced. When a £9million move to Sunderland was completed a year later, it seemed he’d spend half his life on the winner’s podium. Little did he realise at the time, how unique those scenes of celebration would prove. A year ago, with the road back from injury seemingly never ending, the chance of another fix of the winning feeling seemed fanciful. ‘I probably didn’t appreciate at the time like I should have done - playing in a cup final, winning a cup,’ he reflected. Celtic keeper Gordon speaks with referee Craig Thomson after the Scottish Cup quarter final . ‘Albeit it’s a different competition this Sunday but it’s still to win a cup, I probably did think it would come around again, that I’d get another chance. ‘I haven’t been close until now so I’m going to enjoy this one a little bit more, but then I’ll only really enjoy it if we win the match. ‘It’s not something I’ll look back on fondly if we don’t. Certainly I want to take it in a little more this time.’ Gordon is beaten by Rangers striker Nacho Novo during Hearts' 3-2 defeat at Ibrox Stadium in Glagow . Hearts’ 2006 Hampden triumph was obviously memorable. Yet lurking just beneath the surface lay a sense of regret. George Burley’s side had started the campaign like a train but being unbeaten and top of the league in October wasn’t enough to shield him from Vladimir Romanov’s axe. John McGlynn took temporary charge before Graham Rix arrived. In time, he was bulleted to make way for Valdas Ivanauskas. Despite the endless turmoil, Hearts still split the Old Firm, with Rangers nudged into third place. There are those in Gorgie who will go to their graves believing they could have gone one better had it not been for in the insanity of the man at the top. Hearts goalkeeper Gordon during the Bank of Scotland Premier League match against Celtic at Celtic Park . ‘We’ll never know,’ Gordon shrugged. ‘Would more have been achieved? It may have but it may not. You can speculate but no-one at the time could have told if there was more to come from that group of players. It was still a successful time and one I’ll remember fondly for the rest of my years.’ They were, to put it mildly, colourful days. Romanov’s liking for self-harm culminated in Gordon, Steven Pressley and Paul Hartley taking the unusual step of holding a press conference to air their frustrations. The Riccarton Three, as they were dubbed, all lived to tell the tale. ‘It was great days playing in a great team and enjoying playing football,’ Gordon reflected. ‘They’re the things people remember when you finish. Gordon  in action during the Tennents Scottish Cup Semi Final between against Celtic at Hampden Park . Gordon and Andrew Driver celebrate in front of the fans as Hearts beat Hibernian 1-0 at Easter Road . ‘It was a really good team and when that team gets back together it’s a special time for the Hearts fans because they were packing out the ground every week and winning most matches at home and scoring lots of goals. ‘There was always a downside but on the other side of that we were quite successful on the pitch. It was a good team. ‘Whatever went on elsewhere was something which didn’t really affect us. That was because of the strength of the characters we had. Gordon throws his gloves in to the crowd following the Premier League match with Kilmarnock . ‘There are players from that team and some really good characters. Quite a few of that team have gone into management and will probably continue to do so.’ While Hartley, Pressley and Robbie Nielson have done just that, Gordon still has many races to run as a player. Still in contention for three trophies as Celtic’s No1, a nine-year wait to feel a winner’s medal around his neck again could be emphatically bookended in the coming weeks. Ronaldinho celebrates scoring past goalkeeper Gordon during a pre-season friendly  at Murrayfield Stadium . ‘It’s hard, we have played a lot of games already,’ Gordon added. ‘But that’s something you have to deal with when you’re fighting on so many fronts. Trying to win three trophies is going to take its toll but these are the games you have to get through and recover well between times. ‘Up until now we’ve managed it pretty well. Even when we’ve not been playing well we’ve still managed to get through and get the results. ‘I don’t think that’s a problem. It’s part and parcel of having a successful season. It’s something you have to deal with and we will.’ Scottish goalkeeper Gordon in goal for Sunderland after his £9million exit from Hearts back in 2007 . So far, he’s dealt with just about everything that been cast his way. From the cynics that felt signing a long-term crock to replace Fraser Forster would only end one way, to the strikers in Scotland and across Europe who have found him back to his imperious best. It’s not taken long for the smoke signals to be seen down south either. Chelsea have been linked with a move for the 32-year-old as back-up for Thibaut Courtois this summer. But surely Gordon, who effectively still has a two-year tie to Parkhead, has spent enough time watching football these past three years to not voluntarily do so again? ‘Who says I couldn’t be No1, like?’ he laughed. ‘It’s flattering but I’ll just concentrate on doing what I’m doing and we’ll see what happens after that.’","Craig Gordon preparing for his first final appearance since 2006 .

"A Polish prankster whose video of a mutant spider dog got 133million views on YouTube last year has been jailed after another stunt failed to amuse the authorities. Sylwester Wardega rose to international fame after he dressed his dog Chica up as a terrifying eight-legged arachnid and filmed the reaction has he unleashed her on the unsuspecting public. But the 27-year-old's most recent prank has landed him behind bars, after he ran around a Polish shopping centre appearing to wear no pants - and seeming to use its bins as toilets. Scroll down for video . Joke: Sylwester Wardega dressed as an old man before pretending to use a bin as a toilet in a busy Polish shopping centre in front of a shocked security guard . Arrested: Authorities apparently found the prank less funny - and charged him with indecent exposure . The 2.58 video shows Wardega dressed up as an old man in a shopping centre in the Polish capital Warsaw last March. It begins innocently enough, with him spinning around on an escalator at the central train station next door to the  centre as a bemused conductor looks on. He is then filmed trying to catch carp in a tank in Tesco with a fishing rod. When a security guard comes over and asks him what he is doing, he pushes him away and tells him to 'sshhh'. But the prank takes a less salubrious turn in another scene, where Wardega is filmed sitting on a bin near an esculator with his trousers round his ankles. He then throws a toilet roll at a security guard's head before running off. The video has had more than 7million views. Filmed: The entire incident - along with other pranks, like the above - was captured on film . Fame: Wardega has created a following for himself with his elaborate pranks - but it was when he dressed with pet dog as a giant spider that he grabbed international attention . Writing on his Facebook, Wardega announced he had been sentenced to a month in jail. He wrote: 'I just got convicted for a month imprisonment (sic). 'Because of the film 'Grandpa Prank' and the situation in which I allegedly ran around Zloty Tarasy [the shopping centre] with my pants down while I pretended to have physiological needs. 'Ok, I understand, you do not run around with no pants in public... but I was wearing shorts.' Terrifying: Chica and Wardega's terrifying, but amusing, prank has now got more than 133million views . A court official confirmed: 'He was sentenced to a month in prison for indecent exposure.' Stunned fans have now reacted with disbelief. Online commentator Anna Nowak, 24, said: 'It is ridiculous. 'First, it is clear that this video was a joke. He wasn't exposing himself as he had skin covered pants on. 'And anyway, how do can they prove it was him? He was wearing a grandpa mask.'","Sylwester Wardega's video of dog dressed as a spider got 133million views .

"Danny Welbeck started looking forward to his first Wembley appearance with Arsenal after going through a night of mixed emotions at Old Trafford on Monday. Welbeck sent Arsenal through to an FA Cup semi-final against either Bradford or Reading with a 61st-minute winner that came as a result of a clanger by Manchester United right-back Antonio Valencia. For United boss Louis van Gaal, watching the man he sold last summer score the winner at Old Trafford must have been hard to take.

Welbeck celebrates after scoring against his former club Manchester United, but admitted he found it hard . But it was also a difficult night for Welbeck, the Longsight lad who came through United's academy and still considers himself to be a big fan of the club. 'Manchester United is a club that means so much to me,' said Welbeck, who spent 15 years at United having joined them at eight. 'I'm a fan and it's hard to knock them out. I was just doing my job. 'It was about being professional, keeping my focus and motivation. I kept plugging away and then got on the end of Antonio Valencia's backpass, beat David de Gea and got the winning goal. Welbeck spent six seasons at United after coming through the club's youth system . The 24-year-old shakes hands with former team-mate Wayne Rooney (left) after the game . 'I'm just really pleased we're through to the next round.'

'I'll always respect the fans, I had a lovely reception from them and I'm thankful for that,' the England forward said. Arsenal are now favourites to retain the FA Cup after their first victory at Old Trafford in nine years. They will be big expected to overcome whichever opponent they face in the next round and Welbeck is looking forward to stepping out at Wembley in an Arsenal shirt for the first time. Welbeck celebrates in front of the United fans, but for the most part the Old Trafford crowd was kind to him . The Arsenal star celebrates with full back Hector Bellerin, but admitted it was tough to play against United . 'It's good for the team that we're through to the next round, and we're in the semi-finals at Wembley,' the 24-year-old said. 'To get the goal was good for me but it was all about the team performance.' Arsenal return to Old Trafford in the league on the penultimate weekend of the season.

Arsene Wenger's men are up to third having won seven of their last eight Premier League games and Nacho Monreal, who scored the first goal in Monday's 2-1 win over United, hopes Arsenal will be able to keep that momentum going until the end of the season. 'We are in a good dynamic in the last few games,' the left-back said. Nacho Monreal, scorer of Arsenal's first goal on Monday, praised his team's recent form . Arsenal have been excellent in recent weeks, aside from a difficult defeat at home to Monaco . 'Except for Monaco when we didn't play really well, in the rest of the games we have played well and won most of them. This is the style now to keep going. 'We are Arsenal and we have very good players. Obviously everyone had memories of last season that we lost all the games against top teams. 'This season we played really well against (Manchester) City, we won and it was fair and this (against United) is the same. We played really well and are very happy for the victory. 'We want to finish as high up as possible and the best way is to keep going in this dynamic, keep focusing in each game and have commitment. We have to win as many games as we can.'","Danny Welbeck joined Manchester United as an eight-year-old .

"Barcelona legend Hristo Stoichkov has tipped Real Madrid to sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Manchester United if the price is right and claimed the world player of the year is tired of ‘only’ being compared with Lionel Messi. The former striker was speaking in a Sportium promotion when he was asked about Ronaldo and he said: ‘You would have to ask Florentino [Perez] about Ronaldo’s future. Sooner or later he will be sold by the president. ‘Football is like that but it depends on the president. I don’t know if he needs the money; if he does then it is a good moment to sell him.’ Hristo Stoichkov has claimed it would be a good time for Real Madrid to sell Cristiano Ronaldo . The former Barcelona and Bulgaria striker tipped Ronaldo to return to Manchester United . Stoichkov celebrates scoring for Bulgaria against Spain during Euro 96 in England .

Messi is where he should be but Ronaldo is in a delicate moment. ‘All players go through bad moments, it happened to me too. Perhaps the obsession with Messi affects him. The difference between Ronaldo and Messi is he [Messi] gets compared with Pele, [Diego] Maradona and [Johan] Cruyff and Ronaldo only gets compared with Messi.’ Legendary Barca striker Stoichkov said he believed the BBC at Real Madrid - Gareth Bale Karim Benzema and Ronaldo - are not at the same level as Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez.
