"DIY giant B&Q announced today it is to shut one in six of its least profitable stores after its annual profits fell £75million last year. The home improvement chain  is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business. Shares in Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in the UK, jumped up 16p each - a five per cent rise - when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning. Changes: B&Q is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business . Parent company Kingfisher, which also owns Screwfix, plans to axe about 15 per cent of surplus space as a result of the review of its 360-strong B&Q estate. The move was announced as it posted a 7.5 per cent drop in annual profits to £675million after sales fell by 1.4 per cent to £11billion in the year to January 31. This is down from 744million in the 2013-14 year. The planned store closures form part of a plan by new Chief Executive Veronique Laury to shake-up the 360-store B&Q business. Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, made a pre-tax profit of 675 million pounds  in the year to January 31.The results are the first to be presented by Laury, who succeeded Ian Cheshire in December. Veronique Laury said the closure plan was one of a number of 'sharp' decisions being taken by the FTSE 100 company. She added: 'Home improvement is a great market with huge potential and Kingfisher has a strong position within it with further scope to grow in a sustainable way. However, it is clear to me that we need to organise ourselves very differently to unlock our potential.' Other plans include cutting back on some of the 393,000 products sold across the company, particularly as only 7,000 - amounting to 7 per cent of sales - are currently sold in at least two of Kingfisher's operating companies. The company will also look to optimise vacant store space and is in discussions with several retailers about sub-letting opportunities. Kingfisher said the impact on jobs from the B&Q store closure plan will be broadly neutral as it is opening about 60 outlets under the Screwfix brand, while it will also look to redeploy positions to other parts of the business. Ms Laury denied that the UK DIY market was in decline and said the store closure plan reflected a desire to reinvigorate the company's UK offer. She added that it had long been clear that B&Q had too many stores in its estate. B&Q UK & Ireland's total sales were up 1.9 per cent to £3.7 billion in the financial year, with sales of outdoor seasonal and building products up 4 per cent. Profits were 16 per cent higher at £276million. In contrast, profits in France were 12 per cent lower at £349 million due to the impact of weak consumer confidence and a declining housing and construction market. Kingfisher said it will close a small number of stores in the country. It came as Kingfisher, which had a binding agreement to buy French rival Mr Bricolage, was forced to pull out of the £200m deal. The acquisition had been referred to competition authorities because Kingfisher already owns Castorama and Brico Depot in France. While it had the backing of a key shareholder, support was withdrawn by franchisee group the Association Nationale des Promoteurs du Faites Le Vous-Même (ANPF), which holds a 42pc stake in Mr Bricolage. Forty-four of Mr Bricolage's 500 stores, many of them franchises, would had to have been sold to placate regulators. It has since emerged that today was the deadline for the deal and all parties had to agree if there was an extension.","B&Q will shut one in six of its least profitable stores in next two years .

"An animal shelter will be monitored by the government for the next three years after questions were raised about the conditions of its facilities and the number of animals being euthanised. The Lost Dogs Home, in Melbourne, was the subject of recent audit by the Victorian Government, and will now be forced to report on its euthanasia rates twice a year. An investigation into the shelter discovered minimum standards were not being met in some cases, and animals were sleeping on cracked concrete floors or shelters that were too small. Lost Dogs Home, in Melbourne, was the subject of recent audit by the Victorian Government . The cracked floors mean disease is more likely to be spread as the grounds are not sealed, and some of the cat enclosures were also found to be below size. The Lost Dogs Home provides services to 17 councils across Victoria, according to the audit authorised by Jaala Pulford, Agriculture Minister, from a number of different locations. Ms Pulford said more focus needed to be put on the home's assessment process for whether animals should be put down. The report uncovered that some conditions, such as cracked concrete floors, were not up to scratch . The size of the cages where cats were being held were deemed too small . 'We will work to ensure all issues raised in the report are addressed and issues of non-compliance put right,' she told The Age. Despite the home reducing its overall euthanasia rates in recent years, it was found they did not keep records which detailed the health, sociability or temperament of the animals that were put down. The formal investigation into the shelter was launched in January, after strong social media campaign, The Age reported. Victorian Agriculture Minister Jaala Pulford announced the investigation on social media following a strong response from the community.

"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared victory in Israel's election despite being tied with the opposition party in exit polls. Mr Netanyahu took to Twitter to declare a 'great victory' for his right-wing Likud party despite polls showing a dead heat with its main opponent, the centre-left Zionist Union. The Prime Minister wrote: 'Against all odds: a great victory for Likud, a great victory for the national camp led by Likud, a great victory for the people of Israel.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (pictured) delivered a speech for supporters after declaring victory in Israel's election - which exit polls suggest are virtually neck and neck . The incumbent Prime Minister (left and right) took to Twitter to declare a 'great victory' for his right-wing Likud party, despite polls showing a dead heat with its main opponent, the centre-left Zionist Union . Netanyahu (left) took a moment to greet his wife Sara (right) on stage after reacting to the early exit polls . He wrote: 'Against all odds: a great victory for the Likud. A major victory for the people of Israel!' But his main challenger later disputed Netanyahu's victory claim, saying 'everything is open'. Speaking to supporters at party headquarters in Tel Aviv, Herzog said: 'This result allows us to return to power. We will wait for the real results - everything is open.' He added that he would make 'every effort; to cobble together the next coalition government. Polls carried out by the country's three major TV stations have shown an extremely tight race between the Prime Minister's ruling Likud Party and opposition leader Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union. Two polls showed the parties deadlocked with 27 seats each, while a third gave Likud a slight lead of 28-27. But all showed the centrist newcomer Moshe Kahlon with enough seats to determine who will be the next prime minister. Kahlon, a Likud breakaway, has not said which side he would favour - but is likely to drive a hard bargain. They also seemed to suggest that Netanyahu appears to have the slight upper hand in forming a majority coalition, thanks to his traditional right-wing and religious allies. Israeli supporters of the centre-left Zionist Union party wave their national flag as they take part in early celebrations outside the party's headquarters. Exit polls show the two main parties are neck and neck . According to the polls, carried out by Israel's leading television channels, Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union is tied with the ruling Likud party. Pictured: Zionist Union supporters chant for victory . But the Liked party were also celebrating after Channel 2 said  Netanyahu had eked out a narrow victory, winning 28 seats to 27 for Herzog. It also appears Netanyahu has the slight upper hand in forming a coalition . The Netanyahu supporters cheered as they heard the first television predictions for the election results . 'This is a great victory. It's almost a miracle,' Likud lawmaker Ofir Akunis told The Associated Press. 'For months, everybody attacked the Likud. And today is a beautiful day for the Likud. It sends a message that the people of Israel will decide for themselves.' The early figures set off huge celebrations at the Likud campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv. But the mixed results are sure to disappoint Herzog, who had been tipped to come out on top in the election. The results will be announced on Wednesday morning but the country will already be headings into weeks of negotiations, in a bid to form a coalition. The parties will all fall short of the required 61-seat majority in parliament. The early results, which will be confirmed on Wednesday, triggered huge celebrations at the Likud party's campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv . Likud supporters celebrate as Netanyahu declares a 'great victory' for the party and for Israel (left and right) Likud party supporters react joyously after hearing exit poll results in Tel Aviv this morning . Supporters of Benjamin Netanyahu celebrate as election results come in at his campaign headquarters . Israel is divided between two major groups of voters - right wingers and religious parties that tend to take a hard line toward the Palestinians, and parties focused on establishing a Palestinian state as part of a peace agreement. The left wing appeared to have slightly more seats, but would rely heavily on a new Arab list that has said it will not sit in a coalition. That gives Netanyahu, who his seeking his third consecutive term, and his traditional right-wing allies a slight head-start in the negotiations. Experts agreed that the vote had largely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu. Final opinion polls published late last week put Herzog ahead with 25-26 seats with Netanyahu's Likud taking 20-22. But they also warned about the reliability of the polls, pointing to the 2013 election when they completely failed to predict the level of support for centrist newcomer Yesh Atid. Herzog (second left), pictured with his wife Michal after casting their votes, had been tipped to come out on top in the election . Moshe Kahlon, Kulanu party leader, greets his supporters  in Tel Aviv. The upstart centrist Kulanu party has emerged as the kingmaker in the elections, and could tip the scale in favor of either Netanyahu or Herzog . A Zionist Union party supporters raises his hand to his face in disappointment. Whoever wins will fall short of the required 61-seat majority in parliament and will have to rely on allies to form a coalition . Supporters of Moshe Kahlon's party Kulanu celebrate after the exit polls were announced. The party has enough seats to decide who will be the next prime minister - but is likely to drive a hard bargain . This election season has amplified the bitter divide between hard-liners and moderates in Israel. In an extraordinary attempt to sway right-wing voters, Netanyahu announced on the eve of the election that there would be no Palestinian state if he were re-elected. As his party trailed the Zionist Union in final opinion polls, Netanyahu said that if his rivals were elected security would be compromised and they would give up total Israeli control over Jerusalem. 'We will continue to build to fortify Jerusalem so its division will not be possible and it will remain united forever,' he said on a tour of Har Homa, a settlement neighbourhood of annexed east Jerusalem. The outgoing Israeli parliament and the latest opinion poll . Netanyahu also vowed he would never allow the Palestinians to establish a capital in the city's eastern sector and pledged to build 'thousands' of settler homes. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as capital of their future state, and continued settlement building has incensed the international community, which sees it as an obstacle to peace. Throughout his campaign, Netanyahu has repeatedly accused Zionist Union leaders Isaac Herzog and former peace negotiator Tzipi Livni of being ready to abandon Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its indivisible capital. But Netanyahu's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing NRG website if it was true that there would be no Palestinian state established if he was reelected. He later told public radio the two-state solution was now irrelevant, saying the 'reality has changed' and 'any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical Islamists'. Herzog, however, dismissed Netanyahu's jibes, pledging on Sunday  to 'safeguard' Jerusalem 'in actions, not just words, more than any other leader'. On Monday, he insisted Jerusalem would remain forever Israel's 'undivided capital'. The leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier -- as in 2009 when the centrist Kadima party then headed by Livni effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought Netanyahu to power for a second term. Under Israel's complex electoral system, the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes, but to the MP or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61.","Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tied with Zionist Union's Isaac Herzog .

"Three care home bosses have been charged with manslaughter following the death of an 86-year-old woman, who died two weeks after the property was shut down by inspectors. Ivy Atkin died in November 2012, a fortnight after she was moved from Autumn Grange Care Home in Sherwood Rise, Nottingham, into another care home. A police investigation had been launched after concerns were raised about the standard of care provided to residents at the home, which specialised in dementia care. Three care home bosses have been charged with manslaughter following the death of Ivy Atkin, 86, who died two weeks after Autumn Grance residential home in Nottingham (pictured) was shut down by inspectors . Owners Naseen Kiani, 53, and Yousaf Khan, 46, and 38-year-old operations manager Mohammed Rahamatullah Khan have now been charged with gross negligence manslaughter. A fourth person, care worker Safeena Bibi, 26, of Nottingham, has been charged with Health and Safety at Work Act offences. The company which owned the home, Sherwood Rise Ltd, has been charged with corporate manslaughter. Five other people who were on bail in connection with the death have been released with no further action. Kiani, from Sheffield, and Yousef Khan and Mohammed Rahamatullah Khan, both from Nottingham, will appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on April 14, alongside Bibi and the company secretary of Sherwood Rise Ltd. Before it was closed down, Autumn Grange had room for 52 people aged over 65. The four defendants will appear at Nottingham Crown Court, alongside a representative of Sherwood Rise, the company which owned the home . Inspectors from health watchdog the Care Quality Commission investigated the home prior to it closing in November 2012. The report found ‘multiple examples of neglectful care’ at her care home. At the time, 28 residents had to be immediately rehoused in other accommodation. Mrs Atkin, a widowed former dressmaker, had been moved to Autumn Grange in the summer of 2012 when she became unable to cope in the bungalow where she had lived for more than 50 years. According to a relative, Mrs Atkin, who was suffering from dementia, had worked as a factory machinist. Her husband of 58 years, Kenneth, worked in a lemonade factory before his death six years ago. The couple had no children. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ivy Atkin, 86, was living in Autumn Grange residential home in Nottingham .

"The £1.6billion a year industrial tribunal gravy train has been brought to a shuddering halt. Official figures reveal there has been a fall of almost 80 per cent in the number of cases brought against firms by employees. Business leaders said the Government’s introduction of charges to deter vexatious claims appeared to have ended the damaging ‘no win, no fee’ culture that flourished under Labour. Official figures reveal there has been a fall of almost 80 per cent in the number of cases brought against firms by employees . They criticised Labour’s plans to reverse the reforms if it wins power in May, warning it would make firms less likely to hire. The introduction of fees of between £390 and £1,200 to take an employer to a tribunal, refundable if the case is won, has seen a 78 per cent fall in the number of cases since it was introduced in July 2013, the figures showed. That means the level of claims has returned to levels seen in the early 2000s, before the escalation of no win, no fee cases helped the number to spiral to almost 240,000 a year. Under the last government, the taxpayer met the £86million a year cost of running the tribunals. Firms were spending around £1.6billion a year in defence costs. Employment tribunals were also a major cost to employers, which were spending around £1.6 billion a year in defence costs. The British Chambers of Commerce estimated the average cost to a business of defending itself at tribunal is £8,500, and the average cost of agreeing a settlement is £5,400. Many firms said they settled claims they disputed rather than risk costs spiralling by proceeding to tribunal. Ministers say the new fees system is accompanied by financial support for those who allege they have suffered abuses by unscrupulous employers and cannot afford to pay a fee. Business minister Matthew Hancock told the Daily Mail: ‘Labour’s compensation culture was totally out of hand. It cost millions and warned businesses off creating jobs because of the risk of being held to ransom by a spurious claim. Business minister Matthew Hancock accused Ed Miliband (pictured) of not learning lessons . ‘We have worked hard to reform tribunals so they work better and more fairly, where more people are brought together in conciliation, and genuine abuses can be dealt with properly and only reach court when absolutely necessary. 'Businesses are more confident of creating jobs, and are doing so in record numbers. ‘Yet Ed Miliband has not learned lessons and would reverse this progress. A vote for Labour is a vote against business, against jobs and against prosperity. They cannot be trusted with our economy and would only take us back to the dark days of the past.’ Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors said: ‘Our members would often tell us that the threat of being taken to an employment tribunal was a major concern and a deterrent to taking on new staff, particularly during uncertain times. 'The introduction of fees for employment tribunals has had a direct effect on the confidence and ability of businesses to hire, without undermining the rights of employees with legitimate grievances. It has proven to be a fair, balanced and vital reform.’ Employment tribunals rose by almost 160 per cent under Labour. In 1998-99, the number of employment tribunal claims was 91,913. By 2009-10, this had risen to 236,100. Though most applications did not result in a full hearing or were settled out of court, businesses still had to pay substantial legal costs. The consequences of vexatious claims were most serious for small businesses, which could rarely afford to launch a robust defence. Labour has vowed to abolish the current system to ensure ‘all workers have proper access to justice’. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna told the TUC last year: ‘The current employment tribunal system is unfair, unsustainable and has resulted in prohibitive costs locking people out of the justice they are entitled to.’ TUC boss Frances O’Grady said: ‘By charging up-front fees for harassment and abuse claims the Government has made it easier for bad employers to get away with the most appalling behaviour.’ Fees range from £390 for a straightforward claim over unfair dismissal or a failure to pay wages to £1,200 for sex or race discrimination. But poor claimants can have the fees reduced or waived. The new figures show the total number of cases brought has fallen to 35,163 a year. The steepest decline has been in sexual discrimination allegations, down 82 per cent since charges were introduced, to 3,628 over the last year.","Fall of 80 per cent in number of cases brought against firms by employees .

"A shopper got quite a shock when she picked up a bag of potatoes to find a snake sleeping inside. Lewina Stewart, from Toowoomba in Queensland's south-east, had bought the vegetables at her local Woolworths on March 10 before making the find. Sunshine Coast Snake Catcher 24/7's Ritchie Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia Ms Stewart had the potatoes for a week before she noticed the snake inside when she went to open it. Lewina Stewart got quite a shock when she picked up a bag of potatoes to find a snake sleeping inside . She found it 'alive and well' and alerted staff members at Woolworths of the 30-centimetre white-crowned snake. 'It was sealed packet so it would have been in there before it was sealed,' Mr Gilbert said. 'There are tiny holes in the bag but it would have been too small for the snake to get in.' It is understood Woolworths is taking the incident seriously and are trying to find out what went wrong. Mr Gilbert also shed light on how the snake got inside the bag. 'It is a mildly venomous snake. It will burrow under foliage and soil, so I'm not surprised it could have been pulled up with the potatoes,' he said.

"The word 'lunatic' itself was derived from the Latin word for moon 'luna,' as many were convinced that the celestial body could cause disease and strange behaviour. And it's a theory that persists today, with many people believing that a full moon is more likely to coincide with hectic periods in hospitals or in birth wards. But Dr Jean-Luc Margot, a professor of planetary astronomy at the University of California, has carried out a study that proves that the concept is essentially rubbish. A researcher from the University of California says that claims the moon causes illnesses are rubbish. Dr Margot said that when life is hectic on the day of a full moon, many people remember the association because it confirms their belief - but they do not remember when nothing in particular happens on such a day . His research was carried out to illustrate how intelligent and otherwise reasonable people develop strong beliefs that are not aligned with reality. 'The absence of a lunar influence on human affairs has been demonstrated in the areas of automobile accidents, hospital admissions, surgery outcomes, cancer survival rates, menstruation, births, birth complications, depression, violent behaviour, and even criminal activity', Dr Margot writes. Even though a 40-year-old UCLA study demonstrated that the timing of births does not correlate in any way with the lunar cycle, the belief in a lunar effect has persisted. A full moon is when it is on the opposite side of  Earth from the sun. This means its entire surface is lit up by the sun, making it especially bright. A new moon is when it is in the same direction as the sun, so its 'far side' is lit, and it can barely be seen in Earth's sky. On average, the moon is 239,000 miles (384,000km) from Earth and takes 27 days, seven hours, 43 minutes and 11.6 seconds to complete one orbit. A 2004 study in a nursing journal, for example, suggested that the full moon influenced the number of hospital admissions in a medical unit in Barcelona, Spain. But Dr Margot identified multiple flaws in the data collection and analysis of the 2004 research. By re-analysing the data, he showed that the number of admissions was unrelated to the lunar cycle. 'The moon is innocent,' Dr Margot said. Dr Margot cited what scientists refer to as the 'confirmation bias' - people's tendency to interpret information in a way that confirms their beliefs and ignore data that contradict them. When life is hectic on the day of a full moon, many people remember the association because it confirms their belief. But hectic days that do not correspond with a full moon are promptly ignored and forgotten because they do not reinforce the belief. The moon is even blamed when things get crazy at hospital emergency rooms (stock image shown) or birth wards. 'Some nurses ascribe the apparent chaos to the moon, but dozens of studies show that the belief is unfounded,' said Dr Jean-Luc Margot, a UCLA professor of planetary astronomy . Dr Margot said the societal costs of flawed beliefs can be enormous. In just one current example, the recent measles outbreak appears to have been triggered by parents' questionable beliefs about the safety of the measles vaccine. 'Vaccines are widely and correctly regarded as one of the greatest public health achievements, yet vaccine-preventable diseases are killing people because of beliefs that are out of step with scientific facts,' Dr Margot said. A willingness to engage in evidence-based reasoning and admit that one's beliefs may be incorrect will produce a more accurate view of the world and result in better decision-making, he said. 'Perhaps we can start by correcting our delusions about the moon, and work from there,' Dr Margot added. The study was published online by the journal Nursing Research.","Scientist at the University of California studied lunar myths .

"The former wife of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was arrested by Lebanese authorities in December, is to be released and returned to the terror group that worships her, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. According to security sources, a deal that would release 24 Lebanese security officers being held by the Al Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front is close to being finalised and Saja al-Dulaimi would be freed as part of the hostage swap. The infamous female jihadi, now thought to be married to a Palestinian, has been held in a high security prison just outside Beirut since December. Saja al-Dulaimi (right), the ex-wife of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (left), is to be released in a prisoner swap . She is pregnant and expected to give birth soon, but Lebanese security officers have cracked neither her, nor – astonishingly – Hajaa, her ten-year-old daughter with al-Baghdadi who was arrested with her. Al-Dulaimi is now one of 19 non-lethal terrorists who the Lebanese government has agreed can be traded for the release of the soldiers held by al-Nusra. Al-Dulaimi, who was married for three months to the IS chief, defected to al-Nusra in 2013, becoming an invaluable courier for them while she was living in Tripoli. The soldiers, four of whom have been executed, were abducted by the al-Nusra and IS militants in the wake of clashes in the border town of Arsal in August last year. Al-Dulaimi was married for three months to the ISIS (file picture) chief, but defected to al-Nusra in 2013 .","Saja al-Dulaimi is to be released and returned to the al-Nusra terror group .

"A police officer has been sacked after he was filmed forcing his knee against a female suspect's neck until she collapsed unconscious. James Medina was accused of using inappropriate force in a holding cell against the woman who had been arrested on charges of assaulting an officer. Footage shows Medina struggling with Seryina Trujillo for around a minute before he forces his knee on her throat, causing her to go limp and fall to the floor. Police administrators said Medina didn't seek medical attention for Trujillo, didn't seek the help of other officers to subdue her and didn't report the use of force. Manhandled: Denver police officer James Medina has been fired after being accused of using inappropriate force while restraining female suspect Seryina Trujillo in a holding cell which was caught on CCTV (above) Pinned down: During the scuffle, Medina puts his knee against Trujillo's neck until she goes limp . Another officer told a supervisor about the incident four days after it happened,  KCNC-TV in Denver reported. Medina, a 16-year veteran, has appealed the firing, said his attorney, Donald Sisson. Sisson said Medina's actions were reasonable and that Trujillo had been scratching and biting the officer. Sisson said Medina didn't file a use of force report because he didn't think Trujillo was injured. The incident occurred July 10. Trujillo had been arrested for allegedly kicking Medina in the face and spitting on another officer while police were taking her boyfriend into custody. Out cold: Trujillo collapses on the floor. Police administrators said Medina didn't seek medical attention for her, didn't seek the help of other officers to subdue her and didn't report the use of force . Trujillo gets to her feet after she appeared to be unconscious for several seconds. Medina had earlier asked her to surrender her shoes and belt inside the holding cell, but she had resisted, prompting the fracas . Trujillo sits back down as Medina gathers her belongings. Medina said he will appeal the decision to fire him . Medina asked Trujillo to surrender her shoes and belt inside the holding cell, but she resisted. In an ensuing struggle, Medina can be heard repeatedly telling her not to bite him. According to the department, Medina placed his right knee against Trujillo's neck. When he got off, she went limp and appeared to lose consciousness for several seconds. 'Clearly his actions taken as a whole are not in line with the values of the police department,' said Cmdr Matt Murray. 'We have repeatedly talked about the fact there is a culture of change within the Denver Police Department demanded by the community and this is a part of it.' Sgt Glenn Mahr, a member of the department's tactics review board, suggested after reviewing the tape that Medina used appropriate force because Trujillo displayed 'active aggression' toward him. But Mahr faulted Medina for not seeking assistance from other officers. The use of police force has become a flashpoint topic since the shooting last August of black teenager Michael Brown by a white officer which sparked a wave of protests across America.","James Medina accused of using inappropriate force on Seryina Trujillo .

"A Florida teacher claims she was fired because she reported that her preteen student had told her she was being abused by her step-father. Diana Castella was teaching part time for Brownsville Middle School's iPrep program when a student told the teacher that her stepfather lays on top of her. Castella said she sought out another teacher's advice because she was unsure of the school's protocol and then reported what the child had told her to a school counselor the next morning. Scroll down for video . Florida teacher Diana Castella claims she was fired just days after reporting that her student, who is under the age of 12, was . 'Administrators and Miami-Dade County Public Schools don't like snitchers. They like everything to be brushed under the rug,' she told NBC 6. But school administrator told her that she was being investigated because she didn't report the abuse soon enough. Castella allowed the student to go home to her allegedly abusive step-father before the teacher alerted authorities. The girl was first questioned by the Department of Childhood Services without Castella in the room, . Castella said she was then let inside in the room, where she claims she heard the student confess that she had been molested by her step-father multiple times. Police were contacted and the student's father was arrested and charged with child molestation and lewd and lascivious conduct. When Castella returned to school, she said she was called into the principal's office and told she was under investigation by the school because she didn't report the incident in a 'timely manner'. A spokesman for Miami-Dade County Schools told NBC 6 that if someone in the district learns about a 'potential abuse case' they are 'required to report it immediately'. But, according to Castella, the principal claimed she had to be let go because the school could no longer afford to fund her particular position - not because of the investigation. The student's father was arrested and charged with child molestation. Castella said the school then told she was under investigation by the school because she didn't report the incident in a 'timely manner' But, according to Castella, the principal claimed she had to be let go because the school could no longer afford to fund her particular position - not because of the investigation . Castella believes she got fired for reporting what her student had told her. Castella said she is 'disgusted with the system', which she says should be fighting to keep on board a teacher who 'did the right thing'. 'I became a teacher for my students,' she said. 'I didn't become a teacher to save the reputation of a school.' The controversy comes just weeks after two teachers in the Miami-Dade County Schools' district were fired for incidents involving students. Last week a music teacher at Miami Palmetto Senior High was arrested and charged of having sex with a 17-year-old student that he admitted to having a nine-month relationship with. And at the beginning of the month a kindergarten teacher at the district's Silver Bluff Elementary School was charged with child abuse after he allegedly dug his nails into a student's hand and leg because she was struggling with math problems.","Florida teacher Diana Castella said she sought out another educator's advice and reported what the child told her the next morning .

"It started as a conversation about how to photograph China's famous golden monkeys, and ended with Prince William pledging to dress up as a tree. During his wildlife conservation visit to China, the Duke of Cambridge visited a photographer to learn about how he managed to capture such close up pictures of wildlife. And when photography enthusiast Xi Zhinong told the Prince he often dressed up as a tree so he could get close to the animals, the second in line to the throne pledged to do the same. Prince William has pledged to dress up as a tree on his next visit to China so that he can go out with photographer and conservationist Xi Zhinong to photograph rare Yunnan Golden Haired monkeys . The Prince said when he next returned to Yunnan Xishuangbanna he would join Xi on a photography exhibition and also don the same disguise to photograph the endangered Golden Haired Monkeys of Yunnan, according to People's Daily Online. It was pledged during the Prince's tour of the Far East, which he used to foster UK business links as well as raise awareness of the dangers of the illegal trade in wildlife. Golden haired monkeys of Yunnan are native to the forests of China and are highly endangered - with less than 2,000 estimated to be living in the wild. While able to withstand plunging temperatures and even snow, the species is in danger because their habitats are slowly disappearing and their distinctive appearance has made them a key target for illegal hunters. Yunnan golden haired monkeys are native to China but they are believed to be less than 2,000 in the wild . They are also something of a mystery because they were first discovered by scientists in the 1890s, then lost and thought to be extinct until 1962. The monkeys are herbivores and give birth every two or three years. China has launched a conservation programme to try and protect the species. Xi Zhinong is a Chinese wildlife photographer as well as an environmentalist. Between 1992 and 1996 Xi went to Baimaxue Mountain National Nature Reserve to raise awareness of the Golden Haired Monkey. He also hoped that by sharing photos of the monkeys and how they lived he could protect the natural habitat of the animals, in a strip of primeval forest. Prince William spoke to photographer Xi about his work and learned how he disguises himself to take pictures . After being discovered in the 1890s the Yunnan Golden Haired monkey did not appear again until 1962 . During his visit, Xi presented Prince William with two photography collections, 'Wild China' and 'The Spirit of Life'. Prince William was in China last week for a wildlife conservation visit. His visit was the highest profile Royal visit since the Queen toured the country in 1986, and gave the Prince the chance to meet wildlife experts and conservationists. He used the tour to condemn the trade in illegal wildlife and products, such as ivory, and called upon China to become a world leader. Golden haired monkeys are in danger because their habitats, mainly forests, are slowly disappearing . Prince William was intrigued by the golden haired monkeys and asked how close-up pictures were possible . Golden haired monkeys are native to China and mainly spend their time in the forest canopy . During his time in the country Prince William visited Beijing and featured on a television campaign organised by WildAid and aimed at raising awareness of the impact of the trade in rhino horn and ivory. The tour ended however with a PR disaster when the Prince was allowed to visit an Elephant rescue centre, just a few yards from an arena where elephants play football, dance and do tricks for tourists. Prince William's visit was also seen as an opportunity to create links between the two countries, and he met President Xi Jinping. The end of Prince William's tour was branded somewhat a PR disaster after he visited an elephant sanctuary yards from where the animals perform tricks for audiences in a type of circus, condemned by campaigners .","Prince William visited photographer Xi Zhinong as part of conservation trip .

"It is one of Cambodia's most popular tourist cities, where visitors flock to visit the nearby ruined temples of the Angkor region. But while foreign visitors stay in luxury hotels and splash out of escorted trips to discover the delights of 12th-century temple Angkor Wat, families work in a rubbish dump just 18.6 miles away for a meager £1 a day. And now the rubbish site itself has piqued the curiosity of tourists, who have added a morbid visit of the site to their tour itineraries, so they can snap photos with the children working to sort the rubbish. Sigen Rathy is 12 years old. She has worked at the site for a year and has seen many tour groups passing through the landfill site to photograph what they see . A Japanese tourist covers her mouth with her hands due to the strong smell caused by the mountains of toxic waste and decaying food . The desperate photos showing the hard life of adults and children living and working at the site were taken by Spanish filmmaker David Rengel, who visited the area to document child labour conditions in the country. But the director was further shocked when he saw groups of tourists visiting the rubbish site to see the locals at work, take photos of the children and hand out sweets. Anlong Pi is a huge wasteland, just outside the popular tourist hub of Siem Reap. Workers are the extensive rubbish dump breathe toxic fumes on a daily basis as they work and live at the site. Lia Neang Syer is 14 years old. She has worked at the dump for four years and had to give up her studies because she had no money to pay for books and extra lessons. She has two sisters and one younger brother. Their mother also works at the garbage dump. She does not like the job but she is forced because her family need the money to live . Viku Tupse is nine years old and has lived at the rubbish dump for two years. Among the rubbish found a broken face of Mickey, he told Rengel knows that it will entertain the tourists when he places it on his head. He does not understand why tourists visit the garbage dump where he works, but he likes the sweets that tourists give him . In recent years, the huge increase in Siem Reap's population - in part to deal with the influx of tourists - has caused an exponential increase in the amount of rubbish taken to the dump site - causing even worse conditions for workers. Local organisations have also noticed an increase in the number of tourists visiting to site out of curiosity, to photograph the poverty-stricken locals working to sort the rubbish. Rengel explained: 'I went to Siem Reap, where my colleague and friend Omar Havana, a freelance photographer for Getty images, had been developing a project over various years. He gave me the contacts I needed to enter the site. 'While I was taking photos to demonstrate the realities of child labour, I realised tourists were arriving to visit, sometimes in buses and other times in tuk-tuks, Cambodian taxis, I thought it was horrible, and it should be reported. 'In that moment, I changed my point of view and instead decided to report on the practice of tourism as one of the causes of slave labour, including child labour.' A group of tourists watch Sueun Chany, 12, carrying large bags of trash across the dump for sorting. The landfill is located a few kilometers from Siem Reap, the most famous tourist destination in Cambodia . Kon Mai is 15 years old and has worked at the dump since he was 12. He had to leave school because his parents constantly are travelling from one place to another in search of work. He has five younger brothers and theer are reported problems of domestic violence at home . Hael Kemra is 15 years old. In the future she wants to be an English teacher. She began working at the dump at just 10 years old. Her mother was who took her to the garbage dump to earn money when her father abandoned them . While spending time talking to the 200 or so people living at the site, more of 50 of whom are children, Rengel realised the rubbish dump was being offered as an alternative kind of tour to the usual temple visits. He told MailOnline Travel: 'What disgusted me, what I didn't understand and what I don't think is understandable is why these tourist visit places where children work, or visit orphanages where children have lost their parents. 'It seems awful to me that tourists and people with money take part in this, from their position of privilege, show such contempt towards the inhabitants of the countries they visit and towards their human rights. 'What is the most contemptuous, what we shouldn't allow under any circumstances, is that they use children like a some kind of entertainment, violating all their human rights in the process.' Hael Kemra (left) is 15 years old and Suy Sokhon (right) is 16. They rest and laugh on a hammock in the landfill, while they are awaiting the next truckload of waste. Most children begin work in the landfill at 10 or 12 years old . A truckload of waste, organic and inorganic, some toxic, reaches the dump of Anlong Pi, just outside Siem Reap . Sau Srey Neang is 11 years old. She comes from a family of seven and her father left to work in Thailand six months ago - they haven't heard from him since. She wants to continue with her studies so she can become a teacher . Of the 200 or so who work at the site, there are some families that also live there, building houses just beyond the dump and the toxic fumes of the site. Rengel explained: 'The houses and hammocks you see in teh pictures are areas that have been constructed so the workers can rest during their long days at the site. 'They earn their money separating paper, metal, plastic and all recyclable materials then having them weighed and sold to the company that controls the rubbish dump.' Children and their parents are all landfill workers and spend 10 hours a day scavenging for rubbish and recyclable materials . Every day tons of organic and inorganic waste arrive in large trucks forming mountains of toxic compounds, between those mountains the inhabitants of the landfill seek recyclable materials such as glass, paper and metal with which earn money . In recent years the garbage generated in Siem Reap has doubled and the landfill capacity has been exceeded . He added: 'I spoke to the locals about whether tourist visits were a rare occurrence. They told me that every day tourists arrive. Hotels and tourists guides are offering trips as something exotic and different to the usual temple visits. Nobody has banned these visits and the rubbish dump also charges visitors an entry fee.' Dubbing the practice 'dirty tourism', Rengel explains in the promotional materials for his work: 'Around the world, the popularity of the routes of poverty, including orphanages, slums or landfills is growing. 'These types of tours use children and their families for the economic benefit of the organizers, leading to greater exploitation and denigrate children as mere leisure objects.' More of David Rengel's photos can be viewed on his website.","Anlong Pi is situated just 18 miles form the popular tourist town of Siem Reap and the Angkor Wat temple .

"Motorists may soon be able to direct the headlamps of their car with their eyes, according to car manufacturer Vauxhall. The company has revealed  it is developing eye-tracking technology that will automatically adjust the direction and intensity of headlights to match the driver's gaze. The system uses an in-car camera that focuses on the drivers head with infrared sensors to detect movement and calculate the motorist's line of sight. Vauxhall's new eye-tracking system will direct the car headlights in the direction that the motorist is looking. The system uses a central camera and peripheral infrared sensors that scan the driver's eyes more than 50 times per second in dusk and night-time conditions . Vauxhall - which sells its vehicles under the brand Opel in some countries and is owned by General Motors - insists that the technology will automatically compensate should a driver be distracted or look away from the road. The company added it is still currently developing the system but hopes to introduce it to vehicles as its third-generation of intelligent lighting systems in the coming years. The system uses a central camera and peripheral infrared sensors that scan the driver's eyes more than 50 times per second in dusk and night-time conditions. The headlights adjust to match the driver's gaze both vertically and horizontally. Even if the driver is momentarily distracted and takes their eyes of the road, the lights will continue illuminating in the direction of travel. This will be combined with sensors outside the car that will detect daylight levels, turning on the headlights automatically when the vehicle enters a tunnel. Vauxhall said the lights will also adjust to different road and weather conditions. A forward-facing camera mounted behind the rear-view mirror can also detect the proximity of headlamps or rear lights of other vehicles. This allows the vehicle to automatically adjust the beam to preventing dazzling other users by reducing the intensity of the beam. A matrix of LEDs in the headlights additionally mean that parts of the headlight closest to oncoming traffic can be deactivated when passing other vehicles, while keeping the rest of the road illuminated. Engineers have also developed new adaptive lighting that combines with the eye-tracking system to make seeing on the roads at night easier and safer. This technology works using a central camera and peripheral infrared sensors that scan the driver's eyes more than 50 times per second in dusk and night-time conditions.

This allows the vehicle to automatically adjust the beam to preventing dazzling other users by reducing the intensity of the beam. A matrix of LEDs in the headlights also mean that parts of the headlight closest to oncoming traffic can be deactivated when passing other vehicles, while keeping the rest of the road illuminated. Ingolf Schneider, director of lighting technology at Opel, said the eye-tracking technology was still under development but they had overcome many problems. He said it has been designed to prevent it from jerking around as a driver's attention moves from one part of the road to another. A forward-facing camera mounted behind the rear-view mirror can also detect the proximity of headlamps or rear lights of other vehicles, and will automatically adjust the headlight beam to avoid dazzle . A matrix of LEDs in the headlights additionally mean that parts of the headlight closest to oncoming traffic can be deactivated when passing other vehicles, while keeping the rest of the road illuminated . From March 2018 every new car sold in the European Union will legally have to be equipped with eCall technology. This will consist of a 'black box' that detects a crash and automatically calls the emergency services for help. This box is also fitted with a GPS sensor so it can send the car's precise location to the control room. The technology contains a mobile phone-like SIM card designed to transmit the vehicle’s location to emergency services in the event of a crash. It is fitted inside a 'black box' built into the vehicle. An SOS button near the dashboard, linked to a SIM card, allows drivers to call 999 quickly. And if airbags are deployed it automatically sends a text message to emergency services with the car’s location - as well as its unique vehicle ID number. 'To overcome this problem, we have successfully developed a sophisticated delay algorithm which ensures a suitably flowing movement for the light cone. 'We’ve been pursuing this concept of controlling the direction and intensity of light based on where the driver is looking for around two years.' Vauxhall/Opel's International Technical Development Centre has been developing the eye-tracking technology with the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. Many of Vauxhall's models, including the Zafira Tourer, Astra and Insignia, already carry its first generation adapted forward lighting technology. The eye-tracking system will be combined with this system in future models, a spokesman said. However, they were not able to say exactly when it might be introduced as it is still in development. Mr Schneider said: 'Another major benefit is that the eye-tracker doesn’t have to be individually calibrated for a particular driver. 'The system works perfectly with anyone behind the wheel, no matter what their size. 'The more we understand the benefits of this technology, the more intensively we push ahead with our joint project.' Simon Williams, a spokesman for the RAC, said the technology had the potential to make driving at night safer. He said: 'Motorists often find driving at night more demanding. 'In fact, RAC research shows that older drivers in particular, find driving in the dark uncomfortable with 93% of those over 65 saying they actively avoid doing so. 'Anything that can be done to make driving at night safer for every driver, regardless of age, has to be seen as a positive step forward. 'When driving on very bendy roads headlamp beams are not always aligned with the next direction the vehicle needs to take so this development should prove very beneficial in this type of situation. 'The automatic anti-dazzle technology is also impressive as being temporarily blinded by an oncoming vehicle can be extremely dangerous.' Vauxhall says its new LED Matrix Lighting will deactivate parts of the headlight beam to avoid dazzling other drivers, shown in the image on the left, while keeping the rest of the road fully illuminated. The image on the right shows how headlights without the system can dazzle a motorist travelling in the opposite direction . Vauxhall's AFL+ adaptive front lighting technology uses a forward-facing camera  to detect the road conditions ahead  and adjust the shape and intensity of the beam, as shown in the diagram above . Vauxhall's system uses an internal camera and infrared sensors track the driver's gaze 50 times a second .","Vauxhall/Opel hope to introduce the technology to vehicles in future years .

"A family has been left devastated after their healthy one-year-old boy died just days after developing chickenpox. Layton Boys-Hope caught the common childhood illness from his big brother, James. But days later, his parents noticed he had a high temperature and had trouble with his breathing. Layton was rushed to hospital where he developed blood poisoning and was put into a medically-induced coma so his body could fight the infection. But in the early hours of the next morning, the toddler suffered a cardiac arrest and couldn't be resuscitated. Scroll down for video . Layon Boys-Hope, one, died after catching chickenpox. He developed blood poisoning and was put into a medically-induced coma, but suffered a cardiac arrest and tragically passed away . Layton caught chickenpox from his big brother James, three. His heartbroken parents David Hope, 35 and Nichol Boys, 34, are now warning other families to take chickenpox seriously . Layton's heartbroken parents David Hope, 35 and Nichol Boys, 34, are now warning others to be aware of the danger of the common illness, which causes complications for one in 100 sufferers. Mr Hope, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, put his son down for a nap on Sunday February 8, believing he was recovering from a bout of chickenpox. But when he woke for his lunch, Layton was having difficulty breathing and his temperature was soaring. Mr Hope, an optical lab technician, said: 'We took him to Sunderland Royal Hospital where he had blood tests done and were told he had an infection of some sort, but that antibiotics couldn't be administered until it was clear exactly what was wrong. 'Layton was administered to the ward for observation and was going to be kept in overnight, but he died before the morning. 'It all happened so quickly. 'It felt like one minute we were in A&E and he was mumbling away and reaching his arms out to me - not his normal self but not like a child who only had hours to live - and the next he was gone.' For most children, chickenpox - which causes a red itchy spots that crust over to form scabs - is a mild illness that gets better on its own. But one in 100 chickenpox patients suffer complications from the virus. Around 95 per cent of children catch chickenpox before the age of 16, and for most it's a mild illness leading to itching, blisters and sometimes a high temperature. It's caused by the varicella-zoster virus and is highly contagious, usually lasting a week to ten days. In an estimated one per cent of cases, though, serious complications can develop such as pneumonia, meningitis, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), inflammation of the heart and toxic shock, a type of blood poisoning - all usually down to impaired immunity. Doctors advise parents to contact a GP straight away if your child develops any abnormal symptoms, such as: . Mr Hope left the ward at around 8pm to see to his other children: James, three, Skye, six, Brooke, nine, and Reese, 11, . But at 10.30pm he got a call from his wife begging him to come to the hospital. He said: 'She was saying she was scared and that there were all sorts of things going on, tubes and needles everywhere and she wanted me there. 'Then a nurse took the phone and told me I should come back to the hospital if at all possible. 'We lost him just hours after that.' Around 95 per cent of children catch chickenpox before the age of 16. For most, it's a mild illness leading to itching, blisters and sometimes a high temperature. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus and is highly contagious, usually lasting a week to ten days. However, in an estimated one per cent of cases, serious complications can develop such as pneumonia, meningitis, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), inflammation of the heart and toxic shock, a type of blood poisoning - all usually down to impaired immunity. Experts have calculated that complications may result in 6,700 children's hospital admissions a year in the UK. Layton's family, who are struggling to cope with his death, want other parents to take chicken pox more seriously. Mr Hope said: 'Most people wouldn't even take their child to the doctors if they had chickenpox. 'It's such a common thing and we all expect it to come and go quickly. Layton was put down for a nap on Sunday February 8th but when his father checked on him later on he had a soaring temperature and difficulty breathing. He died the next morning in hospital . Chickenpox is normally a mild childhood illness but serious complications can occur in an estimated one per cent of cases . 'Some parents even wish that their child would get the illness, so that it is ""out of the way"" but now even the mention of chicken pox sends a shiver down my spine. 'Of course it's incredibly rare for chicken pox to kill a child, it's obviously not impossible and I just wish something could have been done to help him.' Miss Boys, who is a full-time mother, said that she is still in shock and doesn't know how to respond to the death of her son. She said: 'We were there when they stopped trying to resuscitate Layton and it was heartbreaking for us both. 'I remember turning to the nurse and asking her why I wasn't crying, she said I was in shock, I think I still am. 'My son James has lost his best friend and all the kids are up and down. 'It was Skye's birthday yesterday and she said that she wished Layton could have had some cake. 'We are trying to continue on but every time we find ourselves feeling anything but complete despair we feel guilty.' The family are now fundraising to take their other children on holiday to deal with the grief of their loss. Mr Hope said: 'Skye's birthday was really difficult and although we won't ever go back to ""normal"" I want the kids to know that there are still good days that will happen in the future. 'If we could just get them away for a little while to relax and play it would do them the world of good.'

"It takes practice to perfect shuffling a deck of cards in a fast and flashy way. But a mathematician has pointed out that card aerobatics do not guarantee a random and well shuffled pack. Peri Diaconis compared different shuffling techniques and it seems that the 'riffle shuffle', which involves cutting a deck in half and shuffling the halves into each other, is the most time effective - if done well. Scroll down for video . Peri Diaconis compared different shuffling techniques and said the 'riffle' shuffle (pictured), which involves cutting a deck in half and shuffling the halves into each other, is the most effective and random if done well . In a Numberphile YouTube video, the Stanford University mathematician said that if a dealer uses a riffle shuffle, they only need to repeat the process seven times to get a good mix. If they are well adept at the card manoeuvre, this could take less than 30 seconds. But if they use a flashier overhand shuffle, which involves quickly inserting random chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other, they will need to do it 10,000 times to achieve similar results. This could still be fast in the hands of experts, but still slower than the riffle method. ‘There's a third way of mixing cards - used in poker tournaments and Monte Carlo - I call that smooshing,’ Dr Diaconis said. In a video for Numberphile, Dr Diaconis compared shuffling styles to explain their efficiency (illustrated) If a dealer uses an overhand shuffle (pictured), which involves quickly inserting random chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other, they will need to do it 10,000 times to achieve similar results to the riffle shuffle . RIFFLE METHOD . Technique: Cutting a pack of cards in half and quickly shuffling them into each other. Efficiency: A dealer needs to repeat the process seven times to ransomise the pack and this can be done in less than 30 seconds. OVERHAND METHOD . Technique: Quickly inserting chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other. Efficiency: A dealer needs to do this 10,000 times to achieve similar results. SMOOSHING METHOD . Technique: Randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again. Efficiency: One minute of smooshing guarantees a random pack of cards. SIMPLE METHOD . What: Taking one card from the top of a deck and inserting it at random. Efficiency: It takes 200 or so 'pokes' to randomise a deck, making progress slow. The method, which is also known as wash, corgi and chemmy, involves randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again. It is used in professional poker tournaments. The method looks random and is – if it is done for a long enough period time. ‘If you smoosh for a minute it passes every test we've ever thrown at it. ‘If you smoosh for 30 seconds, it seems ok, but less than that it starts failing tests and someone could make money against you or guess cards,' Dr Diaconis said. This means that while the method is thorough, if done for a minute, it too is slower than the riffle method. A technique called smooshing (pictured) also known as wash, corgi and chemmy, involves randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again. It needs to be done for around one minute for the cards to be truly random and difficult to guess . Dr Diaconis explained in the video how mathematicians check that shuffling is random. He said that there are a staggering 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000 configurations in a perfectly random deck. ‘It's more than the number of particles in the universe,’ he said. One way of defining randomness is that all card configurations should be equally likely. He said that if a deck of cards is perfectly shuffled, you may expect to guess between four and five cards correctly as they are pulled out one by one from a pack. But if they are not shuffled enough – for example, if a pack is riffle shuffled four times instead of seven - people might guess nine or ten cards correctly. In the simplest form of shuffling, where a person takes one card from the top of a deck and inserts it at random, it would take ‘200 or so pokes’ before the deck is random.","A Stanford University mathematician compared  shuffling techniques .

"A former Utah teacher has been ordered to stand trial after a student -- one of three alleged victims of her sexual abuse -- testified that he had sex with her, even after her arrest. Brianne Altice, 35, who taught English at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah, is accused of 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor. The Layton, Utah, student, now 18, testified at a hearing Thursday that he had sex with Altice before and after she was arrested in October 2013 for having a sexual relationship with another student, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Multiple counts: One of the three victims Brianne Altice is accused of assaulting was forced to testify Monday and begrudgingly revealed he'd had sex with Altice after her arrest on charges she's assaulted another boy. A judge ruled Monday the former English teacher will stand trial separately for each alleged sexual relationship . Teen also testified that he considered her to be his girlfriend during a yearlong relationship involving sexual intercourse and oral sex. Altice also sent the boy a text message with a photograph of her breasts in June 2014, authorities said. After hearing testimony from the teen and several other witnesses, Judge John Morris in 2nd District Court found probable cause for Altice to stand trial. And prosecutors argued she should remain behind bars as she awaited that trial. 'It is a simple argument,' Deputy Davis County Attorney Susan Hunt said. 'While the defendant was on pretrial release, this defendant continued to engage in sexual misconduct with a 17-year-old boy . Her willingness to continue to commit felony sexual offenses while on bail causes great concern that this defendant will continue and be a danger to the community.' Her own attorney argued she was no danger because of the alleged victim's age, reports the Tribune. 'She doesn't present a danger to anyone,' attorney Edward Brass said. 'That young man is an adult. In the end, the judge ordered Altice to stay jailed. Bail had been revoked after allegations she had sex with the third victim following her arrest. The judge also decided, this time in favor of the defense, that Altice would be tried separately in each student's case--meaning she'll get three different trials. Will stand trial: Brianne Altice, 35, who taught English at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah, is accused of 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor . Shocking: Prosecutors say Altice had sex with three different students while teaching English at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah. They say she continued her sexual relationship with one of them even after her arrest for another . The defense had argued that bundling the cases, as the prosecution want to do, would have be prejudicial to Altice's case, Fox 13 Salt Lake City reports. The teen on the stand said he was 'unhappy' to be required to testify against Altice. He said their relationship halted after he was arrested for witness tampering and retaliation against a witness in the case. 'It's ridiculous,' he said. 'She doesn't deserve to be here.' Altice was arrested in December 2013 after a boy, 16, told police he had several sexual encounters with her. In October, another teen said he had also had sexual intercourse with her after they began kissing between class periods. Altice, who faces up to life in prison if convicted, was fired from her teaching job last year. Altice's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. 'It is her defense that they did not happen at all,' he wrote in a motion. 'That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students.' But prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with the 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. Bond revoked: Altice has been held without bond since allegations emerged earlier this year that she'd continued the sexual relationship after her arrest .","Brianne Altice, 35, who taught English at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah, is accused of 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse .

"A Seattle baby can be seen running around the city, perching atop buildings and performing some impressive stunts in a clever photo series created by his doting father. Seattle-based photographer Brandon Hill conceives and executes the images of his one-year-old son Maddex's acrobatic adventures, with the help of a little Photoshop, as a part of his ongoing picture series Madd Stunts. 'This series is all about him blending in with the city, having fun at local tourist spots, and doing stunts,' Mr Hill told the Huffington Post of the pictures, which capture his adorable son flying behind a speeding moped and hanging from trees. New skill: One-year-old Maddex can be seen walking across the length of his crib in this photo taken by his photographer father Brandon Hill as a part of his picture series Madd Stunts . Over the edge: With the help of a little Photoshop, Mr Hill made it look as though Maddex was perched on top of his play chair . The photographer explained that all of photos in the series were taken in Seattle, a city he said that he will always 'cherish' because it is where he and his wife had their son. Maddex can be seen getting into precarious situations at Pike Market, Kerry Park and Seattle's famous gum wall among other locations and neighborhoods across the city. He has been photographed doing a handstand on the kitchen counter, tight-rope walking on the ledge of his crib and stuck to a wall littered with gum. Mr Hill has been working on the project, which celebrated his son's childhood, for several months. Held up: Maddex blew a bubble as he hung from Seattle's famous gum wall . Daredevil: The adorable baby was also photographed holding on to a speeding moped . When he first started, Maddex was unable to walk and had to be probbed up by Mr Hill's assistant, who would later be edited out of the image. Mr Hill told Feature Shoot that when Maddex became nine months old he started 'sharing playful expressions while remaining quiet and still' during the playful photoshoots. And the pictures are so good that at least one person thinks that they are actual depictions of Maddex's amazing feats. After Mr Hill shared a photo of Maddex 'balanced' on top of his baby chair on his Instagram page, one concerned commenter wrote: 'Is [that] baby really standing like that? Because that is idiot parenting.' Sheer strength: Maddex used one hand to hang from a tree in the park . Budding gymnast: Maddex used upper body strength to do a handstand on the kitchen counter . Mr Hill jokingly replied: 'Yep, cause he's amazing.' But the exchange didn't stop there. When the commenter noted that Maddex's balancing act was 'extremely dangerous', Mr Hill let her in on his secret. 'Photoshop: endangering children everywhere,' he wrote. Admiring the view: He happily hung out on the roof of Seattle's Public Market .

"An FBI agent who was supposed to be upholding the law was busted on 64 counts in a drug tampering case after he stole heroin from investigations and overdosed in an unmarked police car. Matthew Lowry, 33, a heroin-addicted former special agent in the Washington field office tampered with hundreds of grams of heroin seized during drug investigations in 2013 and 2014. He was investigated by the  Department of Justice after  he was found slumped over and unconscious  in his unmarked FBI vehicle from a heroin overdose on September 29. Car: Matthew Lowry, formerly a special agent with the agency's Washington field office was investigated after he was found unconscious in his unmarked FBI vehicle, pictured, on September 29 after overdosing on heroin . Heroin: Bags of heroin, pictured, were recovered from the FBI agent's vehicle where he kept drugs in his car for weeks or months, and used it periodically . According to authorities, Lowry, a married father of one, allegedly took drugs that had been processed as evidence, removed heroin from evidence bags, and then added a cutting agent to account for the missing weight. He used a dietary supplement or a laxative as the cutting agents. Lowry then kept the bags of heroin in his car for weeks or months, and used it periodically, according to charging documents filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., on Friday. His crimes were fueled by an addiction to prescription painkillers, but his dishonesty botched dozens of cases involving suspected drug traffickers in multiple states. In one case, charges were dropped against 14 defendants suspected to be involved with a large-scale drug-trafficking organization that was the subject of a major FBI investigation in California. The investigation included court-ordered wiretaps, physical surveillance and numerous controlled drug buys, time-consuming and costly investigative techniques. Theft: Documents revealed that Lowry took heroin he got during controlled buys as part of FBI investigations . Attorney: Robert Bonsib said Lowry will plead guilty to 64 charges of obstruction of justice, heroin possession and conversion of property. He could face at least seven years in prison . Additionally, his actions caused federal prosecutors to dismiss charges against at least 28 defendants in drug cases. They also had to notify 150 more that Lowry had participated in investigations targeting them. Attorney Robert Bonsib said Lowry will plead guilty to 64 charges of obstruction of justice, heroin possession and conversion of property. He could face at least seven years in prison. Meanwhile, documents revealed that the former FBI agent took heroin he got during controlled buys as part of FBI investigations. Evidence: Lowry removed small amounts of heroin from evidence packages to self-medicate his health issue known as ulcerative colitis . Bonsib said in each of 20 incidents involving evidence tampering, Lowry removed small amounts of heroin from evidence packages to self-medicate his health issue known as ulcerative colitis. One of Lowry's doctors had prescribed him powerful pain medications without warning him of how addictive they were, Bonsib said. When his doctor left the practice without notice, Lowry tried to kick the addiction but it was 'overpowering' and the pain from his medical condition was 'unbearable.' Bonsib added: 'Mr Lowry recognizes the importance of taking full responsibility for each of his acts and he also recognizes the need to account to the public for his misconduct.' 'He is devastated by the consequences of his conduct, particularly as it has affected the drug investigations that he, his fellow law enforcement officers, and prosecutors had spent so much time developing and pursing.' 'The fact that his conduct has damaged the ability of some of those investigations to be successfully prosecuted is contrary to everything he trained himself for and believes in,' he said. Bonsib described the night Lowry was found unconscious in his car as a 'turning point.' He immediately  met with prosecutors and investigators to help investigate his conduct. He also sought treatment for his addiction. The case is being prosecuted by federal attorneys in Pennsylvania. Lowry wanted to be a law enforcement officer to follow in the footsteps of his father,  a narcotics investigator for Prince George's Police and assistant chief of Anne Arundel County Police.","Matthew Lowry, 33, a former special agent tampered with FBI drugs cases .

"An obesity expert says mocking the overweight 'should be illegal'. Stock photo . Poking fun at fat people should be treated as seriously as racism and sexism, researchers have said. Obesity expert Dr Sarah Jackson said that the law should protect against weight discrimination, in the same way at it prohibits singling out people based on their age, gender or race. Dr Jackson, of University College London, spoke out after conducting two studies into the physical and psychological effects of fattism. Her latest study, of more than 5,000 British adults found that those who were made to feel ashamed of their size suffered more symptoms of depression. They also had a lower quality of life than those who didn’t feel victimised. Examples of fattism included being treated disrespectfully, including being the butt of jokes, receiving poorer services in shops, restaurants, hospitals and doctors’ surgeries, being threatened and being assumed to be stupid. She previously showed shaming fat people into losing weight is counterproductive. Far from shocking people into slimming, it actually leads to them piling on the pounds. It is thought fattism drives those who are already sensitive about their weight to comfort eat. Fear of ridicule may also mean they avoid exercise. With two-thirds of British women overweight or obese, jibes, taunts and simple thoughtlessness could be having a huge effect on the nation’s mental and psychological health. Dr Sarah Jackson, the lead author of both studies, said that people may believe that weight discrimination is socially acceptable because unlike ageism, sexism and racism, it is not covered by law. She said: ‘In the United Kingdom, the Equality Act 2010 legally protects individuals from discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, disability, religion or beliefs, sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy, or gender reassignment; making it clear that discriminatory behaviour of this nature is not to be accepted. ‘However, our results indicate that discriminatory experiences contribute to poorer psychological wellbeing in individuals with obesity, but there are currently no laws prohibiting weight discrimination. ‘This might send the message to people that weight discrimination is socially acceptable. Dr Sarah Jackson said that the law should protect against weight discrimination, in the same way at it prohibits singling out people based on their age, gender or race. Stock photo . ‘If weight was a protected category it might help to reduce the prevalence of weight-related discrimination and thereby improve quality of life and wellbeing for a significant proportion of obese individuals.’ Researcher Professor Jane Wardle said: ‘Combined with our previous work showing that weight discrimination does not encourage weight loss, we can see that weight discrimination is part of the obesity problem and not the solution. ‘Weight bias has been documented not only among the general public but also among health professionals; and many obese patients report being treated disrespectfully by doctors because of their weight. ‘Everyone, including doctors, should stop blaming and shaming people for their weight, and offer support, and where appropriate, treatment.’","Dr Sarah Jackson says law should protect against weight discrimination .

"Sickening pictures and videos have emerged that claim to show Iraqi soldiers torturing and beheading Islamic State prisoners in apparent revenge attacks. The images have been posted on social media in recent days reportedly by U.S.-trained Iraqi Special Forces who are advancing against jihadi strongholds. One Instagram account under the name of Iraqi_lion18 contains numerous pictures of severed heads and mutilated bodies. The account holder vowed 'revenge' for the massacre by ISIS of hundreds of military cadets at a base near Tikrit called Camp Speicher in June. Brutality: This picture posted on social media claims to show an Islamic State prisoner being thrown to his death from a tower by Iraqi soldiers who are advancing on the terror group's strongholds in Iraq . Savage: Men believed to be Iraqi Special Operations Forces from the 'Golden Brigades' surround an  ISIS suspect who has been pulled by a rope . Horrific: A soldier stands on two severed heads in what is being reported as a revenge attack on ISIS fighters . The horrific cache of images, uncovered by ABC News, emerged after Shi'ite militia leaders fighting with Iraqi troops said the current offensive on Saddam Hussein's hometown would be a chance to avenge their deaths. Other accounts show a man with his hands bound being thrown out of a tower and men believed to be Iraqi Special Operations Forces from the 'Golden Brigades' surrounding an alleged ISIS suspect who has been pulled by a rope. MailOnline has not been able to independently verify the origin of the images or establish when they were taken. But they have been shown to senior military figures, human rights experts and politicians who called them evidence of Iraqi 'war crimes.' Retired U.S. Army Special Forces Lt Col James Gavrilis also told ABC News that the images 'did not look like believe  ISIS propaganda at all'. Allegations: Images like this have been shown to senior military figures, human rights experts and politicians who called them evidence of Iraqi 'war crimes'. An investigation has been launched by the Iraqi military . Ex-US Army Special Forces Lt Col James Gavrilis said he did not believe the images were ISIS propaganda . U.S.officials confirmed yesterday that Washington was withholding funding from some Iraqi units 'on the basis of credible information in the past' of atrocities. After being shown the images, Iraqi Army spokesperson, General Saad Maan, said an investigation would be launched, adding: 'We don't have anything to hide.' It came as a prominent Iraqi Sunni preacher today urged authorities to prevent Shi'ite militias fighting alongside government forces against ISIS in Tikrit from carrying out revenge attacks. In his appeal, Sheik Abdel Sattar Abdul Jabbar cited reports of Shi'ite militiamen burning Sunni homes in the battle to win back Tikrit from Islamic State hands. Abdul Jabbar said that if the government failed to stop revenge attacks, the country would face reignited sectarian tensions - such as the ones witnessed at the height of the war in 2006 and 2007. Gunned down: A man believed to be an ISIS militant is shot  after reportedly being captured by Iraqi forces . 'We ask that actions follow words to punish those who are attacking houses in Tikrit,' Abdul Jabbar said during his Friday sermon in Baghdad. 'We are sorry about those acting in revenge that might ignite tribal anger and add to our sectarian problems.' Iraqi forces entered Tikrit for the first time on Wednesday from the north and south. On Friday, they fought fierce battles to secure the northern Tikrit neighborhood of Qadisiyya and lobbed mortars and rockets into the city center, still in the hands of ISIS. Iraqi military officials have said they expect to reach the centre of Tikrit within two to three days. Condemned: A man is pictured being dragged along by what appears to be a military vehicle . 'Tortured': U.S.officials confirmed yesterday that Washington was withholding funding from some Iraqi units 'on the basis of credible information in the past' of atrocities . Meanwhile, Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric called on the government to step up support for Shiite militias battling ISIS alongside Iraqi troops and to take care of fallen militiamen's families. 'The government should provide care for those who are defending the country with their blood and pay attention to the families of the martyrs, those families have lost their dear one and sons,' Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said. His remarks were relayed by his spokesman Ahmed al-Safi in the Shi'ite holy city of Karbala. 'The excuses given for the delays in paying the salaries of the fighters are unacceptable.' The Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias have played a crucial role in regaining territory from the Islamic State group, supporting Iraq's embattled military and police forces in battle. Mourners carry the coffin of a Shi'ite fighter who was killed in clashes with Islamic State militants in Tikrit . Struck down: A Shi'ite fighter injured during clashes with Islamic State militants in northern Tikrit . U.S. General Martin Dempsey said Wednesday that as many as 20,000 militiamen may be involved in the ongoing Tikrit operations. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi last week called on his forces to protect civilians and their property in areas reclaimed from ISIS, vowing zero tolerance for any violations. He also called upon Sunnis who may have welcomed the initial onslaught by the Islamic State or even took up arms on the side of the militants. 'I call upon those who have been misled or committed a mistake to lay down arms and join their people and security forces in order to liberate their cities,' al-Abadi said. Amnesty International cautioned it was still too early to tell if Tikrit had been a cleaner operation than usual. 'For now access to combat areas is restricted and information about abuses may take time to filter out,' the rights group's senior crisis response adviser Donatella Rovera told AFP.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"No one expects to unearth histories of love while looking for a rice cooker. But for one couple, this helped them discover that their relationship started much earlier than they previously thought. Through finding a preschool class photograph, the couple realized they had actually met 16 years previously, when they were three years old. While at his girlfriend's house, believed to be in the U.S., Reddit user Evanaka1234 came across an old school photo of her and recognized her immediately, claiming that she looked like an 'imp'. Reddit user Evanaka found this preschool class photo in his girlfriend's house while trying to find a rice cooker . He recognized his girlfriend immediately, but then realized the boy next to her looked familiar as well. He then discovered that the boy next to his girlfriend was him and that the couple had unknowingly gone to preschool together . But as he stared at the photo he realized the blond boy next to his girlfriend, who has not been named, looked familiar. Then it hit him: The little boy next to his girlfriend was him. He couldn't believe it, so he called his mom, who confirmed the name of his preschool, which was in fact the school his girlfriend went to, even though neither of them remember it. Evanaka1234 posted the picture on Reddit, sharing his story with the world. Sixteen years later the couple are together again, except as a couple rather than classmates. It is unknown how long the couple has been dating. Daily Mail Online tried to reach out to Evanaka1234, but did not get a response.

"Loss: Corrine Gump, 10, and her grandparents were killed in an early morning fire on Monday . A 10-year-old alleged rape victim and her grandparents have died in a massive fire at their home just hours before her suspected attacker was set to go on trial. Corrine Gump and her maternal grandparents, Judith Schmidt, 61, and William Schmidt, 63, who were both deaf, lost their lives in the early-morning blaze in Youngstown, Ohio on Monday. Neighbors reported hearing loud explosions at 3.30am before the fire tore through the house. Later that day, Robert Seman, Jr., 46, was set to stand trial on four counts of rape and four counts of gross sexual imposition. Seman, himself a father to a two-year-old child, had been accused of abusing Corrine from when she was just four years old until she was eight, WFMJ reported, citing an indictment from a year ago. Since April last year, he had been under electronically-monitored house arrest but on Monday his bond was revoked because he allegedly tried to bribe a witness in the rape case, WFMJ reported. Authorities said he had not been taken back into custody because of the fire. Investigators said they have found no evidence that the origin of the blaze was suspicious. But because Corinne was an alleged victim, the Youngstown Police are involved in the investigation, Sergeant Ron Barber told WKYC. Scroll down for video . Accused: It came just hours before Robert Seman, Jr., 46, (pictured) was set to go on trial for charges that he had sexually assaulted her. He was under house arrest and electronic monitoring at the time of the fire . Authorities looking to interview the girl's mother on Monday said that they found her at a house listed in court records as Seman’s house arrest address, WKBN reported. When they had checked for her there earlier that morning, she had not be in, they said. Neighbors told 21 News that they heard two explosions and one neighbor said she awoke to what she thought was a flickering light outside. 'It was fully involved,' Fire Chief John O'Neill told The Youngstown Vindicator. 'We had quite a bit of fire in the basement, so that's the likely origin. They had fire all through the house, top to bottom. The floors were giving way almost immediately upon entry.' The three bodies were found on the second floor. It is not yet clear if they had smoke detectors in the home. Smoke detectors for the hearing-impaired can send vibrations, sound or light to alert residents. Steve Leland, director of Easter Seals Youngstown Hearing and Speech Center Community Center, told the Vindicator that the local deaf community is mourning the loss of the couple. Battle: Firefighters pulled the three bodies from the second floor of the home on Monday morning . Destruction: Fire officers said the blaze quickly ripped through the home from bottom to top. But they said there was no evidence that the cause of the fire was suspicious . Questions: Fire Captain Kurt Wright and a State Fire Marshall look into the back of the house on Monday as an investigation continues into the cause of the fire. Neighbors reported hearing explosions . 'Bill and Judy were always willing to talk to parents who'd just found out they had a deaf child,' he said. 'They would often discuss options for raising a deaf child, talking about their own personal life experiences, being deaf themselves, and raising deaf children.' The couple had three children, two of whom are deaf. William Schmidt was a retired AT&T lineman, while his wife taught deaf people sign language, the publication reported. 'They were very outgoing, very sweet people, always ready to help,' Leland added. Corrine was a 4th grade student at South Range School, where officials have assembled a crisis team to counsel students and staff affected by the tragedy. Seman's trial has been delayed in light of the deaths but no new date has yet been set. He could face life in prison if convicted of the charges.

She was also seen playing on her phone while lounging on a sunbed (left), before posing for another selfie (right) for her ever-expanding collection . The Labour councillor, who is due to stand down in May, is also seen emerging wet-haired from the swimming pool before casually strolling along the poolside. The photographs were taken while on a four-day holiday in Costa Blanca with a female friend. They come weeks after she alleged that she had been repeatedly raped as a child. A source told The Sun that Ms Danczuk had gone on the holiday to clear her head while the police investigation into her claims is ongoing. She was said to have read a lot of books and enjoyed some nice food during the break - while also spending time adding to her ever-expanding gallery of selfies. The source said: 'Everything had become a bit much for her and she's decided to go away for a few days and just get out of the country. It was just what Karen needed.' Last month, Ms Danczuk claimed in a newspaper interview that she had been raped hundreds of times between the ages of six and 12. The photographs were taken poolside while on a four-day holiday in Costa Blanca with a female friend . Ms Danczuk recently told how her selfies - many of which offer up an eye-watering view of her ample cleavage - were rooted in the abuse she allegedly suffered as a child . A source told how she went on the holiday - where she read a lot of books and enjoyed some nice food - to clear her head during the police investigation . The mother-of-two shot to fame last year after posting dozens of risque pictures to her 47,000 followers on Twitter. She has seen been pictured several times making the most of subsequent photo opportunities . She told how her selfies were rooted in the abuse she suffered as a child and are a defiant way of reclaiming control over her alleged attacker. ‘They are my way of saying I am no longer ashamed, I’m saying, “To hell with you and to hell with what happened, I am sexy and good looking but you can’t have me. I’m in control now""', she said. A 36-year-old man was later arrested by Greater Manchester Police. He has vehemently denied the claims.

Her public profile has grown steadily ever since with the images helping to propel her to the position of one of the most famous women in public life. She has recently enlisted the help of Borne Media, an agency made up of a number of executives from Max Clifford’s former PR agency, including his daughter Louise, to look after her public image. Meanwhile, Ms Danczuk's wife Simon, Labour MP for Rochdale since 2010, has this week been speaking out about an investigation into an alleged police cover-up over child abuse claims involving high-profile figures. He is a vociferous campaigner against child abuse and those who cover up such crimes.","Karen Danczuk, 31, put tough month behind her with friend in Costa Blanca .

"A Chinese furniture shopping mall which invited the public to release butterflies back to nature has seen the event ended up in a complete opposite direction – hundreds of colourful creatures were stamped to death by onlookers who hoped to capture them. The mall held the ceremony at a park in Chengdu, regional capital of Sichuan Province in central China. More than 10 boxes of butterflies were flown to Chengdu on the same day from Yunnan in southern China. Organisers said they have rescued the injured butterflies and will take good care of them. Tragedy: Hundreds of butterflies were stamped to death during an  event to release them back into the wild . Set free: 10 families were selected from thousands of in the crowd to release the butterflies from shoe boxes . Keen participants: The butterflies were transported in the cardboard boxes from Yunnan Province on the same day. As soon as they were let into the air, crowd started chasing and trying to capture them . The ceremony, named 'Freeing of Butterflies', attracted thousands of Chengdu citizens who eagerly awaited the release of the insects. Ten families were selected from thousands in the crowd to release the butterflies into the air. However, after the butterflies were released, many of them settled on the large stage. This resulted in excited onlookers and their children chasing and trying to capture the butterflies with many people treading on them without realising. Eventually there were shouted warnings that the butterflies were being trampled underfoot, but it came too late for hundreds of squashed creatures. Picture time: Some participants were so busy taking photos that they didn't realise many butterflies had been stamped to death on the ground . Organisers said some butterflies failed to take off properly because they had just arrived from tropical Yunnan where the temperature was higher than Chengdu and so they were slightly sleepy. Event staff picked up as many of the grounded insects as they could and put them back into their boxes to be returned to a sanctuary. A similar incident happened last autumn in Xinxiang in central China. Thousands of butterflies were crushed or injured when they were released back to the wild during a commercial event. Aftermath: Although some butterflies were set free successfully, many were killed in this event. Organisers said they have rescued as many as possible and would looked after them well .","More than 10 boxes of butterflies were flown to Chengdu for the event .

"The UK's only female giant panda Tian Tian has been artificially inseminated for a third time after two previous failed attempts. The procedure took place earlier today, before an attempt is made at natural mating with partner Yang Guang later, Edinburgh Zoo said. On the two previous occasions keepers have inseminated Tian Tian she has failed to produce a panda cub. Scroll down for video . Tian Tian in her enclosure: She was artificially inseminated today with an attempt at natural mating to follow . Tian Tian the panda in her enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo: On the two previous occasions keepers have inseminated her she has failed to produce a panda cub . Semen from Yang Guang was used in the procedure carried out by a team of three vets at the zoo, alongside a panda expert from China. Iain Valentine from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which runs Edinburgh Zoo, said: 'Natural mating will also be attempted today before the short breeding window comes to a close this afternoon. 'Both pandas remain extremely interested in one another, but as Tian Tian's transition to peak was so rapid it was a priority to move straight to artificial insemination first. 'Throughout yesterday Tian Tian remained very quiet and sleepy, but by 5pm there was a behavioural shift and the results of hormone tests that came back at 7pm, carried out by the University of Edinburgh, confirmed ovulation had occurred. 'As each individual panda is different and their pattern can vary from year to year, this is why we start hormone monitoring via urine samples so early and continually observe our female via CCTV as the window approaches. 'Tian Tian is doing very well and everything went according to plan.' Panda reproduction is a notoriously tricky process, with females only ovulating once a year.The gestation period is typically five months and one or two cubs are usually born . Tian Tian stretches after eating her panda cake in her enclosure: Both pandas are said to be extremely interested in one another . The panda enclosure will remain closed until Sunday. Tian Tian (Sweetie) and Yang Guang (Sunshine) are the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years. The animals arrived on loan from China in December 2011 and will remain at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade. There were hopes that a panda cub would be born last year when Tian Tian became pregnant following insemination. Yang Guang feeds on bamboo as he bulks up for the breeding season: Each individual panda is different and their pattern can vary from year to year which is why producing a cub can be so difficult . Yang Guang stands up as he looks into the enclosure of  Tian Tian.

"A disabled woman has been stuck in her armchair for three years because she can't climb the stairs and her wheelchair won't get through the front door. Sally Walker, 50, lives, sleeps and eats in the seat at her home in Southampton, Hampshire, and relies on photographs taken by her family to see what the outside world looks like. The mother-of-two suffers from chronic lymphoedema - an abnormal collection of high-protein fluid just beneath the skin, usually in the arm or leg - which she was diagnosed with at the age of 25. Scroll down for video . Sally Walker, pictured with her husband, Stephen, 51, who is her full-time carer. She is confined to her armchair after being diagnosed with chronic lymphoedema - an abnormal collection of high-protein fluid . Before then she lived an active life, going to the beach and regularly seeing friends, but the crippling condition has left her confined to her living room. Her two-bedroom council home doesn't have a ramp and is too small for her wheelchair - and the last time she went upstairs was seven years ago. She said: 'I just want to give up. I have had enough because I'm thinking what's next because there is nothing. What is the point? I am just existing, not living. 'I've been depressed for years but this has tipped me over the edge. I'm 50 years of age and I am trapped. I have no privacy and no life. 'I'm frightened of dying here in the chair. This is it. This is my life. All I see is these four walls.' Mrs Walker, who lives with her carer husband Stephen, 51, and her sons aged 30 and 28, spends her days on Facebook, reading, watching TV, talking to friends and petting her dog Chalkie. She said: 'I just dream of being able to get out. When I do have to go to the hospital when I get outside in their chair or bed and the fresh air or sun hits me and I think ""oh my God, what's that?"" It's really weird. 'I have to ask the carers what it is like outside and my family show me photos of the garden.' Sally and Stephen on their wedding day in July 1983, left, and the couple pictured together three years ago on the last time she left the house to go to her auntie's anniversary party . Sally Walker with her husband Stephen and their two children. She developed the condition after the birth of her first child . 'I was never in before. I would find any excuse to go out, even if it was just to go round Steve's mum's house. 'We spent Christmas down the beach with the dog, we used go on holiday.' Following the birth of her first son, she began suffering symptoms and was diagnosed with the condition. She said: 'I had a GP come out to me and he said he'd been a GP for over 40 years and he'd never come across a case so bad in his life. 'He thought I'd been in the tropics because my case was so bad. But it just gets worse and worse.' Mrs Walker also has weeping blisters on her legs and is in 'agonising' pain with lumps in her stomach and legs. The 50-year-old lives, sleeps and eats in the seat and her mobility is so bad she can't even go up the stairs in her two-bedroom council home . The council adapted a shower upstairs but she cannot get there so instead she has to be washed using a bowl and flannels in her armchair. There is also a toilet which has been fitted next to the living room but plumbing problems mean she is forced to use a commode. The couple say they have spoken to their housing officer about their accessibility issues and were told there were bungalows but they are not available and they have no idea of the waiting time. Last year eight paramedics spent three hours helping Mrs Walker after she fell at her home. The pair, who have been married for 32 years, claim the council would not re-house them because they have made adaptations to their home even though they are no longer suitable. The Walkers are supporting a campaign run by the Leonard Cheshire Disability Charity which believes unsuitable and dangerous housing causes problems like depression and accidents, which end up costing the taxpayer much more than if the homes were better designed in the first place. Clare Pelham, chief executive for Leonard Cheshire Disability's, said: 'For many of us, our homes are a haven - places where we look forward to relaxing with our friends and family. 'For many thousands of disabled and older people, their homes are a danger to their health and wellbeing. 'It is shocking that GPs are spending precious time on injuries and illnesses directly related to inaccessible homes at a time when there's overwhelming pressure on our health care system. 'And yet it would cost absolutely nothing for the Government to require all new homes to be built to accessible standards. The house in Southampton where Sally Walker has been confined to her armchair for the last three years . 'With our ageing population and an increase in the number of disabled people, these homes are needed now. 'We literally cannot afford to wait while disabled and older people are suffering.' Southampton City Council were unavailable for comment. Lymphoedema is a chronic condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues. It can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs. Other symptoms of lymphoedema can include an aching, heavy feeling in affected body parts and difficulty moving them. Lymphoedema comes in two forms - primary and secondary. Primary lymphoedema is caused by faulty genes, and develops at birth or shortly after puberty. It's fairly rare and affects one in every 10,000 people. Secondary lymphoedema is more widespread and is caused when an infection, injury, trauma or cancer damages the lymphatic system. It's estimated that 100,000 people in the UK have secondary lymphoedema. There is no cure for lymphoedema, but it is usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system. These include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques. The build-up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection. In particular, a bacterial infection of the skin called cellulitis is commonly reported in people with the condition.

"The husband of a critically ill grandmother who died after being plunged into the icy North Sea during a bungled cruise ship rescue has hit out at the justice system after he was paid less than £13,000 compensation. Janet Richardson, 72, was tipped into the water wearing just her nightdress as crew members tried to transfer her to a lifeboat on a stretcher during the rescue. Passengers shrieked in horror as the pensioner fought to stay afloat for up to eight minutes without a life jacket as crew tried to save her from the icy 2C waters. Janet Richardson, 72, (picture left with husband George) died three weeks after being accidentally tipped into icy water as crew members onboard a cruise ship tried to transfer her to a lifeboat after she was taken ill . Passengers shrieked in horror as the pensioner fought to stay afloat for eight minutes without a life jacket . She was eventually pulled to safety using a long pole but died in hospital three weeks later from complications. Now widower George, 82, has condemned the justice system after he was paid just £12,980 plus £7,000 other payments for the tragedy. And he says he has never received an apology from the cruise operators for the catastophe which was a ‘significant contributory factor' in the death of his wife. Mr Richardson, a retired farmer, said: ‘It’s a disgrace I have never received any apology. 'The whole so-called rescue was a fiasco. 'They should never have used a lifeboat in those conditions, instead they should have used a helicopter, even experts agree. ‘And then not to tether the boats together in those seas was simply ridiculous. I just can’t believe they didn’t take simple precautions.’ Mrs Richardson (pictured in water) was eventually pulled to safety  but died in hospital three weeks later . Mr Richardson, of Penrith, who was married to Janet for 30 years, said: ‘I received less than £20,000 in total because my wife had pre-existing health problems but the trauma of being plunged into icy water definitely hastened her death. ‘Justice has not been served. The penalty for those that did this is tiny compared to the nightmare I have suffered.’ Mrs Richardson and her husband had been on a cruise to see the Northern Lights on board Ocean Countess when she suffered a gastro-intestinal haemorrhage in March 2011. The liner was off the coast of Norway and the captain decided she was so ill she would need to be transferred to a hospital immediately. Crew members strapped her to a stretcher with a blanket and tried to pass her to a team on a lifeboat which had pulled up beside the ship. But the two boats, which were travelling side-by-side at 10 knots, were not tethered together and began to move apart at the crucial moment, plunging Mrs Richardson into the sea. One witness, Colin Prescott, told a later inquest: ‘I saw the stretcher hit the side of the vessel. Mrs Richardson went one way and the stretcher went the other.’ Mrs Richardson was treated in Norway before being airlifted back to the UK. Her husband kept a bedside vigil until her death on April 21. Mrs Richardson was being moved from the cruise ship to a rescue boat on a stretcher when she was dropped . Because Mrs Richardson suffered from cirrhosis of the liver, high blood pressure and was an insulin-dependent diabetic prior to the cruise and because she later died of natural causes the compensation payment was restricted. The grandmother of eight was 18st and had a history of ill-health but her inquest heard that fighting for her life in freezing temperatures may have significantly contributed to her death. The Ocean Countess was owned by Cruise and Maritime Voyages (CMV) at the time but caught fire near Greece in 2013 and has since been sold for scrap. Joanne Berry, solicitor at Slater and Gordon, said Mr Richardson had received the maximum bereavement damages of £12,980 plus added payments. She said: ‘The current law is not fair to families and we fully support a national campaign to review the level of bereavement damages for families in these situations.’ Chris Coates of CMV said a full and final settlement was offered to Mr Richardson by the ship’s owners and insurer’s for the Norwegian Search and Rescue Service. He said: ‘The company maintained close contact with Mr Richardson following the incident conveying our sympathies and offering support.’","Janet Richardson, 72, died after being accidentally tipped into the sea .

"Connecticut's Democratic governor says he will ban state-funded travel to Indiana over a controversial religious freedom law. 'I found it disturbing, disgraceful and outright discriminatory,' the state's chief executive, Dannel Malloy, said during a news conference on an unrelated issue. 'It hearkens back to a time when states were allowed to pass laws that treated their citizens differently. It's our shared past where discrimination was codified into our laws.' Connecticut will become the first state to bar travel to Indiana since its governor signed the religious freedom law last Thursday. Seattle, Washington, and San Francisco, California, have sent out similar orders, however. The bill, signed into law by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has the effect of giving individuals legal cover to refuse a customer's business if it would violate a religious belief to fulfill the request. Civil rights groups are characterizing the law as discriminatory, particularly against LGBT persons, and Republican lawmakers in the state today said they'd be open to clarifying the bill's intent through legislative changes. Demonstrators gather at the Indiana State Capitol on Saturday to protest a controversial religious freedom bill recently signed by Governor Mike Pence. More than 2,000 people attended the Indianapolis rally. Critics say it would promote discrimination against individuals based on sexual orientation . DUELING GOVERNORS: Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, left, a Democrat, said today that he would bar state-funded travel to Indiana in light of the new law, signed by into existence last Thursday by that state's chief executive, Mike Pence, a Republican . The details of Connecticut's retaliatory measure are not yet known. Malloy said Monday morning on Twitter that because of the law, 'later today I will sign an executive order regarding state-funded travel.' 'When new laws turn back the clock on progress, we can’t sit idly by. We are sending a message that discrimination won’t be tolerated,' he said in a follow up tweet. At a press conference later that day, Malloy said his state 'led the way to end discrimination and we should continue to be a leader in speaking out against discrimination across the entirety of the nation.' 'No state should use religious grounds to be the basis for discrimination in our country,' Malloy said, according to NBC Connecticut. 'Let me point out that it is a sad fact that in our history religion was used as a basis to support treating black and white individuals differently as well, and I won't allow any of our citizens in Connecticut to face discrimination in other states, at least without a fight.' More than 2,000 demonstrators showed up outside the Indiana State Capitol on Saturday to protest the new measure passed by the Republican-controlled General Assembly that Indiana says is meant to give its residents a platform to bring religious freedom suits against the government. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act states that 'a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability' unless the government has a 'compelling' interest to do so and interference is the 'least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.' The Indiana law now under a microscope says that 'a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion.' The only exception to that rule is if the government can show it has a 'compelling' interest to interfere and it did so through 'the least restrictive means.' A party that prevails over the government in court can now ask for 'compensatory damages' and may be awarded 'all or part of the costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.' Civil rights activists argue that the law is overly broad because it can be interpreted to apply not only to individuals acting in their personal capacity, but also to businesses. Furthermore, it goes beyond protecting Indiana residents' interests from intrusion by the state - it gives them legal cover from threats to their religious freedom from private entities, as well. Critics of the legislation claim it legally allows businesses to refuse the business of gay couples. A commonly cited example is that of a bakery that declines to take on the order for a wedding cake of a same-sex couple, citing religious grounds. Gay rights activists say such discriminatory behavior would not be allowed under Indiana law as a result of the religious freedom bill. A similar bill could soon become law in Arkansas. That state's bill, having already received the go ahead from the House, passed the Senate on Friday and now heads to recently elected Governor Asa Hutchinson's desk. Arkansas's legislation stats that 'governments should not substantially burden the free exercise of religion without compelling justification.' Hutchinson, a Republican, has already signaled his support for the law. WalMart, which is based out of Arkansas, and Apple CEO Tim Cook sided against the GOP-backed measure over the weekend. 'We feel this legislation is counter to this core basic belief of respect for the individual and sends the wrong message about Arkansas, as well as the diverse environment which exists in the state,' a spokesman for Walmart said in a statement provided to Reuters. Cook publicly criticized both state's laws on Twitter, saying, 'Apple is open for everyone. We are deeply disappointed in Indiana's new law and calling on Arkansas Gov. to veto the similar HB1228.' Another business, Angie's List, said it would put on hold indefinitely construction on the expansion of its Indianapolis headquarters, a $40 million project, until the further notice. 'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' the company's chief executive, Bill Oesterle, said in a statement. If Angie's List, an online database of customer reviews, relocates, Indianapolis' economy will lose out on a promised 1,000 new jobs throughout the next five years. The NCAA, also headquartered in Indianapolis, immediately condemned the law on Thursday, saying it was 'especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees.' The final two rounds of the organization's hotly-anticipated annual basketball competition will be held in the city this weekend. The law will not go into effect until July, though. Democratic Indiana State Representative Ed Delaney speaks to demonstrators protesting the newly signed Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Republican lawmakers in the state today said they'd be open to clarifying the bill's intent through legislative changes to make clear its not meant to be discriminatory . The swift backlash against the law had leaders of Indiana's legislature reeling on Monday. At a news conference Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma and state Senate President Pro Tem David Long said they would be willing to change the wording of the law to make more clear that the state does not endorse discrimination. 'To the extent that we need to clarify that, by adding something to the law to make that clear that's not the intent, we are more than willing to do it, and we plan to do that,' Long told reporters, per a report from Reuters. 'Religious freedom and the right to be free from discrimination can coexist together,' he said. Pence expressed shock during an interview with the Indianapolis Star on Saturday at the national outrage that that's followed the signing of the law. 'I just can't account for the hostility that's been directed at our state,' he told the publication. 'I've been taken aback by the mischaracterizations from outside the state of Indiana about what is in this bill.' By Sunday the rumored presidential candidate had gone into full damage control mode, appearing on ABC News' Sunday morning news program this week. But he stood his ground and would not call the law a mistake during the interview, though, and declined to say whether it could be used to legally discriminate on the basis of orientation, as gay rights activists are charging, as homosexuals are not currently a protected class under Indiana law. 'This is not about discrimination, this is about empowering people to confront government overreach,' he told host George Stephanopoulos. 'Look, the issue here is still is tolerance a two-way street or not,' he said when pressed. A window sign on a downtown Indianapolis florist taken last Wednesday shows it's objection to the Religious Freedom bill passed by the Indiana legislature . Pence argued that his state is being treated unfairly by the same people who claim to be defenders of equal treatment under the law. 'From people who preach tolerance every day, we’ve been under an avalanche of intolerance,' he said. 'I’m not going to take it lying down. Furthermore, Pence said Indiana's law is similar to federal legislation Bill Clinton signed as president in 1993 and a measure that Barack Obama voted for while serving in the Illinois state Senate. Indiana's law has 'the very same language' as the Illinois bill the Democratic president voted for, Pence contended. Obama's spokesman rejected Pence's comparison in an interview on the same network minutes later. 'If you have to go back two decades to try to justify something you are doing today, it may raise some questions about the wisdom of what you’re doing,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in response. 'It should be easy for leaders in this country to stand up and say that it is wrong to discriminate against people just because of who they love.' President Obama notoriously 'evolved' on the subject of gay marriage during his first term and now supports it after having previously been against it.","Connecticut will be the first state to bar travel to Indiana since its governor signed the controversial religious freedom law last Thursday .

"Justice Markandey Ketju said Gandhi's religious references worked to divide the Indian people, strengthening British rule . Mahatma Gandhi, the leader who helped lead India to independence over British rule, was actually an agent for the colonists, a top India judge has claimed. Justice Markandey Ketju said Gandhi deliberately tried to drive a wedge between the country's Hindu and Muslim populations, helping the British to divide and rule. The judge, who is known for making controversial statements, made his comments ahead of the unveiling of a statue of Gandhi in Parliament Square, London. They also came as Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond flies to Delhi for his first official visit, meeting with finance minister Arun Jaitley, who will come to London to see the statue unveiled. Mr Katju, 68, wrote on his personal blog: 'I submit that Gandhi was objectively a British agent who did great harm to India. 'By constantly injecting religion into politics continuously for several decades, Gandhi furthered the British policy of divide and rule.' In a separate post on the same topic, he asks: 'Does such a man, who constantly injected religion into politics, and thereby furthered the British policy of divide and rule, deserve to be called the Father of the Nation? He then goes on to quote from Gandhi's speeches and writings before adding: 'These are only some of the stupid, feudal ideas this ""Father of our nation"" had.' He says the fact that Gandhi peppered his speeches with Hindu phrases and terms pressed Indian Muslims into creating their own separate state, Pakistan, which was founded less than a year before Gandhi was shot dead. Mr Ketju, who has a reputation for making controversial remarks, also quoted from Gandhi's speeches and writings, before concluding: 'These are only some of the stupid, feudal ideas this ""Father of our nation"" had' Mr Katju, former chairman of the Press Council of India, has a large online presence - his Facebook page has been liked nearly 100,000 times, and his blog was shared by thousands of people. Mr Katju's father was deeply immersed in the Indian freedom movement, and he has made controversial statements on the topic in the past. According to The Times, he once said '90 per cent of Indians are idiots' because they vote in elections based on their religion and caste, rather than on political merit.","Judge claimed Gandhi used Hindu religion in speeches to divide India .

"A woman, 72, from Honolulu has been blind for over two years but thanks to her new bionic eye she will miraculously be able to see again. The elderly Japanese woman underwent the four hour procedure at the Eye Surgery Center of Hawaii on Tuesday and is the first person to receive the implant in the Asia Pacific region. The woman's identity will not be released. CBS reports that the bionic eye only works for those who have the hereditary disease, retinitis pigmentosa which causes vision impairment. Scroll down for video . Groundbreaking surgery: A woman, 72, from Honolulu has been blind for over two years but thanks to her new bionic eye implanted on Tuesday she will be able to see again . Blind: The Japanese woman, 72, has been blind for two years due to a condition called retinitis pigmentosa . Dr. Gregg Kokame, who performed the operation, said that the bionic eye will help the woman start to see motion and different shades of grey. 'She'll actually start to see motion, actually start to see somebody walk into the room and be able to see different shades of grey,' Kokame said. The device which was approved by the food and drug administration costs $144,000 but was covered by Medicare for the patient, reported ABC. Before the surgery the woman was only able to perceive some light and was otherwise totally blind. The surgical team restored the woman's vision by implanting a microelectrode array to the surface of the woman's retina that then connects wirelessly to a camera connected to a pair of glasses. The woman will not able to see very close details or any color but she may someday have a broader range of vision as the technology advances. New light: The woman won't be able to see color but she will be able to detect motion and prior to her surgery was barely able to detect light . Camera eye: The bionic eye sends signals to the brain through glasses that have a camera and as the technology improves the woman will be able to see more and more . The woman will be able to use her new device in two weeks after she is fully healed from the surgery. 'She was in very good spirits, ‘Kokame said. 'She's a very pleasant, very strong lady. She's looking forward to having the implant turned on.' Bionic eye implant inventor Dr. Mark Humayan told Hawaii News Now that he hopes the device will evolve to assist more patients. 'We have hundreds of millions of photo receptors in our eye, hundreds of millions, and with only 60 pixels patients who were completely blind can see large objects, can tell a table from a chair or a knife from a fork or a plate so it's very exciting to see what the brain is able to fill in,' Humayan said.

"The families of victims of the Germanwings plane crash face a wait of up to four months for the remains of their loved ones to be identified, it has emerged. The Head of the Criminal Research Institute at France's National Gendarmerie said DNA identification of the victims would take two to four months. Colonel Francois Daoust, the institute's director, said: 'Subject to the amount of body parts found, the time period could fluctuate between two months at the least, and four months. Scroll down for video . French gendarmes and investigators work amongst the debris of the Airbus A320 at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes . The families of victims of the Germanwings plane crash face a wait of up to four months for the remains of their loved ones to be identified. Grieving relatives are pictured at a memorial in Le Vernet, France . Friends of  students killed in the disaster hugged each other outside an emotional memorial service last week . 'It is better to work at the rhythm of the science than to rush ahead and thereby run the risk of making mistakes in the identification.' 'We cannot promise that we will be able to identify all of the victims,' he added, according to German newspaper Bild. German prosecutors said Andreas Lubitz, 27, who deliberately caused the crash in the French Alps, had therapy for suicidal tendencies some time before getting his pilot's licence. And he was being treated by a psychotherapist, Dusseldorf prosecutor's office spokesman Christoph Kumpa said. 'At that time he was being treated for what is documented as being suicidal,' Mr Kumpa said. He added that Lubitz paid several visits to doctors right up until the time of the crash but these did not involve suicidal tendencies. Andreas Lubitz (pictured), who deliberately caused the crash in the French Alps, had therapy for suicidal tendencies some time before getting his pilot's licence, German prosecutors said . A top police boss in France has warned that his department 'cannot promise' that it  will be able to identify all of the victims . No suicide note 'or anything like that' was found in searches of Lubitz's German residences, Mr Kumpa said. There was also nothing in his personal, family or professional background to provide any hints 'about his motivation', he said. He also said Lubitz was not suffering from any 'organic medical illness'. Cockpit voice recorder evidence has indicated that Lubitz deliberately put the Airbus A320 into a descent after locking out the captain. All 150 people on board, including three Britons, were killed in the crash last Tuesday. Work  to collect debris and find the second black box continues to take place at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 - but it could be months before the remains of victims are identified . Mr Kumpa was speaking as the grim search for remains carried on in southern France. There were reports that Lubitz's girlfriend was pregnant with his child and that the co-pilot, as well as having mental health issues, had been receiving treatment for an unspecified vision problem which could have affected his ability to carry on working as a pilot. Authorities have already revealed that he hid from his employers a sick note declaring him unfit to work on the day of the disaster, and German newspaper Bild has said he previously told an ex-girlfriend: 'One day I will do something that will change the whole system, and then all will know my name and remember it.' The Britons killed were Paul Bramley, 28, originally from Hull, Martyn Matthews, 50, from Wolverhampton, and seven-month-old Julian Pracz-Bandres, from Manchester, who died alongside his mother, Marina Bandres Lopez Belio, 37, originally from Spain.","DNA identification of victims will take two to four months, police chief says .

"A man accused of plotting to attack the U.S. Capitol called a television station from jail and said if he hadn't been arrested he would have gone to Washington and shot President Barack Obama in the head. WXIX-TV in Cincinnati said Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, called the station from the Kentucky jail where he's being held, confessed to being a supporter of the Islamic State group and said he planned to kill government officials in retaliation for U.S. strikes on the militant organization. The station aired part of the interview on Friday night, hours after Cornell's attorney argued unsuccessfully in court that it could violate the defendant's right to a fair trial. Cornell said in the interview that both he and ISIS members worked together on the terror plot, which involved planting pipe bombs and going on a public shooting rampage. Reporter Tricia Macke asked Cornell in the interview 'Was it their idea for you to plant pipe bombs at the Capitol and have people running outside to shoot them?' 'It was mix of both of our ideas,' Cornell answered. Scroll down for video . Christopher Lee Cornell allegedly plotted to attack the U.S. Capitol in Washington and kill government officials inside it and spoke of his desire to support the Islamic State militant group . Cornell, asked by Macke what he would have done had he not been arrested in January, said he would have taken one of his guns, 'I would have put it to Obama's head, I would have pulled the trigger, then I would unleash more bullets on the Senate and House of Representative members, and I would have attacked the Israeli embassy and various other buildings.' Cornell, who repeatedly identified himself as Muslim, said he wanted to carry out the attack because of 'the continued American aggression against our people and the fact that America, specifically President Obama, wants to wage war against Islamic State.' He said: 'They might say I'm a terrorist, but you know we see American troops as terrorists as well, coming to our land, stealing our resources and killing our people, raping our women.' Cornell, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, grew up in the Cincinnati suburbs and still lived with his parents. He said support of the Islamic State group is widespread. 'We're here in Ohio. We're in every state,' he said. 'We're more organized than you think.' WXIX-TV in Cincinnati said Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, called the station from the Kentucky jail where he's being held, confessed to being a supporter of the Islamic State group and said he planned to kill government officials in retaliation for U.S. strikes on the militant organization . He said that if he hadn't been caught, he would have attacked, President Barack Obama, the Senate, the House of Representatives and many other places in the nation's capital . Cornell, who repeatedly identified himself as Muslim, said he wanted to carry out the attack because of 'the continued American aggression against our people and the fact that America, specifically President Obama, wants to wage war against Islamic State' At times what seemed like a nervous chuckle punctuated his responses. He said he would do whatever the Islamic State group asked of him, including beheading Americans, and predicted 'there will be many, many attacks'. A federal indictment charges Cornell with two counts that carry possible sentences of up to 20 years each upon conviction: attempted murder of government employees and officials and solicitation to commit a crime of violence. He also faces a firearms-related charge. He has pleaded not guilty and awaits trial in Cincinnati. Cornell was arrested outside a gun shop near his home on January 14 after the FBI said he bought two M-15 assault weapons and 600 rounds of ammunition. The FBI said in court documents that Cornell planned to 'wage jihad' by attacking the Capitol with pipe bombs and shooting government officials and employees. Cornell was coerced and misled by 'a snitch' trying to better his own legal situation, his father said. Cornell warned the news station that there were Islamic State group supporters in almost all of the United States . Cornell was arrested outside a gun shop near his home on January 14 after the FBI said he bought two M-15 assault weapons and 600 rounds of ammunition . He described his son as a 'mommy's boy' who spent hours playing video games in his bedroom. He also said his son was 'at peace' after becoming a practicing Muslim. 'He was dragged into this,' Cornell said before the hearing. 'He was coerced.' His son had long expressed distrust of government and the news media, and local police said he disrupted a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013. The FBI said he had for months sent social media messages and posted video espousing support for Islamic State militants and for violent attacks by others. Cornell told an informant they should 'wage jihad,' authorities said in court papers. Similar stings in recent years have led to accusations of entrapment. But the FBI has argued such stings are vital for averting deadly terror attacks, and juries have returned tough sentences. Cornell (pictured left years ago) posted messages on Twitter sympathizing with Islamic terrorists led to an undercover FBI operation.

"A father-of-two sent his two young daughters to stay with their grandparents 'before strangling their mother and hanging himself' two days before she was due to move out, an inquest heard. Mark Langtree, 38, researched 'murder-suicide' online hours before killing Nicola and then himself after struggling to cope with the breakdown of their 11-year marriage. The deaths were discovered when Mr Langtree's father became concerned that his son had not called his two daughters and visited the businessman's luxury home in Wigan. Mr Langtree believed his wife was having an affair and began 'stalking' her by hanging around outside her place of work and checking her phone and emails for messages, the inquest heard. Mark Langtree, 38, sent his daughters to stay with their grandparents before strangling their mother Nicola (left) Mr Langtree (right) believed his wife (left) was having an affair and began 'stalking' her by hanging around outside her place of work . But when she began divorce proceedings against him, and made plans to move out of their luxury marital home with their two children, he killed her before taking his own life. The inquest heard Mr Langtree's body was found suspended from the stairs in November last year at the couple's detached four- bedroom home in Whitley, Lancashire, where they had lived for around 10 years. Mrs Langtree, 34, was found during a police search of their home on the floor of an upstairs bedroom. She had been strangled with an electrical cable and a post-mortem on her body revealed bruising to her jaw, chest and upper arms, indicating she was involved in a struggle. Mrs Langtree's father James Byrne told the inquest that the couple's marriage started to break down around six months before their deaths. 'Both Mark and Nicola were living separate lives,' said Mr Byrne. 'They were living under the same roof but were sleeping in separate bedrooms for the sake of the children. 'Their relationship started to deteriorate and Mark started to do petty things that annoyed Nicola. 'While she was working he started stalking her and started waiting outside for her and taking photos.

Mrs Langtree's father James Byrne (left) told the inquest that the couple's marriage started to break down around six months before their deaths, pictured (right) is his wife Katie . 'He had read something on her phone saying 'shall we have a coffee?' and from there it was just one thing after another. 'He started checking her phone and emails and just didn't trust her for some obscure reason . 'She was very close to me and her mother and she would have told us if anything was untoward.' Mr Byrne told the inquest that Mr Langtree became uninterested in his children . He said: 'I know he had a high pressure job but he would come home from work and not even say hello. 'He would just drop his case and wouldn't even give Nicola a kiss on the cheek. 'He was playing mind games for the last three months.' He also told Bolton Coroner's Court that his daughter believed she had been drugged just weeks before her death after drinking a glass of wine which tasted 'metallic'. She told her father she had passed out before waking up naked on the floor. Mr Byrne also told Bolton Coroner's Court that his daughter (right) believed she had been drugged just weeks before her death after drinking a glass of wine which tasted 'metallic' In the month before his death, Mr Langtree appeared to try and take his own life and was found by his wife in a room above their garage with an Ikea bag, cans of beer and some pills. Mr Byrne said that Nicola had found him with a rope around his neck having taken drink and tablets The following month the couple went on holiday to Spain. He added that the father-of-two had told his daughters, 'mummy and daddy are splitting up and daddy doesn't want them to'. Mr Langtree's father told the inquest he believed this was a 'cry for help'. Both Mr and Mrs Langtree were listed as directors of Langtree Property Services in Huddersfield. Home Office pathologist Philip Lumb said that Nicola had suffered a striking horizontal ligature to his neck and injuries and bruising to her face and chest including a bruised eye and jaw. Dr Lumb said that the ligature marks were consistent with an electrical cable and the hair dryer had been the closest match. He added that the bruise to the jaw could have been from a blow such as a punch or could have been from contact with the ground. Assistant Coroner for Manchester West Rachel Griffin recorded a verdict of pressure to the neck for Mrs Langtree and hanging for Mr Langtree. Mr Byrne told the inquest that Mr Langtree became uninterested in his children, pictured is Nicola (far right) with her father James and other family members . She said: 'Sadly I am unable to say what happened after 7pm on 12 November 2014, but I accept the evidence that has been given to me today. 'I offer my sympathies and condolences to both families for the loss of a daughter and the loss of a son. 'What occurred on and between the 12th November and the 13th November can only be described as a tragedy of extreme proportion. 'My greatest sympathies however remain with two children  who must now live with not having lost just one parent but with two parents. 'Quite clearly to Nicola and Mark, those children were the centre of their lives.' Detective Inspector Andrew Naysmith from Greater Manchester Police told the inquest he attended the scene. He said: 'The address was secure when we attended. 'Mark was hanging from the bannister and Nicola was on the floor of the upstairs bedroom. Both were clearly deceased. 'In our minds we had discovered a murder suicide which had no third-party involvement. 'There was some items found on the laptop belonging to Mark.

"The Married at First Sight star who almost left her groom at the altar because she wasn't physically attracted to him was forced to smile throughout a cringe-worthy post-wedding photoshoot with her new husband - who was, ironically, thrilled to have married his new wife. On last night's episode of the FYI reality show, 30-year-old Jaclyn Methuen, from Union, New Jersey, looked incredibly uncomfortable as she was forced to hold hands and cuddle up with her new groom Ryan Ranellone, 29, from Long Island, New York, as the pair posed for their first pictures as newlyweds. 'When I look back at those pictures I am going to see a girl [who] was very overwhelmed - disappointed. I wanted to get a guy that's tall, dark and handsome,' she revealed to the cameras. Cringe-worthy: Jaclyn Methuen grimaced as she posed for wedding photos with her new husband Ryan Ranellone on last night's episode of Married at First Sight . All for show: Jaclyn faked a smile for the camera as Ryan swept her off her feet after their nuptials . Forced together: The 30-year-old sales rep was visibly uncomfortable as the posed next to Ryan, letting out an awkward laugh after he told her that she was making him warm . She continued: 'He is a little younger than I would have liked. He lives all the way on Long Island. How is that going to work? His accent is really going to really annoy me. At this present moment this is what I am feeling - definitely disappointment.' To make matters worse, Ryan was oblivious to Jaclyn's feelings, despite the fact that they hugged instead of kissing after they said 'I do'. When the sale rep commented that her new husband felt warm, he responded by noting that he is usually cold. 'You are doing something to me already,' he told her. Jaclyn responded to his playful comment by letting out an awkward laugh. Miserable bride: Ryan, who stated that he was very attracted to Jaclyn, leaned in for a kiss during the photoshoot . Total strangers: Jaclyn told the cameras that she was going to look back at her wedding photos and see a girl who was 'very overwhelmed' 'Jaclyn's a beautiful girl, and I feel instant chemistry,' he told the cameras. 'I just hope she feels the same.' But his new wife was secretly overwhelmed by her whirlwind wedding to a complete strange. 'This is a lot. This is just making me feel uncomfortable,' she said of the photoshoot. 'I am a very open person and I am very affectionate and touchy, but that's when I get to know somebody.' She added:  'We are not essentially really a couple. Legally we are, but emotionally we're not. We're still strangers.' One of the show's relationship experts Dr Pepper Schwartz told the cameras that Jaclyn is 'putting on a good face for the wedding, but that is all she is doing'. Grin and bear it: Jaclyn faked a smile as Ryan held her from behind . Missed connection: The couple stared at the floor as they posed together in a doorway . 'Physical match is not the most important thing,' she continued. 'What she really has to do is trust in the experiment and believe that the experts put her and Ryan together because they share essential values.' Meanwhile, Jaclyn couldn't get over her reaction to her husband's physical appearance. 'I was expecting to be a little more attracted,' she said. 'I don't look into his eyes and see my husband right now. This feels like a huge mistake.' At their reception, Jaclyn's female friends reminded her that real-life is not a romantic comedy and that she shouldn't expect love at first sight. No contact: Ryan and Jaclyn can be seen dancing at their wedding reception . Not romantic: Jaclyn looked away from Ryan throughout the dance . Last week, Jaclyn spoke with Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on the Today show about her wedding day and revealed that she did indeed marry the groom whose physical appearance was giving her second thoughts. 'I put so much pressure on my intuition,' she said of her disappointment in Ryan. 'I thought I was going to know that this guy is my soulmate and we were going to have that connection and those sparks.' On the season two premiere of Married at First Sight, Ryan happily agreed to marry Jaclyn, but the episode ended in a cliffhanger when she admitted she had doubts about her arranged marriage. 'I first see Ryan, my gut just says: ""Oh man, like this is him?""' she told the cameras. 'The initial physical attraction really isn't there right now.’ She continued: 'When I saw him face-to-face, I felt a little disappointed. It just doesn't feel like this is the man who is my husband. I don't know if I can do this.' Happy moment? Jaclyn smiled and pointed at her new husband during their wedding reception . Good advice: Jaclyn's bridesmaids reminded her that real-life is not a romantic comedy and that she should have expected to fall in love with Ryan at first sight . I do: After a moment of hesitation, Jaclyn agreed to marry Ryan, but they hugged instead of kissed after they exchanged vows . And even though she said 'I do', Jaclyn is still struggling with her decision. Before coming on the show, the sales rep for Tito's Handmade Vodka had been single for the past seven years and admitted that she hadn't had sex in two years. She confessed that she hoped her new husband would be 'personable, secure and confident'. Meanwhile, Ryan had been single for eight months. After a string of long-distance relationships, he explained that he finally felt ready to settle down. Ryan and Jaclyn are just two of the six strangers who agreed to wed one another after finding themselves unlucky in love. Over the course of several weeks, viewers will be able to watch as the couples go from wedding, to honeymoon, to 'early nesting', and then to the daily struggle of marriage.","Jaclyn Methuen, from Union, New Jersey, married Ryan Ranellone, from Long Island, New York, on last night's episode of Married at First Sight .

"Prehistoric hunters may have tipped their stone arrows and spears with poisons to help them bring down prey, scientists believe. Researchers have developed a new technique that allows them to test ancient weapons for residues left by toxic plant material added to them. Preliminary tests have suggested that a set of 4,000-year-old stone-tipped arrows from Egypt were coated with poisonous compounds including the plant Acokanthera. Dr Valentina Borgia, a specialist in paleolithic hunting weapons at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge, believes hunters may have been using toxic chemicals on their weapons up to 30,000 years ago. The image above shows arrows from China that were used in a crossbow that were dipped in poison . She said that Paleolithic hunters may have used poisonous pastes made from plants to help make their weapons kill prey more swiftly. Early humans may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago, a new study has suggested. Scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans. A study of fossils of Homo erectus, an extinct human ancestor, shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully. This would have enabled Homo erectus to become a proficient hunter, able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey. She said: 'It made good sense for people to use poisons. 'On their own, Palaeolithic weapons with stone arrowheads may not have been deadly enough to immobilise or kill a large animal such as a red deer. 'Poisonous plants were plentiful and the prehistoric population knew the environment where they lived, they knew the edible plants and their potential as medicines and poisons. 'To fabricate a poison is easy and economic, and the risk is minimal. In addition, the making of poisons is often part of the tradition and the rituality of hunting.' Dr Borgia has been working with forensic scientist Michell Cralin from Northumbria University and Dr Huw Barton, from the University of Leicester, to test for the presence of poisonous plants on prehistoric weapons. Using a technique called liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which is used to detect traces of drugs by modern forensic scientists, they are examining residues left on the tips of ancient weapons. They are also looking for the presence of starch grains that may have been left on the weapons from toxic plant material. This wooden spatula from Malaysia wrapped in a palm leaf was used to apply poison to darts used for hunting . Dr Borgia has conducted tests on 4,000 year old arrow heads found in Egypt (left) that are thought to have been tipped with a poisonous black residue. The image on the right shows a pot of curare, a plant-based poison which is still used by some indigenous hunter-gatherers in South America to coat darts and arrows . They can then compare the results from these tests against a database of known poisonous plants. Dr Borgia has already collected samples from a number objects known to have contained poison and ancient weapons to test the technique. These include a 1926 Chinese pot containing Aconite poison inside, Malaysian darts tipped with the poison Upas, Chinese crossbow arrows and a number of African arrows. Many hunter gatherer societies are known to use poisons when they are hunting. The Yanomami people in the Amazon rainforest use curare - a mix of bark scrapings from Strychnos vines - to tip their darts and arrows when hunting. The use of curare was once common among indigenous populations in South America. The researchers have used starch grains like the ones shown on the left from the plant Aconitum napellus  to help identify poisonous materials. Aconitum was found inside this pot on the right thought to date from 1926 . In Africa hunters use another species of Strychnos to produce the poison strychnine, while other plants like Acokanthera, and Strophantus are also used. Hunters in Northern Asia are also known to have used monkshood to kill large animals such as bears and Siberian ibex. The seeds from yew trees are also thought to have been used to poison arrows. Dr Borgia has also collected black residue from six arrows that date from pre-dynasty Egypt. These 4,000-year-old arrows were first studied by scientists 40 years ago when small portons of the residue from the stone tips were injected into a cat. Opium, magic mushrooms and other psychoactive drugs have been used by humans for thousands of years. An anthropologist has discovered that humans have been cultivating and using mood-altering substances since the Stone Age. Professor Elisa Guerra-Doce has compiled evidence from around the world that Neolithic people were taking drugs derived from cacti in 8,600BC and that they were cultivating opium poppies by around 6000BC. Researchers have also found reddish stains on 13,000 year old human teeth found in a burial pit in Duyong Cave on Palawan Island in the southern Philippines, which are thought to be caused by chewing the leaves of the betel plant. It is still chewed through out much of Asia as a mild stimulant. Charred cannabis seeds have also been found in bowls that date from the Bronze age Pit-Grave culture that appeared in Romania around 2000BC. This bone harpoon in a museum in Cambridge carries a warning label that reads 'Care, Has been poisoned' The animal did not die but became ill, suggesting the presence of a poison. Dr Borgia said: 'Nowadays we have the right instruments to get more information without cruelty to animals. 'Initial tests strongly suggest the presence of Acokanthera, a poisonous plant on our database, but we can’t be completely certain as there are a number of components in the compound. 'We know that the Babylonians, Greeks and Romans used plant-based poisons both for hunting animals and in war. 'In fact, the word ‘toxic’ come from toxon, the Greek for bow. Taxus is a genus of the yew tree with a springy timber traditionally used to make bows. 'It also produces seeds used to poison arrows. In Britain, yews grown for their timber were planted in churchyards so that animals wouldn’t be poisoned by eating their berries. “Few hunter-gatherer societies remain today but all the groups that have survived employ poisons.'","Scientists at Cambridge University are testing ancient weapons for poisons .

"A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a body was found stuffed inside a plastic barrel that was dumped in front of Sonoma's city hall in California wine country, authorities said. In custody: Christopher McNatt, 40, of Sonoma, was arrested Saturday on suspicion of murder . The blood-stained barrel was covered with a plastic tarp when it was discarded in front of the city hall on Friday at about 11.50pm. The discovery of a dead man stuffed inside the 55-gallon barrel led detectives to a mobile home park, where Sonoma County Sheriff's detectives said they believed the victim, Ronald Sauvageau, 64, was killed. They served a search warrant at a home inside the park and arrested Christopher McNatt, 40, in the slaying. An autopsy will be conducted Tuesday to determine the cause of Sauvageau's death. Sheriff's Sgt. Cecile Focha told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat that a weapon believed to be used in the killing was recovered, but she declined to elaborate on the type of weapon or the relationship between the two men. 'I can't speak to the motivations, but whoever decided to kill the person and bring his body there seems gruesome and disrespectful,' Focha said. Scene: Late on Friday night, police were alerted to a a 55-gallon plastic barrel with dried blood on it, dumped outside Sonoma City Hall. Inside they found the dead body of a 64-year-old man . Trailer: Investigations lead police to a mobile home at the Acacia Grove Mobile Home Park on Highway 12 in Sonoma Valley, where detectives believe the crime took place. One of the recycling bins out front was missing . Investigation: Deputies determined which mobile home the victim was killed in at this park . Focha also refused to comment on whether the body was found whole or dismembered. She said at least a half-dozen deputies with the Sheriff's Office and Sonoma Police Department are still investigating. Deputies initially detained a second man Saturday in connection with the crime. However he was let go without charge. Focha also said that although the mobile home east of El Verano appeared to be the scene of the killing, she could not say where the two men were arrested . Ex: Dana Hamilton, a former girlfriend of suspect Christopher McNatt, was shocked about his arrest . 'There's no danger to the public,' Focha said. 'But no, I don't know if they're looking for other suspects.' McNatt was being held without bail pending a court appearance set for Tuesday. An ex-girlfriend of McNatt, Dana Hamilton, told ABC 7 News she was shocked about his arrest. 'There's no reason for this - he's not a violent person,' she said. 'It's so surreal, I'm just trying to catch my breath.'","A 55-gallon barrel was dumped outside Sonoma City Hall late Friday night .

"She is known for having a flawless face that has won her the cover of Vogue and front row seats at fashion shows. But Kim Kardashian didn't always look the way she does today. On Sunday her childhood friend Nikki Lund shared never-before-seen photos of the 34-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star taken long before she became an international sensation. Scroll down for video... Old pals: Nikki Lund (right) shared a photo with her childhood friend Kim Kardashian (left) on Sunday . The beauties today: Kim (left) in Paris on Sunday and Nikki (right) in a promo shot for her new song North 2 South - This is It which is doing well on UK charts . Lund, who dates Bon Jovi rocker Richie Sambora, has shared images of Mrs Kanye West before. But never has the singer, whose new song is North 2 South - This is It was released this year, shared so many. In one image Kim looked chubby faced as she shows off bangs and thinner lips. The reality diva also looked more natural with a hearty smile and lack of self-consciousness. Peace out: Lund has shared images of Mrs Kanye West before.But never has the singer, whose new song is North 2 South - This is It was released this year, shared so many . In another she looks older with thin eyebrows, bigger lips and short hair. She appeared to be about 18-years-old. A black-and-white photo shows Kim with braces on and longer hair. She had on dark lipstick and a black tank top that matched her choker. She was 19-years-old when the image was taken. Another portrait sees the two in a photo booth where Kim had bangs. Cool kids of Calabasas?: Kim, at age 19, had braces as a teen and already plucked brows while Nikki wore a nineties style choker . Hats off to them: As teenagers they knew how to do their makeup already and mug for the camera . Lund also talked to The Mirror, where she told the publication her old friend struggled after the loss of her father Robert Kardashian, an attorney, in September 2003. 'Kim was a daddy’s girl, she adored her father and when she died she was devastated,' the singer said. 'Rob was the one who would make sure she was working hard and that she was behaving herself. I don't think this whole thing would be happening to her right now if he was still alive.' Nikki also added that Kim was quiet as a child. 'She never wanted to be famous, it just kind of happened. She was always the quiet girl sitting in the corner while we were all being loud.' Ahhh, this is more like the Kim we know: The E! star looked more like herself in later snaps; here she was in a photo booth with Lund . The friend also said the mother of North West, aged one, was diligent. 'Kim was studious, she wanted to be a good student. She worked hard at school, she didn’t get straight A’s but the teachers liked her. She’d never bunk off school.' And as a teen, Kim had her role models already. 'Kim was  obsessed with Jennifer Lopez, she would sing If You Had My Love all of the time. She thought she was beautiful. She also fancied P Diddy and Jamie Foxx – Kim always liked African-American men.' Interesting insight: Lund said, 'Kim was obsessed with Jennifer Lopez, she would sing If You Had My Love all of the time. She thought she was beautiful. She also fancied P Diddy and Jamie Foxx – Kim always liked African-American men' In to her looks: Nikki also said, 'Kim was always on some sort of diet, we all were. She did the no-carbs thing and would ask for a burger with no bun' Wanting to be like J-Lo meant Kardashian watched her weight. 'Kim was always on some sort of diet, we all were. She did the no-carbs thing and would ask for a burger with no bun. She was conscious of what she looked like, she didn’t have her bum then but the boys liked her. Kim got a lot of attention back then. 'We were a bit dorky really. We loved the Spice Girls, when we were like 15 and 16 and we loved dressing up as them and singing along to their songs. Kim loved Posh Spice, she thought she was the prettiest one and she loved what she wore. 'She went out and bought herself a black leather dress with slits in it – it was exactly like Posh’s. Kim would do her make up like Posh’s and her hair was similar so she did actually really look like her.' They were friends too: Lund arm in arm with Kim's older sister Kourtney, now 35 and a mother of three children . On Sunday,  Kim has been in Paris taking in fashion shows. On Sunday she stepped out in two different looks. The first one was quite risqué with her showing off her granny panties and bra in a Balmain cage dress and heels with a coat sitting on her shoulders just so. Lund in love: The blonde beauty dates rocker Richie Sambora who she runs a clothing line with . The second outfit was more tame, but showed off quite a bit as well. She had on a black top with zig zag string in the front tying her up. Kinky boots made the E! star resemble Catwoman. Husband West followed behind. Also in France is Kim's mother Kris Jenner.

Daniel was rushed to WakeMed in critical condition, but despite doctors’ efforts he could not be saved. The brothers' uncle Javier Velazquez told ABC11 last week the boys’ parents were home at the time of the accident, which took place at around 12.45pm March 15. According to Velazquez, Daniel and Israel found a bow and arrow and were playing with it in the woods near their mobile home on Swift Creek Lane when tragedy struck. The siblings' mother, Erica Velazquez, made a frantic 911 call after learning of what happened, telling the dispatcher that her 7-year-old son 'was shot in the throat.' ‘His body is swelling up,’ she was quoted by the station WRAL as saying on the call. ‘He's swelling up right now, really bad.’ Daniel, a second-grader at Ballentine Elementary School, spent four days in the pediatric ICU at WakeMed, but his injures proved too grave.

"The 'Hit King' is taking another swing at returning to baseball. Pete Rose, who agreed to a lifetime ban from Major League Baseball in 1989 after an investigation found he bet on the Cincinnati Reds to win while managing the team, has submitted a new request to be reinstated. The career hits leader (4,256) applied for reinstatement in September 1997 and met in November 2002 with previous MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who never ruled on the application. Scroll down for video . Pete Rose (above) has submitted a request to be reinstated to MLB according to commissioner Rob Manfred . Rose, 73, agreed to a lifetime ban from the sport in 1989 after it was revealed he bet on games as a manager . Manfred announced he had a formal request from Rose and said he's willing to 'hear what Pete has to say' Do you think Pete Rose should be reinstated into baseball? Do you think Pete Rose should be reinstated into baseball? Now share your opinion . Rob Manfred succeeded Selig in January and has already said that Rose will be involved in the 2015 All Star Game in July at the Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, according to Yahoo. Manfred said after meeting with the Los Angeles Dodgers in spring training on Monday that he has a formal request from Rose. He said: 'What I intend to do is be in communication with his representatives, and we'll talk about how we'll handle it from a process perspective.' Rose, who turns 74 next month, denied for 15 years that he bet on baseball. In his 2004 autobiography, Pete Rose: My Prison Without Bars, he came clean about betting on the Reds. The new commissioner was not involved in the investigation into Rose's gambling as it was handled by outside lawyer John Dowd. He said: 'I want to make sure I understand all of the details in the Dowd Report and commissioner Bart Giamatti's decision. 'I want to hear what Pete has to say, and I'll make a decision.' Rose won the World Series in 1975 and 1976 with the Reds and  in 1980 while he was a member of the Phillies . The MLB career hits leader (4,256) will be at the 2015 MLB All Star Game July in Cincinnati, Ohio . The Hall of Fame (pictured) voted to ban players on the permanently ineligible list from induction in 1991 . If Manfred did reinstate Rose, it would be a step towards him eventually reaching Cooperstown. The Hall of Fame voted to ban players on the permanently ineligible list from induction in 1991. Even if Rose is put back on the Baseball Writers' Association of America  ballot, members of the group will not necessarily vote him in despite his Hall of Fame-worthy statistics. In addition to managing the Reds, Rose also played for the team for nearly 20 seasons and helped the club win the World Series in 1975 and 1976. He also won the World Series as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1980. Manfred is a member of the Hall of Fame board, but he said he has not spoken with the Hall about its plans for Rose, according to ESPN. He said: 'Honestly, I don't think people should read any disposition into what I'm saying about this. 'I see it as a really simple thing. He's made a request. 'Part of my obligations under the major league constitution is to deal with those requests, and I'll deal with it.' These days, Rose spends his time is Las Vegas signing baseballs for money. That may not fit the lifestyle commissioner Giamatti suggested when the ban agreement was announced. Giamatti said at the time: 'The burden is entirely on Mr Rose to reconfigure his life in a way he deems appropriate.","Rose agreed to life ban from MLB in 1989 after admitting he bet on games .

"A woman of 95 has died after waiting four hours in a queue of ambulances outside a hospital. As Lilly Baxandall arrived at Glan Clwyd Hospital, North Wales, 11 ambulances were waiting to hand over patients. And, by the time she was finally admitted to the Bodelwyddan hospital four hours later, her family said it was too late. The former British Airways catering supervisor, who lived in a bungalow in Abergele, North Wales, developed pneumonia and died the following day. Lilly Baxandall, 95, was taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital, north Wales (pictured) at around 5pm on September 1 last year after a fall. She was not admitted to A&E until 9.50pm, and died the next day . It is the latest shocking death threatening to undermine patient faith in the Welsh Ambulance Service, which has met its response targets just once in the past two-and-a-half years. Labour, which runs the health service in Wales under devolution, has cut health funding by more than 8 per cent since 2010. And the cuts have seen longer waits for ambulances, far more people waiting more than four hours in A&E than in England, and poor cancer care. At a pre-inquest hearing yesterday, Miss Baxandall's great-niece Kate Thomas, a locum doctor who helped care for her great-aunt in the ambulance, said: 'By the time she was admitted it was far too late.' The court, sitting in Ruthin, North Wales, was told Miss Baxandall’s cleaner dialled 999 on September 1 last year when she found her on the floor after a fall. She had a cut on her head but was still conscious. A paramedic arrived soon after but it was two more hours before an ambulance arrived, making it to the casualty department of Glan Clwyd Hospital by 5pm. Coroner John Gittins said Miss Baxandall's case is particularly concerning as it is the third such case he has had to deal with . At that time, Coroner John Gittins said, there was evidence to suggest 11 ambulances were queuing outside waiting to discharge patients. ‘Over the course of the next few hours she began to decline and paramedics were becoming concerned at the delay in admission,’ the coroner said. She was finally admitted at 9.50pm – almost seven hours after the paramedic first arrived. A post-mortem examination found she died of pneumonia due to bleeding on the brain, caused by the head injury. The coroner said he would call a neurosurgeon to give evidence on whether Miss Baxandall would have had a better chance of survival had she been admitted sooner. Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board, which runs Glan Clwyd Hospital, last week said it was struggling due to cuts to the Labour-run NHS – as it urged patients not to go to GPs for free prescriptions to treat minor ailments. The coroner said he was concerned as Miss Baxandall’s death was the third he had dealt with recently where ambulance delays were a factor. He ordered bosses of the ambulance service and health board to give evidence at a full hearing, saying the ‘buck’ stopped with them. ‘I am particularly concerned because the issue of ambulance delays is very much on the public agenda,’ Mr Gittins said. The coroner referred to Fred Pring, 74, and Clive Turner, 73, who both died in North Wales after ambulance delays. Fred Pring, 74 (left), died in March 2013 after waiting 42 minutes for an ambulance, during which time his wife called 999 four times. Clive Turner, 74 (right), died a year later after waiting five hours for an ambulance . An inquest into Miss Baxandall's death at Ruthin coroner's court (pictured) will try to establish why she was kept waiting for so long, and if she could have been saved if she was admitted sooner . Retired gardener Mr Pring died in March 2013 after paramedics took 42 minutes to respond. He suffered heart failure and died before an ambulance arrived. In March 2014, retired engineer Mr Turner died after waiting five hours for an ambulance while suffering internal bleeding. He was then misdiagnosed at hospital and died the following day. Mr Gittins had ordered the ambulance service to make urgent changes, but yesterday said he now wanted to see ‘whether things are changing’. A spokesman for the Welsh Ambulance Service and Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board said they were co-operating with the coroner and ‘liaising closely’ with Miss Baxandall’s family. In another case, a man waited almost an hour for an ambulance after severing a finger while mowing the lawn in Nefyn, North Wales. Owen Morgan, 70, lost his right index finger and severely damaged two others on Friday morning. Last night his family said the delay may have stopped medics from saving his finger.","Lilly Baxandall, 95, was found on floor of her home with cut to her head .

"CIA Director John Brennan has ordered a sweeping overhaul of the spy agency, aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into traditional intelligence gathering . Brennan announced the restructuring to the CIA workforce Friday. He said the move comes after nine outside experts spent three months analyzing the agency's management structure, including what deputy CIA director David Cohen called 'pain points,' organizational areas where the CIA's bureaucracy does not work efficiently. Briefing reporters with Cohen at CIA headquarters this week, Brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the CIA is not covering. He lamented that there is often no single person he can hold accountable for the spying mission in any given part of the world. Not your grandparents' CIA: The CIA is launching one of the biggest reorganizations in its history, aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into intelligence gathering . Critical look: CIA Director John Brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the CIA is not covering . 'There are a lot of areas that I would like to have better insight to, better information about, better access to,' Brennan said. 'Safe havens, denied areas.  Whether because we don't even have a diplomatic presence in a country, or because there are parts of countries that have been overrun and taken over by terrorist groups and others.' On the cyber front, the CIA chief said he is establishing a new 'Directorate of Digital Innovation' to lead the agency's efforts to track and take advantage of advances in cyber technology. US officials said that Brennan decided the agency had to increase the resources and emphasis it devoted to cyberspace because advanced communications technology is rapidly becoming pervasive. Historically, electronic eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency have been at the cutting edge of digital innovation within the US government. But the CIA felt that it too had to reorganize to keep up with the technological 'pace of change,' as one official put it. Brennan said the new digital directorate will have equal status within the agency with four other directorates which have existed for years. 'Our ability to carry out our responsibilities for human intelligence and national security responsibilities has become more challenging' in today's digital world, Brennan said. 'And so what we need to do as an agency is make sure we’re able to understand all of the aspects of that digital environment.' Pitfall: Evidence shows that the CIA may have taken too long to find and kill Osama bin Laden - a mission that was accomplished in 2011 after a decade-long manhunt . Brennan avoided the term 'cyber,' a word used by the National Security Agency, the country's premier digital spying service . The changes come against a backdrop of widespread concern that the CIA's focus on hunting and killing terrorists since the September 11 attacks has led to an erosion of the espionage and analytic capabilities the agency built during the Cold War. The CIA, along with other US intelligence agencies, wrongly assessed the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2002 and failed to anticipate the rapid collapse of Middle East governments during the Arab Spring in 2011, among other shortcomings. The agency's greatest public success of recent years — the 10-year effort to locate and kill Osama bin Laden in 2011 — may have taken longer than it should have, according to evidence made public in the recent Senate report on CIA interrogations.  Internal CIA surveys have cited bad management and bureaucratic frustration as factors in driving talent away from the agency. In the most significant departure, the CIA would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms, a system that typically has required the case officers who recruit spies and run covert operations to work for different bosses, in different offices, than analysts who interpret the intelligence and write briefing papers for the president and other policymakers. The new plan would blend practitioners of those separate disciplines into 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world. There are a handful of such centers at the moment, including the Counter Terrorism Center, where analysts and operators have worked side by side for the last decade targeting al-Qaida with espionage and drone strikes. Under the new plan, each center would be run by an assistant director who would be responsible for the entire intelligence mission within that jurisdiction, including covert operations, spying, analysis, liaison with foreign partners and logistics. The system of CIA stations, headed by a CIA station chief, will remain in place, Brennan said. Most stations are in US embassies, and various CIA case officers in embassies may be working on different missions for different centers. The changes do not require congressional approval and will be undertaken within the CIA's current budget, CIA officials said. Critics of a blended approach have raised concerns that combining analysts with operators could compromise the objectivity of the analysts, who are tasked with coldly interpreting intelligence in which they have no stake. It may be harder for an analyst to cast doubt on a source recruited by a case officer he knows personally, the theory goes. Blended: The new overhaul plan would bring CIA operatives and data analysts together in 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world . The head of the CIA's operation arm retired abruptly in January after voicing concerns about the plan, say two former CIA officials who know him but spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss internal agency matters. Brennan said the undercover officer's decision 'was not a result of this,' but he did not dispute that the officer had opposed some of the changes. 'Any time we've put analysts and operators together, the result has been a more powerful product,' said John McLaughlin, a former CIA analyst who became acting director, and who advised Brennan on the restructuring. Brennan is retaining the old structure of CIA 'directorates.' But he is changing some names, including restoring the old moniker 'Directorate of Operations,' to the spying arm, the name it had before being rebadged the National Clandestine Service in 2005. For analysts, what used to be called the Directorate of Intelligence will be renamed the Directorate of Analysis. Two others, the directorates of support and security, remain. The directorates will manage human resources and set tradecraft standards, Brennan said, while the centers carry out the intelligence missions. The CIA will also significantly boost its leadership training and talent development efforts, which have been compared unfavorably to the military, Brennan said. The reorganization is already drawing fire from some quarters. Paul Pillar, a former CIA analyst who famously dissented from the case for war in Iraq, expressed concern that the costs of the changes would outweigh the benefits. 'I worry that this plan may be another instance of the all-too-common pattern, among senior managers in both governmental and private sector organizations, to try to leave a personal mark by reorganizing the place,' he said in an email.","CIA would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms .

"Teenagers are tired of sharing every detail of their lives online and are taking increasing steps to safeguard their privacy on social media, a report has revealed. Young people are un-tagging pictures, writing false posts and even adopting parallel identities in a bid to keep their personal information safe, according to the Market Research Society. They have even resorted to posting deliberately vague statements on their accounts - known as 'vague-booking' - to prompt real friends to respond privately for further details. Scroll down for video . Vague-booking: Young people are deliberately posting vague statements and false information in a bid to keep their personal data private, research has found . The findings contradict Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's claims in 2010 that the age of privacy is over - and no longer a 'social norm'. The report, by Colin Strong of the MRS Delphi Society, says the rise of apps like Snapchat - which erases pictures after a short amount of time - show teenagers are increasingly concerned about what strangers see. His report says: 'There is an almost universally held view that teenagers simply don’t care enough about online privacy.' At face value, this appears to be true, as many young people flood public social media accounts like Twitter and Instagram with endless streams of selfies and personal information. Mr Strong cites the example of Paris Brown, who was forced to resign from her position as the country's first youth police crime commissioner in 2013 after a series of ill-advised tweets she had posted years before emerged. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg claimed people had become more comfortable with sharing private information online . Jane Frost, chief executive of the MRS, told The Sunday Times that she estimates a third of Twitter users have a private account, only shared with close friends, as well as a public persona. She had many used several fake identities for things like video gaming, while closely guarding accounts made using their real names. Ms Frost said the findings will pose problems for businesses, who will not be to take consumers for granted. Mr Strong adds that just because young people post things in public forums, it does not mean have no desire for privacy. 'Just because it's in a public space doesn't mean they want publicity,' he said. His views are in stark contrast to those of Mr Zuckerberg, the chief executive of the world's biggest social network. Speaking at the Crunchie Awards in 2010, he claimed people had grown more comfortable sharing their private information online. He said: 'People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people. 'That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.' He explained the rise of social media reflected the changing attitudes of people. 'When I got started in my dorm room at Harvard, the question a lot of people asked was, 'why would I want to put any information on the internet at all? Why would I want to have a website?' 'Then in the last 5 or 6 years, blogging has taken off in a huge way, and just all these different services that have people sharing all this information.'","Young people are un-tagging pictures, writing false posts to ensure privacy .

"Michael Gove proposed new taxes on the 'undeserving rich' last night, saying the Tories will only win the general election if voters believe the party are 'warriors for the dispossessed'. Painting a broad, positive vision for five more years in power, the party's chief whip said the wealthiest already pay the most towards reducing the deficit, but insisted: 'We expect them to pay more.' Official figures show that despite the economic crisis, inequality has fallen since 2010 – an achievement he said the Conservatives should trumpet rather than 'overlook'. Tough stance: Chief Whip Michael Gove (pictured) proposed new taxes on the 'undeserving rich' last night, saying the Tories will only win the the election if voters believe the party are 'warriors for the dispossessed' He added: 'The reductions in public expenditure have been accompanied by tax reform to ensure the undeserving rich pay more.' In a speech in London at the launch of modernising Tory campaign group The Good Right, he said that making it easier for families to buy their own homes is a 'quintessentially progressive cause' and central to the Tory campaign. That will be seen as a strong hint that the party's manifesto will include extensions to the Right to Buy programme started by Margaret Thatcher and the Help to Buy scheme introduced by George Osborne. Mr Gove also hailed the Government's reforms to welfare, education and pensions. He claimed that Labour would stop social progress in its tracks if returned to power in May – propped up by Scottish Nationalists – who are 'even less progressive than Labour'. Mr Gove insisted his intervention was not meant as a swipe at the election campaign masterminded by chief strategist Lynton Crosby. But it will be seen as backing for those who have been calling for a more upbeat tone to the campaign. Senior Tories, including Home Secretary Theresa May, have in recent weeks called for a more encouraging pitch, focused on the party's achievements in office and compassionate vision for the future. The Chancellor is expected to use next week's Budget to underline the Tories' pledge to lift the threshold for basic rate tax to £12,500, freeing more of the lower-paid from tax, and to lift the 40p bracket to £50,000, helping the middle classes. Mr Gove's speech repeatedly referred to 'compassionate Conservatism'. Slow progress: He claimed that Labour - led by Ed Miliband (pictured) would stop social progression in its tracks if returned to power in May – propped up by Scottish Nationalists . He said: 'Only if we remind people of our commitment to social justice, demonstrate our belief in equality of opportunity and affirm that we are warriors for the dispossessed, will we be able to win arguments and elections, and then be in a position genuinely to help the vulnerable and the voiceless.' The Government's greatest achievement has been 'getting Britain back to work', he said, adding: 'In the last five years, Britain has created more jobs than the whole of the rest of the European Union put together.' Britain's global export trade is booming – giving George Osborne a pre-Budget boost. The latest Office for National Statistics data shows the trade deficit – the difference between imports and what the UK sells to foreign markets – dropped to just £600million in January, from a high of £2.1billion in December. Exports, which were hit by stagnation in the eurozone, rose by 5.8 per cent in the three months to January, while imports rose by just 2 per cent. Britain's improved performance was helped by lower global oil prices, which have been responsible for the low rate of inflation, currently running at just 0.3 per cent.","Gove said rich are already paying most but 'we expect them to pay more'

"Quotes from Adolf Hitler are stencilled on the walls around customers, as they sit in the controversial Nazi-themed SoldatenKaffe in Indonesia. They don't seem to be bothered by the countless Hitler portraits, Nazi flags and other memorabilia that adorn the walls surrounding them, or the fact that the cafe's owner received widespread criticism and death threats when his business made headlines around the world for all the wrong reasons. SoldatenKaffe has been accused of glorifying the Nazi party and its leader, and is still packing in customers a year after it reopened with even more memorabilia.

Quotes from the Nazi leader are stencilled on the walls of SoldatenKaffe in Bandung, Indonesia . The owner promised to remove all offending posters and memorabilia for the reopening, but they remain . SoldatenKaffe glorifies the Nazi party and its leader and was forced to close its doors in 2013, with the owner promising to remove the offending swastikas and Nazi insignia. However, when the cafe relaunched in June 2014, it not only retained the name of a cafe that was popular with Nazi soldiers in Paris in World War II, but also had even more artefacts on display. The cafe had existed for three years in Indonesia's third-largest city before it was brought to media attention. The coverage sparked worldwide anger from many groups, including Jewish organisations.

It was only when cafe owner Henry Mulyana received death threats that he decided to shut SoldatenKaffe, and take down the offending memorabilia. He obviously had a change of heart when he reopened, as the prominent portrait of the Nazi dictator, posters, quotes and three iron eagles bearing swastikas, still remained. As well as the questionable surroundings, at the cafe's launch men dressed in Nazi uniforms and others as prisoners of war.

Mulyana insists that there is no reason for anyone to be offended and the cafe's Facebook page insists it is not pro-Nazi. It states: 'It is matter of fact, with the intention of exploring Hitler & the NAZIS as pop culture. The authors of the web page are not Nazis or neo-Nazis.'

"A man who has fathered 34 children with 17 different women has landed his own reality series, which is due to start airing on Oprah Winfrey's OWN network in September. Jay Williams, from Atlanta, previously featured in an episode of Iyanla: Fix My Life, another of the channel's hit shows, which sees spiritual life coach Iyanla Vanzant, trying to help different people all struggling with various aspects of their lives. The untitled new series will follow the seemingly irresponsible father as he tries to establish new connections with his children, who are thought to be aged between three and 27, and their mothers. Scroll down for video . Father of many: Jay Williams (pictured) has fathered 34 children, who are thought to range in age from three to 27, with 17 women . Bad dad: The video producer appeared on OWN series Iyanla: Fix My Life in September last year (pictured) A spokesperson from OWN said this 'extreme situation' will challenge Jay's intentions to live up to his responsibilities. Any fans of Iyanla's show couldn't fail to recognize Jay - who was one of the series' most controversial characters. When the video producer appeared on the show in September last year, he was lambasted by the life coach for failing to undergo a vasectomy - despite fathering so many children, who had, as of October 2014, already made him a grandfather three times. 'So let me ask you this question, Jay,' Iyanla said during the episode. '34 children. At any point, did it dawn on you this is too much?' The straight-talking life coach also forced Jay to sit down with four of his children and explain to them why he had 'dropped them' and failed to live up to his responsibilities as a father. 'I would like to confess that I absolutely did not love or care for myself at all,' he explained to the group of four. Tough love: The straight-talking life coach demanded that Jay own up to the mistakes that he has made, both as a father and as a man . No trust: Four of Jay's children appeared on the show (pictured) when their father tried to offer up an explanation for his behavior and apologize for not being there for them . 'I have not honored your mothers as women the way that I should have. I would never say willingly, but I absolutely fell short on my responsibilities to you as a provider, at times. 'And the biggest thing that I would like to confess is that I absolutely did not live up to be the true man that I am and the father that you really have. I am responsible for the reason why each and every one of you absolutely don't know me.' But despite Jay insisting that his sentiments were completely and utterly heart-felt, it seemed his sentiments came too little too late for some of his children. 'I just want you to know that I really don't care anymore,' one of his daughters told him. 'I'm just not buying it.' Ironically, despite admitting to fathering numerous children, Jay insisted to Iyanla throughout the show that he did use condoms - and even added that, had he chosen not to use contraception, he 'probably would have had 200 kids'. Indeed, Jay went as far as to say that he was 'happy' about the number of children that he had fathered, remarking that he hadn't chosen to get a vasectomy because he 'didn't want one'.","Jay Williams, from Atlanta, previously featured on an episode of the channel's hit series Iyanla: Fix My Life .

'While I was brainstorming, I came up with the idea of being that rabbit that we see in practice and in rescues that is treated as we used to believe was ok. 'The rabbits that live in a small hutch with no space or stimulation, with a poor diet which often leads to dental problems, no company of fellow rabbits, generally just a bit of a miserable existence.'

She said: 'I was hoping that doing it this way is just silly enough to grab a bit of attention and make a few people think if there were some little changes they could make to improve life for their pet just a little. 'Rabbits are such misunderstood pets - they are still often seen as a child first pet, but they are really not suitable for this, they are nervous creatures that can, if handled improperly, even fracture their own spine. 'They need space, time, another bonded rabbit for company, vaccinations and, when ill, can go downhill very quickly. 'Rabbits are the third most popular pet in the UK, yet the most neglected - which is not simply due to cruelty, it is often a misunderstanding of their needs and they are really beloved pets.

"Robin Paul, a manager at a medical center from veterans in Indianapolis has been removed from her $80,000 post over an email that mocked the mental health of returning combat veterans . A manager at a medical center from veterans in Indianapolis has been removed from her $80,000 position over an email that mocked the mental health of returning combat veterans. Robin Paul, a manager at the Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center, sent the email making light of mental health issues and patient's suffering to her staff on December 18. It featured a series of photos of a Christmas elf posing as one of the hospital's patients, pleading for Xanax and hanging itself with an electrical cord. Paul oversees a staff of more than 30 health care professionals in the Seamless Transition Integrated Care Clinic, which is responsible for assisting new veterans with their VA benefits, services and programs, to include mental health. The email was forward to The Indianapolis Star, who reported it on Monday and the next day Paul was placed on paid administrative leave pending further investigation. Paul's boss Tom Mattice described the email as 'completely and totally unacceptable.' 'It in no way reflects the attitudes of our staff toward our patients. We take great pride in the quality of care and the empathetic outreach we provide to the veterans we have the honor of serving,' he said. The email is more bad news for the VA which is already reeling from a scandal last year, when it was revealed that hospitals and clinics across the country had manipulated data to downplay long patient wait times. There has been outcry from a number of veterans groups, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 'All we want for the VA to do is to be able to fix what's broken, to hold employees appropriately accountable and help restore the faith of veterans in their VA health care system, and this one employee, this one supervisor, violated all three of those,' said Joe Davis, Director of Public Affairs. Scroll down for video . One photo featured a Christmas elf posing as one of the hospital's patients hanging itself with an electrical cord . The national commander of the organization demanded that Paul should be immediately removed. 'There is nothing amusing about 22 veterans committing suicide every day,' said John Stroud. 'And it is absolutely inexcusable that a VA supervisor would make light of any issue that veterans face.' Yet despite the email being sent more than two months ago, bosses only suspended Paul once it was leaked to the media. 'This inappropriate email needs to be taken very seriously,' said U.S. Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. 'An immediate independent investigation should occur to determine proper disciplinary action.' VA officials haven't say how long the investigation will take and if all the results will be made public. 'I ask Veterans to accept my apology for this failure,' Mattice said. 'And to allow us to continue to demonstrate to you our commitment to your health and well-being.'

"There has long been tradition for mothers to pass on beauty lessons to their daughters. But now, mums are just as likely to ask their daughters for advice — particularly because the boom in online beauty bloggers means that young people have access to professional techniques at their fingertips. All you need to do is Google ‘smoky eye’ and you’ll find dozens of videos showing you how to do it. It’s no surprise that these online beauty gurus have legions of followers, and two of the biggest YouTube stars are Norwich-based sisters Sam and Nic Chapman, whose Pixiwoo site has millions of viewers worldwide. When I met the girls, they were quick to credit their mother Judy, 58, with giving them some of the best tips they still follow. Nic (left) and Sam Chapman (right) credit their mother Judy (centre) with giving them some of their best beauty tips which they still follow . Judy, too, loves having make-up artist daughters and readily admits that some of the best tricks she has learned have been from Sam and Nic. With Mother’s Day coming up, I met with Judy, Sam and Nic to learn their top tricks. SAM, 37, AND NIC, 34: MUM HAS TAUGHT US . . . Always remove your make-up. Dirt builds up on the skin throughout the day and it blocks your pores and leads to breakouts. Cleanse thoroughly before bed to remove both dirt and make-up — it will also keep your pillowcases clean! Moisturise twice a day and remember to apply the cream to your neck, too — our neck and hands are often the first places to show signs of ageing but they are nearly always forgotten. Dry skin is common in our family, so for us it’s extra important to moisturise properly. We also use a more intensive treatment in the evening. Mum taught us to stay out of the sun. Too much sunbathing leads to wrinkles and age spots in later life. As a family, we have porcelain-pale skin so have always been cautious about lying out in the midday sun. Have your eyebrows shaped professionally. Overplucking can give you a startled appearance and once you have made a brow mistake, it can take years for them to grow back. Finally, the best tip we’ve learned is to drink plenty of water. Alongside the obvious health benefits, staying hydrated shows in our skin, too. It helps to flush out toxins and improve moisture. JUDY CHAPMAN: MY DAUGHTERS TAUGHT ME . . . Choose the correct moisturiser for your skin type. It’s easy to just grab any one, but you need to make sure you are using something that is tailored to your skin. I am lucky because the girls help me shop for foundation. However, if you struggle to choose the correct shade you should try it along your jawbone and then go outside into the daylight to check how well it blends into your skin. Nic (left) and Sam (right) say their mum, Judy (centre), taught them to stay out of the sun and drink plenty of water as it helps to flush out toxins and improve moisture . Thin eyebrows can be so ageing and mine are a little overplucked from embracing the thin brow trend in the Seventies. Now the girls have taught me how to cheat my way to fuller brows with a brow pencil, I have a more youthful look. The importance of blending with a foundation brush cannot be underestimated. I couldn’t be without my Real Techniques Expert Face Brush (£9.99, Boots). The wide, firm bristles make it easier to apply and smooth foundation. Finally, use an eyeshadow primer. My eyelids are quite oily and my eyeshadow often creases, so when Sam and Nic taught me to layer eye products, starting with an eyeshadow primer, it totally changed my look.

"NHS hospitals are becoming ‘dangerously’ overcrowded and staff do not have enough time to clean-up between patients, experts warn. Some wards are more than 95 per cent full - well over the 85 per cent considered safe – placing patients at far higher risk of infections and neglect. A report by the Kings Fund today also warns that standards across the NHS including hitting waiting times and financial targets have slipped for the first time in 20 years. NHS hospitals are becoming ‘dangerously’ overcrowded and targets for waiting times are slipping, experts warn . The think-tank predicts there is a ‘real risk’ patient care will worsen next year because the health service is running out of money. Its experts are particularly concerned that many hospitals are becoming so overcrowded their wards are unsafe. Figures show that the average NHS hospital is 90 per cent full but in the last three months to December almost a fifth were more than 95 per cent occupied. This is partly because many hospitals have lost beds and closed wards as part of a long-term drive to treat more patients at home. John Appleby, chief economist at the Kings Fund, called the report 'worrying' The numbers of beds has halved in 26 years from around 300,000 in 1987/8 to 150,000 last year. But over that time, the numbers of frail patients being admitted to hospital from A&E has increased and they are being packed onto crowded wards where there is a high turnover. John Appleby, chief economist at the Kings Fund said: ‘That is very worrying.’ ‘There is clearly pressure in the system to use beds more intensively as the money is tighter, but patients keep turning up at the front door. ‘If they are used too intensively you haven’t got time to clean up between patients. ‘The pressure is building and bubbling out in terms of bed occupancy levels which are getting dangerously high.’ ‘There are potential dangers with infections and not having enough time to clean beds.’ The report also warns that targets for waiting times in A&E, cancer treatment and other operations and procedures have been repeatedly missed over the last year. And it predicts the waits may well get even longer next year as hospitals just do not have enough money to ensure patients are treated promptly. The NHS will have overspent its budget by more than £800 million by the end of this financial year and half of hospitals will be in the red. Mr Appleby added: ‘The next Government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ‘While the NHS has performed well in the face of huge challenges, there is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming. Andy Burnham MP, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said the report was proof that David Cameron had ‘broken’ his promise to protect the NHS . ‘Our assessment is it's going to be very difficult indeed next year. ‘My speculation would be that once the system is under pressure financially next year as well, we're going to see some real problems with waiting times and that's going to have to be addressed, and patients will really feel that. Andy Burnham MP, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said the report was proof that David Cameron had ‘broken’ his promise to protect the NHS. ‘What this report reveals, is that he is on course to create a large deficit in the NHS. ‘Hospitals are now trapped in a financial vicious circle with bills for agency staff running out of control and staff failing to keep pace with demand.’ Clive Turner, 74  died last year after waiting five hours for an ambulance only to be misdiagnosed at hospital . Lilly Baxandall, 95, died after waiting four hours in a queue of ambulances at Glan Clwyd Hospital, North Wales. A coroners hearing was told Miss Baxandall’s cleaner dialled 999 on September 1 last year when she found her on the floor after a fall. She had a cut on her head but was still conscious. Paramedics arrived soon after and she was transported to hospital in an ambulance two hours later. But Coroner John Gittins said, there was evidence to suggest 11 ambulances were queuing outside A&E waiting to discharge patients. ‘Over the course of the next few hours she began to decline and paramedics were becoming concerned at the delay in admission,’ he said. By the time she was finally admitted to the Bodelwyddan hospital, four hours later, her family said it was too late. A post-mortem examination found she died of pneumonia due to bleeding on the brain, caused by the head injury. The coroner also referred to the death of Clive Turner, 73. In March 2014, retired engineer Mr Turner called an ambulance after  suffering internal bleeding. But it was five hours before he was admitted to hospital where he was then misdiagnosed. He died the following day.","A new report has said hospitals are becoming ‘dangerously’ overcrowded .

"Often naked: Gerard Leeper has been identified as the serial nudist in Charlotte, North Carolina . A serial nudist whose regular spells lounging naked in his front door have horrified neighbors has been arrested four times before for indecent exposure. Gerard Leeper, who routinely stands au naturel at his front doorway in Charlotte, North Carolina, has reportedly kept up the habit for a decade - bringing him up close and personal with the law several times. However, due to the nuances of North Carolina's criminal code, Leeper's nudity is not actually illegal - and three out of four charges he faced were dropped. Exasperated police in the city have even suggested lobbying the North Carolina General Assembly to change the law and criminalize Leeper's naked ways, the Charlotte Observer reported. As it stands, the state's indecent exposure law requires 'willfully exposing the private parts of his or her person in any public place and in the presence of any other person or persons'. As Leeper's home is not a 'public place', he isn't committing a crime. However, a police spokesman said they want to change the law to include 'a place that can be readily observed by the public' - like a front door. Scroll down for video . A man in a Charlotte, North Carolina, neighborhood has annoyed his neighbors for ten years by standing at his front door completely naked several times a week . Leeper's latest bout of nudity was exposed by the WBTV news station. One neighbor, Pecolia Threatt, said: 'I was rolling out the trash can on Friday and I just happened to look over there and he was standing there buck naked.' Police have reportedly been called to Leeper's home four times already in 2015. He has been charged with indecent exposure four times, though the dates are unclear. One charge, in 2006, was successful, and landed Leeper in jail for ten days. He has also reportedly been convicted for violating a protective order, resisting a public officer and communicating threats. Of the situation, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said: 'We are currently looking at the unique facts in this case... 'In all likelihood we will be approaching the legislature with a recommendation that the law be amended to include not only a public place, but a place that can be readily observed by the public'. Homeowners in the area were due to hold a crisis meeting about Leeper on Monday, but were keeping the media out.

"The results of an experiment on the ISS to monitor how ants cope with zero-gravity has been published. Researchers found they managed surprisingly well, using other ants or the surfaces and walls as anchors to climb. However, their ability to search collectively did not go perfectly as they tumbled and fell while trying to explore. Scroll down for video . A team in California studied ants in zero gravity on the ISS. Astronauts were asked to monitor the ants in eight habitats on the station. Nasa astronaut Rick Mastracchio is seen here observing the activities of the Ants In Space CSI-06 investigation aboard the International Space Station . The study, Collective Search by Ants in Microgravity, was published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. The ants were taken to the station in January 2014 and subsequently studied by astronauts on board. Ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules, judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell. Working together, the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies. When the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines, covering more ground. But in the micro gravity of space, the ants' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work. These flexible principles could be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way, for tasks like searching a burning building. ‘We had no idea what the ants would do. We didn't know if they would be able to search at all,’ said Professor Deborah Gordon, a biologist at Stanford University, to the BBC. The experiment used eight different habitats in total, with each containing 80 common pavement ants. As barrier doors between the different sections were opened, the ants dispersed to search the new area. The astronauts then recorded the habitats with an HD video camera. A control experiment was carried out on Earth, and the results - perhaps unsurprisingly - showed that those on the ground were much better at searching than those in space. In fact, the ants were not even able to explore the entirety of their habitats in space, as they found it tough to grip and dropped off the surface for up to eight seconds at a time. At any one moment, the researchers found that seven per cent of the ants were floating around. The Ants In Space CSI-06 investigation looked at how an ant colony responds to the extreme environment of microgravity aboard the International Space Station to solve their collective need for resources. Data gathered from this study may help with algorithms for robotics on Earth. ‘The ants did not perform collective search as effectively in microgravity as they did in the ground controls,’ the researchers wrote in their paper. ‘Because ants in microgravity did not use straighter paths or traverse more distance when the area to be searched expanded, they did not search the area thoroughly.’ The researchers noted that one of the reasons the ants struggled to explore their might have been that they were unable to interact with others easily. However, it was not all bad news; the ants showed an ‘impressive ability to walk on the surface in microgravity, and an even more remarkable capacity to regain their contact with the surface once they were tumbling around in the air.’ The ants also made efforts to remain in contact with the surface. The ultimate goal, though, was to see how they could overcome problems in their collective search method - such as in a human-dominated environment - something which the ants adapted to fairly well.

"A raft of 'bizarre'  Victorian-style by-laws banning activities such as selling lucky heather have been introduced by councils . Driving into a retail park after 6pm is now a crime under a raft of 'bizarre' new Victorian-style by-laws introduced by councils. Playing music, skateboarding, drinking alcohol in public and even selling lucky heather are among the activities outlawed by local authorities across the country in a drive to restrict freedom, say critics. A group which campaigns against excessive regulation said the measures introduced in the 2014 Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act had created a 'patchwork of criminal law'. Under Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPOs), an activity that is illegal in one street may not be in the next – creating confusion, the Manifesto Club has claimed. But councils say the orders, which allow them to target anti-social behaviour at a local level, have widespread public support. The orders, a form of Asbo, were first used in December when council chiefs made it a crime for motorists to enter a retail park between 6pm and 6am unless they were using shops or restaurants. The aim was to ban up to 500 boy racers who used the Turner Rise Retail Park in Colchester as a meeting place. Ministers insist the orders are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour, such as spitting and aggressive begging. But some councils are also planning to apply them to the likes of pigeon feeding, 'nuisance parking' and children playing ball games outside schools. Town Hall chiefs in Blackpool want to ban loitering around cash machines and the sale of lucky charms and heather. In Oxford it is now a crime to enter a tower block if you are under the age of 21 unless you live there or are visiting a resident. Council bosses are also trying to ban pigeon feeding and taking your dog off their lead. Playing music, skateboarding and drinking alcohol in public  are among the activities outlawed . Anybody flouting the orders will be liable for a fine, normally ranging from £70 to £100, issued by a police officer, police community support officer, council worker or private security guard employed by the local Town Hall. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Public Spaces Protection Orders ensure that public spaces are not affected by anti-social behaviour so law-abiding people can enjoy them.' But Josie Appleton, director of the Manifesto Club, said: 'These powers are so broad that they allow councils to ban pretty much anything. 'The result is a patchwork of criminal law where something is illegal in one street but not the next. This makes it hard for the public to know what is criminal and what is not. 'These orders will turn towns into no-go zones for homeless people, old ladies feeding pigeons, or anyone else the council views as 'messy' – a return to the meddling and moralism of 19th-century by-laws.' People caught urinating in the streets will have to clean up the mess themselves as part of a groundbreaking new scheme. Instead of being given a fine and facing a court case, offenders will be given the chance to wash the street clean of urine. The plan, which was introduced in December in Eastleigh, Hampshire, is believed to be the first of its kind in the country and has been welcomed by traders. Under the scheme, those responsible can meet with a representative of the town's businesses who explains what it is like to clear up after someone. They also spend several hours cleaning the streets – and avoid a fine of up to £400. One young man who took part in the initiative said: 'I'm ashamed of what I did. I hadn't realised how many people are affected.'","Raft of 'bizarre' Victorian-style by-laws have been introduced by councils .

"The families of three London schoolgirls thought to be in Syria have travelled to Turkey to retrace their steps. School friends Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, left east London for Turkey last month before crossing into an ISIS-controlled area of Syria. The Bethnal Green Academy pupils are feared to have reached the conflict zone to become so-called 'jihadi brides' with ISIS. Scroll down for video . Anguish: The families of three missing London schoolgirls have travelled to Turkey to retrace their steps . Questions: The families hope to find clues that may help them find or even contact their daughters . Emotional: The families went to the Istanbul coach station where the teenagers boarded their bus to Syria . On the journey, their families went first to the Istanbul coach station where the teenagers waited 18 hours in the biting February chill for their bus to the Syrian border. There they spoke to a man who unknowingly let the girls in. He told ITV News they were 'smiling as they arrived' and 'smiling as they left'. Renu Begum, sister of Shamima, told ITV News: 'This is our next step basically to get the message out to them that we've followed them all the way out here. We want them to know that we love them.' Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza, said: 'I don't really recognise my sister, the video and the CCTV that we saw. Because this is just not her and we just want to understand her, you know, to find some answers and get some help.' Abase Hussein, father of Amira, said: 'I don't know how to explain. I can't describe my feelings. I feel like my girl is next to me when I find someone that's on their last journey who saw them. I feel like my daughter is next to me - that's the feelings I have.' Searching for clues: At the bus station, the family spoke to a man who unknowingly let the three girls in . Tears: The families struggle to hide their emotions as they retraced the steps of the London schoolgirls . The families left through the same door as the girls at the bus station, and family lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said: 'Of course they feel responsible for their own children, that goes without saying. 'But the fact is these girls were school children and much of what took place clearly took place at school. Police put a cap on information that they and the school were giving back to the parents.' The east London schoolgirls flew to Istanbul from Gatwick with Turkish Airlines and now believed to be in based in the Syrian town of Raqqa – the Islamic State's self-declared capital. Last week it emerged that Sharmeena Begum, 15, a close friend of the trio and a fellow pupil at Bethnal Green Academy, left Britain before them in December. There are suspicions the trio kept in touch with Sharmeena who passed on information about how to follow in her footsteps. Those closest to all four girls suspect they were groomed by Islamists using social networking sites and secretive internet messaging software. The families have criticised police and others for failing to stop them. But their plight has raised questions about why the families themselves did not spot their conversion to radical Islam. Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has said the three schoolgirls would not face prosecution if they returned home. Familiar route: The families, along with ITV's Rohit Kachroo, flew in to Istanbul from Gatwick . Looking for answers: By retracing the route of the schoolgirls, the families hope it might bring them home . Elsewhere last week, three British teenage jihadists were placed in custody after a dramatic security operation prevented them joining ISIS in Syria. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man, all from North-West London, were intercepted in Turkey after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. Security services say 600 British Muslims have gone to fight in Syria and around 60 of them are young women. They include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months, many of whom wanted to become 'jihadi brides'. ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq, and has attracted thousands of foreign fighters to its cause. Turkey has faced criticism for not controlling its border with Syria, but has accused European states of failing to prevent would-be jihadists from leaving in the first place.","Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, in Syria .

"Victoria Evans, now 28, was just two years old when she experienced her first beating at the hands of her adoptive mother, Eunice Spry. As many little girls do, she had pulled the labels off a collection of tinned food purchased by Spry and left in the kitchen of their Tewkesbury home. But instead of laughing off the mischievous toddler's prank, she 'went mad' and insisted that the little girl to eat the contents of one of the cans, regardless of what was inside. Scroll down for video . Brave: Victoria Evans was viciously abused for more than 19 years by her foster mother Eunice Spry . The contents turned out to be cat food and the toddler, retching and crying, threw up. Spry's response? Instead of a hug, she forced the child to eat the vomit as well. The incident heralded what would turn into more than 19 years of abuse at the hands of a woman described as 'Britain's most sadistic mother'. Victoria, and her siblings Christopher and Alloma, were subjected to a catalogue of appalling abuse at their foster mother's hands, while her own biological daughter Judith and adopted daughter Charlotte, were pampered and well-cared for. Now, all three children have spoken out for the first time and appear in the latest episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos which will be screened just months after Spry's release from prison. Spry, who was initially jailed for 14 years for her crimes in 2007, first had the tariff reduced to 12 years by the High Court and was released last summer after serving just half of her sentence. Depraved: Spry, pictured left after her arrest, meted out horrific abuse to her children. Victoria is pictured. Appalling: One of the cruel injuries inflicted on the children by twice-married Jehovah's Witness Spry . In a cruel twist, the evil foster mother was rehomed close to the scene of her crimes - and within a few miles of her victims own homes. ‘Why do criminals have more rights than their victims? She has served her punishment but mine will never leave me,' says Mrs Evans. ‘When she was sent to prison I felt safe for the first time in my life. I was so happy that she couldn’t hurt me any more. 'I never want to see her again and I do not want her living anywhere near me. I do not think I am asking for a lot.' Spry's crimes began shortly after she was given approval by social services to become a foster mother. The three children, all toddlers, duly arrived. At first, all seemed well but as the months went by, devout Jehovah's Witness Spry began to show a hitherto unnoticed dark side. Ruined: Christopher Spry, who was tied to a van and dragged around a field by Spry, calls her a 'psycho' Shocking: As a toddler, Victoria was made to eat catfood and then her own vomit when she threw it up . Beaten: Like her brother and sister, Alloma Gilbert was viciously beaten with 'a variety of sticks' by evil Spry . 'She thought I was demonised or that I was working in Satan's name and that we were the devil's offspring,' says Christopher Spry. 'We were always told that Satan looked after his own.' As the abuse escalated, Spry began to haunt the children even when they were at school, insisting that they tell no one what was happening to them and ordering them to present a happy appearance to teachers. 'She told me not to tell the teachers anything, and that she would know,' explains Alloma Gilbert. 'I was questioned several times by my teacher. I wouldn't tell her much and said I was happy.' But their troubles, which included being forced to stand against the wall for hours on end and eat branflakes soaked with linseed oil, were about to become much worse. Concerned that teachers were becoming suspicious, Spry decided to relocate to an isolated farm on the edge of the village of Eckington. Once there and with no one to see what was going on, the abuse worsened with the three children forced to sleep in the barn, while the others, Judith and Charlotte, slept in their own bedrooms in the house. 'Victoria and I lived in an old mobile home, and it had no electric, had no water,' recalls Mr Spry. 'We used to use a hose pipe to try and clean ourselves. 'Half the time, I'd be sleeping out in the field or in the chicken sheds and you'd wake up, and there'd be a rat on your chest. Road to recovery: All three children have written books detailing their abuse at Spry's hands . 'There was very little food, and I used to eat chicken pellets to try and survive.' The children, given next to nothing to eat by Spry, were always hungry but if they did happen to find food, they would find themselves viciously beaten. When some chocolates went missing, the three found themselves on the end of a particularly violent attack, which saw Spry batter them with a chair leg. On another occasion, they had sticks thrust down their throats leaving them in so much pain, they would be unable to swallow. But the worst beating of all was dealt out to Mr Spry who, as a 10-year-old boy, was tied by the feet to Spry's van and dragged at speed across a recently ploughed field. 'I blacked out multiple times,' he says. 'I was bleeding all over, I kept waking up and I was still being dragged. 'Then, she just took the rope off the van at the end, and I couldn't move.  We were in the middle of nowhere, there's no-one to help us, and my siblings came over and dragged me away. 'I can't remember the next few days. I was really lucky to survive. I probably should have died, and I'll tell you what, being dragged around that field, I wish I had. Brave: Alloma initially had to be persuaded to testify against Spry but says her life is better now . Sandpapered: Victoria, whose face was once sandpapered by Spry, escaped aged 18 . 'There is no way to describe how horrific that was. That is my worst memory of being with Eunice Spry.' For Mrs Evans, the worst incident came at the age of 14, when she and Spry's daughters Charlotte and Judith were involved in a fatal car accident. She was the only survivor of the accident, which saw their car crushed between two lorries, and was left first in a coma and then in intensive care for months. But even the hospital was no refuge for the terrified child, with Spry regularly turning up to threaten her with more abuse if she revealed what life on the farm was really like and railing against the twist of fate that had killed her biological daughter but 'left scum like you alive'. Shockingly, when Mrs Evans was offered the chance of physiotherapy, Spry turned it down and forced her to stay in a wheelchair for almost two years - even though she was able to walk. If she tried to get out, she would be beaten. 'If she saw me even try to get up and walk, she would take the feet pieces off my wheelchair and she would slam them into my shins,' says Mrs Evans. 'I wanted to walk, but I couldn't. I was frightened to. Once she pulled me out of the wheelchair by my hair, and then, she got some sandpaper, and she sandpapered my chest and my face.' But the years of abuse were drawing to a close and when Mrs Evans was offered a job as a babysitter, she saw a chance to escape. 'People were seeing me with black eyes, bruises all over my face, my face swollen up, cut,' she explains. 'I was seeing people my age, their mothers treating them with so much respect. I remember people asking, wanting to get their opinion. 'I found that quite eye-opening that these people were allowed an opinion. People my age were allowed choices and opinions.' Eventually, she revealed what had happened to friends and although feeling guilty about the possibility of her foster mother getting into trouble, agreed to tell the police. Her siblings Christopher and Alloma, although initially reluctant, agreed to testify against Spry and in April 2007, the evil foster mother was jailed for 14 years. So shocking was the scale of her crimes, Judge Simon Darwell-Smith told Spry that her 19-year reign of terror was one of the 'worst I've seen in 40 years'. He added: 'Frankly, it's difficult for anyone to understand how any human being could have even contemplated what you did, let alone with the regularity and premeditation you employed.' Tragically, while Spry, now 70, is back on the loose, her foster children are still trying to come to terms with her appalling crimes. 'I've heard her being called Britain's Most Sadistic Mother, and while that is true, that would seem to suggest she was a mother at all, and to me, she doesn't even deserve that,' says Mr Spry. 'A mother wouldn't beat down her own children. A mother could not lack the respect for human life in the way she did. 'She has destroyed everything that she could. She's ruined my life. She's a torturous, evil, twisted person, a psycho and we're very lucky hasn't killed someone.'","Victoria Evans, Christopher Spry and Alloma Gilbert were abused .

"Shocking footage has revealed the moment care home staff were secretly filmed calling an 84-year-old great-grandmother with dementia a 'witch'. Her daughter Maddy Jobson, 50, turned sleuth and hid the camera in a clock at the Keldgate Manor Residential Home, in Beverley, East Yorkshire, after she spotted her mother had bedsores. Footage of the incident shows Alzheimer's sufferer Freda Jobson being degraded by the staff, who ask her if she is a witch, whether she has ever practiced black magic and mimic her groaning noises caused by dementia. Scroll down for video . As Mrs Jobson lies in bed, care home workers (pictured) were heard to ask her if she was a 'witch' and also mimicked the groaning sounds she was making, which were caused by her dementia . They can also be heard swearing in front of her and are alleged to have removed a bandage used to cover a bedsore on her elbow and wrap it around her head while laughing. Ms Jobson said: 'I am disgusted and sickened. I haven't slept a wink since I saw the footage. 'What if their actions had caused her heart to stop? Would we have just thought mother died peacefully in her sleep? It does not even bear thinking about. 'There's a sign on the door of the home that states, ""Dignity, Respect and Care"". But where was the dignity, respect and care for my 84-year-old mother? 'Our family put its trust in those who are supposed to be professional carers. All we wanted was end-of-life dignity and care for my mother.' Humberside Police, the Care Quality Commission and the East Riding of Yorkshire Safeguarding Adults are carrying out a joint investigation. Freda Jobson (pictured), 84, suffers from Alzheimer's and her care is funded by East Riding Council . In the footage, three female staff members are seen leaning over Mrs Jobson's bed and mimicking the noise she makes and laughing. One of the women is heard to say, 'Don't she look like a gypsy witch?' She then adds: 'I bet you are into black magic. Are you a witch? Are you a witch?' Mrs Jobson, whose late husband George was a Freeman of Beverley, worked nightshifts at care homes in the town, including Figham House and Molescroft. Her care is funded by East Riding Council. Shortly after arriving at the home in 2010, Mrs Jobson began suffering from bedsores, which are caused by prolonged pressure to the skin. Her daughter, who works at Educare, a nursery in Mill Lane, Beverley, had watched a programme about spy cameras used in homes. She said: 'I thought: Why haven't I done that? I wanted to know my mother was being properly looked after. I thought it would put my mind at rest.' 'We watched the footage on Tuesday on my laptop,' she said. 'I was livid when I saw it and I went straight round to the home and demanded to see a senior member of staff.' Ms Jobson says she confronted Paul Raper, director of the home, and his wife Jane. His mother, Cecilia Raper, owns the facility. 'I exploded,' said Ms Jobson. 'How long has this been going on for?' Management at the home declined to comment. Lynsey Howes, of Hamer's Solicitors, which is acting on behalf of Keldgate Manor, said: 'The home is co-operating with external agencies investigating the allegations.'

David Fryer, regional engagement manager for the Care Quality Commission, which inspects homes across Britain, said: 'We are aware of the video footage taken by the family of a resident at Keldgate Manor and the significant concerns this has raised. 'We are in close liaison with the local authority safeguarding team, the police, and the provider to ensure these issues are investigated thoroughly and appropriate action is taken as required. 'Our priority will always be to ensure that people are safe and that their needs are being met and where we identify any risk to people living at the home we have a range of enforcement powers we can use.' A Humberside Police spokesman said: 'We will be undertaking a joint investigation with East Riding of Yorkshire Safeguarding Adults to establish whether there are any incidents of abuse at Keldgate Manor Care Home.'","The care home staff were caught on camera calling 84-year-old a 'witch'

"An army sergeant has been cleared of attacking a fellow soldier after he thought he heard him call his wife fat. Afghanistan veteran Edward Keteca told service police he had heard Gunner Gary Doyle say 'something derogatory' about his wife Aimee as they walked home from an officer's mess party. The court heard that the 35-year-old then hit a female colleague who had attempted to break up the resulting drunken brawl at Larkhill Royal Artillery Barracks near Salisbury, in Wiltshire. Afghanistan veteran Edward Keteca (pictured leaving court with his wife Aimee) told service police he heard a fellow soldier call Mrs Keteca fat . Sgt Keteca claimed he had been worried the Gnr Doyle and the 'prominent bunch' of soldiers who had been out drinking with him in nearby Amesbury until 1.30am, might do something to his wife. He said: 'He (Gnr Doyle) turned and said something derogatory about my wife so we exchanged words on that. 'Until today I keep trying to remember what he said to me but he did say something to me because we stood there exchanging words. 'That's when the scuffle started. Words had been said and that's all led to one thing after another.' Sgt Ketaca claimed had heard Gunner Gary Doyle (pictured) call his wife fat and the two became involved in a drunken brawl . Bulford Military Court Centre heard that Gnr Doyle's comrades Gnr Samantha Palmer and Bombardier Andrew Radford had attempted to break up the drunken scuffle. After he being pulled away from Gnr Doyle, the court was told that Sgt Keteca had floored Gnr Palmer, 26, who got back up and told him: 'I'm a girl. You've just hit me.' The female gunner had to be taken to hospital the next day for treatment of a swollen eye. But the sergeant claimed he had struck her in self-defense after the 6ft tall, 17 stone rugby player grabbed his shoulders from behind. He told the court martial he punched her to free himself without realising she was a female. He said: 'I do accept making contact with the person coming from behind and I feel bad. 'I wasn't really sure what his intentions were - female or male. 'I was thinking about safety to myself and because I had my wife there as well. Who's to say they wouldn't do something to my wife?' Sgt Keteca's wife of six years Aimee, 29, added that the main aggressors in the incident on February 22 last year were the other soldiers. The mother-of-two said: 'The men jumped on my husband and they got involved in fisticuffs. 'My husband was being kicked the c*** out of on the ground. 'I was quite upset and I was thinking 'what's going to happen to my husband?' He was on the ground being kicked and punched. 'My husband was defending himself. He had men kicking and punching him and he was doing what any normal person would do.' Sgt and Mrs Keteca were described as a 'calm, happy couple' by comrades who knew them at Larkhill for over a year, who also labelled Sgt Keteca 'professional, reliable and highly respected'. Under cross examination, Gnr Doyle admitted describing Mrs Keteca as 'large' but denied calling her 'fat' or anything on the night of the incident. Gnr Doyle, of the 101 Regiment Royal Artillery, said: 'I never spoke no words. He just lunged towards me and I thought 'hang on'. 'He struck me a few times and I put my hands up to defend myself and we got into a big of a scuffle. 'I ended up falling over as he's hit me.' Gnr Doyle's comrades Gnr Samantha Palmer and Bombardier Andrew Radford (pictured) had attempted to break up the fight . Afghanistan veteran Edward Keteca (left) told service police he heard a fellow soldier say 'something derogatory' about his wife Aimee (right) as they left an officer's mess party . He added: 'It was a bit pathetic - it was just two drunken men.' Gnr Palmer - now a Lance Bombardier in the 265 Battery - had cried as she recalled being hit for the first time in her life. She told the court martial: 'People have a choice in life and I have never hit anybody so why should anybody hit me?' L Bdr Palmer, who denied making  derogatory remarks about Mrs Keteca, said the sergeant had thrown 'sloppy' and 'drunken' punches at Bdr Radford once he had also stepped in. She added that the case would never have come to court had she received an apology over the incident. 'One little apology and the person's career wouldn't be on the line,' she said. The drunken brawl happened at Larkhill Royal Artillery Barracks near Salisbury, in Wiltshire (pictured) Sgt Keteca always accepted he hit Gnr Palmer but but denied affray on the grounds of self defence. Today he was cleared by a board of three officers who deliberated for a little over an hour and joked with his defence barristers about sharing a bottle of champagne with his wife to celebrate. Sgt Keteca, of the 14th Regiment Royal Artillery, declined to make any further comment outside court.","Sgt Edward Keteca had been cleared of attacking two of his fellow soldiers .

"In a heartbreaking love letter written to mark their 13th wedding anniversary, the wife of real-life American Sniper Chris Kyle has described the moment her future husband gave her two dozen roses during one of their first dates. Taya Kyle pledged to love her late husband 'all the days of my life' in the touching tribute posted on social media two days ago. Kyle, who was the subject of last year's Clint Eastwood-directed movie American Sniper, was gunned down by fellow war veteran Eddie Ray Routh at a shooting range in Rough Creek, Texas, on February 2, 2013. Taya Kyle, pictured with her late husband Chris, posted the letter on her husband's public Facebook page . Chris Kyle (pictured in 2012) was gunned down at a Texas shooting range by a fellow army veteran . That day, Kyle had offered to help Routh deal with his post traumatic stress disorder but was instead shot dead along with his friend Chad Littlefield. Now, in the wake of a turbulent year that involved her husband's killer's trial and an appearance at the Academy Awards for the film made in his name, Mrs Kyle has written of her enduring love for her husband. Posted on Facebook, her letter said: 'I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life. 'Today, I am thinking of our new relationship, when you rented a boutique hotel room in San Diego and surprised me with two dozen long stem pink roses when we arrived. You got us tickets to a local improv type play. I knew then I was the luckiest girl in the world to be with tough, romantic, loving you. 'Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you. Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty. 'I am somewhere in between today. I loved you yesterday, I love you know, and I will love you all the days of my life.' Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller (pictured) portrayed the couple in the 2014 Oscar-nominated film American Sniper . Eddie Ray Routh (pictured) was last month convicted of double murder and sentenced to life in prison . Kyle was considered the deadliest sniper in American history, with his kill count thought to number about 160 confirmed, with many more probable kills. Routh was convicted on February 28 of double murder and as prosecutors decided not to pursue the death penalty, the only possible sentence was life in prison - with no chance of parole. The verdict, which took little more than two hours for jurors to reach, came as interest in Kyle's career as the U.S. military's deadliest-ever sniper reached fever pitch. Kyle's exploits in the Iraqi desert were showcased to tens of millions of Americans just days before, when American Sniper, the movie based on his bestselling autobiography, featured at the Oscars, where it was nominated for six awards. Chris and Taya Kyle pictured together in April 2012. Mrs Kyle has described one of their early dates in a heartbreaking love letter written to mark what would have been their 13th wedding anniversary . 'Hey babe, . 'It's 13 years today. Our wedding anniversary. I miss you and I love you. I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life. 'Today, I am thinking of our new relationship, when you rented a boutique hotel room in San Diego and surprised me with 2 dozen long stem pink roses when we arrived. You got us tickets to a local improv type play. I knew then I was the luckiest girl in the world to be with tough, romantic, loving you. 'I am thinking of the way you loved to blow the budget on gifts for me with that huge smile on your face and eyes lit up... so much so that my heart would leap out of my chest as I was simultaneously shocked and delighted even when I had no idea how we would afford it. I'm sorry I sometimes voiced my concern about the price. 'I am also thinking of how grateful I finally learned how to not balk at the money spent on your generous gifts. I am thinking of November 2012 when you sent me a dozen long stem red roses with a card that said ""just because"" and how you had them delivered even though we were home together that day. You just wanted to surprise me. You did and it made my day like you made so many others. 'Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you. Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty. I am somewhere in between today. 'And if I didn't tell you enough in life, then let me tell you today... YOU Chris Kyle, are IT for me. YOU are the package deal who makes hanging on worth it.

"Some nations are developing swarms of small drones for combat, spying on warzones as well as dropping payloads. But Russia has reportedly set its sights on a supersonic behemoth, which could strike terror into the hearts of any enemies in the future. Called the PAK TA, the conceptual aircraft is designed to carry troops and tanks at supersonic speeds and could take to the skies as early as 2024. But some commentators say it’s unlikely that the plans will get off the ground. Scroll down for video . A conceptual aircraft called PAK TA (illustrated by Alexey Komarov, Customer and Technical Manager at Volga-Dnepr Group) could be used to deploy Russian troops anywhere in the world in just seven hours . The concept comes from the country’s Military-Industrial Commission, RT reported, and the design, drawn by a technical manager at Volga-Dnepr Group, shows a futuristic, plane with a cavernous fuselage complete with a large opening and jagged wings. The plane is an unusual shape because it is intended to carry up to eight Armata tanks - which have yet to be built – complete with ammunition to anywhere in the world at supersonic speeds. It would fly at speeds of over 1,200mph (2,000km/h) despite carrying a payload of up to 200 tonnes (200,000kg) with a range of more than 4,350 miles (7,000km). The plane is an unusual shape because it is intended to carry up to eight Armata tanks - which have yet to be built – complete with ammunition to ‘anywhere in the world’ at supersonic speeds. This illustration shows a cavernous opening at the back of the aircraft . The programme envisages that 80 of these new aircraft (illustrated) would be built by 2024, enabling Russia to be able to drop a ready-made army wherever it may be needed in under seven hours . Conceptual: The PAK TA aircraft is only a concept. Purpose: The aircraft is designed to carry troops and tanks at supersonic speeds, so that a small army could be deployed anywhere in the world in just seven hours. Speed: The plane would fly at supersonic speeds of over 1,200mph (2,000km/h). Payload: Up to 200 tonnes (2 million kg) which is enough for several tanks and ammunition. Range: More than 4,350 miles (7,000km). Power: A video hints that the plane could be partially electric. Timing: The PAK TA programme envisages that 80 of the aircraft would be built by 2024. The speed is comparable to that of a light fighter jet, leading some commentators to brand the plans improbable and more of a flight of fancy than a serious plan. The top speed of the US’ largest transport plane – the C-5M Super Galaxy – is 518mph (834km/h) PopSci reported. The design, imagined by an employee of a Russian aircraft company, also hints that if the plane were to be built, it would be partially powered by electricity. While batteries  can power small electric planes, the technology is unlikely to develop quickly enough to drive a huge supersonic craft, like the PAK TA. The programme envisages that 80 of these new aircraft would be built by 2024, enabling Russia to be able to drop a ready-made army wherever it may be needed in under seven hours, Expert Online reported. The vehicles could load cargo autonomously and be able to airdrop tanks and men onto tricky terrain. The aircraft (illustrated) would fly at speeds of over 1,200mph (2,000km/h) despite carrying a payload of up to 200 tonnes (2million kg) with a range of more than 4,350 miles (7,000km) The design (pictured) also hints that if the plane were to be built, it would be partially powered by electricity. So while batteries and electric batteries can power small planes, the technology is unlikely to develop quickly enough to drive a huge supersonic craft, like the PAK TA . ‘With the development of a network of military bases in the Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia, which is expected to be completed during the same time period [by 2024], it’s obvious that Russia is preparing for a full-scale military confrontation of transcontinental scale,’ Expert Online reported. The PAK TA project is thought to have been underway for several years and is designed to replace the current generation of air freighters - Ilyushin and Antonov cargo aircraft. The only operating aircraft that can carry a comparable amount of weight is the Antonov An-225 Mriya, which is a one-off and is built for the Soviet Buran space shuttle programme.","PAK TA plane is a conceptual aircraft intended to carry 200 tonnes .

"There's nothing more embarrassing than waking up at someone else's place and having to step out in yesterday's outfit. But now there's a perfect solution to those morning after woes - a top that can be worn 24 different ways in a variety of colours, without the use of any zips, ties or buttons. The Morf shirt is the brainchild of Israeli-based designer Tamara Salem, who came up with the idea as a way of bringing a playful element to her wardrobe and getting more use out of key pieces. Scroll down for video . The future of fashion? The Morf top, which was invented by Israeli-based designer Tamara Salem, can be worn 24 different ways thanks to a clever double-layered construction . Tamara told MailOnline that her invention was 'almost accidental'. 'I was making a shirt as a gift for my best friend's birthday, and I had this vague idea for a multi-layer top with a black front and white back,' she said. 'But only when I actually held it in my hands, I discovered I could flip it and get a totally black shirt, and then flip it again and get an all-white shirt. I realised then how many different options this structure offered,' she explained. A mesmerizing video on the project's Kickstarter page, which has raised a whopping $35,600 so far, shows just how the shirt works with the clever use of double-layer construction. No more outfit repeats: The shirt, which comes in red, blue or green and costs $80 (about £52), is billed as the perfect solution to a morning after situation . The model in the video begins by wearing the top in plain black with a deep V-neck with grey panels on the sleeves. Then she pulls it off inside-out and puts it back on, and this time it has black and white stripes in the front and plain black sleeves. When she rolls up the sleeves, they miraculously become a bright shade of blue. Later, she turns the top inside-out yet again and it becomes grey with a neckline in black and monochrome stripes on the back. All in all, the top can be worn up to 24 different ways, providing almost an entire month of styles using just one piece of clothing. 'I believe that fashion is all about change, inviting us to re-invent ourselves,' said Tamara. 'I hope to get the attention of women who enjoy being unexpected and ever-changing.' Versatile: 'I believe that fashion is all about change, inviting us to re-invent ourselves,' said Tamara . Wear it everywhere: The Morf is so versatile, it can be worn for all types of activities - from walking the dog to going to work and then transitioning to night . Tamara says the Morf is so versatile, it can be worn for all types of activities - from walking the dog to going to work and going out on the town at night. 'For the price of a single shirt - you get an entire collection. And did I mention it is a packing and traveling MIRACLE?' she said. The Morf top is currently the most popular fashion project on Kickstarter, with 466 backers. It comes in both male and female sizes in red, blue or green, and will cost $80 (about £52) when it officially launches online on 29 April.","Morf top can be worn 24 different ways thanks to double-layered design .

"Nigel Farage today lost another UKIP election candidate who has quit the party in protest at 'unforgivable racist abuse' from a senior MEP. Tim Wilson rounded on Mr Farage for ignoring the widespread condemnation of Scotland MEP David Coburn, who recently compared a Muslim minister in the Scottish Government to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza. In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson, who was due to stand for UKIP in South Northamptonshire – and was tipped to come second behind the Tories – claimed he has been 'forbidden to speak about Islam favourably' by party bosses. Ukip leader Nigel Farage defended Ukip MEP David Coburn who compared a Muslim minister in the Scottish Government to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza. Ukip candidate Tim Wilson rounded on Mr Farage for ignoring the widespread condemnation of the remark . The move has piled more pressure on Mr Coburn to resign and comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the 'racist filth' in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland. UKIP has also lost two other General Election candidates in recent days in separate incidents. MEP Janice Atkinson was expelled after her chief of staff was filmed allegedly attempting to make fraudulent expense claims. The party's candidate for Scunthorpe Stephen Howd, was suspended last week following an 'alleged incident at his workplace'. Mr Coburn's recent controversial comment was made during a telephone conversation with the Scottish Daily Mail earlier this month, in which he spoke about his appearance on BBC Two show The Big Immigration Debate. He claimed that SNP Europe and International Development minister Humza Yousaf was supposed to appear on the programme, and said: 'Humza Yousaf, or as I call him, Abu Hamza, didn't seem to turn up.' Ukip's only Scottish MEP David Coburn is facing calls to resign . Mr Coburn has since apologised for the remark and Mr Farage has dismissed it as a 'joke in poor taste', adding today: 'That's David… that's the way he is.' But Mr Wilson told the Mail: 'What Coburn said is unforgiveable - it's racist abuse. It doesn't matter whether it was a private comment, or a public comment, this man has public office and he needs to filter the ridiculous thoughts that come from his brain. 'He should be dismissed from UKIP and held to account.' He added: 'Mr Farage cannot dismiss something like this as a joke. You can't toss this thing off as a joke with a pint of beer. It's unacceptable. 'If a leader cannot understand that it is the effect of his words not his intention that matters then maybe he too needs to consider his position and I would be the first to welcome Mr Farage into the political wilderness.' In his resignation letter to the local party, seen by the Mail, Mr Wilson wrote: 'Since selection, I have been systematically gagged by the party 'whip' and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably… . 'Ironically, while I am told not to talk positively about Islam, a Scottish MEP and member of UKIP has used appalling language that should never be condoned and that must be described as Islamophobic. Mr Farage has dismissed this as a joke. 'This is a red line, therefore, that has been crossed. This is not a joke to me. 'In an interview today, I have criticised both Mr Farage and the Scottish MEP and for that reason, I cannot and will not represent UKIP at an election. 'However, if the party is to progress, it must certainly deal with the thugs and bullies who currently have positions of power and whose appalling views are both tolerated and/or presented as party policy.' Mr Wilson was selected as the party's candidate in February, and joined UKIP last year after leaving the Tories. Earlier today, UKIP leader Mr Farage continued to defend Mr Coburn. He said: 'What's he done wrong apart from telling a joke in poor taste? 'That's David, he's out there, that's the way he is. There was no malintent in it. ‎It was a joke in very poor taste. I wish he would think a bit more before he tells such jokes again.' Nicola Sturgeon arrives at The Scottish Parliament with Humza Yousaf - described by Ukip's David Coburn as Abu Hamza . But Mr Yousaf, MSP for Glasgow, said: 'UKIP's pathetic response to religious hatred, racism and bigotry has exposed them as a party that is so out of touch with people that even their own senior members are abandoning them. 'I welcome Tim Wilson's resignation. He has demonstrated that he is unwilling to be associated with a party that allows Islamophobia to be rife within its ranks. 'Serious accusations have been made about UKIP actively preventing their members talking positively about Islam. Nigel Farage should heed warnings from his own members and demonstrate that he will not tolerate prejudice in any form by expelling David Coburn without any further delay.' A spokesman for UKIP said: 'Tim Wilson was never gagged or told that he could not speak about Islam. 'When Mr Wilson submitted some videos that he intended to use as a viral campaigning tool, all that his regional officers advised him to do was produce shorter videos focused on national issues such as the NHS, not five minutes or more discussing the nuances of Islam in Britain.'","MEP David Coburn's said he called the SNP's Humza Yousaf 'Abu Hamza'

"Sunrise panellists Elka Whalan and Sally Obermeder have come under fire after suggesting parents had the right to choose whether to vaccinate their kids. Both mums joined host David Koch and commentator Shelly Horton on the program for a spirited debate about vaccination on Wednesday morning. The discussion came just weeks after baby Riley Hughes died in a Perth hospital after suffering complications from whooping cough. In views later labelled 'dangerous and irresponsible', Ms Whalan suggested parents should take anti-vaccination views into consideration. And in a fiery exchange with host David Koch, Ms Obermeder said that parents choose whether or not to vaccinate out of love for their children. Scroll down for video . David Koch, the father of four adult children and a grandfather, was vocal in his defence of vaccination . Fiery debate: Former swimmer Elka Whalan (centre) and Daily Edition host Sally Obermeder said parents should investigate both sides of the vaccination debate. Shelly Horton (left) said parents should 'definitely' vaccinate their children . Under fire: The Daily Edition host Sally Obermeder (pictured left) is the mother of toddler Annabelle, while former swimmer Elka Whalan (right) is pictured while pregnant in 2011 with her husband Thomas Whalan . Ms Whalan said: 'We are hearing this terrible story (about baby Riley) but we are also not hearing figures of people who have also died from being vaccinated as well.' The former Olympic swimmer said she vaccinated her children, adding that people need to 'research both sides of the story'. Ms Obermeder, the host of The Daily Edition and a mother of one, argued: 'Isn't it the parents' right to choose what they want for their child?' 'No parent chooses to do it or not do it because they don't love their child,' she told the panel. 'Parents love their kids, and they make the best decision... (they) think they're making.' Her remarks sparked a heated riposte from David Koch, a grandfather and the dad of four adult children. Koch said parents must depend on the word of experts, not 'Dr Google' (or information parents find online). 'There is no argument,' he said. Ms Obermeder said parents should speak to their doctors about vaccination and that people would then 'probably decide' to vaccinate. 'No parent chooses to do it or not do it because they don't love their child', Ms Obermeder told the panel . Koch (left) said: 'If you talk vaccinations in general, it isn't their decision if it effects somebody else's child... Not if it affects my grandkids'.

Media personality Mia Freedman flayed Elka Whalan for her remarks on Twitter . Media identity Mia Freedman honed in on Ms Whalan's comments on social media, labelling them 'truly dangerous and irresponsible' in a series of Twitter posts. Ms Whalan fired back: '@MiaFreddman every parent & person well educated has the right to research. I am pro vaccine but you must see every side.' The parents of Riley Hughes urged parents to get their children vaccinated earlier this month. After their call, West Australian authorities approved a plan for mums-to-be to receive free whooping cough vaccinations. Around 2500 mums will be eligible to receive the jabs each month. 'Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,' Riley's dad Greg wrote on the family's Facebook page.

"Mike Peters was headed to his job driving veterans to and from outpatient services when he saw a man engulfed in flames 'from his waist to above his head' while standing alongside a suburban Rochester, New York, road. Peters stopped, ran past a woman making futile attempts to pat out the fire and tackled the burning man into an icy snowbank, using handfuls of dirty snow to douse the flames. Peters and two other motorists were credited with saving the life of 84-year-old Christopher Flowers after his clothing caught fire from a cigarette he was smoking while driving on Monday morning. Police and fire officials in the town of Gates said Tuesday that Flowers, of Chili, was driving when the multiple shirts he was wearing caught fire from a dropped lit cigarette. Flowers pulled over and got out of his car as flames spread across his clothing. Officials say three passing motorists — Peters and two women — pulled over to help. Peters said one of the women was trying to knock down the flames with her hands, but wasn't having any success. 'I scooped the guy up and did an end-zone dive into the snowbank,' Peters told The Associated Press. Peters said Flowers was wearing several layers of clothing, including two or three flannel shirts and a couple T-Shirts topped by a hooded sweatshirt. The three rescuers removed the smoldering clothing and wrapped him in a blanket that one of the women had in her trunk. Flowers was hospitalized and listed in guarded condition Tuesday with severe burns to his upper body. Peters believed Flowers pulled over and got out of his car to fish the burning cigarette from his multi-layered clothing, only to have Monday's windy conditions fan the flames to the point they engulfed his entire torso. 'I've just never seen anything like it,' said Peters, a 52-year-old former Army helicopter mechanic from Gates. 'It was like newspapers catching on fire.' Authorities identified the other two rescuers as Deborah Zielinski of Henrietta and Kathy Baleno of Gates.","Christopher Flowers, 84, was driving in Rochester, New York, Monday .

"The most expensive place to spend the night in the United Kingdom has been revealed - and it is not London. Nicknamed the 'home of golf', St Andrews in Scotland has now earned a a new claim to fame as the most costly spot to spend a night in Britain in 2014. Visitors wanting to experience the historic town, which boasts the third oldest university in the UK as well as hosting the Ryder Cup, can expect to cough up £158 per room per night. St Andrews in Scotland has now earned a a new claim to fame as the most costly spot to spend a night in Britain in 2014. Visitors wanting to experience the historic town, which boasts the third oldest university in the UK can expect to cough up £158 per room per night . Hotel rooms were more than £20 cheaper in London than St Andrews with the average costing £136 . This is a five per cent rise from last year where hotel rooms cost £148, according to the latest Hotels.com Hotel Price Index. It was above London, at £136, Oxford at £127, Bath at £120 and Windsor at £118. Only one place in the top 10 the channel island of Jersey, had hotel rooms averaging under £100 a night. It was also the only place in the top 10 to see a decline in hotel prices, dropping 4 per cent on 2013 to £97 per night. The beautiful hilly vistas and historic sights of Bristol proved popular with tourists as the city recorded the greatest increase in hotel prices - a rise of 13 per cent to £87 per night . Growing consumer confidence triggered by the boost in the UK economy of 2.6 per cent in 2014 meant more people were happy to spend on hotel rooms. Coupled with increased foreign tourism, this increase meant average hotel prices paid by all travellers in the UK went up by 2 per cent to £104. Matt Walls, vice president of Hotels.com, said: 'The UK clearly displayed the ability to attract a record number of visitors in 2014. In spite of the increase in the national average room rate, overall prices paid by consumers are still great value, a clear indication that the tourism industry here is in good shape.' North of England seaside destinations like Scarborough provide the best value, with rooms averaging £61 . The beautiful hilly vistas and historic sights of Bristol proved popular with tourists as the city recorded the greatest increase in hotel prices - a rise of 13 per cent to £87 per night. Sporting events also contributed to boosting a city's fortunes with the Commonwealth Games contributing to a 12 per cent increase in Glasgow to £87, while the Tour de France triggered an 8 per cent rise in Leeds to £79. Holidaymakers wanting to escape home without shelling out £100 a night are advised to stick to the North of England. Bradford, the curry capital of Britain, was the best value for money place to stay, with rooms reaching an average of £51 a night. Seaside destinations like Scarborough and Blackpool also proved affordable options, with the average price of hotels at £61 per night. Increases were spread across the country as all but five of the 46 destinations included in the report saw their figures rise. But prices dipped in several holiday favourites with the Cotswolds down 8 per cent to £87 and the Lake District slipping 2 per cent to £86. Canterbury slipping and Sheffield both slipped down by 1 per cent to £84 and £65 respectively. Across the world, the boost in the global economy seen in 2014 was mirrored by a  three per cent rise in the average hotel prices as  consumers became more confident in raising their travel spending. Hotel prices have now experienced five years of steady price rises since they plummeted during the financial collapse of 2008/9. Glasgow saw a boost from the Commonweath Games, with hotel prices increasing by 12 per cent  to £87 . Johan Svanstrom, President of the Hotels.com brand, said: 'Although the Index rose again last year, it is still way behind its peak of seven years ago which is great news for consumers. 'Each year is unique in the travel industry and 2014 was no exception, bringing its own opportunities and challenges. Global events, such as the Winter Olympic Games and World Cup, predictably attracted travellers to new destinations. 'Yet unforeseen tragedies, including the Ebola outbreak, the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 and the loss of MH17 left their own mark.'","St Andrews earns new claim to fame as most costly spot to spend the night .

"A 20 stone woman who worked as a cleaner in a gym has transformed her body after seeking the help of her colleagues - and is now set to start a fitness career of her own. Jade Delaney, 21 from Dublin, Ireland, shed an impressive eight stone after finding another reason to go to the gym other than work. After constantly being surrounded by healthy people, Jade started quizzing the trainers at the gym who agreed to help her with her weight loss. Scroll down for video . Jade Delaney was inspired to drop 8st when she worked as a cleaner in a gym and began quizzing the personal trainers who worked there. Pictured: Jade before weight loss . Before her weight loss Jade was known to locals as the 'chickenball' but she has since adopted a new nickname with people dubbing her the 'shredded chicken'. Pictured after losing eight stone . At her heaviest Jade was dubbed 'chickenball' by people in her local area for her 20st frame - but since losing the weight she has adopted a new nickname - 'shredded chicken'. Jade said that it was working so closely with fitness experts that inspired her to drop to the pounds. 'Being around trainers all the time at work I started asking little questions about food. Then one day one of the trainers gave me a food plan with some basic diet changes,' she said. Jade now heads to the gym at 6:30 am every morning before her cleaning shift . 'Sticking to the plan, I noticed results within a couple of months. After I had my diet sorted the next step for me was getting involved in exercise classes.' Her old lifestyle of snacking throughout the day and lie-ins everyday made Jade pile on the pounds. Sick of being surrounded by fit people Jade began her weight loss in December 2013 and less than a year later had slimmed down to 11st. But Jade has now cut down on high carbohydrate foods such as bread and potatoes and done away with junk food helping her shed the weight. Jade is enrolling in a college in September to study fitness hopes to become a personal trainer herself . As well as swapping her eating regime , she's up at 6:30am every morning in the gym before she starts her cleaning job there later in the day. Jade said she made a conscious effort to surround herself with people who would inspire her to get fit. 'I had to separate myself from certain people who would demotivate me and stick with friends and family who supported me 100% and were positive about fitness. 'Now, I never want to go back to that lifestyle. I want to help people and inspire them to do what I've done.' Rather than rely on scales throughout her weight loss Jade studied her physical appearance and mental state to judge her progress. Pictured: Jade before her weight loss (left) and Jade now (right) Jade, who is enrolling in college in September to study fitness and leisure management, never weighed herself throughout her journey. Instead, she used her physical appearance and mental state to judge how well she was doing. She has also started up her very own fitness blog where every day she posts videos and workouts to help other start their own weight loss journey. Jade said: 'People are too obsessed with checking the scales, if you're training right and eating well you shouldn't have to worry about the scales. 'This time last year I was a completely different person. I feel like I've found my calling. 'I never knew I would have lost all this weight and now I'm on the road to becoming a personal trainer.' Jade added that she wanted to prove to others that anyone can exercise and that the gym should not be avoided. 'I want to tell people there's no need to be afraid of the gym, classes are the best thing to do.

"It was the last resort of a hard-working single mother-of-four who, by her own admission, had 'never asked for anything from anyone'. On Tuesday Helen Campochiaro, 38, of Hudson, Florida, set up an account on Go Fund Me, appealing for support for her family after she was left injured and financially drained by a recent car crash and needed to find a new place to live within two weeks. However on Wednesday night, her 12-year-old son, Kevin Pimental, shot dead his six-year-old brother inside the mobile home he shared with his mother and three siblings, wounded his older brother in the leg, and then turned the gun on himself. Campchiaro was working one of her two jobs at the time. 'The mother's going through an absolute living hell right now,' Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said Thursday. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Kevin Pimentel, 12, shot his brother Brady Pimentel, 6, dead Wednesday night at their mobile home in Hudson, Florida, before shooting his older brother in the leg and then killing himself . Victims: Six-year-old Brady Pimentel (left) was killed in the shooting, while Trevor Pimentel, 16 (right), is recovering in hospital from a gunshot to the leg. He is too traumatized to speak with police . Heartbroken: Helen Campochiaro has been described as a hard-working, caring mother who was trying to provide for her four children. She was working at the time of the tragedy, police said . Scene: The shooting occurred the family's mobile home at the Sugar Lane park mobile home at 16916 Bachmann Ave in Hudson, Florida, north of Tampa . The victims were identified as  six-year-old Brady Pimentel, who was pronounced dead at the scene, and 16-year-old Trevor Pimentel, who is recovering in hospital from a gunshot to the leg. The three were home alone at the Sugar Lane Mobile Home Park north of Tampa while their mother was at work, Nocco said. Nocco previously said the argument was over food. Kevin and Trevor were believed to have been cooking together at the time of the incident, about 6pm. But a day later, Nocco wouldn't talk about it, saying only that the older boys were preparing food and deputies were still investigating. The sheriff refused to release many details about the crime, including the motive and where the boy got the gun, because he said deputies haven't told the mother yet. 'She doesn't yet know all the details,' Nocco said. 'She can't handle that right now. She emotionally and physically can't handle that right now.' Grief-stricken: Campochiaro shared this photo on her Facebook page following the horrific incident. It is an older picture of her two sons that died, Kevin (center) and Brady (right) Authorities said they have found no evidence that child welfare officials or police had ever been called to the home before the shooting. Campochiaro was a hard-working woman who had two jobs so she could take care of her boys, the sheriff said. On her Facebook page she says that she makes themed cakes and is a seamstress. Originally from New Jersey, she wrote that she 'will always be a Punk Jersey girl'. Campochiaro had been in a car wreck recently, but didn't even go to the hospital because she had to work, Nocco said. The boys' 18-year-old brother also lived at the home, but he was not there at the time of the shooting.

Helen's sister, Barbara Campochiaro, of Spring Hill, told The Tampa Bay Times the children 'were raised with gun safety' and that Helen owned a firearm, though she was not sure what kind. 'She was a single mom with four boys. Unfortunately, she could only afford to live in a trailer,' Campochiaro said. 'She just had it (a gun) for protection.' Kevin was in middle school. Brady attended elementary school and Trevor took virtual high school classes at home in the mornings and culinary classes at a technical school in the afternoons. Grief counselors were at the schools to talk to their friends, students and teachers. Trevor is in the hospital, and is expected to be OK. When deputies tried to talk to him, his heart rate spiked. 'You've got a 16-year-old who just saw something horrific, a living nightmare. I would never want anyone to be in his shoes. He's grieving right now. He just lost two brothers,' Nocco said. The family lived in the mobile home park off a dirt road in Hudson, which is about 30 miles north of Tampa on Florida's Gulf coast. Appeal: Helen Campichiaro set up this Go Fund Me page asking for financial help the day before the shooting. Since the tragedy, donations have skyrocketed to over $4,000 . On March 24, the day before the shooting, Campichiaro set up the Go Fund Me account asking for financial assistance from her friends and family. She was trying to raise a deposit for a new place. 'Me and my boys have had to start over from uncontrolled circumstances,too many times,' Campichiaro wrote on her account. 'Divorce,theft, abuse ... I have sold almost everything I own to make a better life for my boys,more than once.My four boys are my world and I revolve and live for them.I work 7 days a week self employed being able to work around them.' Campichiaro also alluded to having to leave her children at home while she worked. 'I regretfully feel like I never see my boys,' she wrote. 'They are so good and so understanding.They do more than their share at home and for me.Least I can do is put them in a good home.I believe in paying it forward and try to do my part everyday.' Friends of Campachiaro have set up a separate fundraiser for her on Give Forward, which has already received over $5,000 in donations. 'She is a devoted mom, an extremely hard worker, and an incredible business woman,' the page says of Campachiaro. 'Please help raise money for her family, for her son in the hospital recovering, and many, many expenses. Two of her sons were killed while she was at work, anything helps.'","Kevin Pimentel, 12, shot his brother Brady Pimentel, 6, dead Wednesday night at their mobile home in Hudson, Florida .

She earlier told Daily Mail Australia she was 'overwhelmed' by 'the love of her life and best friend's' death. Ms Wild said the last time they spoke was at 1am on Saturday morning when Mr Brown left home. Mr Brown died while free diving north of Moreton Island with some friends. They were competing with each other to see who could dive the deepest, when he passed out while about 15m underwater, according to reports. The heartbreaking message Mr Brown sent Ms Wild, which she posted online on Monday morning . Friends raced down more than 30 metres to recover their mate and attempted to resuscitate Mr Brown. He could not be revived. The desperate rescue attempt was captured on GoPro cameras the friends were all wearing. Water Police Sergeant Shaun Harrison said his friends pushed through normal human limits to rescue their mate. 'They've managed through some actions of their own ... to grab him and bring him back to the surface,' Sgt Harrison said. Chad Collins, one of the friends with Mr Brown, said his 'best mate' was 'born to swim in the ocean'. '18 months ago he wanted a new challenge so we went and bought a speargun off Gumtree and took up freediving,' Chad told the Gold Coast Bulletin. Chad Collins, one of the friends with Mr Brown, said his 'best mate' was 'born to swim in the ocean' Mr Brown's devastated mother Maree Hutton said her 'adventurous and perfect' boy died doing what made he happy . 'He died very peacefully. He was very relaxed. There was no pain and he was very much at ease. It helps me knowing that he didn't feel pain.' Mr Brown's devastated mother Maree Hutton said her 'adventurous and perfect' boy died doing what made he happy. 'I just want people to know that my son died doing what he loved and he would want us to celebrate everything he loved.' Professional free diver and Apnea International Founder Erez Beautus, said the tragedy was a painful reminder for all divers to have a 'safety buddy' in the water. 'Just exactly for this case, for this scenario, so if something goes wrong, your buddy can be watching you all the time,' Mr Beautus said. 'If we dive a little bit deeper - deeper than 10 metres - the sole responsibility of the safety diver is to take care of his buddy at that moment in time.' He also said the accident was 'tragic but preventable'.","Gold Coast teenager Sam Brown died after fainting while free diving .

"In Japan working yourself to death is so common they even have a name for it - karoshi. Now the government is trying to cut the number of people who drop dead at their desks by making holidays compulsory. Laws currently being debated in the Japanese parliament will make it illegal not to take at least five days of holiday a year. A survey by the country's labour ministry in 2013 found employees only took nine out of their allotted 18.5 days of holiday. Another poll, according to the Japan Times, found one in six workers took no paid holiday at all. Scroll down for video . These so called 'salarymen' or office ladies fear resentment from their colleagues if they take days off, a real concern in a conformist culture that values harmony . The same workers clock up punishingly long hours with 22 per cent of Japanese working more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16 per cent of Americans and 11 per cent of French and Germans, according to data compiled by the Japanese government. These so called 'salarymen' or office ladies fear resentment from their colleagues if they take days off, a real concern in a conformist culture that values harmony. A video showing the brutal reality of a Tokyo 'salaryman' doing 80 hour working week recently went viral on YouTube, scoring 738,630 views. Japanese workers pack the subway - 22 per cent of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week . In it a 24-year-old man named Stuart, who works for a financial company, films himself rushing to squeeze in time to eat, shower and sleep, in between clocking up 78 hours at work in six days. He said: 'There are definitely people in Tokyo who do this all year round in order to support their families. I couldn't imagine having to do this if I had those kinds of responsibilities as well. 'Compared to my experiences in the UK, the management style here seems to focus slightly more on hours actually spent in the office, as opposed to actual work output. 'As a result you begin to create a level of inefficiency whereby employees will know how much work they need to do in a day, and spread this out over say 12 hours, instead of getting the work done in 8 and going home.' College-educated  Eriko Sekiguchi, 36, who works for a major trading company, used just eight of her 20 paid vacation days last year. Six of those days were for being sick. She told the Associated Press: 'Nobody else uses their vacation days'. But this strict work ethic is coming at a terrible cost, with record numbers of Japanese workers suffering stress-related illness, premature death and suicide. If the law is passed more Japanese will be taking holidays in popular destinations like Hawaii . According to official data, about 200 people die every year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules. Japanese must use their vacations for sick days, although a separate law guarantees two-thirds of their wages if they get seriously ill and take extended days off. That means workers save two or three vacation days for fear of catching a cold or some other minor illness so they can stay home, said Yuu Wakebe, the Health and Labor Ministry official overseeing such standards. Wakebe himself routinely does 100 hours of overtime a month, and took only five days off last year, one of them for staying home with a cold, but he managed to get away to Hawaii with his family. Stuart, who works for a financial company, films himself rushing to squeeze in time to eat, shower and sleep, in between clocking up 78 hours at work in six days . 'It is actually a worker's right to take paid vacations,' he said. 'But working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.' The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is not known for taking long vacations. Yet even he has spoken out against the unreasonable demands companies place on their employees. Japan's working culture, Abe said recently, 'falsely beatifies long hours'. By the end of the decade, the government hopes it will push Japanese employees towards following the example set by British workers, who use an average of 20 days' paid annual leave . In a speech to the OECD in Paris last year he said: 'We must reform the work style that places importance on the amount of time spent working, an orientation created by men. We will press forward in reviewing the system of labor that gives consideration to the work-life balance.' Japan's working culture,  'falsely beatifies long hours' according to PM Shinzo Abe . The new law will allow for more flexible work hours, encouraging parents to spend more time with their children during summer months, for instance, when school is closed. By the end of the decade, the government hopes it will push Japanese employees towards following the example set by British workers, who use an average of 20 days' paid annual leave, and those in France, who take an average of 25. Cary Cooper, a British psychologist and professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University Management School said the law was a 'really good idea.' He added: 'We don't have a word for death by overwork. The fact the Japanese do - karoshi - show how much of a problem it is. 'The Japanese work culture is really messed up. They work long hours and have really long commutes. They have been a nation of workaholics since WWII. They were proud of it,  but it has a human cost. 'Their healthy diet with a lot of fish oil means they should not have heart problems, but record numbers are dying from heart disease caused by stress. They are also suffering depression and anxiety caused by overwork. The suicide rates are also significantly high. 'The Japanese government now sees the cost in human health and life and have decided to tackle it. The common view is working a lot and not taking holidays is macho but the government is saying we don't think that is OK and there are consequences. 'I think if the law is past people will obey it because the Japanese tend to be sticklers for rules. 'Even if it is not passed, it is important people are talking about it.'","Law being debated by Japanese parliament to ban taking less than five days holiday a year .

"Professor Michael Kelly, pictured, was one of 43 Fellows of the Royal Society who wrote to the president to warn that it was in danger of violating its founding principle . Five years ago, I was one of 43 Fellows of the Royal Society – the first and arguably still the most prestigious scientific organisation in the world – who wrote to our then-president about its approach to climate change. We warned that the Society was in danger of violating its founding principle, summed up in its famous motto ‘Nullius in verba’ – or ‘Don’t take another’s word for it; check it out for yourself’. The reason for our warning was a Society document which stated breezily: ‘If you don’t believe in climate change you are using one of the following [eight] misleading arguments.’ The implication was clear: the Society seemed to be saying there was no longer room for meaningful debate about the claim that the world is warming dangerously because of human activity, because the science behind this was ‘settled’. We hoped we would persuade the Society to rethink this position. That document was revised so that the uncertainty involved in trying to model the climate was admitted. But since then the Society has become more, not less dogmatic – despite the fact that since we sent that letter, it has become evident that there is even more uncertainty than previously thought. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have continued to rise, but since 1998 there has been no statistically significant rise in global temperatures at all. This flies in the face of the confident predictions made by nearly all the climate computer models that the temperature would continue to rise as it did from 1975 to 1998. More than 60 different explanations have been proposed to explain why this ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ has happened, and their sheer number is the clearest evidence that the system that climate scientists are seeking to model is irreducibly complex. Human-sourced carbon dioxide is at best one of many factors in causing climate change, and humility in front of this complexity is the appropriate stance. Yet the Society continues to produce a stream of reports which reveal little sign of this. The latest example is the pre-Christmas booklet A Short Guide To Climate Science. Last year also saw the joint publication with the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) of Climate Change: Evidence And Causes, and a report called Resilience. Through these documents, the Society has lent its name to claims – such as trends towards increasing extreme weather and climate casualties – that simply do not match real-world facts. Both the joint report with the NAS and the Short Guide answer 20 questions on temperatures, sea-level rises and ocean acidification. But a report today by the academic council of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which includes several Society Fellows and other eminent scientists, states the Society has ‘left out’ parts of the science, so the answers to many of the questions ought to be different. I have personal experience of this selectivity. Last year, at the request of the president, I produced a paper that urged the Society’s council to distance itself from the levels of certainty being expressed about future warming. I said it ought at least to have a ‘plan B’ if the pause should last much longer, so calling the models into still more serious question. I got a polite brush-off. Prof Kelly said the Royal Society, pictured,  was founded on the principle ‘Nullius in verba’ – or ‘Don’t take another’s word for it; check it out for yourself' Professor Kelly fears the Royal Society has become more dogmatic when considering climate change . The great 20th Century physicist, Richard Feynman, wrote in his autobiography: ‘Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can – if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong – to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it.’ This the Royal Society has failed to do. The reason for this lack of nuance seems to be that policymakers say they want ‘scientific certainty’. As an engineer, I find that amazing: we remain legally liable for what we say professionally, so will always qualify our statements. But the misleading lack of qualification in the statements made by the Royal Society and others is creating policy nonsense. The Climate Change Act requires the UK to cut its CO2 emissions by 80 per cent from 1990 levels by 2050 – at mind-boggling cost. Generating electricity from windmills has contributed to electricity prices increasing by twice the level of inflation over the last decade, with further huge rises to fund renewable energy to come. Aluminium production is highly sensitive to energy prices, and most of the UK smelters have closed down – helping us reduce UK emissions, but also exporting jobs. He claimed the commitment to slash CO2 levels by 80 percent from their 1990 levels by 2050 is mind-boggling . No one describes the consequence: we now import that aluminium from China, leading to CO2 emissions from shipping it here. Worse, most electricity in China is produced by coal, not gas, as in the UK. We are exacerbating the original global problem of global CO2 emissions, yet also pointing fingers at the Chinese. We really are leading the world in climate change hypocrisy. The project to ‘solve the climate change problem’ is a modern version of the biblical Tower of Babel. We do not know how much the project will cost, when it will have been completed, nor what success will look like. During my time as a government departmental Chief Scientific Adviser, I was always aware that politicians made the final decision on any issue on the balance of all the evidence. For this reason, civil servants are trained to draw their attention to all the upsides and downsides of taking a particular course of action. Those who fail to provide balance are not giving advice, but lobbying. It is with the deepest regret that I must now state that this is the role which has been adopted by the Royal Society. And when scientists abandon neutral inquiry for lobbying, they jeopardise their purpose and integrity.

While the mothers wanted nothing more than to rest and sleep, the cubs were content with playing in the snow and exploring their surroundings. The bears seemed unperturbed by the blustery conditions - but the weather played havoc on the photography trip. Judith, whose pictures were awarded the Australian Photography Magazine's 'Nature Photographer of the Year', said: 'The weather kept most people indoors as at times it was impossible to stay upright outside. 'I was overwhelmed by the intelligence, the love, care and protectiveness the mothers show for their cubs. We watched a group of cubs - young ones and teenagers - play and it was for all the world like watching kids in the school yard.

"Greek ministers have threatened to send ‘millions of immigrants and thousands of jihadis’ to Western Europe if it is forced out of the euro. The country’s defence and foreign ministers made the warning as eurozone creditors urge them to speed up promised reforms to receive payments on a £172billion bailout. Without the funding, the country – which shares a border with Turkey - will go bust, forcing it out of the EU’s single currency. Scroll down for video . Greek ministers threatened to send 'thousands of jihadis' to Western Europe as pressure mounts on them to speed up on promised reforms ahead of a bailout. Hundreds of extremists have left Europe via Turkey to join militants in Syria (a radical is pictured in Raqqa, above) Turkey has become the preferred transit route for European jihadists travelling to fight in the Middle East for extremist organisations such as Islamic State. Nikos Kotzias, the Greek foreign minister, told EU colleagues in a meeting last week that there would be far-reaching consequences in the event of a breakdown of order in his country. He said: ‘There will be tens of millions of immigrants and thousands of jihadists, if you take out Greece. ‘The Western Balkans is not stabilized. Then you have the Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, North Africa.’ In a similar warning, Panos Kammenos, the Greek defence minister, said that if the eurozone allowed Greece to go bust it would give EU travel papers to illegal immigrants crossing its borders or the thousands held in detention centres. Nikos Kotzias, the Greek foreign minister, said there would be far-reaching consequences in the event of a breakdown . He said: ‘If they deal a blow to Greece, then they should know the migrants will get papers to go to Berlin. ‘If Europe leaves us in the crisis, we will flood it with migrants, and it will be even worse for Berlin if in that wave of millions of economic migrants there will be some jihadists of the Islamic State too.’ Mr Kammenos, who is the leader of the Right-wing Independent Greeks party which is in coalition with Greece’s ruling Syriza government, said: ‘If they strike us, we will strike them. We will give to migrants from everywhere the documents they need to travel in the Schengen area, so that the human wave could go straight to Berlin.’ Most Greeks want the country to keep the euro, but two-thirds also continue to back the government’s tough stance to renegotiate the bailout package. Last month, Greece and its Eurozone creditors struck a deal to extend the Greek bailout to June. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister and leader of the Syriza movement, had to bow to German-led pressure to stick to the broad terms of its £176bn bailout in order to obtain the four month extension. The country’s creditors in the 19-country eurozone endorsed Greece’s request for the extension after the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund — the main institutions handling Greece’s loans — provisionally backed a list of reforms that Athens proposed.","Greeks threatened to send 'millions of immigrants' to Western Europe .

"Michael Gove was the architect of the Tories' education policies, but after clashing with teaching unions, officials and other Cabinet ministers he was shifted to the lower profile role of Chief Whip . Michael Gove is still in control of schools policy, despite being ousted from his job Education Secretary last summer, the Lib Dems have claimed. David Laws said the senior Tory still has a grip on shaping government policy on education, eight months after being shifted to become Chief Whip. The claims are a fresh blow for new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who last month angrily denied claims Mr Gove was receiving confidential documents from her department despite being sacked six months ago. Mr Gove was the architect of the Tories' education policies, but after clashing with teaching unions, officials and other Cabinet ministers he was shifted to the lower profile role of Chief Whip. But Mr Laws, the Lib Dem schools minister, has claimed that with Number 10 and the Treasury he is still dictating policy rather than Mrs Morgan. Mr Laws told the Independent: 'While Nicky Morgan's instincts are moderate, the people who control education policy in the Conservative Party are still Michael Gove, David Cameron and George Osborne. 'The face and language may have changed but the Tory policies haven't.' He added that there had been 'some pretty big rows' over initiatives such as a 2% pay rise for teachers and the Prime Minister's 500 free schools plan, both announced last week. He told the paper: 'In all of these areas, the block seemed to be outside the Department (for Education), not inside it. It is policy driven by an ideological approach rather than a calm appreciation of the facts and evidence.' Mr Gove was 'massively influential' in the Tory hierarchy, Mr Laws added, but said he did not know if the senior Tory was seeing Ms Morgan's papers. Responding to similar claims last month, Ms Morgan insisted that she is in charge of the department. She said: 'I just think that this is a complete load of nonsense. 'Michael has been nothing but supportive, as have other former education secretaries from different political perspectives.' David Laws said Mr Gove still has a grip on shaping government policy on education, not his new boss as Education Secretary Nicky Morgan . Asked whether she would be alarmed if Mr Gove was seeing her papers, Ms Morgan said: 'I have no reason to suspect that that is the case, no conversations I have had have given me any indication that's the case. 'I am in charge of the Department for Education and we are all united in our reforms. 'The Chief Whip is of course going to see paperwork that goes through a number of departments. 'Having been in the whips' office I know the Chief Whip has to be across all portfolio areas.

"A burger flipper from Worcestershire has reinvented his fast food business after spending an intense period in the kitchen of one of the country's top restaurants as part of a new TV programme. Now hungry burger-lovers keen to try his gourmet-influenced meat are travelling from far and wide to buy them. A new six-part Channel 4 programme, Burger Bar to Gourmet Star, put Carl Sampson, 27, under the tutelage of one of the country's top chefs, Daniel Clifford. What happened when the more humble end of the country's dining spectrum met with the higher echelons of British cookery? Top chef Daniel Clifford (left) tutored Carl Sampson (right) prompting him to turn his food van business around . Flipping great: Carl Sampson, 27, has seen his burgers fly off the shelves of his van after appearing in the television programme. Plans are afoot to sell burgers wholesale and even open a restaurant . Previously, Sampson  made a living serving burgers to passing lorry drivers from a lay-by on the A38 near Worcester. By his own admission, the meat he presented, in a plain white bap, might have left burger aficionados running for the hills. His signature dish wasan artery-straining UFO burger, a carnivorous concoction that comprised four burgers, four sausages, eight rashers of bacon and, somewhere in between, eight squares of processed cheese. However, since his brush with the higher echelons of British cookery, word of mouth has seen people travel from all over the country to sample his fast food. He told the Worcestershire News: 'I’ve had people travel from Chester, London and even Lincoln - that’s a 125-mile trip - just to try them.' Chef Daniel Clifford admits he fully expected Sampson to wilt under the pressure and was amazed by the young chef's stoic attitude . His fortunes changed after an intense cookery lesson with respected chef Daniel Clifford of Midsummer House, Cambridge which prompted a culinary epiphany. The results? Hand-pressed 5oz burgers so in demand that Sampson often has to turn people away. So far, the chef admits he's tinkered with his popular new recipe, which includes rump and chuck steak, cayenne pepper and Worcestershire sauce, more than thirty times. Chef Clifford admits the two men were operating in separate universes. 'I’ve never stopped in one of these places in my life', says the chef as he arrives at the burger van in the show in his Audi. Sampson, whose previous experience as a cook amounted to a stint at McDonald's and working at a pub, was thrown into the deep end of the kitchen at  Midsummer House. It was assumed he would falter under the pressure. Instead Sampson thrived on the one-on-one time with the chef and despite plenty of less-than-friendly words aimed in his direction, he saw the short apprenticeship through. Sampson is planning to sell his burgers wholesale after local farm shops flocked to stock them . Before his training at Midsummer House, Carl Sampson served up standard burgers from a below par butcher. Now his new beef patties, which the recipe for has been tweaked no less than 31 times, includes the following: . Rump steak . Chump steak . Herbs and spices including: . cayenne pepper . Worcestershire sauce . After leaving Midsummer House, the married father set about trying to adapt what he'd learned to his own business.

"The British crew of the new James Bond film triggered an international air safety alert by going on a drunken rampage aboard the official 007 jet. Last night, the producers of the forthcoming Spectre film confirmed that they were investigating the 'intimidatory and frightening' behaviour on board the privately chartered plane flying from Stansted Airport in Essex to Mexico City 11 days ago. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that charter aircraft company Hi Fly sent a damning a report to the Bond film production company Eon that revealed how some of the film's crew: . Scroll down for video . The British crew of the new James Bond film went on a drunken rampage aboard the official 007 jet, pictured  filming  in Mexico city last week - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage . The report also made clear that the reckless behaviour of some of the film crew, fuelled by excess alcohol, had 'compromised' the safety of the Airbus 330 and had breached international aviation regulations. Last night, a worker at Toluca airport in Mexico City said the mayhem had left the interior of the plane looking like a 'pack of wild animals' had gone through it. The source added that vomit had been left inside the toilet and on the floor outside. The producers of the forthcoming Spectre film, starring Monica Bellucci and Daniel Craig, confirmed that they were investigating the 'intimidatory and frightening' behaviour . He also claimed the airline had to bring in a specialist firm to clean the plane at a cost of 20,000 pesos – about £1,000. The incident will prove embarrassing for Eon, which only yesterday launched a glossy trailer for the new £190 million movie, which will again star Daniel Craig as 007. About 150 of the film's crew, including cameramen, technicians and stunt men, were on their way to Mexico to film some of the most spectacular action sequences, including one that takes place during Mexico's macabre Day of the Dead festival. It is understood that neither Craig nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet, which landed at Toluca Airport for the two-week shoot on March 18. Hi Fly, which has told Eon that its staff breached the conditions of the charter, will deploy extra security at the airport to ensure that no passengers arrive drunk for the jet's return journey to the UK on Wednesday. The airline has agreed to fly the crew back to Britain only on condition that no alcohol is served or consumed on board. The privately chartered plane (pictured) was flying from Stansted Airport in Essex to Mexico City 11 days ago . Members of the film crew removed a safety pin from one of the aircraft's doors - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage . Eon, led by Michael G. Wilson and his stepsister Barbara Broccoli, have now told staff that the flight will be 'dry'. However, in a twist worthy of the Bond films, it is unclear whether the American watchdog, the Federal Aviation Administration, is investigating the incident. On Friday night, spokeswoman Laura Brown confirmed that the incident was 'under investigation' but declined to comment further after being given a detailed account of the reckless behaviour on the plane. But the following day her colleagues denied any such probe was under way. The FAA has some jurisdiction over international airspace around the US, which could have been passed through by the 007 film crew's flight. A spokesman for Eon last night confirmed it was conducting an internal investigation to find out exactly what had happened. But The Mail on Sunday understands that Wilson and Broccoli read the riot act to staff at a production meeting held shortly after the plane's arrival in Mexico. They have also apologised to horrified air crew members. One source, who asked not to be named, said: 'Michael and Barbara have both made it very clear that this sort of behaviour is unacceptable and should never be allowed to happen again. It is understood that neither Craig (pictured) nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet . Some of the film's crew vomited and urinated in the aisles and verbally abused cabin crew - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage . 'The behaviour of a handful of crew members got out of hand and made things very unpleasant for their fellow passengers. 'Eon has apologised to all the crew members who had to endure this intolerable behaviour.' Airline expert Chris Yates said last night that 'it was entirely possible' that the removal of the safety pin could have caused the door to open. He said: 'The pin is part and parcel of the locking mechanism on the aircraft door. Essentially, if you remove it there is a possibility that you could potentially open the door and decompress the cabin.' However, while the risk was real, he added that in all likelihood the door would have been held shut by the speed of the plane moving through the air. Hi Fly, which is based in Lisbon, leases its 12 Airbuses to governments, companies and individuals. Last night, a spokesman declined to comment on the incident. He said: 'This particular flight from the UK to Mexico was a private charter, not open to the public. We have an obligation towards the privacy rights of our clients and therefore we are unable to comment.' A spokesman for Eon said: 'We are investigating the matter so cannot comment further at this time.' Spectre is the 24th movie in the Bond franchise and co-stars Christoph Waltz, Ralph Fiennes and Monica Bellucci. It is due to open in Britain in November.","Crew of new James Bond film went on drunken rampage in official 007 jet .

"When Cressida Dick quit the Met police at the end of 2014, she had risen to become Britain's highest ever ranking policewoman. Her role as Assistant Commissioner was a far cry from her humble beginnings in the force as a bobby on the beat in 1983. In a new BBC documentary, she and other female police officers have revealed how they had to overcome rampant sexism in their bids to follow their dream careers. Cressida Dick became Britain's highest ever-ranking policewoman . On A Fair Cop: A Century of British Policewomen, which airs this evening on BBC4, Cressida said: '1983 seems like a very long time ago. I loved it but it was incredibly different. There were some women detectives but they tended to be one in an office or in a crime squad.' Many of the former police officers interviewed in the show said the lack of equality with male officers even put them in danger as they weren't allowed to carry weapons and had to wear skirts, which hindered their movements. WPC Mary Routledge recalls: 'Women were expected to do same role as men without equipment. Once I was sent to guard 10 Downing Street at the last minute. 'When I was there, a security officer asked me where my gun was. I said ""I haven't got one."" He replied ""what will you guard the PM with?"" So I said my handbag.' It was situations like these that led her to resign in 1974. She explained: 'We were being put in positions that a man would be put in but we weren't being given equipment. 'I was embarrassed at the thought of a male officer being injured looking after me, I couldn't have that on my conscience.' PC Suzie Ranyard, 34, left, works as an armed response officer one hundred years after Margaret Damer Dawson, right, helped form the Women's Police Service. Then the women had no official uniform or weapons . Many of the female officers were exposed to sexist comments on a daily basis and one of the worst crimes they could commit was to want to become a working mother. Della Cannings, a WPC with Devon and Cornwall Police, reveals: 'One superintendent told me it was better to employ a police dog than a policewoman because the dog stayed for longer in the organisation than women and they didn't answer back.' She revealed how when she wanted to marry, she had to ask the permission of her senior officer and it was noted at the time that it would be the end of her career. This was also something Barbara Franklin experienced when she joined Northumbria Police in 1982. She said: 'There was a lot of sexism. I had a male detective inspector and every day my first job was to take him a cup of tea, put it on his desk and curtsy before I left his office.' When she was promoted to be a detective, she said she dared not tell them she was pregnant. When she finally did, her department head 'ranted and raved'. 'He said said it was a waste of taxpayers money because of all the training I had,' Barbara recalled. 'When I said I intended to return after having the baby he said ""over my dead body will I have a mother as as a detective, you will have to go back into uniform"". 'One of my bosses, a chief inspector said he would have me back as a sergeant but there was no part-time hours or job shares so I went back 13 weeks after having my baby.' These women who were in the Women's Police Service in 1918 had no powers of arrest . The first female volunteers to the Women's Police Service, like these pictured in 1918, designed their own uniforms and were 'tolerated' during the war . Jackie Malton, who became a detective chief inspector in the Eighties and provided the inspiration for Prime Suspect character Jane Tennyson, said it was a difficult time for women to prove themselves professionally. But she added: 'The police service was definitely sexist but it also reflects society.' The female officers have shared their stories as 2015 marks the 100th anniversary of the first British policewoman - Edith Smith - being given the power to arrest. Women had started working as unofficial law enforcers the year before in order to support the war effort. A group of suffragettes including Margaret Damer Dawson formed the Women's Police Service in 1914. They designed their own uniforms and were 'armed' only with umbrellas. Joan Lock, a police historian said: 'They didn't have power of arrest, they were very much unofficial and they were being tolerated, partly because the suffragettes had promised to behave themselves during the war.' Women who served in the police in the Seventies and Eighties said the sexism seen in TV show Ashes To Ashes, cast pictured, wasn't far off the mark . After Edith Smith was given the power to arrest in 1915, other women were given this power from 1923 onwards and they were also then given an official uniform designed by Sophia Stanley made by Harrods. The police force was divided by gender until the Seventies when the force became integrated and women were given more rights and equal pay. Even though they still had to work against sexist attitudes, since then, the pioneering women of the force have helped other women rise to the top. Today, there are nine female chief constables in Britain and women make up 28 per cent of the country's police strength. Today women have many more opportunities in the police force, including joining the Mounted Branch . As a fire arms officer PC Suzie Ranyard said she feels she has to 'prove' herself 'and compete with the males' Women can work across all departments from murder investigation to firearms. One woman who serves in the latter is PC Suzie Ranyard, 34, an armed response officer for East Midlands operational support services. She said she loves her job - but despite living in an age if more equality - still feels she has to prove herself at times. She said: 'It's quite a hard specialism to get into and rightly so because it's such a responsible job, you could potentially take somebody's life. 'Training is tough you are constantly being analysed. As a female officer you feel you have to prove yourself and compete with the males. 'The most exciting element is not knowing where you could be going next. One minute you could be sat in the police car and the next jumping walls chasing someone.' Cressida Dick hopes more women will find a role they love in the police service like PC Ranyard and she did. She said: 'I would like all women to feel they can do anything they like in policing, that they don't just survive but they are thriving and having as much fun and interest and excitement and challenges as I have had.'

"Ben Smith, pictured smiling with girlfriend Jordan Ibsen before the event, collapsed and died just minutes from finishing the Wilmslow Half Marathon . Smiling for the camera, 27-year-old Ben Smith poses with his girlfriend at the start of the half-marathon he would never complete. It is the final picture of the sales executive, who collapsed and died less than two hours later near the end of the 13.1-mile course. Mr Smith, who regularly played sport, fell to the ground just a mile from the finish line of the Wilmslow Half Marathon in Cheshire. Despite runners’ attempts to resuscitate him, former grammar school pupil Mr Smith was pronounced dead in hospital. He had posed for pictures with girlfriend Jordan Ibsen, 25, just before the race. Last night his devastated parents said they still do not know what killed their son after a post-mortem examination failed to find an explanation for his death. His father Gary Smith, 57, said: ‘What happened to Ben is still unexplained. ‘He was fit and healthy, had no medical conditions. There was a GP running behind him who said he had no pulse. ‘He had played lacrosse his whole life and was always healthy. We’ve had no answers – we’re still waiting for more tests to come back. We just don’t understand why or how this happened. ‘It was completely out of the blue. We’re devastated and Jordan is heartbroken.’ Gary, who lives with wife Chris, 51, and Ben’s brothers Oliver, 25, and Josh, 24, in Sale, said his son had recently moved in with teacher Miss Ibsen in Chorlton, Manchester. He said his son had just landed a promotion and that he and his girlfriend were ‘soul mates and best friends’ just setting up a life together. Mr Smith, a former Altrincham Grammar School for Boys pupil who later studied at Loughborough University, is understood to have been training in the run-up to the race on March 22. Fitness fanatic Ben Smith had entered the Wilmslow Half Marathon in Cheshire (pictured) and was just a mile from the end when he collapsed . Air ambulance air ambulance and paramedics rushed to the scene after the 'healthy and active' 27-year-old became unresponsive . One runner who witnessed the tragedy said: ‘By the time I got to the 12-mile mark, fellow runners were already giving him chest compressions and desperately trying to bring him round. ‘There weren’t any race marshals around so fellow runners were helping. ‘They seemed to get him back and they turned him on his side. Everyone was very, very shocked. It was an incredibly distressing sight but there was little anyone could do. It is such a tragedy.’ His mother Chris said: ‘He was doing his dream job – he loved it. He had been given a big promotion and a pay rise, he’d moved in with Jordan. ‘They were just getting on in life together. They were a lovely couple and were starting to build a life. It’s so unfair. ‘It’s an absolute mystery what happened. We’ve been inundated with cards and messages. He was a hard worker all his life and he never said a bad word about anybody.’ He was taken to the nearby Wythenshawe Hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival on Sunday, March 22 .","Ben Smith died last week during the Wilmslow Half Marathon in Cheshire .

"The Supreme Court is weighing a free-speech challenge to Texas's refusal to issue a license plate bearing the Confederate battle flag. Specialty plates are big business in Texas, where drivers spent $17.6million last year to choose from among more than 350 messages the state allows. The state's Department of Motor Vehicles says nearly 877,000 vehicles among more than 19million cars, pickup trucks and motorcycles registered in Texas carry a specialty plate. But a state motor vehicle board turned down a request by the Texas division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans for a license plate with its logo bearing the battle flag, similar to plates issued by eight other states that were members of the Confederacy, as well as Maryland. Pictured above is the design of a proposed Sons of Confederate Veterans license plate.  The Supreme Court will weigh a free-speech challenge to Texas's decision to refuse to issue a license plate bearing the Confederate battle flag . The justices are hearing arguments on Monday over whether the state violated the group's First Amendment rights. Texas commemorates the Confederacy in many ways, but it says that putting the battle flag on license plates would offend many Texans who believe the flag is a racially charged symbol of repression. The same image is etched on a century-old Civil War monument on the grounds of the state Capitol in Austin. The First Amendment dispute has brought together some unlikely allies, including the American Civil Liberties Union, anti-abortion groups, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, civil libertarian Nat Hentoff and conservative satirist P.J. O'Rourke. 'In a free society, offensive speech should not just be tolerated, its regular presence should be celebrated as a symbol of democratic health — however odorous the products of a democracy may be,' Hentoff, O'Rourke and others said in a brief backing the group. Sons of the Confederate Veterans claim that Texas is violating the group's First Amendment right of freedom of speech by not allowing them to have their logo, bearing the battle flag, on license places (file photo) The case could be important for how the Supreme Court determines whether the speech at issue belongs to private individuals or the government. Texas's main argument to the Supreme Court is that the license plate is not like a bumper sticker slapped on the car by its driver. Instead, the state said license plates are government property, and so what appears on them is not private individuals' speech but the government's. The First Amendment applies when governments try to regulate the speech of others, but not when governments are doing the talking. Sons of Confederate Veterans claim on the group's website that it  'is preserving the history and legacy of these heroes so that future generations can understand the motives that animated the Southern Cause' Even if the court disagrees that license plates are government speech, the state said its rejection of the Sons of Confederate Veterans license plate was not discriminatory. The motor vehicle board had not approved a plate denigrating the Confederacy or the battle flag so it could not be accused of giving voice to one viewpoint while suppressing another, the state said. The ACLU suggested the court view license plates as a mix of private and government speech. For example, drivers who seek a personal touch and buy the specialized plates know the government has approved their issuance. Eleven states are supporting Texas because they fear that a ruling against the state would call into question license plates that promote national and state pride and specific positions on such controversial issues as abortion. A decision in Walker v. Sons of Confederate Veterans, 14-144, is expected by late June.","Drivers spent $17.6million last year to choose from among more than 350 messages the state allows .

"Thousands of women who had PIP breast implants could be in line for payouts totalling up to half a billion pounds. Elizabeth Williams, 34, had  PIP implants fitted in 2008, and plans to claim compensation . Thousands of British women who had PIP breast implants could be in line for payouts totalling up to half a billion pounds. There are believed to be more than 50,000 women in the UK who were fitted with the implants before the product was discovered to contain a high level of industrial silicone. But the deadline for compensation expires today - and there are still many UK women who don’t realise they can claim compensation for their implants. The scandal came to light after doctors found unexpectedly high numbers of women were suffering from ruptured implants. The Stanton Fisher Group, a firm of UK financial claims specialists representing PIP patients from all over the world, has said the total payouts for British women could total as much as half a billion pounds. It is welcome news for the thousands of women in the UK who faced trauma, financial costs and further operations to have their PIP implants removed. And they are urging women to come forward to start their claims as soon as possible, before the deadline at the end of today. It comes after many women have been unsuccessfully trying to gain compensation from their individual private clinics and banks. Solicitor Steven Hulme from Stanton Fisher, said: ‘Anyone living in the UK should consider making a claim now. ‘Women who have had PIP implants simply need to prove they had the surgery undertaken. There is no requirement for the implants to have ruptured or still be in place to pursue a claim. ‘The victims of the PIP breast implant scandal have been cruelly and criminally treated and we are determined to get justice and financial compensation for them.’ PIP implants were sold widely across the world from the mid 1990’s. There was uproar when it emerged in 2010 that the french firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) had been manufacturing the implants using industrial grade silicone intended for use in mattresses. Jean Claud Mas, the founder of Poly Implant Prothese was jailed for four years last year for fraud at a court in France. But in November 2013, a court in Toulon, France, ruled that the German safety company TUV Rheinland, which had certified the silicone implants, is liable for having failed to perform its control properly and has to compensate the victims whilst PIP is in bankruptcy. A law firm is urging women to come forward to start their claims as soon as possible, as the deadline for claiming payments is  at the end of today . French lawyer Olivier Aumaitre, who is working closely with Stanton Fisher, discovered that the German company had repeatedly certified the PIP implants and he took them to the French Court where the ruling was made. The ruling, which is now pending before a Court of Appeal, could make TUV Rheinland liable to pay compensation to up to 300,000 women around the world - including women in the UK. Mr Hulme added: 'This has opened the door for the thousands of women in the UK and Ireland who had PIP implants to take action in the French Courts. ‘We are pursuing an advance payment of unto £2500 for each of our clients, prior to their final compensation award being decided by the Court, which could be up to £10,000. It is welcome news for thousands of women in the UK who suffered anxiety, depression and worry after the scandal came to light. In 2010, it emerged the french firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) had been manufacturing implants using industrial grade silicone used in mattresses. Founder Jean Claud Mas (pictured) was jailed for fraud . Elizabeth Williams, 34, who lives in Manchester, had her PIP implants fitted in 2008 at a private clinic, boosting her from an A to a D cup. Miss Williams, who runs her own sandwich shop, said: ‘After I gave birth to my daughter Georgia, ten, I felt my breast tissue had reduced significantly. ‘Having the implants made me feel much more womanly, but then when I heard about the PIP implants I panicked. I borrowed some money from my family to pay the £2,500 cost of having them removed and new implants put in. ‘But the whole thing left me very depressed. The compensation payouts won’t make up for all the worry. My daughter had to see me going through it all too, and she was very traumatised.’ Mr Hulme added: ‘We want to get the message out there that getting compensation is an accessible process for thousands of UK women.’","French  firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) had been illegally making implants using industrial grade silicone intended for use in mattresses .

"Photographs have revealed the frantic moment rescuers desperately tried to save a Canadian tourist who suffered fatal injuries when a breached whale hit her boat in Mexico. Jennifer Karren, 35, passed away in hospital after the whale collided with her boat in the Sea of Cortez off Cabo San Lucas on Wednesday. Two other people aboard the boat were also injured. The group had been returning from a snorkeling trip with 'Cabo Adventures' at around 11am when the whale hit the small vessel, tossing Karren into the water. The captain and a tourist both jumped into the water and pulled her back to the boat. Photographs released by the Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection on Thursday show people on the boat desperately trying to save the woman with CPR. Scroll down for video . Freak accident: An image shows a woman receiving CPR aboard a small boat after she was injured by a breaching grey whale near the beach resort of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The woman later died in hospital . Jennifer Karren (pictured with her husband Trevor Karren) had been returning from a snorkeling trip with 'Cabo Adventures' at around 11am when the whale hit the small vessel, tossing her into the water . Terrifying: The boat, pictured, collided with a grey whale, fatally injuring the woman and hurting two others . The boat company reported that the CPR was administered by another passenger, a nurse. Mexican navy personnel responded to the scene and moved Karren, from Calgary, to shore and from there she was rushed to a nearby private hospital where she later died. The two other people were said to have received 'considerable' injuries but are expected to survive, the company said. In a statement, tour operator Cabo Adventures explained that the boat's captain, José Salazar Tendis, had to make a 'sudden maneuver' to try to avoid the whale directly in front of them, but the beast hit the side of the boat instead. The captain immediately called the Naval Rescue, it said. The boat was carrying nine tourists on a snorkel tour at the time, the company said. Unknown danger: A California gray whale is pictured breaching in Magdalena Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico (file photo). They can reach 49ft in length and weigh 36 tonnes and are often seen in Mexican waters . CBC News reported that Canadian consular officials in the area were assisting the woman's family. A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said: 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of a Canadian citizen who passed away in Mexico.' Gray whales can reach 49ft in length and weigh 36 tonnes and are known to frequent Mexican waters, where they migrate annually between their feeding and breeding grounds. Ahead of accident, Mexican authorities announced on Wednesday that the gray whale population in the area is unusually large this season, which runs from December to April. Cabo Adventures runs multiple tour days, from snorkeling and scuba diving to whale watching and camel riding. Carren was on the $79 'Snorkel & Sea Adventure' which takes groups to 'secluded coves and isolated beaches for the ultimate snorkel excursion', according to the company's website.","Jennifer Karren, 35, was killed while vacationing in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico on Wednesday .

"If you're a curious soul with a taste for the unusual, or just a bad hangover on a Sunday morning, one of Cleveland Street's newest cafes in Sydney's Surry Hills might have just your fix. Since opening its doors in January, Dr Faustus, a 1920's-feel brunch spot in a re-styled old pharmacy, has been serving an eclectic menu of 'remedies and elixirs' for the urban hipster crowd.

"A onetime producer of the reality show 'Survivor' was convicted in Mexico Thursday of murdering his wife during a 2010 Cancun beach vacation. Bruce Beresford-Redman, 43, was found guilty and then sentenced to 12 years in prison by Judge Víctor Manuel Echeverria Tun, Quintana Roo state prosecutor Gaspar Armando Garcia Torres said. Juanita Beresford-Redman, Bruce's mother, said her son was also ordered to pay a fine of 43,000 pesos, which is equivalent to $2,800. The former producer was on vacation in Cancun with his wife, Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman, and their two children in 2010 when her body was found dumped in a sewer cistern at the resort where they were staying. Scroll down for video . Guilty as charged: Former 'Survivor' producer Bruce Beresford-Redman (left) has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for the murder of his wife, Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman (right), during a 2010 Cancun vacation . Murder in paradise: Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman's battered body was found dumped in a sewer cistern at the luxurious Moon Palace Resort in Cancun . Rocky relationship: Monica learned her husband had cheated on her, and the beach vacation was supposed to be an attempt to mend their marriage . The vacation was supposed to be an attempt to repair their troubled marriage after she learned her husband had cheated on her. The family of Burgos issued a statement through their lawyer, Alison Triessl, late Thursday. 'It has been nearly 5 years since they lost their beloved sister,' Triessl said. 'Not a day goes by that they don't miss her terribly and nothing will bring her back, but they can finally say that she has received the justice she deserved.' 'We are appalled and disgusted with this gross miscarriage of justice. Over an exhausting three and a half year period this trial has done nothing but prove Bruce’s innocence beyond any doubt. Whatever lies behind this ruling it is based on neither facts nor evidence. This is a disservice to Monica’s memory; this is not the justice she and Bruce still deserve and that we continue to demand. At some point, even in Mexico, Bruce’s innocence will lead to his freedom. We will immediately appeal this absurd decision and will not rest until Bruce is exonerated and returned home. This decision must lead to a reconsideration of the extradition treaty between the United States and Mexico as it is clear that Mexico cannot meet even minimal standards of justice. We remain ever grateful to all those who continue to support Bruce.' Beresford-Redman's family also released a statement in response to the outcome of the trial, strongly condemning what they described as a 'gross miscarriage of justice.' 'This is a disservice to Monica’s memory; this is not the justice she and Bruce still deserve and that we continue to demand,' read the statement posted on a Facebook page dedicated to Beresford-Redman's case. The family plan to appeal the guilty verdict as soon as possible. Beresford-Redman maintained his innocence, but in 2011 a US court upheld his extradition. In 2012, State Department officials signed a warrant clearing his extradition to Mexico. And shortly after arriving in Mexico, a judge ordered the Emmy-nominated producer to stand trial on a murder charge. Part of the evidence in the case included statements from guests at the high-end Moon Palace resort who said they heard loud arguing and cries of distress coming from the couple's room on the night the 42-year-old victim went missing. The producer's lawyers maintained the noises came from Beresford-Redman and his children playing loud games throughout the night and argued there was not any forensic evidence that he killed his wife. Beresford-Redman had been ordered to stay in Mexico when his wife's body was found, but he returned to Los Angeles, where he surrendered to authorities after an arrest warrant was issued in Mexico. Mexican authorities said Beresford-Redman murdered his wife ‘by asphyxiating her’ in their room . Mexican authorities said Beresford-Redman kiledf his wife ‘by asphyxiating her’ in their room at the Moon Palace Resort in Cancun on April 5, 2010. Her decomposing body was discovered in a sewer two days later. A coroner noted that she had suffered scratches on the neck and a blow to the right temple. British tourists in the room next door to Beresford-Redman’s suite reported hearing noises that sounded like a woman in distress, which his attorneys chalked up to loud playtime with his two kids, then ages 3 and six. Lawyers also argued that Mexican authorities found no blood evidence in the couple's room and claimed that investigators and prosecutors used the fact that the couple was experiencing marital problems due to an affair by Bruce Beresford-Redman to support the theory that he killed his wife. In a statement to police, Bruce Beresford-Redman admitted arguing with Monica at the resort but denied he was ever violent toward her. After police noted scratches on his neck and hands, Beresford-Redman said that he and his family had taken several outdoor excursions on their vacation and the injuries were a result of climbing over rocks and diving into the water on the trips. Shortly after his wife's death, Mexican authorities seized Beresford-Redman's passport and ordered him to stay in the country while they investigated. Behind bars: Beresford-Redman maintained his innocence, but in 2011 a US court upheld his extradition . Unwavering support: Beresford-Redman's family released a statement condemning what they described as a 'gross miscarriage of justice' But he returned to the United States and later declared himself innocent. A Mexican judge issued a warrant for his arrest and he was extradited in early February 2012. During a jailhouse interview with CBS's 48 Hours Mystery taped later that month, Beresford-Redman once again proclaimed his innocence. ‘I didn't kill my wife, I really didn't,’ he from behind bars. ‘I can't imagine how anyone who listened to everything said could possibly think I had anything to do with killing my wife.’ Beresford-Redman worked on 48 episodes of the competition reality show Survivor between February 2002 and May 2004, while he also helped produce hit MTV car series Pimp My Ride. ‘Am I a survivor or not?’ Mr Beresford-Redman told CBS. ‘I think very much remains to be seen.’","Bruce Beresford-Redman, 43, was convicted in Mexico in the 2010 killing of his wife, Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman .

"Smiling alongside a health minister at a Norfolk maternity unit in 2013, this new mother is still being chased for the £3,000 it cost the NHS to help her give birth. Zimbabwe-born Caroline Nyadzayo’s unpaid bill is part of the £62million cost of ‘health tourism’ to Britain. The 34-year-old, an advertising executive in Africa, was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter on his visit to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital when the maternity suite was reopened. New mother: Zimbabwe-born Caroline Nyadzayo (left) was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter (right) on his visit to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in the maternity suite . The mother said she complained to Mr Poulter about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it. But Mr Poulter has reportedly said he does not remember being told that. Miss Nyadzayo, now in Harare, told The Sunday Times it was ‘unfair’ she was still being pursued, because the baby’s father is British. She said: ‘I know the system may believe I travelled [to Britain] to abuse the NHS benefits, but as a matter of fact I just wanted to have my first baby as a family and surely everyone is entitled to that.’ The couple were questioned about the birth when they entered Britain at Norwich Airport in October 2013. However, they were released when they agreed they would be paying for it. Discussion: The mother said she complained to Mr Poulter at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (pictured) about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it . Miss Nyadzayo said: ‘I was told because I was 31 weeks pregnant it was likely I was going to use the NHS to my advantage. We said we would pay for the birth. But we had no idea how much we’d be charged.’ Her case was profiled as figures suggested hospitals’ failure to claw back the cost of treating Europeans is costing taxpayers millions of pounds a week. The so-called ‘health tourism gap’ between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost £700million. It means the UK is now paying out £15 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill abroad for every £1 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors. The Prime Minister and Health Secretary have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra £500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18.","Caroline Nyadzayo, 34, was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter .

"A judge set bail at $2 million on Thursday for a man whom prosecutors said was arrested with credit cards linked to a retired Arizona power company executive, his wife and their adult son who were found slain in a 'heinous murder' at their home in rural Idaho. The victims were identified as 80-year-old Theodore M. Welp, 77-year-old Delores E. Welp and their son, 52-year-old Thomas P. Welp.  They were found at the home on Tuesday. Ada County Coroner's Office told Daily Mail Online on Friday that the cause of death was homicide but would not release the nature of the injuries. Accused thief Adam M. Dees, 22, of Nampa wore restraints but appeared relaxed during his appearance in Ada County Court via a video feed from jail. In a clear voice, Dees said 'no' when asked by Judge Theresa Gardunia if he would be able pay the bail. Theodore M. Welp, far left, Delores E. Welp in the black dress and Thomas P.

He faces three counts of grand theft, three counts of forgery and a misdemeanor count of carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. The 9 mm handgun was found tucked into Dees' waistband, prosecutors said, without disclosing whether it was linked to the killings. Defense attorney Isaiah L. Govia has sought bail of $25,000, noting his client had no previous felony convictions. He also said Dees was put on suicide watch after being arrested because he is bipolar and schizophrenic and didn't have access to his medication. Gardunia told Dees before setting bail that she had to consider the circumstances surrounding his arrest and make her decision based on public safety. She ordered Dees to return to court on March 26. Fourth District Magistrate Theresa Gardunia, right, talks with attorney Isaiah L. Govia, who is representing Adam Dees, left, on a video screen, during Dees' arraignment on Thursday in Boise, Idaho . Police arrested Dees on Wednesday at an electronics store. Prosecutors listed a handful of other sites where they said he used the credit cards, forged the names of the homicide victims, and was later identified by workers. Dees' father, Steve Dees, told the Idaho Statesman that his son told his family he found the credit cards. Ada County Sheriff Gary Raney asked the public for help in determining a possible connection between Dees and the Welps. Authorities were also looking for information on a wedding ring they believe Dees had tried to sell. They didn't know if it was connected to the killings. Raney has said the killings were the most violent he had seen in three decades of working in law enforcement. The killings took place in what records say is a three-bedroom, three-bathroom home on about 20 acres with a total value of about $800,000, owned by Theodore and Elaine Welp. Authorities say the property has horses and other buildings. An Ada County Sheriff's Office investigator exits a home where Adam Dees, 22, lives on Thursday  in Nampa, Idaho.

"No parent wants to hear that their child is a bully - and thanks to the stiff punishment he dreamed up, this father is unlikely to hear it twice. Timothy Robenhorst, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, was shocked to find out his son Kayden had been mistreating a classmate, and in response gave him a tough workout, gardening duty and instructions to apologize. For the physically grueling stages of his 5-part punishment, Kayden was dragged out of bed at 4:30am and made to do 50 push-ups on his fists. Spelling it out: Timothy Robenhorst was shocked to heard his son, Kayden, had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him . Next, the boy was tasked with performing ten tougher, incline push-ups, then running a mile. Early-morning Wisconsin temperatures are still routinely below freezing. But Kayden's labors were not over after his hellish morning workout - and the boy is stuck doing landscaping work at two houses his father apparently owns for an unspecified length of time. Punished: Kayden, pictured, was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs . But the punishment also has an emotional and social aspect - with Kayden also being instructed to apologize to his victim in front of his entire class the day after, which was set to happen Wednesday. Robenhorst then posed for a photograph with his son and a poster spelling out his punishment, and encouraged people to share it. As of Friday night it had been shared more than 1,000 times. He also seemingly insisted that it be posted on Kayden's profile too, where it was set as his profile picture and cover photo. Under the post, Robenhorst wrote: 'I teach my kids they do not start fights but if someone puts their hands on them they finish it. 'This is what happens when you become a bully! I don't put up with it and at 4:30am today my son found out what happens when you pray on people for no reason and bully! 'Please share this to end this behavior everywhere!

"A new biography of Michelle Obama has revealed that her mother was initially suspicious of her future son-in-law because he was of mixed race. Barack Obama's father was from Kenya and his mother was a white woman. His parents met in Hawaii although his father abandoned his family when the future president was aged just two. The claim is contained in a new biography of the First Lady written by Washington Post correspondent Peter Slevin. Scroll down for video . Marian Robinson, far right, went on a visit to China in March last year, accompanying the First Lady, center, and her grandchildren Sasha, far left, and Malia . A new biography of Michelle Obama, right, claims that Mrs Robinson, second left, had reservations about her daughter marrying a man of mixed race, but the future president soon won over his mother-in-law . However, despite her initial reservations, Marian Robinson, 77, was soon won over by the high-flying lawyer who had serious political ambitions. As part of his research into Mrs Obama's life, Mr Slevin uncovered an interview with WTTW's 'Chicago Tonight' show where Mrs Robinson addressed the issue of race. She told the interviewer that his mixed-race heritage did not worry her. 'That didn’t concern me as much as had he been completely white.' Mr Slevin told the New York Daily News that 'Marian, no pushover, was favorably impressed with Barack'. Barack Obama married Michelle, pictured on October 18, 1992 in Chicago, Illinois . Mr Obama's mother-in-law moved into the White House after he became president to help with their two children  Sasha and Malia. She has travelled with the Obamas, accompanying them on several trips including visits to Africa and China. The book, 'Michelle Obama: A Life' is being released on April 7 by Alfred A. Knopf for $27.95 on hardback. According to the publisher, the book is 'An inspiring story, richly detailed and written with élan, here is the first comprehensive account of the life and times of Michelle Obama, a woman of achievement and purpose—and the most unlikely first lady in modern American history. 'With disciplined reporting and a storyteller’s eye for revealing detail, Peter Slevin follows Michelle to the White House from her working-class childhood on Chicago’s largely segregated South Side.' As part of the process to complete the book, Mr Slevin interviewed several members of the Obama family's inner circle. The publishers added: 'Slevin deftly explores the drama of Barack’s historic campaigns and the harsh glare faced by Michelle in a role both relentlessly public and not entirely of her choosing. He offers a fresh and compelling view of the White House years when Michelle Obama casts herself as mentor, teacher, champion of nutrition, supporter of military families, and fervent opponent of inequality.'

"Tens of thousands of propaganda leaflets have been dropped at the centre of the Islamic State power base in a bid to destabilise the extremist group. The Pentagon-led operation saw 60,000 leaflets depicting a cartoon of ISIS recruits dropped in Raqqa in Syria - considered to be at the centre of IS operations. Each leaflet depicts would-be jihadists being fed into a meat grinder by malevolent militants, with blood on their hands. The line of recruits cower from the militants as they attempt to entice them towards the grinder. Propaganda leaflets, depicting ISIS recruits being fed into a meat grinder, have been dropped by the Pentagon in Raqqa, the self-proclaimed ISIS capital in Syria, in a bid to destabilise the extremist group . The propaganda, created by Military Information Support Operations, is aimed at destabilising connections within ISIS. 'It's trying to set the stage for an internal uprising against ISIS,' Nicholas Heras, an expert on ISIS at the Center for a New American Security told USA Today. The leaflets were dropped by an Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle fighter, which dropped a specialized leaflet-dispenser bomb for the first time in Syria, according to Air Force spokesman Colonel Tadd Sholtis. A sign on the leaflet says 'Daish Recruiting Office' with 'Daish' another word used to describe Islamic State. The same word appears on the meat grinder. Another sign reads 'now serving 6001', and the new ISIS recruit at the front of the queue is shown dropping his ticket number as he is encouraged to step forward by one of the militants. Yesterday the US launched airstrikes against targets in Tikrit in Iraq to support Iraqi ground forces trying to push IS militants out of the country. The strikes began on Wednesday and are understood to be ongoing. The US has hundreds of military advisers in Iraq helping its security forces plan operations against the Islamic State, which occupies large chunks of northern and western Iraq. In contrast to traditional drops, forces used a specialised leaflet-dispensing bomb to drop the propaganda . Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias have battled ISIS militants in Tikrit, where smoke was seen yesterday . The leaflet drop is said to be a softer tactic being used by American forces to try and destabilise ISIS, as news of problems within the group emerge with some fighters reluctant to take part in fighting in Kobani, on the border with Turkey. Propaganda is already widely used to give daily updates about air strikes in Syria, but the Pentagon has typically kept its releases more low key. ISIS also makes use of propaganda itself, producing weekly and daily news bulletins about successful strikes and action in the country. This week the group also produced an 'idiots guide' to travelling to Syria. Last year supporters of ISIS were arrested for giving out promotional leaflets in Oxford Circus in London, aimed at encouraging people to leave Britain for Islamic State.","Specialised 'leaflet-dispenser bomb' was dropped in ISIS base in Syria .

"Alabama state officials are investigating a complaint of alleged elder abuse of acclaimed author Harper Lee as controversy continues to rage over whether the the 88-year-old really wants to publish a new novel. Since HaperCollins announced the new book last month, many have questioned whether Lee, famously reluctant to seek publicity, would really have a follow-up to her classic 'To Kill a Mockingbird' over more than 50 years. Many claim her mental health is not sound enough to endorse such a proposition while another says she is backing the release of the new book, 'Go Set a Watchman.' Scroll down for video . Controversy over the author's mental state has raged since it was announced she would publish a book after more the half-a-century without a new novel . The New York Times reports investigators have interviewed staff at the Meadows assisted living facility where Lee resides as well as friends and acquaintances. A doctor who asked to remain anonymous said he had filed a complaint after knowing Lee for two years and believing her infirm. He said he had been told she was mostly incapable of communication. Such investigations can involve law enforcement if financial exploitation can be shown. One person speaking to the Times anonymously said Lee seemed to understand the investigators and give clear responses. As the investigation continues, people have argued for several different pictures of Lee: funny, depressed, witty, confused, or even varying from day to day. She reportedly had a stroke in 2007 resulting in health and vision problems. 'It’s a call only God or a doctor can make,' attorney Philip Sanchez, who was a pallbearer for older sister Alice's funeral, told the Times.

"Cancer survival rates in Britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other European countries, experts warn. Even for breast cancer – one of the most treatable forms of the disease – the figures are still well below those reached by France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s. For lung cancer, the rates are so far behind that patients in Britain are now half as likely to survive as those living in Austria. Macmillan Cancer Support has described the situation as ‘shameful’ and warns too many patients are dying needlessly here when they would survive had they been treated elsewhere in Europe. Cancer survival rates in Britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other European countries, despite billions of pounds being spent to improve the UK's survival rates (file picture, posed by models) And despite billions being spent to improve cancer survival rates over the last 15 years – £640million invested by Labour in the early 2000s and £750million by the Tories – Britain does not appear to have gained any ground. In 2002 Labour increased National Insurance tax by 1 per cent as part of a budget introduced by then Chancellor Gordon Brown specifically to pay for major improvements in the NHS, notably cancer care. But only this month figures showed that waiting times for scans are at their highest in seven years while a report by MPs warned of ‘unacceptable’ variation in care. Data analysed by Macmillan shows that 81 per cent of breast cancer sufferers in Britain survive five years. This is a lower rate than France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s, when the figure was 83 per cent. In these countries the survival rates are now 86 per cent or higher. For bowel cancer, 54 per cent of Britons can expect to survive five years, whereas in the late 1990s it was already 59 per cent in Finland and 55 per cent in Norway, the Netherlands and France. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer here is currently 10 per cent but in several countries, including Austria, Germany and Italy, it was at 11 per cent by the late 1990s. Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘Frankly, this is shameful. What we can see here is that better cancer survival rates are not unachievable. ‘If countries like Sweden, France, Finland and Austria can achieve these rates, then the UK can, and should, bridge the gap.’ Experts are not sure why our figures remain so far behind but it may partly be that doctors are not detecting the illness early enough, before it has spread to other organs. It may also be down to patients not being offered the newest, most effective drugs nor the latest surgical procedures, which are routinely available in other countries. This is particularly true for the elderly who are often denied chemotherapy or surgery on the grounds that they are considered too frail. Experts are worried improvements made to survival rates have stalled because the NHS cannot cope with the ever-increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer. It is estimated that about half of us will get cancer at some point in our lifetimes. The figures are taken from a comparison of survival rates of European countries carried out by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, known as the ‘Concord programme’. Meanwhile, the latest monthly NHS statistics showed 18,740 patients waited longer than six weeks for tests to diagnose cancer such as X-rays, CT scans or ultrasounds – up 40 per cent in a year and the worst figure since February 2008. It follows a report by MPs warning of ‘unacceptable’ and ‘unexplained’ variation in cancer detection and treatment across England – particularly for the elderly. Sean Duffy, of NHS England, said: ‘We are diagnosing and treating more people than ever before and as a result the NHS is helping more people than ever survive cancer.’","Cancer survival rates more than 10 years behind other European countries .

The finding contradicts the prevailing view of diversification slowing down as ecological niches fill up with species, only to surge forward again in the wake of a major extinction. Researchers also found that on average it takes around two million years for a new species to emerge from an existing group of animals. A study has claimed that the changes induced by evolution can be reversible, meaning certain animals can return to an earlier biological trait. The remarkable discovery was made by finding birds had regrown a bone previously discarded by dinosaurs millions of years ago. The study was carried out by a team of scientists from the University of Chile . They found that 230 million years ago, two-legged dinosaurs no longer required the strong wrists of their four-legged brethren, and thus they became weak. The number of bones in wrists shrank from 11 to three, with one in particular of interest to disappear being the pisiform. But according to the research, the bone reappeared when dinosaurs evolved into birds and took flight. The new bone, called the ulnare, appears in the same place as the pisiform once did. The pisiform allowed bird wings to remain rigid on the upstroke. The study found it disappeared in bird-like dinosaurs, but modern birds later evolved to once again use this tiny bone. The scientists used data from nearly 2,300 studies examining the molecular biology and genetic diversity of different species. They have now produced a database that can be searched to find out when species separated in evolutionary history and when they last shared a common ancestor. Professor Blair Hedges, director of the Centre for Biodiversity at Temple University in Philadelphia who was one of those leading the study, said the resulting tree took on a more spiral-like appearance. He said: 'This finding shows that speciation is more clock-like than people have thought. 'The constant rate of diversification that we have found indicates that the ecological niches of life are not being filled up and saturated. 'This is contrary to the popular alternative model which predicts a slowing down of diversification as niches fill up with species.' The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, used what are known as molecular-clocks to produce the new swirling tree of life. These look for changes within DNA to calculate the mutation rate and so the time it took for species to evolve. It can also show when different species split from one another. Combined with the fossil record, the technology is helping to provide a far more detailed view of how life on the Earth is related and how it evolved. The timeline above shows from the perspective of humans how we diverged from other groups of organisms . The timeline on the left shows when man first diverged from their best friend, dogs, as pictured on the right . The traditional view of evolution has been as a tree that grows ever more complex branches over time . By searching in the database compiled by the researchers, which is available as a free iPhone app and online, it is possible to see when two species separated in evolutionary history. For example, homo sapiens and dogs split from a common ancestor 94.2 million years ago while cats and dogs separated sometime later at around 55.1 million years ago. Crows - a bird that has been shown to have intelligence equivalent to chimpanzees and even young children - separated from chimps and the rest of the primate family 296 million years ago. The research has also helped to show that one of the most popular theories of what drives evolution may not be completely accurate. Biologists have long believed that life on Earth has undergone explosions in diversification as life has spread out to fill environments and to take advantage of new food sources. Major extinction events, like the demise of the dinosaurs, are thought to have been crucial in allowing life to undergo rapid periods of change as new species appeared to fill the gaps left by those that had died out. However, the new research by Professor Hedges and geneticist Professor Sadhir Kumar at Temple University, showed that evolution has actually occurred at a relatively constant rate. Professor Hedges said: 'Taken together, this indicates that speciation and diversification are separate processes from adaptation, responding more to isolation and time. 'Adaptation is definitely occurring, so this does not disagree with Darwinism. 'But it goes against the popular idea that adaptation drives speciation, and against the related concept of punctuated equilibrium which associates adaptive change with speciation.' The darker the shade of grey on the new timeline the earlier a group of speices is thought to have occurred . Humans sit within a relatively small section marked by primates in the above view of the new timeline .","Biologists at Temple University  created a spiral shaped view of evolution .
They used data from 'molecular clock' studies on more than 50,000 species .
These analyse mutations in DNA  to calculate when species evolved apart .
It shows dogs and humans shared a common ancestor 94.2m years ago .
Crows and chimps separated from each other more than 290m years ago .
The study shows the diversity of life on Earth has grown at a constant rate .
This contradicts the traditional view of evolution as occurring in bursts ."
"A woman who discovered she was conceived by rape has been adopted by her birth mother more than 40 years after she was given away. Rebecca Kiessling always knew she wasn't brought up by her biological parents, but it was not until she searched for her birth mother that she found out why. The 45-year-old, from Michigan, US, waited until she was 18 to track down Joann, who revealed she had considered aborting her daughter – and later told her that her biological father was a rapist. Rebecca, pictured with Joann, 77, had to wait until she was 18 to track down her biological mother, who confessed she would have aborted her daughter, who was conceived by rape after she was attacked . Joann, now 77, had been attacked while she was on her way to a shop at night, and dragged to a nearby field. Rebecca said: 'Mum told me she thought he was going to kill her. He had a knife. She was lucky to be alive.' The attacker was never caught but Joann discovered she was pregnant with his baby. Rebecca explained: 'Abortion was illegal in Michigan. Mum admitted if it had been legal at the time she would have had an abortion. 'That really upset me. She even went to two backstreet abortion clinics but in the end was too fearful for her life when she saw the conditions there. Rebecca, pictured growing up, left and right, said she always knew she had been adopted but had no idea about her mother's attack until it was confirmed by her adoption case worker . Reunited: Joann walked Rebecca down the aisle during her wedding to Robert in 1998 . 'She said she thought about asking her cousin to adopt me but realised it would be too difficult for her to keep me in the family.' Rebecca, who waited until she was 18 to find her biological mother, and lost her adoptive parents as a result, said she understood why her mother had that reaction. She said: 'Seeing me every day would have been a reminder of the rape. No wonder my mum hadn't wanted me. 'All these years I'd wanted to find my roots. Now I knew my dad had been a rapist and I'd been conceived in what was probably the worst moment of my mum's life.' Rebecca had always known she was adopted from a young age. She said: 'Kids at school picked on me for looking nothing like my short, dark-haired parents. 'I'd always wondered where I had come from. 'My adoptive parents were very strict and I was nothing like them. 'I felt like I didn't have an identity so I was desperate to find out what I could. Rebecca revealed she was desperate to find her birth mother, Joann, who was thrilled to see her after more than 40 years. She has now adopted Rebecca, who says she finally feels like she 'belongs in the world' 'My adoptive dad told me I had a half-brother and half-sister, so I wondered if I was the product of an affair or perhaps Mum had been widowed.' Rebecca's adoption case worker confirmed the truth. But Michigan state protected the anonymity of women who put babies up for adoption. After a change in law, Rebecca could receive basic details about her birth parents. She said: 'When I turned 18 I would be able to request information like my birth parents' eye colour or height, but nothing that would identify them. 'On the morning of my 18th birthday I called Oakland County Court. 'All I could discover was that mum was 31 when she had me, 4ft 10in with brown hair and hazel eyes. My father was listed as Caucasian and of large build. That was it.' Her father's description set Rebecca's alarm bells ringing. She said: 'It made me think of a police description. I spoke to my case worker who confirmed I was the result of a rape. 'My adoptive parents tried to comfort me but they didn't know how to console me.' But she was still desperate to find her mother and passed a letter through Oakland County Court to her mother. Rebecca has said she has even told her own children how her mother was attacked . She received a reply with her mother's full name and Rebecca's name at birth - Judy Ann Miracle. She said: 'I was scared she wouldn't want to meet me but she was thrilled to hear from me.' But she said: 'When I first met her, it felt natural to call Joann 'Mum' and she has said she sees me as a blessing. 'I'm so happy something so good came from something so awful.' Joann was thrilled to hear from her biological daughter. And when Rebecca married husband Robert Kiessling in 1998, Joann was the mother of the bride. Rebecca said: 'I didn't know if I would ever see her let alone have her at my wedding. It was an amazing day.' Rebecca revealed that she even told her own children what had happened. She said: 'I'd always felt compelled to adopt children so we did that before we had our own. 'They know their biological grandfather was a bad man who hurt Grandma. I don't see a reason to hide that.' Sadly Rebecca's relationship with her adoptive parents was not as strong and they severed contact. Rebecca said: 'In 2010, I asked Mum if she and her husband Joe, who wasn't with her when I was born, might adopt me. 'They thought it was a great idea. I'm Joe's first child so we had a big party with 'It's a girl' balloons. 'When I was young I felt like I had to justify why I'm here. I wasn't planned or wanted. Mum almost had me aborted. 'Now I know I was created for a purpose and since she legally adopted me, I finally feel like I belong in the world.'","Rebecca Kiessling was bullied at school for looking different to her parents .

"Dr Louise Selby said she was left 'speechless' at the 'blatant sexism' of Pure Gym after she was locked out of the female changing rooms . A doctor has accused a gym chain of ‘blatant sexism’ for assuming she must be a man because of her profession. Paediatrician Louise Selby was issued with a security passcode to enter her local Pure Gym branch. But the PIN repeatedly failed to work on the door to the women’s changing room because the membership management system was programmed to register anyone with the title ‘Dr’ as male. The chain – which has 90 gyms from Aberdeen to Southampton and plans to open another 40 this year – yesterday admitted that the problem is nationwide and asked any female doctors who use its facilities to contact its membership team. Dr Selby said she was ‘outraged’ when she asked staff for help at the Pure Gym in Cambridge and was told what the problem was. ‘Their archaic attitudes to women and blatant sexism really are second to none,’ she said. ‘They may have modern machines but their attitudes are firmly stuck in the early 20th century. ‘I was speechless and I’m not often speechless. If it is some sort of IT glitch then why don’t they fix it? ‘There was even an option on the [application] form to say whether you are male or female. They should offer an apology to people who are affected because it has caused offence.’ Dr Selby, 31, from Balsham, Cambridgeshire, sent a complaint to the gym’s Twitter account after having to ask other women to let her into the locker room for several weeks. Dr Selby said she had experienced sexism in the past with people assuming she is a nurse or secretary because of her sex and says there a need for change. CEO of PureGym, Humphrey Cobbold, said; 'We would like to apologise for the inconvenience and frustration caused to Dr Selby and any other female doctors who may have been affected. 'There is certainly no intention on our part to be sexist. 'There are currently more than 200,000 female members of PureGym and a large proportion of our staff are female and are absolutely an integral and essential part of our business. Dr Selby was told by staff at the gym that the code she was given to get into the women's changing rooms wouldn't work because all people with the title 'Dr' are automatically registered as men . The gym said the error was down to a 'glitch' in its system and that staff were looking into the issue . 'It is very unfortunate that an error between two of the systems we use gave the appearance that all doctors are male and we are working to ensure that this does not happen again. 'We encourage any members who have been affected by this issue to call or email our member services team.' A company spokesman refused to name the firm that supplied its IT system. A spokesman for Pure Gym said the had now removed 'Dr' from their sign up forms, and are contacting all members who are doctors in order to address any problems they are having .","Dr Louise Selby signed up for membership at Pure Gym in Cambridge .

"Supermassive black holes at the centre of large galaxies could be powering blasts from deep inside the galaxy's core, astronomers have claimed. The huge outpourings of material are responsible for ejecting enough dust and gas to build more than a thousand stars the size of our sun every year. And these outflows could also remove huge quantities of star-making gas, dictating the size, shape and overall fate of galaxies. Scroll down for video . Astronomers studying the supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy IRAS F11119+3257 have found proof that the winds blown by the black hole are sweeping away the host galaxy's reservoir of raw material to form stars. This artist's impression depicts how a black hole accretes the surrounding matter through a disc . The image looks uncannily like an eye in the sky - such as the Eye of Sauron from Lord of the Rings . Astronomers have sought the driving force behind these massive molecular outflows for years, and now a team of University of Maryland scientists has found an answer. The galaxy in the study, known as IRAS F11119+3257, has an actively growing supermassive black hole at its centre. This means that, unlike the large black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy, this black hole is actively consuming large amounts of gas. As material enters the black hole, it creates friction, which in turn gives off electromagnetic radiation - including X-rays and visible light. Black holes that fit this description are called active galactic nuclei (AGN), and their intense radiation output also generates powerful winds that force material away from the centre of a galaxy. In February it was revealed that a supermassive black hole 12 million times larger than the sun and powering ‘the brightest lighthouse in the distant universe’ has been discovered. The extraordinary object is at the centre of a quasar - an intensely powerful galactic radiation source - with a million billion times the sun’s energy output. The nature of quasars has remained a mystery since they were discovered in 1963. But scientists theorise that they are generated by matter heating up as it is dragged into supermassive black holes at the centre of distant galaxies. The new object, named SDSS J0100+2802, is 12.8 billion light years from Earth and was formed 900 million years after the Big Bang, which gave birth to the universe. Astronomers cannot explain how such an enormous black hole could have formed so soon after the first stars and galaxies emerged. The study found that these AGN winds are powerful enough to drive the large molecular outflows that reach to the edges of the galaxy's borders. Although theorists have suspected a connection between AGN winds and molecular outflows before, the current study is the first to confirm this link. 'This is the first galaxy in which we can see both the wind from the active galactic nucleus and the large-scale outflow of molecular gas at the same time,' said lead author Dr Francesco Tombesi, an assistant research scientist in the University of Maryland's astronomy department. He also worked at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre. The team analysed data collected in 2013 by Suzaku, an X-ray satellite operated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) and Nasa, as well as data from Esa's Herschel Space Observatory. An alternate theory says that active star formation near the galactic centre could drive these outflows. But the brightness of IRAS F11119+3257's active nucleus - which is responsible for about 80 per cent of the galaxy's overall radiation - suggested otherwise. Star formation alone can't explain this intense concentration of energy, leading the researchers to conclude that the AGN winds must be the primary driver. The outflows could also remove huge quantities of star-making gas, dictating the size and shape of galaxies. This artist's impression shows the outflow of molecular gas (red) in a galaxy hosting a supermassive black hole at its core. The study is based on data from the Herschel and Suzaku space observatories . This is a red-filter image of IRAS F11119+3257 (inset) from a telescope at the University of Hawaii's, showing faint features that may be tidal debris, a sign of a galaxy merger. The background is a wider view of the region from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey . 'The temptation is to ignore the supermassive black hole when studying galactic dynamics and evolution, but our study shows that you can't because it influences galaxies on the larger scale,' added co-author Dr Marcio Meléndez. Limited satellite time means that, at least for now, the team has only this one galaxy as a baseline for study. But now that they have a better idea what they are looking for, they will be able to find more candidate galaxies in the future. Within the next year, Jaxa and Nasa will launch Astro-H, a successor satellite to Suzaku. The instruments aboard Astro-H will make it possible to study more galaxies like IRAS F11119+3257 in greater detail. 'These are not like normal spiral or elliptical galaxies. They're like train wrecks,' said co-author Dr Sylvain Veilleux. 'Two galaxies collided with each other, and it's now a single object. This train wreck provided all the material to feed the supermassive black hole that is now driving the huge galactic-scale outflow.' The findings were published in the journal Nature.","University of Maryland scientists present theory for galaxy cores .
They say supermassive black holes are causing blasts of material .
This leads to the formation of thousands of stars ever year .
And the huge outflows could also dictate the size and shape of galaxies ."
"Television producer Shonda Rhimes hit out at an article posted on Deadline which claimed television has become too diverse this season and the 'trend' may not last.

"The 'secret' teenage daughter of a late mining baron who successfully fought for $25 million from her father's estate is now set to have her multi-million dollar inheritance challenged by her half sisters. Olivia Jacqueline Mead was left $3 million in a trust fund when her iron ore magnate father Michael Wright died in 2012. The 19-year-old, who is the third and youngest of Mr Wright's daughters, challenged his will in the West Australian Supreme Court in January claiming the amount left to her from her father's estimated worth of $1 billion was insufficient. Scroll down for video . Olivia Jacqueline Mead may have her multi million dollar inheritance challenged after she successfully fought for $25 million in the West Australian Supreme Court from her iron ore magnate father Michael Wright's estate . The court ruled last month that Ms Mead, the product of Mr Wright's relationship with Elizabeth Anne Mead after he divorced three women, should be handed $25 million from his estate. But the matter is due to return to court this week after the Wright family signalled their intent to challenge the ruling. The $25 million was to be paid in a lump sum within 60 days of the February 26 judgement, but the Wright family has since sought clarity from the court about the drafting of orders - there's a 21-day appeal period after those orders are drafted. The battle over Mr Wright's estate made headlines earlier this year when lawyers pressed Ms Mead for details about why the $3 million sum was insufficient and what she expected she would need for the rest of her life. Mr Wright was estimated to be worth $1.5 billion when he died at 74 in 2012. He was the son of Peter Wright, who co-founded Hancock Prospecting and Wright Prospecting with Lang Hancock .

The battle over Mr Wright's estate made headlines earlier this year when lawyers pressed Ms Mead for details about why the $3 million sum was insufficient . Ms Mead told the court she needed a home five times the Perth median price ($2.5 million), $10,000 each year for fashion accessories including Tiffany and Co sunglasses and $100,000 for a wedding when she ties the knot. Her initial list of claims also included an Audi A4 and a Toyota Tarago for when she has children, as well as a diamond-encrusted bass guitar worth $250,000 and a limited ­edition Kuhn Bosendorfer grand piano. In a summons filed in December 2012, Ms Mead also claimed to have been left without adequate funds for her proper maintenance, support, education and advancement in life from her father's estate in the bequeath to be held in trust until she was 30. Her wish list amounted to about $20 million but Supreme Court Master Craig Sanderson ruled Ms Mead was 'in no sense... spoilt by her father' and deserved far more than she had been left. 'The deceased had a vast fortune and he was in the fortunate position of being able to provide for all of the parties who had a claim on his bounty,' Master Sanderson said. Many in Perth had little idea Mr Wright had a fourth child until Ms Mead's case went to trial. Mr Wright was estimated to be worth $1.5 billion when he died at 74 and was the son of Peter Wright, who co-founded Hancock Prospecting and Wright Prospecting with Lang Hancock - Gina Rinehart's father.

The teenager's half-sisters Leonie Baldock and Alexandra Burt, who both work within the family business, had  been bequeathed $400 million. While Ms Mead had been included in his trust it was subject to onerous conditions, which meant that she might have received very little . She would have been deemed exempt from the funds if she 'had any association or involvement whatsoever to illegal drugs' was convicted of any felony within the 10 years prior to his death, of if she had 'converted to Buddhism or Islam'.

"Ashley says her mum's favourite Mother's Day present was a gadget  she said she didn't want . I can vividly remember the Mother’s Day when I bought my mum the one gift she had expressly forbidden me to buy. It was Tivo: a way to record favourite TV shows, which at the time was novel and new to the market and something I was sure she could use. She was adamant about not wanting it and not watching enough TV for it to be useful. Even so, I persevered knowing that many of her favourite cooking shows, home design programmes and Poirots recording all by themselves would be something she would quickly learn to love. I also suspected that her reticence had to do with her own unspoken fear that she wouldn’t be able to master a complicated remote control. Despite her protestations, I bought it anyway, and almost immediately it became one of her favourite gifts of all time. So whether it’s something she’s intimidated by, technology she isn’t familiar with, a beauty treatment she finds too extravagant or doesn’t think she needs – or if you’re just tired of giving her the same Emma Bridgewater mug with flowers every year, here are the top 15 gifts you should buy for your mum this Mother’s Day, that she doesn’t know she wants (yet). 1) A540A phone from Gigaset £39.99 johnlewis.com .

"It is something most of us prefer not to see when we open our fridge. But photographer Nick Lariontsev has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out-of-date bread and cheese in a different way. Using macroscopic photography techniques, he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread. Using macroscopic photography, Russian photographer Nick Lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread (grab shown) The multicellular filaments slowly spread across the Petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet. He has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance. Mr Lariontsev, a photographer based in Russia who posted the video on YouTube, said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film. Among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. Among the moulds in the film are the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. The fungi Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, and the soil-based fungi Trichoderma . Fungi from the group of Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, along with the soil-based fungi Trichoderma. The fungal genus Botrytis, some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the genus Mucor, which grow on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days. The result is a rather stomach-churning but strangely captivating four-minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before. Professor Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University and a member of the British Mycological Society, said: 'Most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants. 'But if it wasn't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us. 'If fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest, then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil. 'Many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow. 'Fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked.' The fungi Botrytis, which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the fungi Mucor, which grows on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days . It sounds more like the recipe  for a good pasta sauce, but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf-life of cheese from seafood, rosemary and oregano. The transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. Tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry. The researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling. While helping to prevent the cheese from going off, it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used. Professor Chelo González, a researcher at the Institute of Food Engineering for Development of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, said: 'The most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts. 'These produce a strange flavour or odour, a slimy texture and a significant visual alteration. 'Using a natural and edible product reduces the fungal problems and controls the weight loss during the maturing.' The researchers coated Tronchon cheese (labelled queso Tronchon recubierto) with a combination of chitosan, which is extracted from crustacean shells, and essential oils from rosemary and oregano .","Russian photographer Nick Larionstev captured a video of mould growing .

"A Phoenix woman who left her two young sons alone in a hot car during a job interview pleaded guilty Monday to a felony child abuse charge in a deal that lets her avoid jail time. The plea agreement calls for Shanesha Taylor to serve 10 years of probation, undergo parenting classes and pay an unspecified amount of restitution. Her children remain in her custody. Taylor attracted sympathy around the nation after her tear-stained mug shot went viral on the Internet. Her story of trying to get a job but not being able to find child care resonated with the public, and she received more than $114,000 in donations through an online site. Scroll down for video . National attention: Shanesha Taylor attracted sympathy around the nation after her tear-stained 2014 mug shot went viral on the Internet . Plea: Taylor (seen in the floral print shirt) pleaded guilty Monday to a felony child abuse charge in a deal that lets her avoid jail time . But she became the target of backlash after she missed deadlines to fund a trust for her children and questions arose about where the money went. In court Monday, Taylor provided one-word answers to a court commissioner's questions and, unlike her earlier court appearances, avoided TV cameras outside the courthouse by leaving through a side exit. Her lawyer tried unsuccessfully to bar a TV camera from recording the hearing. As part of the plea, defense attorney Valeria Llewellyn said her client, by leaving the children in the car, put them in a situation where they could have been hurt. Court Commissioner Jeffrey Rueter asked Taylor whether her attorney's statement was correct. 'Yes,' Taylor answered. Taylor was arrested nearly a year ago after leaving her two young boys in her car for about 45 minutes while she interviewed for a job with a Scottsdale insurance company. Authorities said the temperature inside the car exceeded 100 degrees. A witness found the infant crying hysterically and sweating profusely. Taylor told investigators she didn't have anyone to watch her then-2-year-old and 8-month-old sons. Deal: Monday's plea marks the second time Taylor has struck a deal with prosecutors to resolve her case. An agreement last summer allowed Taylor to avoid charges as long as she set up a $60,000 trust fund for her children with the donated money . Broken arrangement: Taylor (seen here last year) broke the 2014 deal  by missing a deadline for putting money in the trusts, even after the amount of her payments was lowered to $40,000 . Monday's plea marks the second time Taylor has struck a deal with prosecutors to resolve her case. An agreement last summer allowed Taylor to avoid charges as long as she set up a $60,000 trust fund for her children with the donated money. But she broke that agreement by missing a deadline for putting money in the trusts, even after the amount of her payments was lowered to $40,000. Taylor has said she didn't fund the trusts because her children won't get the money if they decided not to attend college. Prosecutors had said the mother of three had spent about $4,100 per month, including more than $1,000 in non-essential items such as cable TV, clothing and dining. Taylor had countered that she doesn't live an extravagant lifestyle. The breach prompted prosecutors to then push the case against Taylor. The restitution requirement in Monday's deal doesn't apply to the contributions Taylor was given.","Shanesha Taylor, 36, pleaded guilty to a felony child abuse charge Monday .

"The parents of teenagers who flee Britain to join ISIS should take more responsibility for their children's actions, a senior police officer has said. Sir Peter Fahy, one of the country's leading counter terrorism officers, said families are more to blame for young jihadis who runaway to Syria than the police, schools or local authorities. Rather than report their concerns to police for fear of being criticised, some parents are guilty of embracing 'victimhood' when their children leave, he claimed. Scroll down for video . Sir Peter Fahy (above) said the parents of jihadi runaways should take more responsibility for their actions . Sir Peter's comments come after the families of three jihadi schoolgirls claimed police had not done enough to prevent their daughters from leaving the country. Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum, both 15, fled their north London homes in February. They are thought to have joined former classmate Sharmeena Begum in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. Their families have since lambasted police for not warning them that Sharmeena had earlier travelled to Syria. But Sir Peter has slammed their 'ill-advised' condemnation which he says could lead to a 'backlash'. A senior police officer claimed the families of runaway jihadis were embracing 'victimhood'. Fahmida Aziz (left), Sahima Begum (centre), and Abase Hussen (right), criticised police in front of a Home Affairs Select Committee when three London schoolgirls fled for Syria . Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum, both 15, fled their north London homes in February and were seen on CCTV in Turkey shortly afterwards . 'What is ill-advised is to just blame the police, blame the authorities, blame the school, when the absolute prime responsibility for the welfare of children lies with parents,' he told The Times. 'I'm not saying that is easy. But it creates the conditions for a backlash which again is not positive.' His comments come after the the schoolgirls' families castigated police for not warning them of concerns before the girls fled the country in February. Sharmeena Begum fled the country months earlier . Sitting before a Home Affairs Select Committee, they claimed they should have been told directly that their daughter's friend and classmate, Sharmeena Begum, had gone to Syria to pursue terrorists. In a joint statement, they said: 'With respect to the disappearance of our children we have been disappointed by the handling of this matter by the school, Met police and the local authority, all of whom we feel failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information to us or indeed between each other. 'As parents, we expect the safeguarding of our children to be the top priority of schools and the local authority whilst our children are in their care. 'Had we been made aware of circumstances sooner, we ourselves could have taken measures to stop the girls from leaving the UK.' While Metropolitan Police delivered letters to the three girls, its Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, admitted their parents should have been contacted directly. Sharmeena, 15, left the home she shared with her father in north London shortly after his second marriage. Her mother had not long died. Mohammad Uddin claimed his daughter was targeted by shadowy extremists on her mobile phone. Earlier this week the father of a private schoolgirl from Glasgow who fled Scotland to become a jihadi bride denied his daughter had recruited Sharmeena's classmates. Aqsa Mahmood was accused of encouraging Shamima Begum to join her in Syria after communicating with the teenager over Twitter. But her father, Muzaffar Mahmood, said she had no part in the London schoolgirls' departure to the country, claiming Aqsa had been in touch with him to dismiss the accusations. Mohammad Uddin with pictures of his teenage daughter, Sharmeena Begum. He said he believes she was targeted by extremists over social media, a concern rife among other Muslim mothers . He claimed the media was focusing solely on his daughter and blaming her for other teenagers travelling to ISIS governed regions. 'She texted when this was going on,' he said. 'She was never in contact with them and I believe her. 'A lot of press - everything happening is Aqsa Mahmood,' he said. 'We feel really bad when we hear in the press that she recruited them. 'We regret what she is doing and we condemn what's going on over there but she hasn't been in touch with them [the runaway girls] at all. It's very painful.' Shamima contacted Aqsa on Twitter, requesting that she follow her so the pair could speak privately via direct messaging. Such methods of communication are common among ISIS recruiters,with many parents fearing their children are at risk of being groomed over social media. Organisers of an event in Cardiff today claimed some families were 'in denial' when it came the dangers of websites used by militants to communicate with teenagers in Britain. The father of jihadi bride Aqsa Mahmood (pictured left and right) denies she was involved in recruiting three London schoolgirls believed to have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State . Muzaffar Mahmood said his daughter had contacted the family to insist she didn't know the names of the missing London schoolgirls, and he said he believed her . Shakila Malik, who has two teenage sons, said she was disappointed by the reactions of some mothers who think they are unaffected by extremist. 'Personally I don't think some (mothers) are ware,' the community youth worker said. 'They just think it's a joke and children are not being groomed. They are in denial.' The conference was put together by the charity Inspire, launched last year in response to the growing threat of extremism. Speakers encouraged around 50 Muslim mothers to instill confidence in their children and talk to them about radicalisation. Worried parents should contact the child's teachers, imam and even the police, Sara Khan, who started the charity, said. In the most drastic cases parents could confiscate their child's passport to stop them from leaving the country, she said. 'It is also important parents understand why IS is appealing and to give their children the theological counter narratives,' added Mrs Khan.","Sir Peter Fahy said the 'prime responsibility' for runaways lies with parents .

"In the last decade, thousands of British teenagers have celebrated their 'graduation' from secondary school by hiring a limousine to travel to their prom in style. But it seems that they have nothing on their Mexican peers. A series of fascinating new photographs highlight a trend in the city of Monterrey for throwing extravagant parties to mark the point at which young girls turn 15 and, according to Latin American tradition, transition into womanhood. Sofia, 15, is just one of many teens who marked her coming of age - or 'quinceañera' - by riding in not one, but several, super-bling limos with gaggles of friends, wearing matching suits and party frocks, joining in the fun. Scroll down for video . It's my party! Young Sofia, 15, is pictured wearing a flamenco-style cerise dress riding in an open-top SUV-limo hybrid. The glammed-up teen celebrated her quinceañera - transition into womanhood - with a lavish party . Is it a car, is it a nightclub? Another teen, Ariadna, smiles as she takes a seat in a lavender limo, which comes with shiny ceiling and strip lighting - perfect for partying teens . Parties to mark a girl's quinceañera have become increasingly lavish with parents splashing out huge sums to ensure their youngster has a party to remember. However, it isn't just 'bank of mum and dad' that pays for the event, other relatives are called upon to 'sponsor' certain elements, for example, the cake or the DJ. Such is the pomp and ceremony of these excessive bashes, you could be forgiven for thinking that you're looking at a garish wedding party. Even the attending boys go to town, taking care to coordinate their looks with the birthday girl. Much like the American prom, the celebrating girl can expect a date, with her betrothed often appearing like a mini-groom, wearing an outfit that has been planned to match hers. The birthday cake is likely to be just as eye-catching with 'the bigger, the better' the remit. Other trends include hiring a choreographer to make sure everything from the girl's entrance into the room to her first dance has a professional touch. Open the roof and let's go! Partygoers climb inside the SUV-limo hybrid as guests make their way to a quinceañera birthday party . An early lesson in how to get in and out of a vehicle in style: One birthday girl, wearing a billowing turquoise dress, climbs aboard her limo .

The brighter, the better: Leticia, dressed in a bright pink evening gown has her own moment in the spotlight, posing in a limo that has zebra-skin seats and even a bar facility . Video courtesy of signaturefilmsphotography.com . Latin American communities in the US take quinceañera just as seriously with many girls incorporating popular films into their dresses. For example, when Disney released the hit film Frozen in 2014, it prompted a surge of Elsa-inspired dresses. At the other end of the spectrum, indigenous tribes in  jungle communities in the likes of Gueatemala would celebrate in a much simpler fashion. It's all a far cry from the more humble traditions of quinceañera. According to folklore, in the months before turning 15, a daughter would be taught skills to prepare her for ensuing marriage including cooking, weaving and even tips about how to bring up her own children. It is thought that quinceañera has its roots in  ancient Aztec culture. 15 is the number: Quinceañera is celebrated differently in different countries but is essentially a coming-of-age party . From the Latin American communities of Los Angeles to the streets of Mexico and even in Cuba, when a girl hits the age of 15, a huge party promptly follows. Essentially a coming-of-age affair, quinceañera - literally meaning '15 years old', has taken off in much the same way that the high school prom has, with celebrations and outfits becoming increasingly extravagant in recent decades. In the past, a girl celebrating her quinceañera would be preparing for marriage and offered advice from older females on how best to equip herself for womanhood. Skills considered essential for being a good wife, for example sewing, cooking, cleaning and taking care of infants would be learned. At her quinceañera, the girl is 'presented' to her community and may be expected to make a speech. After an 'acceptance' of the girl, the party-goers would then pray before a meal is served. Although most historians agree that the celebration has its roots in Aztec culture, how it is celebrated now depends very much on the country the girl grows up in. For many, religion still plays a part and parties are more conservative. Latin American communities in the US take quinceañera just as seriously with many girls incorporating popular films into their dresses. For example, when Disney released the hit film Frozen in 2014, it prompted a surge of Elsa-inspired dresses.

"It was a case that held the nation spellbound almost 40 years ago, puzzling policemen, psychics and even occult experts. Now, a three-part drama series will recreate the strange goings-on at a London council house where a family were terrified by a demonic spirit. Janet Hodgson, who was 11 at the time, was convinced she was possessed by a former resident of the house in Green Street, Enfield, a grumpy old man called Bill Wilkins who had died there many years before. A three-part drama on Sky Living called the Enfield Haunting will recreate the strange goings on at a house . Timothy Spall, who plays investigator Maurice Grossel, comforts Eleanor Worthington Cox, who plays Janet Hodgson, the 11-year-old girl who was convinced she was possessed by a former resident of the house . The council house (on the right side of this semi-detached) in Green Street, Enfield, was said to be haunted . Speaking through her, an eerie voice - which can still be heard on audio tapes today - said: 'Just before I died, I went blind and then I had a hemorrhage and I fell asleep and I died in the chair in the corner downstairs.' The case of the Enfield Poltergeist also involved levitation, furniture being moved through the air, and flying objects swirling towards witnesses. There were cold breezes, physical assaults, graffiti, water appearing on the floor, and even claims of matches spontaneously bursting into flame. The events - which began in August 1977 - unfolded for more than a year behind the door of the ordinary-looking semi-detached council house. The family became so scared they slept in the same room, with the light on. Most of the activity centred on 11-year-old Janet. She went into violent trances, which were awful to behold. On one occasion, the iron fireplace in her bedroom was ripped from the wall by unseen forces. Family members also claim to have seen her levitating - floating across the room. She said: 'I felt used by a force that nobody understands. I really don't like to think about it too much. I'm not sure the poltergeist was truly 'evil'. It was almost as if it wanted to be part of our family. 'It didn't want to hurt us. It had died there and wanted to be at rest. The only way it could communicate was through me and my sister. 'It was an extraordinary case. It's one of the most recognised cases of paranormal activity in the world. But, for me, it was quite daunting. 'I think it really left its mark, the activities, the newspaper attention, the different people in and out of the house. It wasn't a normal childhood.' Most of the activity centred on 11-year-old Janet Hodgson, who was apparently seen floating across the room . The disturbing events which included moving furniture unfolded for more than a year behind the door of the ordinary-looking semi-detached council house on a suburban street . Some of the events were captured on camera, and the images are disturbing. One shows Janet apparently being thrown across the room . In the Sky Living drama series called The Enfield Haunting, Janet is played by Eleanor Worthington Cox, 13, the youngest recipient of the Laurence Olivier award for her portrayed of Matilda Wormwood in Matilda The Musical. In one scene Cox shudders at the top of the stairs after being terrified by the spirit. Timothy Spall, who played the role of Winston Churchill in King's Speech and Peter Taylor in the Damned United, plays investigator Maurice Grossel, while Juliet Stevenson plays his wife Betty. Spall said: 'I am very pleased to be taking part in The Enfield Haunting. It is a brilliant script which is full of emotional texture and develops beautifully into a human story.' The house is currently occupied by another family, who do not wish to be identified. The mother says simply: 'I've got children, they don't know about it. I don't want to scare them.' The ghostly story of the infamous case will be recreated by the all-star cast to be screened this spring on Sky . Cynics cast doubts on the events saying it was a hoax. Two SPR experts caught the children bending spoons themselves, and questioned why no one was allowed in the same room as Janet when she was using her gruff voice, apparently that of Bill Wilkins. At the time it provoked a national debate and 37 years later, the spooky tale will become the subject of debate once more.","Enfield poltergeist gained national news coverage in the late 1970s .

"The police chief at the Hillsborough disaster said it was 'one of the biggest regrets of my life' he did not think of the consequences of allowing thousand of fans in to the ground after he ordered exit gates to be opened. Former chief superintendent David Duckenfield also added that it was his mistake and that he apologises profusely for the events that transpired. The match commander at the game agreed to a request to open the gates to prevent crushing at the turnstiles outside the ground, the inquest in Warrington heard. Former chief superintendent David Duckenfield says Hillsborough was one of biggest regrets of his life . But after Gate C was opened on his orders at eight minutes before kick off, an estimated 2,000 fans poured in, heading straight for a tunnel leading directly to the already-packed central pens three and four, behind the goal. The jury was told as many as an extra 800 fans went in to pen three alone after the gate was opened. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died following a crush on the Leppings Lane terrace of Sheffield's Hillsborough ground as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest kicked off on April 15 1989. Mr Duckenfield said he now realised 'in hindsight' the 'most likely' route fans would take once Gate C was open was to go down the tunnel facing them and in to the central pens. Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquests, said: 'You say in hindsight you recognise that's where a number of fans might have gone. Do you think as a match commander the consequences of the decision you made, and in particular thought as to where the fans might go, is something you should have considered?' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'Ma'am, I think it is fair to say that is arguably one of the biggest regrets of my life, that I did not foresee where fans would go when they came in through the gates.' Mr Duckenfield, who has admitted he had 'limited' experience of policing football matches compared with other senior officers, added: 'If I had been a fully competent, experienced, knowledgeable match commander of the experience of Mr (Brian) Mole or Mr Freeman, I no doubt would have thought about it, but I was not in their position.' Mr Duckenfield, stationed in the police control box with a bank of TV monitors of the ground, said he was 'shocked' at the request to open the gates from Superintendent Roger Marshall from outside Leppings Lane after police became 'overwhelmed' by the number of fans gathered at the turnstiles. 96 Liverpool fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground's perimeter fence in 1989 . The witness continued: 'Certainly I'm sat there, I don't mind telling you I was shocked and taken aback by it and thinking, 'Where are these people going to go if I open the gates?'' He said another message then came through on the police radio from Mr Marshall saying: 'If we don't open the gates someone's going to get killed.' The witness continued: 'That really was a shocking, terrifying moment to feel you had got to that situation.' Another officer in the police box, Mr Bernard Murray, then said to him: 'Are you going to open the gates?' the jury heard. Mr Duckenfield said: 'I remember saying to him quite clearly, Mr Murray, if people are going to die I have no option but to open the gates. Open the gates.' He said he was left 'no option' and thought fans would feel 'relief and comfort' in being released from the crush of the turnstiles on to the concourse. He added: 'Ma'am, it is difficult to envisage in the quiet of the court room but in that moment when I made a decision of that nature it really is, I'm at a loss to describe it, other than to say it is a momentous decision and your mind is such that you don't think upon the next step.' Mr Duckenfield said he did not think before opening the gates about blocking the tunnel off with a line of police officers - as had happened in previous years. Miss Lambert said: 'Did you even consider for a moment the possibility that they might go through the central tunnel?' 'Not at all ma'am,' Mr Duckenfield replied. Mr Duckenfield added: 'I think it's fair to say I was overcome by the enormity of the situation and the decision I had to make. 'And as a result of that I was so overcome, probably with the emotion of us having got into that situation, that my mind, for a moment, went blank.' Fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster before the FA Cup semi-final . Mr Duckenfield said there was 'every possibility' that he panicked, and accepted that it was a mistake not to have taken steps to close the tunnel leading to the central pens. 'I think I was so consumed by the events that probably by that time I was overcome and didn't consider delaying the kick-off at that stage. 'The request was made, the crisis was building, the atmosphere and tension was increasing and I shall never forget (another policeman) saying 'It's too late, the players are on the pitch'.' After viewing CCTV footage of fans on a concourse behind the Leppings Lane terrace, having passed through Gate C, Mr Duckenfield went on: 'I have a view from what I have seen that quite a few of the fans were apparently standing around, waiting for friends or wondering where to go or what to do.' The jury has heard that the exit gate remained open for five minutes, allowing fans to flow into the ground. Miss Lambert asked Mr Duckenfield: 'At any stage during those five minutes did it occur to you to wonder where those fans were going?' Mr Duckenfield responded: 'No ma'am.' Chair of the Hillsborough Families For Justice Margaret Aspinall arrives at the inquest on Tuesday . Agreeing with Miss Lambert that a match commander of reasonable competence ought to have thought where the fans allowed through the gate might go, the 70-year-old claimed to have been 'distracted' by a radio message referring to another gate 'going in'. 'I wanted resources to be directed to the North Stand,' he said. 'That is why my thought processes moved from where they (fans) were going to go, to what would happen next.' Referring to his failure to realise where fans would go during the five-minute period, the witness continued: 'It certainly was a mistake and an oversight. Under the circumstances, with my limited ability, I accept it was a mistake - a mistake I shouldn't have made, a mistake I regret bitterly. 'It was a grave mistake and I apologise profusely.' At 2.59pm, when the match kicked off, Mr Duckenfield told the jury, he looked towards the Leppings Lane terrace and had seen 'nothing untoward'. Miss Lambert suggested to the former match commander that it might be said to have been 'obvious' that fans climbing out of the central pens might be connected to the ingress of supporters through Gate C. 'It was not obvious to me ma'am,' Mr Duckenfield added. 'I thought there may have been some crowd disorder or some problem and I was awaiting information. 'I didn't know what to think. I was looking and waiting for information.' Questioned about when he had realised that something was badly wrong, Mr Duckenfield added: 'I have a recollection that a young man came from the perimeter track behind the goal and either collapsed or fell down. 'He was hobbling, I remember seeing him hobbling, and there was a sudden realisation that this was not a pitch invasion, this was a serious situation.'

"It was a surreal start to the day for a bleary-eyed night shift worker, after he got a lot more than he bargained from his morning cereal. Jarred Smith, 22, woke up at about 3pm last Tuesday and headed into the kitchen at his home in Davidson in Sydney's northern beaches. He took some food out of the fridge and walked over to the kitchen counter when he saw something strange and scaly sticking out of a Corn Flakes box. Scroll down for video . Jarred Smith, from Sydney's northern beaches, got a lot more than he bargained for inside a Corn Flakes box . Jarred said he stared at the box for about 15 seconds before he realised that contained a diamond python snake. 'I thought mum had bought some strange door stopper at first but then I saw the tail end of what looked like a snake and thought ""no way its a snake"",' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Then I peeked in the top of the cereal box and its head popped out,' he said. 'I dropped my food and ran out of the kitchen and screamed out to my dad downstairs ""dad, there's a snake in the kitchen!"".' His father also took a while to comprehend the situation thinking his son meant there was a snake on TV. 'When dad walked in it maneuvered even further into the box that's when I took the video.' Jarred then called the NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service (WIRES) and explained to the lady on the other end of the phone where the slithery reptile was hiding. 'She burst out laughing and said ""are you serious?"", he said. The diamond python retreated into the box when Jarred's dad came to see the unexpected surprise . The snake handler turned up minutes later and was surprised to see the size of the python, which he estimated at about one and a half metres long. 'He asked if we minded if put the snake back in our garden which we didn't,'Jarred said. 'The snake wouldn't fall out of the box so he had to rip it and the whole snake dropped out.' 'He was more surprised when he saw it properly because he said it actually looked about two metres long.' Diamond pythons are known for being quite timid and the snake handler told Jarred that the species is harmless and only attacked when aggravated. Although Jarred has never seen a snake before - let alone up so close and personal - he was impressed with how attractive the reptile was. 'He's a good looking snake so if he comes back it's fine - I just didn't expect to find it in my cereal.' The snake handler had to rip open the cereal box to release the snake which was two metres long .

"Paul Davies was jailed for 20 months after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm to the infant . A former soldier who battered a seven-month-old baby so badly that its eyes rolled to the back of its head has been jailed. Paul Davies, 28, left the infant with life-changing injuries and then falsely claimed to the child's mother that it had suffered a seizure. The woman said she had trusted Davies to look after the seven-month-old and when she returned he claimed the baby had 'gone rigid' after having some milk and vomiting. Prosecuting, Tara Wolfe said: 'He said he started to become panicky. He said he tried to call 999 but his phone wasn't working.' The baby was 'pale and stiff' when paramedics arrived and rushed it to hospital where scans found bruising around the neck, a brain bleed and bleeding to both retinas. Experts told the court the brain injuries were most probably due to shaking, and that the full effects of the trauma may not be known for years. The victim's mother, who is also not being identified, told the court she had 'trusted' Davis with the baby. Davis, of Clevedon, Somerset, initially denied injuring the tot and implied it could have been forcefully treated by its mother or paramedics. But he pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to the infant and was jailed for a 20 months at Bristol Crown Court. Judge Michael Roach told him: 'We will never know precisely how the baby came by its injuries. 'Whether through temper or loss of control, you caused devastating injuries to that small child.' Defending, Fiona Elder said: 'It was a one-off incident and a momentary loss of control.' She said Davis had been using his former partner's phone and the day before the incident she had cancelled her contract and left him unable to call 999. The court heard Davis was medically discharged from the Army and was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. At Bristol Crown Court, pictured, Judge Michael Roach said Davies had caused 'devastating' injuries to the child .","Ex solider Paul Davies admitted causing grievous bodily harm to the infant .

"Fans of the Clangers will be relieved to see they have not changed much as they return to our screens . With their pink woolly noses and whistling speech, the Clangers were among the most memorable children’s TV characters of the 1970s. And fans will be relieved to see they have not changed much as they return to our screens. Last night, the BBC gave viewers the first glimpse of the Clangers, which have been reinvented for a £5million series due to be broadcast in spring. The Clanger family – Major, Mother, Small, Tiny and Granny – are still knitted from wool and look similar to the original series’ characters. They also still live together on the moon in the new series, which will be narrated by actor and presenter Michael Palin. Advances in animation since The Clangers first aired more than 45 years ago will mean some slight differences. ‘We are able to give them more personality – a little twitch of the ear which can say so much,’ said Jackie Edwards, the series’ executive producer. ‘But she added: ‘The new series is very faithful to the original. It is still made with wool and love… there is a magic about The Clangers that’s enduring. You can tell what they’re saying.’ Fans of The Clangers were immediately taken with the teaser, declaring the creatures just as ‘adorable’ as the originals. ‘My four-year old was entrances,’ said one viewer on Twitter. ‘Now this takes me back!’ said another. The original series of The Clangers aired in 1969, and ran for 26 episodes until November 1972. There was also a four-minute election special broadcast in 1974. The £5million new series will be narrated by actor, presenter and comedian Michael Palin, pictured . Last night’s episode explained to children what a solar eclipse is, ahead of the eclipse expected to take place this morning. It stressed that viewers should take care of their sight, only viewing the phenomenon through special goggles. The series has had heavy involvement from Daniel Postgate, the son of Oliver Postgate, who co-created and narrated the original version of The Clangers.","Memorable 1970s show has been reinvented for a £5million spring series .

"Scott Peterson horrified the nation when he was convicted 10 years ago for murdering his 8-months-pregnant wife Laci and their unborn son Conner. While he was sentenced to death for the crime, the likelihood that the 42-year-old will actually be executed is unlikely in California where the last death row inmate was killed in 2006. Perhaps most shocking though is the fact that Peterson lives a relatively 'cushy' life at the Bay Area's 163-year-old San Quentin prison - which houses the largest death row population in the nation. Scroll down for video . Peteron's easy life behind bars: Scott Peterson is living in what has been described as an 'exclusive' and 'cushy' part of San Quentin prison in California. Above, photos of the man who killed his 8-months-pregnant wife in jail last year . Getting the best of a bad situation: Peterson allegedly lives in a single cell.  Above, a general view of the 163-year-old San Quentin prison, which houses the largest death row population of any prison in the country . Roof top: The portion of the prison where Peterson lives includes a roof deck with a half-basketball court . Recreation: Above, a handful of San Quentin prisoners playing pick-up basketball on a roof-deck court . Fox News spoke with Nancy Mulane, author of 'Life After Murder: Five Men in Search of Redemption', who is one of the few outsiders who have been able to witness Peterson's life behind bars. Mulane says Peterson is living in an 'exclusive' part of the historic prison, in a single cell with the ability to socialize with other prisoners on a roof deck with a half basketball court. 'I saw this quite, I would have to say, buff-looking young man with his shirt off,' Mulane said. 'And he was playing basketball. He looked like you were watching some college athletes out on a neighborhood court play basketball.' 'You've been around a lot of prisons,' Fox News' Geraldo Rivera remarked. 'It sounds to me like what you describe is the cushiest environment that you've seen.' Mulane went on to add that there are many death row prisoners in California who spend 23 of the 24 hours in a day locked in their cells. 'They are not having the life Scott Peterson is having. Scott Peterson has an exclusive life inside San Quentin,' Mulane said.

Above, Scott looking unconcerned in his mugshot and in court . Life in prison? Peterson was sentenced to death for the murder, but his execution looks unlikely in California where a death row inmate hasn't been killed since 2006 . Peterson's comfortable accommodations add insult to Laci and Conner's deaths, since he has also shown no remorse for the crime. Laci Peterson was reported missing on December 24, 2002. In the early days of the search, family and friends supported her husband Scott, believing he had nothing to do with her disappearance. But that changed when it was revealed less than a month later that Scott had been having extramarital affairs, and had even struck up a relationship with a massage therapist who didn't even know he was married. The fetus of the Peterson's unborn child was found in April 2003, after washing up on the shoreline of San Francisco Bay north of the Berkeley Marina. The next day, a woman's torso belonging to Laci was also recovered. Prosecutors argued that the state the bodies were in indicated that Laci was suffocated or strangled to death. Peterson was sentenced to death on March 16, 2005 for the crime, with the judge calling the murder of Laci 'cruel, heartless and callous'.","Author who saw Scott Peterson in San Quentin prison says the convicted murderer has a much easier life than most death row inmates .

"A good sex life won’t just improve your mood, it could also boost your brainpower. A study found that the more satisfied a person was with their love life in their 60s and 70s, the sharper their mind and the better their memory. One possibility is that an active sex life keeps the brain young. The finding follows a recent British study which revealed that age is no barrier to an active love life. Dutch researchers found that people in their 70s having sex were better able to use their memory, file photo . The Manchester University study found, more than half of men and almost a third of women aged 70-plus are still sexually active. And one third of these have sex at least twice a month. The latest study involved quizzing more than 1,700 Dutch men and women about their sex life and their need for intimacy. The volunteers, who ranged in age from 58 to 98, were also put through a battery of mental tests, designed to assess everything from memory to the ability to think abstractly. Two-thirds of the men and women had a partner and a similar number said that they still felt the need for intimacy. Those who were satisfied with their sex life and said that sexuality was important did better on the tests. The link was particularly strong in women, the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry reports. The researchers, from the Altrecht mental health centre, can’t be sure if staying sexually active was keeping the brain or if interest in sex dwindles as the mind fails. However, previous research has credited having sex with the growth of new brain cells, in rats at least. It has also been suggested that doing a crossword is better for the brain than an orgasm – because it gives the whole brain a workout, rather than just one area of it. Researchers have found that rats can boost their brain power by having more sex than normal . The Dutch researchers said it is important not to assume that sex is just for the young. They wrote: ‘Many beliefs about sexual behaviour in older populations are based on personal and stereotyped views of ageing and sexuality. ‘Older persons are generally expected to no longer be capable of or to be lacking interest in sex when, in reality, many elderly persons require sexuality to be important and wish to remain sexually active as they age. ‘Age itself is no adequate predictor of sexuality; the reality of ageing is that most people continue to have sexual feelings of some sort.’ ends .","University researchers found that sex in later life helps boost memory .

"Killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was 'passionate and obsessed' with the French Alps and used to enjoy regular holidays with his family just miles from the Germanwings crash site, it has emerged. The 27-year-old, who deliberately downed Flight 4U9525 killing all 150 people on board, dreamed of becoming a pilot from a young age and frequented a gliding club just 30 miles from the crash site with his parents as a child. Francis Kefer, a member of a flying club in Sisteron, in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence where the Airbus A320 crashed, said that Lubitz and his family regularly visited the region between 1996 and 2003. He also took part in flights over the province as a teenager, before later completing a gliding course in the area, which he was said to be 'well-acquainted' with. Scroll down for video . Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (above) had an obsession with the French Alps and used to fly gliders over the mountainside where he brought down a Germanwings flight, killing all 150 crew and passengers on board . Lubitz regularly visited the French Alps with his family as a youngster and as he grew older he took training courses during which he learnt to fly gliders over the mountainside where he brought down the Airbus A320 . Lubitz deliberately crashed the Germanwings Flight 4U9525 into the mountains on Tuesday after locking his captain out of the cockpit. He is said to have remained calm as he drove the plane directly into the ground . Lubitz brought down the passenger plane in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence on Tuesday. The crash site is just 30 miles from the Aero-club de Sisteron glider airfield, which Lubitz visited regularly as a child with his parents . Dieter Wagner, a member of Luftsportclub Westerwald – the gliding association where Lubitz first learnt to fly aged 14 – said: ‘He was passionate about the Alps, even obsessed with them.’ The 70-year-old added to Le Parisien: ‘Andreas participated in courses in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence with my niece, who was a good friend to him. ‘I am sure he knew the area of the crash because he had flown over it in a glider.’ The flying club, which is situated in Lubitz’s hometown of Montabaur, Germany, confirmed that the co-pilot had taken part in glider training sessions with the club’s partner firm in Sisteron - a town in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence of France. The Aero-club de Sisteron glider airfield, which is popular with glider pilots thanks to its numerous peaks and valleys and stunning panoramas, is situated just 30 miles away from the crash site. An unnamed source told France's Metro News that Lubitz, who would have been nine-years-old when the family started holidaying in the region, seemed a 'normal boy'. Lubitz first sat in the cockpit of a light aircraft at the age of 14 and, after a couple of years of instruction under dual controls, was able to fly on his own. One friend said he was desperate to become a pilot and  'would have died' if he had not passed his flying exams. He even became a flight attendant while he waited to start his training. After obtaining his pilot's licence, Lubitz regularly returned to the French region and, according to local glider pilots, overflew the major turning points in the region, flying from one peak to another. Ernst Müller, a member of Luftsportclub Westerwald aviation club, said: ‘I am certain that Andreas has participated at least once or two internships with us in Sisteron.’ Lubitz eventually went on to become a co-pilot for Germanwings in 2013 but his training was interrupted by a bout of depression and he found it difficult to shake off perceptions that he was not fully up to the demanding job. News of his obsession with the French Alps comes amid claims from German newspaper The Rheinische Post that he may have crashed the plane due to fears he was about to lose his licence on medical grounds. The pilot locked his captain out of the cockpit on Tuesday before setting the Germanwings Flight 4U9525's controls to descend into a rocky valley, obliterating the plane and killing all 150 people on board. Lubitz, a keen runner, had built his whole life around becoming a pilot and even posted pictures of planes all over his bedroom walls as a child. A friend said he 'would have died' if he had not have passed his flying exams . Dieter Wagner, 70 (pictured), a member of Luftsportclub Westerwald – the gliding association where Lubitz first learnt to fly aged 14 – described the killer co-pilot as 'passionate about the Alps, even obsessed with them' Lubitz flew over the province in the southern French Alps where downed the passenger jet as a teenager and later completed gliding lessons over the area. One acquaintance said he was 'obsessed' with the region . A member of the flying club which Lubitz started lessons with as a teenager said he was 'well-acquainted' with the French Alps and regularly flew over the area where he brought down the passenger plane on Tuesday . Investigators revealed yesterday that medical sign-off notes were found at Lubitz's home - including at least one that covered the day of the crash - and Dusseldorf University Hospital confirmed he had been a patient there over the past two months, although it would not disclose his condition. More sick notes are said to have covered other days when he flew despite being told not to. However, police said they found no suicide note in a five-hour search. Speaking to MailOnline, an airline spokesman stressed the company was unaware of any medical notes and said it had been Lubitz's responsibility to tell his employers he was unfit to fly. He was facing a potential medical examination that could have seen his pilot's licence removed and it is thought he may have feared mental or other health problems would bring an end to his dream. Former BA pilot Alastair Rosenschein said pilots of Lubitz's age face regular medicals as well as simulator tests and can be grounded if they fail to pass. He told MailOnline: 'He may have known that his career was already over. He may have known that the end was in sight.' Mr Rosenschein said that, in Britain, pilots under 40 face annual or bi-annual medicals and, as well as testing physical health, doctors often ask questions to assess pilots' mental health. He added: 'However, it's difficult to see how a doctor could foresee something like this. There are no rules that someone who is having marital or financial difficulties cannot fly.' In a blunt admission yesterday, Carsten Spohr, the head of Lufthansa which owns the budget airline, admitted Lubitz had slipped through the safety net with devastating consequences. ‘The pilot had passed all his tests, all his medical exams,’ he said. ‘He was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions. 'We have at Lufthansa, a reporting system where crew can report – without being punished – their own problems, or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment. 'All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.’ German investigators removed dozens of boxes from the Dusseldorf apartment Lubitz shared with his girlfriend yesterday, as they continue to search for clues which could explain the reasons behind the air crash . Investigators found a torn up sicknote which was valid on the day of the crash among other evidence . Other possible explanations for Lubitz's actions are that he may have stopped taking his medication so it would not be detected in any medical tests or slipped into desperation during a crisis in his relationship. He is said to have recently split from his on/off girlfriend, who he lived with in a smart flat on the outskirts of Dusseldorf. Some media reports claim the pair were together for seven years and were engaged to be married next year. However, a former lover of Lubitz came forward today to claim she had dated the troubled co-pilot for five months last year. The 26-year-old air Germanwings stewardess said she met Lubitz while the pair flew across Europe together and said they would often stay in hotels together. She said he even warned her that he was going to commit an act so heinous that his name would be remembered for ever. The woman, known only as Maria W, revealed to German newspaper Bild how he ominously told her last year: ‘One day I will do something that will change the whole system, and then all will know my name and remember it.’ When she heard about the airliner crash, she remembered Lubitz’s menacing prophecy. ‘I never knew what he meant, but now it makes sense,’ she said. Earlier today, a passenger on the outbound flight from Dusseldorf to Barcelona, which is believed to have had Lubitz on board, questioned why the co-pilot didn't down that flight instead. Michael, 45, said he saw the pilot leave the cockpit during the 6.45am flight for a toilet break. He told Bild: 'I sat in the fifth row. I could see the front of the plane. The toilet behind the cockpit was apparently out of order, I could see the red light flashing throughout the flight. 'A man over 40, probably the pilot, in a grey V neck sweater came through the curtain. He went through the plane probably to the rear toilet. 'After an estimated three to five minutes he came back and again opened the cockpit door.' He said he didn't see the co-pilot during the flight but described the journey as 'unobtrusive and 'normal'.","Andreas Lubitz said to be 'passionate and obsessed' with the French Alps .

"Airlines which fly suspected terrorists out of the country in breach of Home Office order will be hit with fines of up to £50,000 under new laws to come into force within weeks. The penalties would be applied to any carrier which breaches a government ‘no fly’ instruction and allows a jihadist to travel on their planes. Smaller fines of up to £10,000 could be applied where airlines fail to hand over detailed information about its passengers and crew. Some 600 Britons are thought to have flown to Syria or Iraq to join Isis, including the three teenage girls Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15 (pictured) The new powers are designed to prevent potential terrorists travelling overseas to fight with Isis. They were rushed through the House of Commons on Tuesday night and will come into force early next month. Some 600 Britons are thought to have flown to Syria or Iraq to join Isis, including the three teenage girls Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15. If police or the security agencies are aware of someone’s intention to travel, an automatic alert can be put next to their name which instructs an airline to pull them from the flight. The new rules will require all carriers to use data systems which automatically respond to instructions from police to offload or screen any passenger. Anyone who is subject to a Terror Prevention and Investigation Measure (Tpim) will also be prevented from travel. Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘We have a fundamental duty as a government to ensure that the people who work to keep us safe have the powers they need to do so.' Fahmida Aziz, Sahima Begum and Abase Hussen give evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee in the House of Commons - after their daughters are feared to have joined Islamic State in war-torn Syria . Mr Brokenshire added: ‘This important legislation will disrupt the ability of people to travel abroad to fight and then return. It will also enhance our ability to monitor and control those who pose a threat. ‘We have always been clear that we will take the strongest possible action against those who travel to Syria and come back to the UK with the intention of doing harm — both through our existing powers and by toughening them even further.’ All the measures are expected to come into force early next month, subject to approval in the Lords. Home Secretary Theresa May has also ordered officials to draw up new guidance for airlines requiring them to alert the police if young people attempt to travel on routes used to get to Syria.","Some 600 fanatics are thought to have flown to Syria or Iraq to join Isis .

'He's a bundle of personality wrapped into one little dog, and even though we've given him a 'voice' and he plays many different characters - Chef Crusoe, Captain Crusoe and Batdog. We like to think that everything we post somehow captures a bit of his amazing personality,' Mr Beauchesne said. Chef Crusoe with an array of ingredients including bread, carrots, lemons, broccoli and cheese . He shot to fame after his owners posted a video of him cooking. Last December the canine chef signed a book deal and even has a host of merchandise available online, including mugs, T-shirts, bumper stickers and even a calendar that can be 'autographed'. 'Crusoe's recent video showing him making bruschetta, with the enchanting Italian voice of Gino D'Acampo (Mum's crush) is probably our favourite production so far.' Rolling out the dough for his pizza (left), the cheeky chappie goes in for a taste of cheese (right) Crusoe patiently waits for his steak to cook. He particularly enjoys making Italian food . Mr Beauchesne explains that Crusoe's first recipe was carrot cupcakes, which the thoughtful pooch made on Valentine's Day for a special lady. 'Since then he's made pizza, steak and sweet potatoes, slow-cooked lamb, and now as part of his Italian series - 'bruschetta', as we get ready to take Crusoe to Italy this May!' Mr Beauchesne added that Crusoe will continue with his Italian series cooking videos and maybe even create some while he is in Italy. Who's a good boy? Crusoe waits patiently for his carrot cakes to bake . Pug life: Talented canine chef Crusoe with his homemade bruschetta . The couple who are originally from Quebec got Crusoe when he was just a small puppy and have raised him ever since. Mr Beauchesne explained that Crusoe enjoys cooking anything that involves a lot of butter, cheese, meat or dairy. 'So his taste is quite diverse. As you can see though, he's very well behaved when working with food! He won't gobble it up until it's finished and served. 'I couldn't have asked for a better dog. We always make the photo shoots fun and he's a great sport. He's always been very calm and cooperative, and just a natural in front of the camera. 'He's like a son to us.

Even shoppers interested in buying small figurines have to fork out £4.62 more in the UK - an increase of more than 25 per cent. UK shoppers also pay around 13 per cent more than some of their European counterparts, The Sun reported. Rob Davies, a 21-year-old fan of the show, said that fans 'should be treated equally'. Another fan, Jess Lilley, said: 'I am outraged. They make so much from the show here even though it is produced by Americans.'

Amazon Prime was more than £20 cheaper in the US at £59, its survey found. And a 13-inch Apple Macbook Pro cost £1,144 instead of £1,499 in the UK, it said. Part of the price difference is due to the UK having a high VAT rate.

"Starbucks is selling a limited edition coffee blend that is so rare it will only be available in stores for one week. The Nicaragua Laurina 'reserve' is currently available in just 20 select Starbucks stores in the United States, all of which have been flooded with requests from coffee lovers eager to get hold of the rare bean - which is being sold for $16 per half pound, more than double the amount of many of Starbucks' other more traditional offerings. Despite the coffee's hefty price tag, many of the stores in which the Nicaraguan blend was being sold have already run out of stock, less than 24 hours after the beans became available to the public.

"DIY: Celebrity builder Tommy Walsh has teamed up with Poundland for a range of tools costing £1 each . The price of hitting yourself on the thumb or hanging wallpaper upside down has just got cheaper. For Poundland is launching a range of 200 DIY essentials from hammers to packs of paint brushes and screwdrivers - and yes, they all cost no more than £1. The thriving budget chain has signed a partnership with celebrity builder Tommy Walsh, who appeared alongside Alan Titchmarsh in the BBC’s Changing Rooms, to develop and test the range. Recent reports from major DIY warehouses suggest many young adults don’t have the skills or the interest in home make-overs or doing jobs around the home. However, Mr Walsh insists people can save a fortune by avoiding the need for tradesmen if they have their own tools and make sure they plan their jobs carefully. He claims the items in the range are at least five to six times more expensive at the major DIY chains. He gave the example of a three piece professional paint brush set, which would be at £5-£6 at a leading shop. Other items include a 7.5m tape measure and 20g tube of superglue, as well as a 1m spirit level, paint rollers and trays, masking tape, a five pack of screwdrivers and the 330g tubes of all-purpose filler and mastic. ‘The cost of calling out a tradesman or even buying tools for small home improvements can mount up quickly,’ Mr Walsh said. ‘DIY should be accessible and affordable for everyone. Customers can fill their toolbox with all the essentials they need for as little as £10.’ The range has been trialled by tradesmen who decorate and carry out repairs for a living to ensure it is robust and easy to use. The grips have been ergonomically designed so the hand tools are easy to use for long periods without causing blisters. The decision by Poundland to move into DIY comes just as some of the big names are closing outlets, following a fall in trade. Homebase is shutting 80 stores amid claims today’s home makers do not know how to do even simple jobs like putting up a shelf or a curtain pole. Budget: The chain hopes to step in to the gap left by floundering . Poundland has helped DIY novices by splitting the range into four colour coded categories - ‘Decorating Essentials’ in red, ‘Adhesives’ in blue, ‘Toolbox Essentials’ in yellow and ‘Fixtures and Fittings’ in orange. Each pack will provide tips from Mr Walsh on how to carry out the corresponding DIY task. The partnership with the celebrity builder is part of a wider trend by the budget chain to bring in middle income shoppers. It already offers Jane Asher bakeware range, which has achieved double its predicted sales, while there are beauty products that have been well received by the fashion press, and jewellery. Poundland chief executive Jim McCarthy said: ‘Purchasing DIY products can be very expensive. We believe we have identified a gap in the market and can challenge other retailers with our more affordable products. ‘Tommy’s range offers outstanding value for money and will make home improvement accessible for everyone no matter what their budget.’","Poundland is now selling a wide variety of tools each costing £1 .

"This cat has outlived all of her nine lives. Tiffany Two, a tortoiseshell feline holds the Guinness World Record for the oldest living cat and reached another milestone Friday when she turned 27 years old. The cat, who was born on March 13, 1988 in San Diego, California has now lived the equivalent of 125 human years. Old age: Tiffany Two, a tortoiseshell feline, pictured, holds the Guinness World Record for the oldest living cat . Owner: Sharon Voorhees, pictured, paid just $10 for Tiffany Two when the cat was just six weeks old and has been caring for her ever since . Tiffany Two's owner Sharon Voorhees said she paid just $10 for the cat when she bought her from a pet store at six weeks old. She boasts that it was the 'best money she ever spent.' According to the Guinness World Records the short-haired black and orange tortoiseshell is officially the world's oldest living cat. Voorhees recalls that at the time she bought Tiffany Two she also purchased two dogs, born around the same time, but they died years ago. Meanwhile, she explains that the cat's unusual name was  a tribute to another tortoiseshell cat she owned in the 1970s. And while the 27-year-old is generally in good health, she does suffer from high blood pressure. Tweet: Guinness World Records tweeted 'this week oldest cat Tiffany Two turned 27 years old' But Vorhees says she still enjoys roaming around outside and is 'not feeble and still able to go up and down stairs'. Years ago, Tiffany Two had a stint on the open road after she went missing for two years. It's not known where she went. Today, she enjoys  staying inside but does venture outdoors sometimes. Voorhees said: 'She's not afraid of anything or anyone. She walks right past the dogs, she's very feisty!' As Tiffany Two  grows old gracefully she still has good sight and hearing and eats both 'wet food and dry food.' However, the record-breaker is not the oldest cat ever recorded throughout history. That achievement belongs to a feline from Austin, Texas, called Creme Puff who was born on 3 August 1967 and died on until 6 August 2005 at the ripe old age of 38. Milestone: Her owner Sharon Voorhees has kept pictures of her cat's growth since 1988 .","The cat holds the Guinness World Record for the oldest living cat .

"A San Antonio French teacher caught straddling a 15-year-old in her car. A Donna school security guard suspended for sending inappropriate texts to female students. A Waco band director who had sex with a high school girl in his music room. These are just three of the 74 cases of inappropriate sexual relations between educators and students that have been opened since September. The Texas Education Agency reported that, in the last three school years, there has been a 27 per cent increase in the number of student-teacher relationship investigations in the state. San Antonio teacher Marcus Revila was given 17 years in prison for producing child pornography with a 16-year-old student who he got pregnant. Lisa Zuniga avoided a long prison sentence because she was pregnant with the child of a 13-year-old student she had sexual relations with. There were 179 investigations during the 2013-14 school year, compared to 141 probes in the 2009-10 period, according to the Houston Chronicle. The surge of cases in Texas corresponds to a national rise. There were 781 reported alleged cases of sexual relationships between students and school employees, according to the Washington Post. Terry Abbott, a former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Education, said that, on average, 15 new young people are reported to have been 'sexually victimized' by their teachers each week, he wrote in the Washington Post. Abbott's firm, Drive West Communications, has been tracking media reports of relationships between students and their educators. According to Abott, they found that Texas has the highest number in the country of teacher sexual misconduct cases. Abott believes social media services have made it easier for teachers to 'develop improper relationships with students out of sight of parents and principals,' he wrote in the piece. Brittni Colleps (left) was sentenced to five years in prison after she admitted to having sex with five 18-year-old students at her home. But the lawyer for Ashley Zehnder (right) is arguing that she did not commit a crime by having relations with a student because the age of consent in Texas is 17 . He believes Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat have 'created an open gateway for inappropriate behavior'. Some states are already taking action. In New Jersey, teachers are not allowed to add students on Facebook without written approval from their principal. They can also only contact students electronically if its done through district computers. A relationship between biology teacher and cheerleading coach Ashley Zehnder, 24, and a boy on the school's squad came to light because of technology. Zehnder admitted to the relationship after the boy began showing a naked photograph she had sent him through Snapchat to fellow students at their Pasadena high school. The teacher's lawyer has argued that Zehnder did not commit a crime because the age of consent in Texas is 17. But some Texas teachers have been locked up for years after they were caught having sexual relationships with a student. Two Texas school districts have been rocked by multiple student-teacher relationships occurring just months apart, which included criminal justice teacher Carlo Andres Cordova and teacher Breanne Brown . San Antonio teacher Marcus Revila was given 17 years in prison without parole this year after he was charged with producing child pornography with a 16-year-old student he had relations with and is now pregnant with his child. And Kennedale teacher Brittni Colleps was sentenced to five years in prison after she admitted to having sex with five 18-year-old students at her home. But former teacher, Lisa Zuniga, was able to avoid a long prison sentence in 2003 because she was pregnant with the child of a 13-year-old student she had sexual relations with. A South Texas school district recently got hit with a federal lawsuit after three employees were found to have had sexual relationships with students, according to the San Antonio Express-News. One of those employees, criminal justice teacher Carlo Andres Cordova, was the son-in-law of the Donna district's superintendent and allegedly had sex with a female student in his classroom. And barely a month after a health sciences teacher at the Abilene Independent School District admitted to having sex with a student, the district was rocked by another incident in January. According to police, teacher Breanne Brown had sex with a 16-year-old student on 10 different occasions.","Texas Education Agency reported that there has been a 27 per cent increase in number of investigations in last three years .

But the super-sized feline, who tips the scales at 24.5lbs (11kg) and is 45 inches long, is only 17 months old and is set to continue growing.

Super-sized feline Ludo, who tips the scales at 24.5lbs (11kg) and is 45 inches long, is only 17 months old and is set to continue growing . Mrs Gill, 28, who runs a chip shop with her husband, said: ‘When we bought Ludo, he was no bigger than any of the other kittens in his litter as Maine Coon’s are quite chunky as kittens. ‘But as the months went on, we noticed he quickly overtook our other cats, who are a few years older than him, and he’s now double the size of them. ‘He’s a lovely cat- he’s very friendly and affectionate but some people who visit are scared of him as they’re used to seeing dogs that size, not cats. ‘When I pick him up, it’s like picking up a baby – he’s huge’ The Maine Coon belongs to Kelsey and Matthew Gill from Ryhill, West Yorkshire, who bought him from a breeder around a year ago . She said: ‘I’m not sure if he’s the biggest in Britain yet, but he’s definitely close. ‘We realised he could be one of the biggest when my husband looked it up on the internet and found Ludo was slightly above all the other cats, . ‘There’s a debate about when they stop growing, but he’s only 17 months so I think he’s still got a lot of growing to do. I can’t imagine how big he will get. ‘It’s strange as our other cats are much smaller but they eat so much more than he does. ‘The breeder we got him from told us his relative was the longest cat.’ ‘We’ve had Maine Coon’s for a while, but never one this big. The other two Maine Coon’s that we have at the moment are much smaller than Ludo and they’re about four years old. He overtook them in weight and size when he was five months old and he was 18 pounds at nine months. ‘Even though he’s huge, he’s so friendly and lovable. He’ll often come over and lay on the bed or flop out on the floor to be stroked. ‘He doesn’t cost us anymore than the other two as he doesn’t eat that much - the smallest one eats the most. He just has a standard amount of the Maine Coon royal canin cat food. Mrs Gill, 28, who runs a chip shop with her husband, said: ‘When we bought Ludo, he was no bigger than any of the other kittens in his litter as Maine Coon’s are quite chunky as kittens' ‘Although he’s big, we’re still able to pick him up and take him places if we want, but he is very heavy.’ Maine Coons’ – which are known as ‘the gentle giants’ of the cat world - produce some of the biggest domestic felines.

"Nicky Morgan has suffered a fierce backlash from teachers who yesterday branded her 'misguided' for snubbing a major union conference. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said she had been 'repeatedly' invited to speak at the event but had 'chosen not to attend'. The union also accused her of 'cynicism' over her rhetoric on teachers' workload and said it was now clear this was 'just a major PR exercise'. Nicky Morgan has suffered a  backlash from teachers who said she was 'misguided' for snubbing a  union conference . It comes as members are due to debate possible industrial action over teachers' pay, which could take place after the general election. The row is likely to put a damper on Mrs Morgan's efforts to placate the teachers' unions after taking over from Michael Gove last year. She earned herself the nickname of 'Ms U-Turn' after a series of apparent departures from her predecessor's policies, but now it appears her attempt to reverse Mr Gove's war with the unions may be faltering. At the weekend, she was attacked by NASUWT, the biggest teachers' union, for failing to accept an invitation to address their conference in Cardiff. And according to the ATL, this year's conference in Liverpool will be the first in recent history where there will be no representative MP from the Government. Speaking yesterday ahead of the event, general secretary Mary Bousted said: 'She was invited repeatedly. She has chosen not to attend, we don't know why she's not attending. 'I think that's not a good place for the new Secretary of State for education in a coalition government to be. 'If she really cared about teachers and if she really cared about their working lives, and the work that they're doing and the issues that they want to raise, then she would come. 'She's missing an important means to engage with teachers.' Mary Bousted, general secretary of NASUWT, said it gave 'such a bad message' that Mrs Morgan would not go to the major union conference . Dr Bousted pointed out that Mrs Morgan had chosen to speak to head teachers at the Association of School and College Leaders at the weekend. Lib Dem schools minister David Laws was also invited to the ATL event, but sent a 'personal apology' for not being able to make it, she said. She said of Mrs Morgan: 'I think it's just so misguided and gives such a bad message, to be able to go and speak to school leaders but not to be able to speak to teachers. 'What is she afraid of? Would she at ATL get a bad reception? No. Would she be jeered or shouted at? No. She would get tough questioning, but she would get a perfectly polite, and perfectly courteous hearing. 'I would have thought it would be a major platform for her to speak directly to the profession, and she's chosen not to do so. I think it's a big mistake.' She also attacked Mrs Morgan's pledge to help reduce teachers' workloads, which included a promise not to make alterations to qualifications in the academic year or during a course unless in 'exceptional circumstances'. The measures followed a survey launched by Mrs Morgan last October called the Workload Challenge survey, which generated 44,000 returns. At the time, she drew praise from unions after hailing teachers as 'heroes' for their efforts in the classroom. But Dr Bousted said yesterday: 'The Government's response, in our view, shows that this was merely a cynical attempt to get 44,000 teachers' email addresses and to appear to be interested in the issue of workload.' 'In our view, the workload challenge was just a major PR exercise with no serious, significant policy response.' On Tuesday, the ATL committee will be asked to campaign for a 'significant pay rise' for the education sector and to discuss 'joint action' with sister unions. The resolution argues that teachers have lost the equivalent of 15 per cent in their pay packets over the past few years. A Government spokesperson said: 'The Secretary of State recently approved a pay deal which gives heads the freedom to offer their best and most experienced teachers a 2 per cent pay rise, something that is only possible because we trust heads and governors to decide how to reward their staff.' They said of the ATL conference: 'The Secretary of State will not be able to attend because of diary commitments.'","Nicky Morgan snubbed Association of Teachers and Lecturers conference .

"Traditional British cooker manufacturer AGA, favoured by TV chefs Mary Berry and Nigella Lawson, has today launched in China with a brand new feature: a wok burner. Taking the leap into the new market is arguably the biggest gamble the firm, which has been selling ovens in Britain since 1929, has ever made. Most Chinese kitchens have just two gas hobs and, if they have an oven at all, it is usually cheap and the size of a microwave. Gamble: AGA has been selling cookers in Britain since 1929 and launching in China is seen as a big gamble. Daniel Wong (front), AGA’s director of business development in China, said shifting eating habits among the country’s rich influenced the company’s decision to launch there . British staple: AGA is a favourite of Merry Berry and Nigella Lawson. Even the PM has one of the firm's cookers in his kitchen . But AGA is targeting the country's new middle class and chief executive William McGrath told MailOnline he was confident he could convince people to spend between £5,400 and £27,000 on the British favourite. The launch was announced in 2012, but due to China’s unfamiliarity with ovens and  laws about accreditation for them, it was derailed. Accreditation rules have been re-drafted by authorities and now, three years later, AGAs are finally available to order. Mr McGrath, speaking in Beijing ahead of the official launch event, conceded that the cookers could just become popular with a ‘small niche market connecting with expats in China’. However, he said that it was worth the risk because if they prove popular with the country’s 1.35 billion population it will be a ‘game changer’ for the firm. ‘We’re quietly confident, and that comes from talking to people in the industry as well as consumers,’ he said. ‘The answer to whether it’ll work seems to be, “It’s definitely worth a go”. But nobody is saying this is definitely going to work.’ AGA products are synonymous with cosy comfort food such as Sunday roasts and Victoria sponges. The Prince of Wales, David Cameron, Delia Smith and even Jeremy Clarkson, who was dropped by the BBC this week, own one. Despite the company's rich British history, it has teamed up with China-based firm Beijing Hi Seasons for the rollout and Mr McGrath said he’s hoping that  families in China will use the cookers to make traditional Chinese food. AGA chief executive William McGrath (pictured) denied that succeeding in China was essential for the company but added: ‘We want to win some away games' Cooker model: British fashion model Daisy Lowe was enlisted to advertise the popular cooker, which has not launched in Asia . As such, the RedFyre AGA models being launched in China resemble those available in Britain but with a crucial difference: a wok burner on top. China’s new moneyed middle class has a huge appetite for western luxury brands, from Chanel clothes to Land Rovers. Daniel Wong, AGA’s director of business development in China, told MailOnline that shifting eating habits among the country’s rich also influenced the company’s decision to launch there. ‘Five years ago in China, when people got money they just dined out in expensive restaurants,’ he said. ‘But affluent people have started cooking at home more, showing off to friends, saying: “I can cook”. We’ve seen a rise in cooking schools and sales of cooking magazines.’ Nobel Prize-winning physicist Dr Gustaf Dalén invented the world's first heat-storage cooker in 1922. After a failed experiment cost him his sight, the doting husband wanted to make a better appliance for his wife Elma. According to the AGA website, Dr Dalén created a cast-iron cooker capable of every kind of cooking simultaneously, with two large hotplates and two ovens. The AGA was invented and by 1929, manufacturing was underway at the AGA Heat Ltd factory in Smethwick. AGAs are now made at the company's Shropshire foundry in Coalbrookdale and are still made by pouring molten iron into moulds. However the modern cookers contain state-of-the-art technology. AGA's history dates back to 1929. This picture, taken in 1968, shows two children at the Ideal Home Exhibition . Can you really do every kind of cooking that there is? This advert was published in a 1955 edition of Punch Magazine . A cascade of recent high-profile food safety scandals in China has also contributed to a rise in home cooking, as confidence in restaurant standards has dropped. Although AGA sales were up in 2014 in the UK, the company is reaching near saturation point in the country – after all, you’re only likely to buy an AGA once. Last year the company, which produced its millionth Rangemaster cooker this month, released a slimline City60 model aimed at UK city dwellers in an attempt to find new buyers. Mr McGrath denied that succeeding in China was essential for the company but added: ‘We want to win some away games. 'China and Germany, where we’re also expanding, are fascinating because they’re outside of our comfort zone.’ Consumer analyst Paul French recently told the Financial Times: ‘In China, if you have the kind of money to spend on an AGA, you generally have someone who cooks for you.’ But Mr Wong and Mr McGrath said that the AGA is billed as a family-orientated product and this would chime well in the country. The RedFyre AGA models being launched in China resemble those available in Britain but with a crucial difference: a wok burner on top . British: AGA has been selling these popular ovens in Britain since 1929 but hopes to break into the Asian market . ‘Now, in China, the generation that earns money doesn’t just leave behind their parents,’ Mr Wong said. ‘They bring them back home. So we see families with one kid, two kids, together with grandparents, and Chinese love family gatherings.’ Another potential pitfall for the AGA is the risk of copycat manufacturers ripping them off and undercutting them. Trademark, copyright and patent abuse in China is often flagrant, and it seems inevitable that if AGA takes off, knock-off products with similar names will start popping up. ‘We’re just going to concentrate on pushing our brand really hard,’ said Mr McGrath. ‘We know those stories [of rip-off products] are a concern for everyone, but you’ve got to go with what you know. This brand has stood for 90 years because it stands for something.’ While it’s hugely ambitious to try to get a generation of Chinese to ditch cooking traditions that stretch back generations, Mr McGrath said that if the gamble pays off, he’ll set his sites on conquering the rest of Asia. ‘China could be an entry point to Asia,’ he said. ‘If it works here it’d obviously follow on to look at other markets here.’","British manufacturer AGA has launched a cooker with wok burner in China .

"Police say a woman in an SUV followed the mother of Eliza Delacruz as she rode the bus with her daughter in Long Beach, California, less than two hours before the three-week-old girl was kidnapped on January 3. Eliza was found dead in a dumpster near the Mexican border the following day. During the kidnapping, a man burst into the Delacruz family home and shot the infant's parents and uncle before taking the girl. Scroll down for video . Theses sketches show the woman and man being sought in connection to the abduction of Eliza Delacruz . Eliza was found dead in a dumpster the day after a man broke into her home and shot her parents and uncle . She was found in a trash bin behind a pizza restaurant in Imperial Beach, a town near the Mexican border . Sketches were released on Wednesday of both suspects. The girl's parents and uncle were critically injured, but once they recovered the mother recalled her encounter with the woman. Authorities do not think the baby's father and uncle were followed before the shooting and kidnapping. Police say the woman was driving a black Range Rover SUV and that she stopped the mother and spoke to her about her infant after they got off the bus. About two hours later, Eliza was kidnapped by the gun-toting man. She was found dead the following day in a trash bin behind a pizza restaurant 120 miles south of her home in the town of Imperial Beach. Cameras did not capture a license plate of the SUV. The FBI is assisting to see if the images can be enhanced. According to the Long Beach Police Department: 'Detectives continue to consider all possibilities as to why these crimes may have occurred. 'At this point in the investigation, a connection between the victims and suspects has yet to be identified.' Police have not determined a motive and have no indication the family was in any kind of trouble. Police say the woman was driving a black Range Rover SUV (pictured) and that she spoke to the mother . A small memorial was created near the location of the trash bin where Eliza's dead body was dumped . Imperial Beach is about 120 miles away from the home Eliza was kidnapped from in Long Beach, California . Long Beach police Lt. Lloyd Cox said: 'We've looked at narcotics, we've looked at human trafficking, we've looked at all kinds of things to see if there's any indication as to why somebody would pick this family. 'They went through a significant amount of effort and violence to take one three-week-old baby. 'Why?' The death was ruled a homicide, but details from the autopsy have been withheld because of the ongoing investigation . The family was moved to a different location Wednesday to protect them as police released the new information. The names of the baby's parents and uncle have also not been released for their safety. Cox declined to say if the family had been under police protection since the shootings. He said: 'They know where they live, obviously. 'Somebody may want to silence them further. 'They've tried to kill them once already and they killed their child. 'We can't just sit back and wait. 'We're hoping that they're local and we may get something.' A $25,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to any arrests. Long Beach Police urge anyone who may be able to identify the vehicle or driver who approached the victim on January 3, 2015, to call Long Beach Homicide Detectives Donald Goodman and Mark Mattia at (562) 570-7244.

"A Virginia lawmaker who was jailed over a sex scandal with his 17-year-old receptionist has announced that she has given birth to a baby boy. Delegate Joseph Morrissey, 57, told The Richmond Times-Dispatch on Sunday that Myrna Pride, now 18, had delivered 'a beautiful, healthy 7 lb. 8 oz. baby boy' in Georgia. 'I was with Myrna and she is absolutely thrilled… I am too!' he told the paper, which added that there was no information on the baby's father. Morrissey, who was re-elected from behind bars in January, was released from jail last week after completing a sentence for a misdemeanor relating to the sex scandal, which emerged last summer. Sex scandal: Joe Morrissey, pictured in January, has announced a teenager with whom he is accused of having sex has given birth to a healthy boy. He pleaded no contest to the charges last year . To avoid a trial, he had pleaded no contest in December 2014 to contributing to the delinquency of a minor in a sex scandal involving the then-17-year-old girl. The plea allowed him to avoid potentially decades behind bars. He had been accused of having sex with the teenager in his law offices - where she worked - and of possessing a naked photo of her, which he also sent to a friend. Their alleged relationship emerged after Pride's sisters and father found a nude photo and sexually explicit messages on her phone. They tracked Morrissey and Pride from a restaurant one night in August 2013, and then called police, who found the teenager inside his home at midnight. Morrissey, a bachelor who has fathered three children with three different women, has denied having sex with the teenager. She has also denied the relationship. Morrissey claimed that Pride came to his home that night in August 2013 not to have sex, but to get his legal help recovering child support from her father, Coleman Pride. Then earlier this year, he was indicted on four new felony charges for allegedly forging a document relating to payments Pride's father owed her. Morrissey allegedly vouched for the document in court and persuaded the girl's mother to swear to its authenticity as well. Behind bars: Morrissey is seen leaving jail in Barhamsville, Virginia on work release in January. He was released last week but now faces four felony charges over allegations he forged court documents . The document had been presented in court to support his version of events from the night the girl was found inside his home. It appeared to be a court order showing that Coleman Pride, Myrna's father, had agreed to pay $50 a month into a college fund for his daughter. But prosecutors said there is no court record of any child support order, and that the document 'appears to be a fabrication'. Charges: Deirdre Warren (pictured) is also accused of swearing the documents were authentic . Myrna's mother, Deidre Warren, was also indicted on perjury and forgery charges. Morrissey faces up to 10 years on each count if convicted. He is preparing for a trial on the charges and Pride, who will turn 19 later this month, has appeared at his recent hearings, the Times-Dispatch reported. Morrissey, an attorney known as 'Fighting Joe' since his 1993 courthouse fistfight with another lawyer, said earlier this year that the charges are false and he vowed to beat them. 'This is a very harmful and mean-spirited blow, but I'll do what I've always done. I'll prevail,' he said. After his conviction, the four-term Democrat announced his resignation under pressure from his colleagues but angered them by running as an independent in the special election called to choose his successor. He won the election in January. That month, the Associated Press reported that his colleagues largely ignore him. House Speaker William J. Howell stripped Morrissey of his committee assignments, and legislative leaders from both parties are debating whether to censure or expel him. 'This is a truly painful and embarrassing chapter for the oldest continuously operating legislative body in the New World,' Howell said after learning of the new charges. 'The House will evaluate these new indictments as it pertains to disciplinary action.'","Delegate Joseph Morrissey was released from jail last week after completing a sentence over accusations he had sex with the girl, then 17 .

"A shootout between a family and police in an Arizona Walmart parking lot early Sunday morning ended with the death of a suspect and a wounded cop. Cottonwood Police say they were called to the scene of the Walmart on Rodeo Drive at 11:52am Saturday after receiving a complaint about a female employee being harassed by a group of people. When they arrived at the parking lot around midnight, cops confronted a family of eight near their Suburban SUV with Idaho plates, who started shooting, according to the Verde Independent. Shootout: Shots rang out at a Cottonwood, Arizona Walmart early Sunday morning as a family of eight got into a gunfight with police . Fatality: A police officer was shot in the leg and a suspect shot to death in the dramatic confrontation . 'It was 8 on 8,' Johnson said. 'Eventually, they were all subdued and are in custody.' During the gunfight, one of the suspects was killed while a police officer was shot in the leg. Another suspect was hit in the stomach and rushed to the hospital. The injured police officer, 31, was last reported in stable condition, while the condition of the second suspect is not being released. The cop has been with the force for 10 years, and is expected to make a full recovery. During the fight, a Walmart employee tried to aid the police officers and broke his arm.

"A Brazilian man known locally as the ‘Ninja of Serpents’ came face-to-face with a pair of snakes in his latest date with danger. Captured on camera, Arteval Duarte holds what appear to be two BCC Boa Constrictors – native to South America – in his hands as he addresses the camera. He releases the snakes – also known as Red-tailed boas – and starts to blow up a balloon, dodging one of the snakes that lunges at him. The snakes watch him intently as the balloon he is inflating gets bigger and closer to them before violently lunging at him without warning. Bursting the balloon instantly, the snake comes incredibly close to puncturing the man's face. The viper then retreats back to its original position and Duarte begins to blow up another balloon. Arteval Duarte is known locally as the ‘Ninja of Serpents’ because of his many filmed encounters with snakes . Duarte moves closer to the Boa Constrictors while blowing up a balloon, causing one of them to strike . He repeats the dangerous feat three more times – the two snakes taking it in turns to pop the balloons as he compliments their intelligence. The video concludes with the snake ninja approaching the constrictors on the table and after dodging another lunge, grabbing and holding onto them. According to Duarte, the two snakes have been trained to obey his commands and bursting balloons from his mouth like this appears to be something they are used to doing. The motive for the stunt is in apparent protest against the deforestation of the Amazon. The mouth of the snake that bursts the balloon is only inches away from puncturing Duarte's face . Duarte blows up a total of four balloons and the two snakes appear to take it in turns bursting them . Arteval has specialised in performing bizarre stunts with snakes for 15 years to protest the deforestation of the Amazon . Arteval says that he dedicates his life to protecting the habitats of animals and that his videos bring attention to the problems. Specialising in bizarre stunts for over 15 years, Arteval has also been recorded putting tarantulas and scorpions in his mouth. He has been bitten by many snakes in his time, which may give an explanation for the bandage on his arm.","A pair of snakes lunge at daredevil Arteval Duarte as he blows up balloon .

"Two of China's most popular websites have been criticised for using 'sexist stereotypes 'on International Women's Day. The doodles show a ballerina twirling in a music box and another depicts a girl drinking tea and surrounded by flowers while sat in an armchair. Search engine Baidu had the ballerina in a pink dress, who first turned into a bride and then into a mother pushing a baby, on its homepage on Sunday. Sexist doodles: The popular Chinese website has been accused of missing the point of International Women's Day with ballerina image . The depictions caused outrage on social media as websites celebrated International Women's Day on Sunday. Video-sharing site Youku, wished female users: 'May the world treat you gently.' Critics wasted no time in comparing the two websites to global giant Google which featured women in professions, including an astronaut, a scientist, sports players an artist, a chef and a musician. Weibo user @Zoexiaoyizi, said of the ballerina:  'This is how you define women and celebrate them! On the mark: By contrast, Google's doodle shows images of female scientists, astronauts, judges and sports stars to illustrate achievements . Chinese authorities detained several women right's activists this weekend. Some had planned to hold a nationwide protest against sexual harassment.On Monday, five were still being held police, said an activist and a friend of the women, who asked not to be identified. Beijing traditionally cracks down on activists during important meetings like this week's National People's Congress (NPC). 'Google's doodle just makes their stupidity even worse.' Guo Weiqing, a professor at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, told CNN, that the imagery suggested that women are there only to be taken care of and look pretty while the business of the real world is left to men. 'Internet companies conveying such a narrow definition of women isn't good. 'It's exactly the opposite of the International Women's Day mission, which is fighting for gender equality,' he said. Baidu and Youku did not respond to calls for comment.","Search engine Baidu showed ballerina turn into wife then mother .

"A woman shed an incredible nine stone after posting pictures of all of her meals on Instagram - and getting people to rate how healthy they are. Jess Semmens, 22, takes a series of pictures of what she is about to eat, posts them on her page and waits to see what her followers think of her food. It may sound like a bizarre routine but uploading hundreds of such snaps online has helped Jess lose nine stone and six dress sizes in two years. Scroll down for video . Jess Semmens, 22, went from 22st to 13st after she began posting her meals on Instagram for people to rate . 'You could say that I have Instagrammed myself thin' - Jess began to post workout photos. The positive comments were the confidence boost she needed to carry on . After binge-eating and fad diets Jess found motivation to slim by publicly sharing details of her meals, their calorie count and her weight-loss progress. Inspired by the online feedback she received - mostly from strangers - she shrank from 22st and a dress size 24, to 13st and size 12. Research unit manager Jess says: 'Like most women, I had tried every diet under the sun but none worked for me. 'I thought I was doomed to be overweight for ever but when I started counting calories on a phone app and sharing pictures of my meals I was amazed at how many comments I received. 'I started documenting the change in my figure as I lost weight and it was a great way to see my progress and keep me on track whenever I felt like reaching for the biscuit tin. 'If I didn't stick to the diet I wasn't just letting myself down, I'd be letting down all my followers too. Jess began focusing on losing weight by sharing her healthy meals when her doctor told her that she would be dead before she was 25 . Jess began cooking meals from scratch and eventually sharing her own recipes or ingredients on Instagram . 22-stone Jess had tried 'every diet under the sun' but nothing had worked for her . The pressure kept me motivated, as did all the lovely comments I got - and now I feel amazing. You could say that I have Instagrammed myself thin.' At just seven, a gym accident left Jess struggling to carry on with the sport and she ballooned in size. Jess, of Exeter, Devon, says: 'I hated not being able to do my gymnastics so comfort-ate and soon started to pile on the pounds. 'I then started getting bullied at school. The other children would say really nasty things to me. My school days became a nightmare. I'd hide myself away in the toilets.' Ashamed of her growing belly, from the age of ten, Jess began raiding stashes of food from her parents' kitchen and hiding it to later gorge on in secret. She says: 'I'd grab anything I could get my hands on and would hide it from my mum and dad. When I was feeling sad, I turned to the snacks for some comfort.' But the cruel playground taunts went on and Jess's weight continued to climb. Bullied at school, Jess began to hide herself away and gorge on food in secret . At just the age of seven, Jess, from Exeter, Devon, had a gym accident which left her unable to continue with sports. At this point, her weight began to balloon . By the time she sat her GCSEs in 2008, age 15, Jess was 14st and a dress size 16. A year later, in the summer of 2009, Jess was given a confidence boost when she met her now ex-boyfriend. She says: 'He didn't care about my body and used to compliment me all the time. All my body hang-ups were suddenly washed away and I felt happier.' But the nights spent cuddled up on the sofa, still eating the comfort food, only served to worsen Jess's weight problem. Jess says: 'We settled into a really unhealthy routine. I was happy because I was in love but this had such an awful effect on my health. 'We spent every night slumped on the sofa. We'd have a huge bag of crisps each and a whole tub of ice cream to ourselves. Looking back, I'm disgusted by how much we ate.' Over the course of just two and half years, Jess ballooned to a size 24, putting on another 7st to reach 22st. Her office job meant she spent most of her day sat at her desk - and she took no exercise. She says: 'It got to the point where I was getting out of breath just from walking. When Jess began sharing her meals on Instagram and counting calories, she began to get positive comments, which motivated her even more . 'I was even afraid to go out dancing with my friends because I'd get so hot and tired - I would be dripping with sweat before I had even walked into the club.' In 2011, Jess visited her GP for a check-up and was given a devastating wake-up call - either she turned around her lifestyle or she would be dead before she was 35. Shortly after, she split with her boyfriend and moved back home with her parents. She recalls: 'I wanted to lose weight and was a sucker for a fad diet. 'First I tried cutting out sugar, then I tried a low-carb diet. 'I tried the Paleo and Atkins diets but never managed to stick to anything for more than a few weeks and nothing seemed to shift the weight.' By the summer of 2012, Jess was feeling helpless - but then she heard about app My Fitness Pal. She says: 'A friend told me about it and I thought I would give it a go. It allowed me to put in my height, weight and goal weight and it told me to eat no more than 1,600 calories a day.' The app outlined her new diet - to eat 50 per cent carbs, 30 per cent fat and 20 per cent protein - and although she stuck to the plan at first, she began to struggle to keep herself motivated. Then Instagram came into play. Jess found that looking at other people's weight-loss journeys helped her motivate her on her own . She says: 'A friend had told me about all the healthy-eating accounts on Instagram, so at first I used the search function to look for ideas. It really helped to see other people's weight-loss journeys and it made me realise I could share mine.' Motivated to ditch chocolate and crisps, Jess started cooking Instagram-inspired meals from scratch and sharing them. She received many likes from other healthy eaters and, once her cooking skills got up to scratch, began creating her own healthy recipes and sharing them. Only two months later, Jess had lost three stone and gained hundreds of followers. She says: 'Once I plucked up confidence I joined the gym when I'd lost about 4st. This is when I started taking post-workout pictures. 'I started to post almost everything I ate and uploaded post-workout photos to show my followers how much I'd worked out. I did mostly cardio as I was too scared to use the weights. 'People commented on how good I looked and it was just the confidence boost I needed to carry on.' By last December, two and a half years into her regime, Jess had lost a mighty nine stone. She says: 'If it wasn't for Instagram, I'd still weigh 22st. You can try all the fad diets but all you need is to eat healthily and to have some encouragement. I've never been happier.' BEFORE . BREAKFAST: Coffee and chocolate bar .

"Hidden patterns of climate change have been revealed by scientists using a method more normally used to diagnose heart disease. The scientists used multiscale entropy analysis to measure the 'pulse of the planet' in an attempt to look for subtle changes in temperature on Earth. The technique is normally used by surgeons to detect irregular heartbeats in large amounts of data from echocardiograms. The graph above shows how the entropy - or predictability - of Central European air temperatures have become less predictable over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months. The black lines shows the temperature predictability between 1850 to 1960 while the red lines shows the entropy between 1961 and 2014 . Researchers at the University of Leicester, however, have used it to look at the variability in the temperature in Europe. They found that the climate appears to have become less regular recently when temperatures are examined on times-scales of longer than 12 months. The chances of heatwaves in Europe have dramatically increased in the past decade as a result of warming temperatures, experts have said. Extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are now likely to happen twice a decade, a study from the Met Office found last year. The chances of extreme heatwaves, such as the one in 2003 which led to tens of thousands of deaths across Europe, have also increased tenfold, from a one in 1,000 year event to around one in a century. By the 2040s, such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, according to the research published in the journal Nature Climate Change. The study is an update of research carried out in 2004 into the heatwave the previous year. It found the likelihood of it happening again has at least doubled as a result of human activity, such as burning fossil fuels. Despite a slowdown in rising global temperatures since the late 1990s, the new study found summer temperatures in central and Mediterranean Europe affected by the 2003 heatwave had increased by 0.81°C (1.4°F) between the 1990s and the period 2004 to 2013. They say this may be a sign that the regional temperatures are being influenced by more complex feedback systems and may explain why extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods and cold spells are happening more irregularly. Professor Heiko Balzter, a climate scientist at the University of Leicester who led the study, said: 'I had the idea to apply a new method to the climate data. 'It has been applied a lot to diagnose heart disease, because it is good at detecting regularity and randomness in time-series data. 'We are literally taking the pulse of the planet. 'Interestingly, the changes we found only operated on time-scales longer than about a year. 'On these time-scales the climate seems to have become less predictable.' Multiscale entropy analysis works by searching data for small patterns of information that appear repeatedly. It many of these chunks are found then the data has low entropy and high regularity. If few are found then the system is harder to predict. The research team, shoe work is published in the journal Climate, used this approach to analyse the Central European variance-adjusted mean monthly air temperature anomalies. They found that air temperatures between 1961 and 2014 have become less predictable than between 1850 and 1960 over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months. Professor Balzter said: 'Evidence is mounting that the temporal dynamics of the climate system are changing at the same time as the average global temperature is increasing due to multiple climate forcings. Heatwaves, like the one above hitting Brighton Beach, have become harder to predict because temperatures patterns across Europe have become more irregular, according to the new research by climate scientists . This map of central Europe shows where entropy has increased (blue) and where it has decreased (red) This map of central Europe shows where the temperature data had the greatest change in entropy, as shown by the colours where yellow is the greatest change and hardest to predict while white is an entropy change of zero . 'A large number of extreme weather events such as prolonged cold spells, heatwaves, droughts and floods have been recorded around the world in the past 10 years. 'Such changes in the temporal scaling behaviour of climate time-series data can be difficult to detect. 'It is possible that climate system feedbacks are expressed in altered temporal scales of the European temperature time-series data.'","Multiscale entropy analysis is normally used to diagnose heart disease .

"Convicted criminals could be banned from smoking in the communal areas of prisons after a landmark court ruling. A High Court judge in London has declared that the 2006 Health Act, which prohibits lighting up in public and in workplaces, applies to all Crown premises, including prisons. It comes after Mr Justice Singh rejected Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's argument that the Crown had immunity from the Act. Criminals could be banned from smoking in the communal areas of prisons following a landmark ruling at the High Court in London . However, the judge accepted his ruling had wide-ranging implications and said it should not take effect until Mr Grayling has had a chance to appeal. The judge was told by Government lawyers that criminalising smoking could lead to unrest in the jails of England and Wales. Prisoners can smoke in their cells with the door shut and outside in exercise yards, but both inmates and staff could face prosecution for lighting up in communal areas if the ruling is not overturned on appeal. The case was brought by Paul Black, an inmate at HMP Wymott in Lancashire, who says he suffers from a range of health problems made worse by second-hand smoke. High Court judge Mr Justice Singh, pictured, made the ruling after rejecting the argument that Crown premises had immunity from the Health Act 2006, which bans smoking in public places and in workplaces . Lawyers for Black, a sex offender who has been at Wymott since 2009, argued both prisoners and staff were guilty of lighting-up in areas prohibited under prison rules, including on landings, in laundry rooms and in healthcare waiting rooms. Lawyers for the Justice Secretary maintained the rules and regulations, especially the sanction of withdrawal of privileges, were sufficient to deal any problem. The Health Act already applies to private prisons as they are not Crown premises. Mr Justice Singh, sitting in London, declared: 'In my judgment it is clear from the terms of the 2006 Act that the intention of Parliament was indeed that it should apply to all public places and workplaces which fell within its scope, including those for which the Crown is responsible.' But giving permission to appeal, the judge acknowledged concerns in the Prison Service over the impact of his decision on 'prisoners who feel the need to smoke and may be resistant to the criminalising of that conduct in places where in my view the Health Act does apply.' Black had also argued that prisoners were legally entitled to anonymous and confidential access to the NHS freephone smoke-free compliance line to report infringements of the rules. The judge said that issue should be reconsidered by the Justice Secretary in the light of his judgment. Black is serving a sentence of indeterminate detention for public protection (IPP) after being convicted in 2007 of sexual assault and outraging public decency. His minimum term in jail expired after 203 days but he cannot be released on licence until the Parole Board decides he is no longer a danger to the public. The case was brought to the High Court by Paul Black, an inmate at HMP Wymott in Lancashire, pictured, who says he suffers from a range of health problems made worse by second-hand smoke . Black's solicitor Sean Humber, head of the Prison Law Team at Leigh Day, said: 'The judgment confirms that the legal restrictions on smoking apply every bit as much in prisons as in the public places and workplaces in the wider community. 'The judgment is important in confirming that prisoners are entitled to the same level of protection from the risks posed by second-hand smoke as everyone else.' However, a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said; 'Prison cells in England remain exempt from the smoke-free legislation that came into effect in 2007. 'Since that time we have introduced a number of measures to reduce the risk of exposure of staff and prisoners to second-hand smoke. We are undertaking additional measures to continue to lessen the impact of smoking in prisons. 'This includes tightening our current smoking controls, undertaking air quality monitoring in prison accommodation, and maximising the provision of smoking cessation support to those prisoners who want to stop smoking.'","High Court rules smoking in communal areas of prisons should be banned .

"We all have our own ways of dealing with heartache, whether its drinking our cares away with friends, turning to the comfort of our families, or perhaps even buying a sports car. But one pensioner took a slightly more unorthodox approach after splitting from his wife by nailing a caravan on top of a motorised catamaran and sailing it around the English coast. The unusual vehicle, which also features a rather flimsy looking safety fence, was last spotted making its way along The Swale between the Isle of Sheppey and Kent coast. Unusual sight: The pensioner has now taken to the water in a floating caravan, seen in recent days chugging along down The Swale between the Isle of Sheppey and Kent coast . Puzzled locals, who have watched the bizarre contraption in disbelief, said the owner is a keen boatman in his '70s or 80s’ and lives in nearby Sittingbourne. Some residents had theorized that the man built the craft to appease his wife, who was said to hate sailing but love caravaning. However a close friend of the handyman said that the couple actually split two years ago, and his friend built the craft as a way of coping with his grief. ‘And fisherman Trevor Ryan, 63, added: ‘He bought the catamaran and then he fitted the caravan on it and launched it from Iron Wharf boatyard.

"A New Zealand bar manager and his two Myanmar colleagues were jailed for two and a half years with hard labour by a Yangon court Tuesday for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks night. The ad posted on Facebook in December caused a stir of outrage in the former junta-ruled country, where surging Buddhist nationalism and religious violence has sparked international concern. Philip Blackwood, who worked at the VGastro bar in Yangon, was found guilty of insulting religion along with the bar's Myanmar owner and manager, after the New Zealander posted a mocked-up photo of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook — in reference to a well-known international club brand. The 32-year-old was arrested by Myanmar police in December, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up. Scroll down for video . Philip Blackwood (C) is escorted by police to a court hearing in Yangon. Blackwood and his two Myanmar colleagues were sentenced  to two and a half years in jail for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks . In emotional scenes after the verdict, family members of the two Myanmar defendants expressed shock and fury at the sentencing, with the mother of one exchanging barbs with a handful of nationalist monks waiting outside. The case has been watched closely by international observers amid fears that the Buddhist-majority country, which has seen a surge in foreign investment since it began emerging from the grip of the military in 2011, is seeing its much-lauded reforms stalling. Blackwood, who has a seven month old daughter, along with 40-year-old bar owner Tun Thurein and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, have been held in Yangon's notorious Insein prison since their arrest in December. Mr Blackwood leaves court after being sentenced to two and half years in prison. He was found guilty of insulting Buddhism . Blackwood, the manager of VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested  after posting a promotional image of a psychedelic Buddha wearing headphones to the bar's Facebook page . The trio, who all denied the charges, were sentenced to two years in jail for insulting religion through written word or pictures and a further six months for breaching local authority regulations. Both offences carry the punishment of hard labour. They were also held responsible for protests that erupted outside the bar over the image. Judge Ye Lwin said that while Blackwood, 32, had posted an apology, he had 'intentionally plotted to insult religious belief' when he uploaded the photo. He added that although the New Zealander had admitted to posting the picture without intending to offend, it was also 'unreasonable only to blame the foreigner' when explaining the guilty verdicts for the Myanmar defendants.

VGastro Bar employee Htut Ko Ko Lwin is escorted to a police vehicle after appearing in court in Yangon on Thursday. The trio could face two years in jail for breaching Myanmar's Religion Act . Htut Ko Ko Lwin's mother screamed at a group of monks taking photos with smartphones outside the court after the sentencing. The wife of bar owner Tun Thurein said she would consult her lawyer about appealing. 'They just decided everybody is guilty so I'm very shocked. This is very unfair,' Myat Nandar said. Blackwood made no comment as he was bundled into the back of a police truck through a scrum of media cameras. Myanmar has been rocked by several deadly outbreaks of religious violence in recent years, mainly targeting the Muslim minority. The bloodshed has coincided with the rising influence of hardline monks, who have advocated controversial new laws. Rights groups say these would severely curb the freedom of religious minorities and women. V Gastro bar, which opened just two weeks before the incident, swiftly deleted the offending image and posted this apology on its Facebook page . Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday's sentences showed 'freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever' in Myanmar, which is gearing up for crucial elections later this year. 'The authorities should accept the heartfelt public apology of the three men, vacate the conviction, and order them to be released immediately and unconditionally,' he said in a statement. Blackwood's parents told Fairfax Media from their New Zealand home that they were shocked by the decision and their son would consider an appeal. 'We hoped common sense would prevail and he would be found not guilty because it was not a malicious or intentional act...' said father Brian Blackwood. The arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country .","Philip Blackwood was jailed for two and a half years with hard labour .

"Millions of cars, motorbikes and lorries are being left on the scrap heap in China every year in a bid by the government to cut pollution levels. In one scrap yard in the city of Hangzhou, an incredible 100,000 vehicles have piled up after being taken off the road because they did not meet the national emissions standard. A similar picture can be seen right across the country. These amazing photographs on People's Daily Online show the sheer scale of China’s car graveyards. From above, the eclectic collection of cars and trucks could almost be mistaken for the pieces of someone’s giant toy set. Five and a half million cars will be scrapped this year because they are high emission vehicles, contributing £10.8bn to the recycling industry. By 2020, it is estimated that 16 million vehicles will be ready for the scrap heap. China’s booming car industry means some 154 million cars are now on the country’s congested roads. A massive 17 million were sold in 2014 alone, making up a quarter of global sales. In an attempt to slow down car sales, Chinese authorities have cut the number of new vehicles that can be registered on the roads. Last year the number of new registration plates available in Beijing fell from 240,000 to just 150,000. It has been said that by 2017, only 90,000 plates will be issued for ordinary cars and the rest to eco-friendly cars. Sea of metal: An aerial view of a junkyard in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province.

"A bitter blast from Scandinavia will put Spring on hold for almost a week as cold temperatures and snow return to parts of Britain and the temperature dips to just -3C. The cold snap has returned with a vengeance despite Britain recently enjoying blue skies and sunshine  with temperatures peaking at 17.5C in some parts of the country. But the weather has taken a cooler turn as an easterly breeze from northern Europe sweeps across the UK - and it is expected to last until the middle of next week.

"Tesco worker Christine St Michaels stole £250 from the tills but avoided jail and community service after complaining of headaches and nosebleeds . A Tesco worker who stole £250 from the tills has avoided jail or community service after complaining that she suffers from headaches and nosebleeds. Christine St Michaels, 33, was spotted on CCTV slipping money into her pockets as she filled up cash registers at the Leytonstone branch in north east London. She initially refused to empty her pockets when confronted by customer manager Robert Sharman, but St Michaels eventually revealed the £250 in cash. Tesco staff are barred from having any personal cash on them while they are working. St Michaels, who had worked at the Tesco branch for 12 years, was found guilty of theft and ordered to pay a £250 restitution order and £500 in prosecution costs. But she was not ordered to carry out community service after Snaresbrook Crown Court heard  she suffers regular headaches and nosebleeds. She received a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, in addition to a three-month curfew. Criticising a pre-sentence report suggesting St Michaels should be exempt from community service, Judge Simon Freeland QC said: 'This trial included normal working hours, this defendant gave evidence to the jury and was cross examined. 'She didn't require any form of facility to deal with these headaches and nosebleeds and there were no outward manifestations of discomfort whatsoever.' During her trial St Michaels claimed the CCTV footage of her slipping the notes into her pocket was actually her 'double checking' to make sure no notes had accidentally fallen out of the cash tray into the bottom of the drawer. She claimed: 'It was money I had had in my pocket because I was going to take it to the bank - I had accumulated it over time at home. 'It was money that had been lying around. I thought 'Let me just put it in my account'.' Snaresbrook Crown Court heard how the cashier told Mr Sharman: 'I know this looks bad, but it's my own money, I was going to put it in the bank and I forgot it was in my pocket.' Judge Freeland said: 'This was a significant breach of trust. 'On the 6 February of this year following a fully and strenuously contested trial you were convicted of one count of theft from Tesco - something which was a serious and flagrant breach of trust. 'You had been employed as a cashier at a Leytonstone branch of Tesco for some 12 years, up to the 24 April 2013. 'You were summarily dismissed following the observations of the store manager which led to your trial and conviction. 'Your duties included doing the change run before the store opened. She was spotted on CCTV slipping money into her pockets as she filled up cash registers at the Leytonstone branch in north east London (not pictured) 'Your duties were to the extent that you were trusted not only to be honest but to act with complete integrity. 'You were observed by Robert Sharman, the store manager, who had access to viewing the CCTV, and he saw you helping yourself to monies, misappropriating them and putting them into your pocket. 'This was to the extent that you were caught red handed with your hands literally in the till. 'This involved a flagrant breach of trust and I have no doubt that you thought about what you were going to go, and you planned what you were going to do. 'It was consistent in as much as it involved four tills and not merely one till.' Judge Freeland added that a pre-sentence report indicated St Michaels displayed 'not one shred' of remorse. At an earlier hearing, the cashier's barrister Stephen Talbot-Hadley said: 'This defendant is now 33-years-old, as a result of her arrest she was immediately dismissed from Tesco - that's not a mitigating factor but she's since been on employment support allowance of £72.40 per week. 'She's not someone who has any drug or alcohol problems - she lives with her mother, her sister and her two nephews. 'Her father died in 1982 and her mother has been responsible for the family since then.' Mr Talbot-Hadley said St Michaels' only income came in the form of the fortnightly benefit, before adding there was 'no evidence of a lavish lifestyle.' 'She has asked me to express her genuine remorse to the court having reflected on the matter,' he continued. 'As a consequence of her behaviour she has lost her employment, but more moreover the nature of this particular offence will mean it will have a significant impact on her future job prospects. 'It is also right to say that hitherto she was a person of good character.' As part of her electronic curfew St Michaels must remain at home between the hours of 7pm and 7am for the next three months. She was ordered to pay a £250 restitution order and £500 in prosecution costs. St Michaels from Wanstead denied but was convicted of one charge of theft.","Christine St Michaels, 33, was spotted on CCTV stealing £250 from tills .

"The Married at First Sight star who almost left her groom at the altar because she wasn't physically attracted to him once again rebuffs his attempts to get intimate when he leans in to kiss her on their wedding night. On tonight's episode of the FYI reality show, Ryan Ranellone, 29, from Long Island, New York, admits that he is worried that Jaclyn Methuen, from Union, New Jersey, is trying to put him in the 'friend zone' just hours after they said 'I do'. And just minutes later his fears become reality when the 30-year-old sales rep refuses to get intimate with her new husband once they settle into their honeymoon suite, admitting that he still feels like a stranger to her. 'I haven't had sex in two years so there is now way we are having sex tonight, so I hope that we can just be buddies,' she says in a sneak peak from the upcoming episode. Scroll down for video . Romantic gesture: Ryan Ranellone happily carries his new wife Jaclyn Methuen  on tonight's episode of Marriedat First Sight . Back off: Jaclyn says she needs time to get to know Ryan, but he is worried that she is putting him in the 'friend zone' only hours after they said 'I do' The clip shows Ryan romantically carrying Jaclyn across the threshold into their hotel room, just moments before he playfully tosses her on a rose-covered bed – but despite his attempts to try and win Jaclyn over with romantic gestures, she confesses she is still hung up on his looks. Jaclyn, who has been single for the past seven years, notes that she needs time to adjust to her life-changing decision to marry a total stranger. 'Right off the bat, I am not physically attracted to him,' she explains. 'I don't even know how to be somebody's girlfriend never mind somebody's wife, so I just want to have some time to get to know him.' But Ryan has no problem expressing how thrilled he is to have Jaclyn as his new wife. 'We really don't know each other, but the experts definitely did a good job. I am very attracted to my wife, so I am looking forward to enjoying the rest of the evening with her and getting to know each other,' he says. Grand gesture: Ryan romantically walks Jaclyn across the threshold on their wedding night . The newlyweds indulge in some champagne and they joke around as they toss rose petals in the air, but Ryan remains determined to try and get romantic with his wife, who hugged him instead of kissed him at the altar. 'It feels like two good friends goofing around. I can't say it is exactly what I expected on our wedding night,' he tells the camera. 'I don't want her putting me into that friend zone.' Ryan can be seen leaning in for a kiss, but it's unclear as to whether or not Jaclyn accepts. 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. I need to take step back and I need a little space. I need time,' she tells the cameras at the end of the clip. On last Tuesday's episode of the reality series, Jaclyn was forced to smile throughout a cringe-worthy post-wedding photoshoot with her new husband as they held hands and cuddled close for their first pictures as newlyweds. Look of panic: Jaclyn is caught off guard when Ryan leans in for a kiss . Drop off: Ryan playfully tosses Jaclyn on a bed of roses in their honeymoon suite . 'When I look back at those pictures I am going to see a girl [who] was very overwhelmed - disappointed. I wanted to get a guy that's tall, dark and handsome,' she revealed to the cameras. At their reception, Jaclyn's female friends reminded her that real-life is not a romantic comedy and that she shouldn't expect love at first sight. During the season two premiere of Married at First Sight, it was unclear as to whether or Jaclyn was going to say 'I do' to Ryan, but the reality TV star later confirmed to Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on the Today show that she did indeed marry the groom whose physical appearance was giving her second thoughts. 'I put so much pressure on my intuition,' she said of her disappointment in Ryan. 'I thought I was going to know that this guy is my soulmate and we were going to have that connection and those sparks.' And while, it looks like she making more of an effort to get to know Ryan on tonight's episode of the show, he might be moving too fast for her taste.

"A bloody hotel siege ended with at least 17 people dead after Somali troops stormed the building. It was the culmination of a 12-hour standoff which saw four Al Shabaab Islamic militants take hostages in a Mogadishu hotel after a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden car at the gate. Security forces, led by a unit from the elite US-trained special forces troops known as 'Gaashaan,' were able to enter and take control of the building, following a 12-hour stand off.

Al Shabaab was pushed out of the capital by African peacekeeping forces, but have waged a series of gun and grenade attacks, looking to overthrow the government and impose its strict version of sharia law on the country. An offensive launched last year by African Union forces along with the Somali army has driven the group out of its strongholds in central and southern Somalia, while a series of U.S. drone strikes have killed some of its top leaders.

"In the vast, white expanse of Antarctica, one glacier bleeds a shocking red. Known as Blood Falls, the dramatic colour comes from the two million-year-old iron-heavy brine trapped under the ice. Now, for the first time, scientists have taken uncontaminated samples from deep beneath the glacier in the hope of finding microbial life. In the vast, white expanse of Antarctica, one glacier bleeds a shocking red. Known as Blood Falls, the dramatic colour comes from the two million-year-old iron-heavy seawater trapped under the ice . They believe that 'extremophiles' possibly living under the surface could be unique in their ability to survive – and they may even help in the search for alien life on other planets. Scientists recently sent a probe into the ice of Taylor Glacier to extract salty samples of water from the main vein that feeds the red-stained feature. 'This is going to be an exciting sample to play with,' Jill Mikucki, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Tennessee told The Antarctic Sun. She explained that Blood Falls' deep red hue is caused by the discharge of iron-rich, brine liquid. Its chemistry is changed by bacteria, which transforms sulphur and iron compounds in order to survive. Pictured is the drill camp on top of Taylor Glacier. Blood Falls' deep red hue is caused by the discharge of iron-rich, brine liquid.Its chemistry is changed by bacteria, which transforms sulphur and iron in order to survive . The Midge (Minimally Invasive Direct Glacial Exploration) project, led by Professor Mikucki has developed a unique probe, dubbed EnEx-IceMole. Pictured is the IceMole poised for action . When the liquid oxidises at the surface, it creates a blood-red colour. But to learn more about the bacteria, scientists needed samples that were oxidised. The Midge (Minimally Invasive Direct Glacial Exploration) project, led by Professor Mikucki developed a unique probe, dubbed EnEx-IceMole. It looks like a rectangular metal box with a copper head and ice screw that can melt through ice, . 'It can drive curved trajectories through bulk ice. It can go sideways, up and down. If you want to reach any point, you can go there,' Dirk Heinen, a German physicist told The Antarctic Sun. To help the probe navigate, scientists sent acoustic pulses from the surface into the ice. This is similar to a GPS but uses different kinds of waves that use sound to track the position of the IceMole. Cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis that contain a bright red pigment can cause snow to appear red . Snow appears white because it reflects most visible light that strikes it. Anything that does this means you see the whole spectrum of visible light, which looks white. Other objects appear different colours because they absorb certain wavelengths of visible light but reflect others - a green apple, for instance, reflects only mostly the green wavelength. But, as reported by JSTOR, when snow is deep enough it can actually appear blue. The reason for this is due to ice crystals in the snow, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) ‘As light waves travel into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of light,’ the NSIDC explains. While most of the light is reflected, there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue. When you see just the surface of a pack of snow, the scattering of the blue light is almost completely impossible to notice. But if you look into a significant amount of snow, about 3.3ft (one metre) or so, more photons emerge towards the blue end of the spectrum than the red end. When snow appears red, though, it is for an entirely different reason. This effect is due to cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis that contain a bright red pigment. Also known as ‘watermelon snow’, it is ‘most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions’. The team focused on locating the channel through which the brine moves from the reservoir to the surface at Blood Falls. They also used seismometers to image the ice and bedrock below, and GPS units to track glacial movement. The team are now in the process of analysing the samples. 'It offers us a portal, or window, to the subglacial world … a sample of material from that ice-covered interior,' said Professor Mikucki. Scientists say the results could reveal how life could exist on moons like Saturn's Enceladus and Jupiter's Europa. Both moons are believed to have liquid oceans beneath icy crusts. The scientists sent a probe into the ice of Taylor Glacier to extract salty samples of water from the main vein that feeds the red-stained feature. The crevassed, rough, slick surface of Taylor Glacier makes it a challenging location for research .

"Giving it all away: Oprah plans to auction off 500 belongings from her Chicago apartment next month . Just two weeks after announcing she was closing her studios in Chicago, Oprah Winfrey is now planning to auction off all of the art in her luxe apartment in the city. On Monday, Leslie Hindman Auctioneers announced the sale of some 500 belongings in Oprah's Water Tower Place Condo. The items will be previewed starting April 16, with bidding starting on April 25. In true Oprah fashion, the proceeds from the auction will go towards a good cause: her Leadership Academy Foundation which runs a school for girls in South Africa.

"Police raided the dressing rooms at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland's training ground as part of their probe into Adam Johnson. The 27-year-old England international was arrested on March 2 at his £1.85million mansion on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl and was bailed until Wednesday. And Sportsmail can reveal that as part of the probe, officers also turned up at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light and the 60-acre Academy of Light and scoured both dressing rooms as part of their hunt for evidence. Adam Johnson, pictured with girlfriend Stacey Flounders, was bailed until March 18 after being arrested . The 27-year-old Sunderland winger was arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl . The gates at Johnson's £1.85million were shut following his arrest earlier this month . Former Manchester City man Johnson has been suspended by Sunderland since his arrest . Police officers raided dressing rooms at Sunderland's Stadium of Light as they investigate Johnson . It is also understood that all Sunderland staff were called into meetings following Johnson's arrest and warned away from posting anything about it on social media and from speaking to the press. Johnson, who earns £50,000 a week, has been suspended by the struggling Premier League club. The Black Cats, who are currently facing a battle against relegation, are now without a manager after Gus Poyet was sacked on Monday. A source said: 'You don't expect to see police officers in a dressing room and quite a few people at the club were shocked by it. They were looking for things such as second mobile phones and notes, anything that would help them, really.' Changing rooms at the club's Academy of Light training ground were also scoured by local police . Johnson was released on bail until March 18 and will continue to help police with their inquiries . Peterlee Police Station in County Durham where  Johnson was taken after he was arrested . Johnson played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . They added: 'All staff were called into meetings and told in no uncertain terms that they were not to put anything on things like Twitter and Facebook and not to talk to the press about it under any circumstances.' Johnson, a winger, has been in a relationship with girlfriend Stacey Flounders for three years. Miss Flounders recently posted photographs of the couple’s first child, Ayla Sofia, who was born on January 8. It was unclear if she and her daughter were at home at the time of the player’s arrest. He has scored 20 times in 105 games for the club, including the winner at Newcastle in this season’s Tyne-Wear derby. Johnson, pictured playing against Switzerland in 2011, has 14 England caps to his name . Sunderland's players look lost during their 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa on Saturday . Born in Sunderland, Johnson signed for the club for £10m from Manchester City in 2012. Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at Johnson's house, close to the quiet hamlet of Castle Eden, as he was questioned at Peterlee police station. Ex-Middlesbrough man Johnson has been bailed until March 18. Sunderland were thumped 4-0 at home by fellow strugglers Aston Villa on Saturday with thousands of angry supporters leaving the match before half-time with their team already four goals down.

"British drivers would have the cheapest petrol in western Europe if tax was not added by the Treasury, official figures reveal. Pre-tax petrol prices in the UK are lower than anywhere in the EU except Estonia, but when fuel duty and VAT are added the cost at the pump is among the highest. With just weeks until the Budget, the revelation will pile pressure for fuel duty cuts on Chancellor George Osborne who has called on fuel companies to reduce charges in the wake of falling global oil prices. Official data released by the government shows that the pre-tax costs of petrol in the UK has fallen to just 32.4p per litre, the second lowest in all of the EU . Tax adds another 76p per litre, making it the fifth highest behind the Netherlands, Italy, Malta and Greece . Total petrol prices have begun rising in recent weeks, after falling dramatically from £1.30 to £1.06 in the year to February. Ministers including Mr Osborne and his Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander have repeatedly said the price on forecourts must fall to reflect the cheaper wholesale costs for fuel firms. But official data released by the government shows that the pre-tax costs of petrol has fallen to just 32.4p per litre, the second lowest in all of the EU. But tax adds another 76p per litre, making it the fifth highest behind the Netherlands, Italy, Malta and Greece. It means tax makes up 70 per cent of the total price of a litre of fuel, the joint highest with the Netherlands. By contrast, tax accounts for only 51 per cent in Bulgaria and 57 per cent in Hungary, Luxembourg and Lithuania. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'These numbers tell a revealing story. For all the Chancellor's calls on oil companies to cut the cost of petrol and diesel the person who has the biggest influence over pump prices is Mr Osborne himself. 'Despite recent freezes in fuel duty, more than two-thirds of what we pay on the forecourts goes to the Treasury. 'We agree with the Chancellor that the cost of fuel is a big burden for the nation's 37 million motorists but if he really wants to ease that burden then he could do so overnight by reducing fuel tax.' The revelation will pile pressure on Chancellor George Osborne who has called on fuel companies to reduce charges in the wake of falling global oil prices . Howard Cox, founder of the FairFuelUK Campaign, said: 'For decades the highest fuel duty in Europe has held back the beneficial affects of having the lowest pre tax pump prices. 'Since 2011, FairFuelUK has prevented £30bn of tax hikes that Labour had planned if they had been in Government. 'Our haversack of empirical evidence endorsed by The Treasury shows that cutting duty will increase GDP, generate new jobs and lower inflation. 'It's no coincidence that five years of frozen duty and recent historic falls in oil prices have given rise to UK's blossoming economy. 'It's time that all parties recognise that lower pump prices are good for the hard pressed 32m motorists and businesses by generating other positive growth taxes through lower fuel duty levies. It's about motivating consumers not stifling the with crippling but essential costs. 'FairFuelUK continues to call for a 3p duty cut in the Budget so the UK drops down Europe's League table of this punitive tax.' The Treasury insisted that since 2011, the Government has scrapped the fuel duty escalator that would have increased fuel duty by 1 penny per litre above inflation every year. Ministers claim that pump prices will be 18p per litre lower by the end of the parliament, compared to the Labour government's fuel duty plans. A Treasury spokesman said: 'We have frozen fuel duty for the remainder of this parliament, resulting in the longest duty freeze in over 20 years. 'Due to the Government's action on fuel duty since 2011, by the end of the parliament pump prices will be nearly 18 pence per litre lower than they would have been under previous fuel duty plans. 'This represents a saving of £10 for the typical motorist each time they fill up their tank.'","EXCLUSIVE: Pre-tax  petrol is 32.4p per litre in the UK, only Estonia lower .

"Food poisoning affects one in six Americans every year caused by rotting meat and vegetables, dirty water and unhygienic kitchens. But a new technique using just electricity and water could one day make food safer, without damaging the environment. Researchers claim that tiny nano-sized droplets of electrically charged water filled with free radicals could be sprayed onto food to kill pathogens lurking on the surface. Researchers claim that tiny nano-sized droplets of electrically charged water filled with free radicals, could be sprayed onto fruit and vegetables, to kill pathogens lurking on the surface (illustrated) Scientists at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts believe that with more research, droplets called Engineered Water Nanostructures (EWNS) could replace current methods used to disinfect food, such as applying mild solutions of bleaches and chlorine. ‘Fruit and vegetables can become contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms anywhere in their production chain, starting from the field or orchard, during harvest, transport, processing, distribution, and marketing, or during preparation in food-service establishments and in the home(from farm to fork route),’ the scientists write in their study, published in the journal of Environmental Science and Technology. ‘Possible pathogen sources include contaminated irrigation water, animals, birds, insects, soil, manure, and infected workers/food handlers.’ Depending on how long fruit and vegetables were exposed to the spray of nanoparticles, lab tests showed that between 80 and 98 per cent of bacteria were destroyed. An SEM image of E. coli is shown . Think of food poisoning and you may immediately consider raw meat to be the culprit. But raw or minimally processed fruit and vegetables can be a source of pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites the study said. Every year in the US, approximately 48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalised, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases. Between 1990 and 2005, contaminated fresh produce accounted for 13 per cent of all reported food borne outbreaks and for 21 per cent of reported illnesses. In Europe, fresh produce of non-animal origin accounted for 10 per cent of the outbreaks, 26 per cent of the cases, 35 per cent of the hospitalisations, and 46 per cent of deaths between years 2007−2011, according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). To create the charged droplets, which measure just 25 nanometres, the team led by Philip Demokritou, sprayed water though a strong electrical field - a technique known as electrospraying. The water molecules split into hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, which are usually unstable, Environmental Technology reported. But in the electrospray, a thin layer of charged water captures the radicals and stabilises them. The electrical charge serves to boost each droplet’s surface tension so that it stops the radicals evaporating. ‘EWNS possess unique properties; they are 25 nm in diameter, remain airborne in indoor conditions for hours, contain Reactive Oxygen Species and have very strong surface charge,’ the study said. To test the efficiency of process, three strains of bacteria known to cause illness - E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria - were applied to tomatoes and stainless steel surfaces. Tomatoes were then sprayed with nanoparticles in an enclosed chamber for between 30 and 45 minutes, while the steel samples were exposed for 15 to 45 minutes. Scientists believe that with more research, droplets called Engineered Water Nanostructures (EWNS) could replace current methods used to disinfect food, such as applying mild solutions of bleaches and chlorine. They tested their technique on tomatoes (stock picture shown) Depending on how long fruit and vegetables were exposed to the spray of nanoparticles, lab tests showed that between 80 and 98 per cent of bacteria were destroyed. The study added: ‘The results presented here indicate that this novel, chemical-free, and environmentally friendly intervention method holds potential for development and application in the food industry, as a “green” alternative to existing disinfection methods.’ The scientists claim that the charged water does not change the taste or texture of food. However, it could be years before it can be used to treat produce sold in supermarkets because current rules stipulate that treatments must kill 99.999 per cent of bacteria.","Experts made droplets using electrically charged water and free radicals .

"The State Department said Tuesday it had no record of Hillary Rodham Clinton signing a statement attesting that she had turned over all unclassified documents related to official business when she left her post as secretary of state in 2013. Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday that Bush-era secretaries Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice had also never signed such a 'separation statement.' 'We have reviewed Secretary Clinton's official personnel file and administrative files, and do not have any record of her signing the OF-109,' Psaki said, referring to the form's bureaucratic name. 'In addition, after looking into their official personnel files, we did not locate any record of either of her immediate predecessors signing this form.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CASE CLOSED? State Department spkoeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday that former secretary Hillary Clinton never signed a 'saparation statement' certifying that she no longer had work-related documents . OUT OF TROUBLE? Clinton and her presidential ambitions have taken fire over tens of thousands of emails she kept on a private server at her home instead of using a standard government email address . Psaki said there was no sign of such a statement in department files. 'We're fairly certain she didn't sign one,' she told reporters. Asked if the State Department considered the case closed, Psaki snapped: 'I hope so, There's quite a bit going on in the world. We can also discuss that.' On the Fox News Channel on Monday, legal commentator and former judge Andrew Napolitano opined that Clinton was between a rock and a hard place. If Clinton had signed the form while holding on to tens of thousands of emails, he said, she was 'committing perjury.' And if not, Napolitano added, she was likely guilty of stealing public records. Either could be a felony. But Psaki emphasized that different bureaus within the department had different rules relating to such statements that had the effect of making it optional for some employs to fill them out and turn them in. She could not identify the bureaus in which employees had such a choice. Questions about whether Clinton signed such a document have swirled since the revelation of her use of a personal email account for government-related work. Republicans, among others, have said that the State Department, along with other federal agencies, generally requires outgoing employees to turn over job-related materials before leaving. That policy requires employees to sign the separation statements declaring they had 'surrendered to responsible officials all unclassified documents' related to official business during their employment. Providing incorrect information on the form can be grounds for prosecution. The Republican National Committee earlier Tuesday had submitted two Freedom of Information requests to the State Department seeking copies of the 'separation statements' signed by Clinton and her top aides and related records. The office of House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement on Tuesday that it would be 'a big problem if she signed that form like she was supposed to.' Others have said it would be equally troubling if Clinton did not sign the form because that would have meant she would was holding herself to a different standard than other employees. Psaki will be in her just just a few more weeks. Her next posting will be at the Whtie House, where she will take over as communications director.","The 'OF-109' form certifies that an outgoing public servant no longer has possession of work-related nonclassified documents .

"The  leader of the Muslim group who defended ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi  has sparked further outrage after he refused to condemn the stoning women. Asim Qureshi, the director of Cage, was last night quizzed about extremist positions advocated by Muslim scholars - including female genital mutilation, domestic violence and stoning as a punishment for adultery. But Mr Qureshi, appearing on the BBC's This Week programme, failed to speak out against the practices - while also defending the right of Muslims to wage jihad. It comes after he defended the London-raised fanatic Emwazi - unmasked as the infamous fanatic 'Jihadi John' - as a 'beautiful, kind man'. Scroll down for video . Asim Qureshi, the hard-line leader of the Muslim rights group Cage, which defended ISIS executioner Jihadi John last week, has sparked further outrage after repeatedly refusing to condemn the stoning women . Pressed by Andrew Neil, the show's presenter, to condemn a series of extreme positions, including claims that Jews are descended from pigs and homosexuality is evil, Mr Qureshi responded 'I'm not a theologian' 2006: 'When we see Hezbollah defeating the armies of Israel, we know where the solution is and where the victory lies. 'We know that it is incumbent upon all of us, to support the Jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the West. February 26, 2015: Mohammed Emwazi was an “extremely gentle, kind, beautiful young man'. He was “extremely kind, extremely gentle and the most humble young person I ever knew”. March 3, 2015: 'What we want is to understand whether or not the security agencies, their actions, led to him feeling like he does not belong to UK society. That is it. We never said there is a direct causality.” March 5, 2015: ""Jihad is part of the religion of Islam."" Pressed by Andrew Neil, the show's presenter, to condemn a series of extreme positions, including claims that Jews are descended from pigs and homosexuality is evil. He responded 'I'm not a theologian' before adding: 'I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.' Mr Neil accused Mr Qureshi of advocating Jihad and Sharia law. Mr Qureshi responded: 'As far as I am concerned, Sharia law isn't practised correctly anywhere in the world. Jihad is part of the religion of Islam.' He repeated his criticism of MI5 and the security services, claiming they helped to radicalise young Muslim men by mistreating them. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson said his remarks showed 'what we are up against in terms of the 'moderate front'. The exchange came after London Mayor Boris Johnson accused Mr Qureshi of being an apologist for terror. Mr Qureshi last week described London-raised fanatic Emwazi – accused of being the infamous 'Johadi John' in the ISIS beheading videos - as an 'extremely kind' and 'extremely gentle' man who had been radicalised as a result of harassment by security agencies. The Cage research director said he believed the approach taken by the agents was 'a factor in the reason why he felt like he didn't belong in the UK any more'. Mr Johnson responded: 'I really, really think that the focus of your indignation and outrage should be on people who go out to join groups that throw gays off cliffs, that behead people who don't subscribe to their version of Islam, that glorify in the execution of innocent journalists and aid workers. Mr Qureshi – who last week described the British fanatic Mohammed Emwazi unmasked as Jihadi John, as a 'beautiful young man' - . 'These should be the object of your wrath, not the security services who are trying to keep us safe.' Mr Qureshi, 33, has revealed the he became 'anti-white' at the £18,000-a-year Whitgift School in Croydon, south London, which he attended as a child. The controversial campaign chief was born in Britain to Pakistani parents and – thanks to his mother's ice-cream business – was sent to 400-year-old Whitgift. Jihadi John's sister is 'living in fear' after receiving death threats, a close friend said today. Student Shayma Emwazi, 23, has been tracked and abused on Facebook, forcing her to close her account. She and the rest of Emwazi's family are now living under police protection in a secret location after Mohammed Emwazi was unmasked as Jihadi John. A friend of Shayma told the Evening Standard: 'They are struggling to live a normal life. 'Shayma came back from holiday not too long ago to all of this drama which occurred overnight. She does not deserve to be blamed for her brother's evil actions. 'The only thing she and Mohammed have in common is that they are blood, but she is not a terrorist.'","Cage director Asim Qureshi was quizzed about extremist positions .

"Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond today condemned terror apologists who 'seek to excuse' ISIS extremists including Jihadi John. He used speech in London to hit out at the likes of campaign group Cage, which claimed that it was MI5's attempts to recruit Mohammed Emwazi that led to him becoming radicalised and emerge as Jihadi John. Mr Hammond condemned critics who try to 'excuse' the terrorists by pointing the finger of blame at the security services. Philip Hammond condemned critics who try to 'excuse'  terrorists including Jihadi John by pointing the finger of blame at the security services . British citizens who travel to Iraq and Syria to fight against ISIS could face prosecution if they return. Philip Hammond said that parents and schools have a responsibility to help prevent young people from travelling abroad to take part in the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Asked what the authorities' response would be to Britons who take up arms against IS, the Foreign Secretary said: 'The simple, legal answer is that anyone conducting irregular fighting activity overseas is subject to British legislative sanction. 'That is unlawful activity and can be dealt with on their return to the UK.' The parents of three London schoolgirls believed to have entered Syria with the aim of joining IS - Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase - are later due to appear before the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, alongside the ambassador of Turkey. Cage sparked outrage last month with its attempts to justify Emwazi's brutal killings of ISIS hostages. In an extraordinary press conference, the group's research director Asim Qureshi said Kuwait-born Briton Emwazi was a 'beautiful young man', 'extremely gentle' and 'the most humble young person that I ever knew'. The 32-year-old blamed British security services for Emwazi's radicalisation, saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an 'outsider'. Today Mr Hammond vehemently rejected the idea that the actions of Emwazi and other ISIS murderers can ever be justified. He said: 'The exposure of the alleged identity of one of the most murderous ISIL terrorists over the last few weeks has seen some seeking to excuse the terrorists and point the finger of blame at the agencies themselves. 'We are absolutely clear: the responsibility for acts of terror rests with those who commit them. But a huge burden of responsibility also lies with those who act as apologists for them.' In a rare speech on the intelligence agencies, Mr Hammond will mount a strong defence of their work saying that it was only their 'brilliance' that had kept Britain safe in the face of the continuing terrorist threat. The agencies have also faced criticism over the fact that Emwazi was allowed to travel to Syria - where is believed to have carried out the brutal beheadings of a series of western hostages - even though he had be known to MI5 since 2008. Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute in London, Mr Hammond - who is responsible for MI6 and GCHQ - said that agencies are currently facing an 'unprecedented' level of challenge in the face of a wide range threats from around the world. 'The sheer number and range of cases, old and new, amounts to the greatest challenge to our collective security for decades and places unprecedented demands on those charged with keeping us safe,' he said. 'Warped' Cage's research director Asim Qureshi (left) at a press conference about Jihadi John last week . Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed as 'nonsense' the suggestion that jihadis like Emwazi had been radicalised by their contact with security services. Mr Cameron told LBC radio: 'The fact is we face a terrorist threat in Britain. That is the opinion of the experts who advise me and set the threat level. 'Our police and security services have a very important role to play to find out about people that could do us harm and to step in and prevent them from doing that. 'Of course we need to work with communities to do that - and we do. 'But I totally reject the idea that police or security service tactics have somehow radicalised people. That is, I think, nonsense.' Campaign group Cage sparked outrage last month with its attempts to justify Emwazi's brutal killings of ISIS hostages. In an extraordinary press conference, the group's research director Asim Qureshi said Kuwait-born Briton Emwazi was a 'beautiful young man', 'extremely gentle' and 'the most humble young person that I ever knew'. The 32-year-old blamed British security services for Emwazi's radicalisation, saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an 'outsider'. He said that while in the past they had simply had to focus on 'ideologically-driven expansionist states' they now had to deal with international terrorist groups and state-sponsored aggression as well as self-radicalised, 'lone wolf' terrorists. 'The emergence of groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria and (IS) in Syria, Iraq and Libya, simply serves to underline the pace with which the threats to our safety and security from this source are evolving,' he said. 'It is only thanks to the dedication, and in many cases the brilliance, of our intelligence officers that we have succeeded to detect and contain these threats.' At the same time he pointed to the renewed threat to international order posed by Russia after years of re-engagement with the West following the end of the Cold War. 'We are now faced with a Russian leader bent not on joining the international rules-based system which keeps the peace between nations, but on subverting it,' he said. 'President (Vladimir) Putin's actions - illegally annexing Crimea and now using Russian troops to destabilise eastern Ukraine - fundamentally undermine the security of sovereign nations in Eastern Europe.' He said that the 'clandestine nature' of the threats- from weapons systems developed in secret to covert plotting by terrorists - underlined the need for Britain to maintain a 'highly effective, secret capability' to identify, monitor and act against them. 'As the range of threats gets bigger, so the pace of technological change with which the agencies must keep up is getting faster, making their central task of keeping us safe ever more demanding,' he said. 'We must respond decisively and positively to the public and parliamentary debate about the powers required by our intelligence agencies to do their job in a changed technological environment - and in doing so draw a line under that debate so that the agencies can get on with the job of keeping this country safe.'","Foreign Secretary condemns critics who try to 'excuse' the terrorists .

"A Southwest airlines passenger boarded a plane only to receive an email telling him that his trip had been cancelled. Bob Woudstra paid $616 (around £410)  for  a round trip from Grand Rapids to Fort Myers, in Florida. On the day of his flight, the Michigan businessman was dropped off at the airport, made it through security and successfully boarded the plane. A Michigan man was told his flight was cancelled two hours after take off as the airline had no record of him . But two hours into his flight, Mr Woudstra received an e-mail from the U.S carrier, notifying him of its no show policy. The airline told him that he  wasn't on the plane, so they cancelled his flight Mr Woudstra said, explaining that he had to buy a new return ticket for $456 (around £304). He told MailOnline Travel: ' I think Southwest needs to prove to me I wasn't on the plane, cause I have plenty of witnesses that dropped me off in Grand Rapids and picked me up at Ft. Myers.' After returning home, he called the airline to demand a refund, but was told he'd need to prove that he was onboard that flight. Southwest airlines say there could have been an error at the gate, which caused the misunderstanding . 'I can't believe that with security supposing to be so tight that I could fly on a plane and Southwest doesn't even know I was on their plane. 'Southwest doesn't acknowledge that I was on the plane, they are just giving me, per Southwest ""the benefit of the doubt"". 'So that tells me they think I am lying, and Gary the guy I was traveling with must not have been there either, even though his ticket shows up.

He had recently been released from prison after four when his family posted a bail bond but he was rearrested on Wednesday after the Brooklyn district attorney upgraded the charges against him, according to the New York Times. Yesterday he appeared in Brooklyn Criminal Court on a charge of second-degree murder. He hung his head during his 15 minute appearance. Assistant district attorney Frank DeGaetano said in court: 'He shook her several times. Thaiya Spruill-Smith, two, was taken off life support after suffering a brain hemorrhage. Stepfather David Adams, 25, has now been charged with her murder . 'He made her hit her head. She had multiple abrasions and contusions, 17 on her head, and she had damage to the axons and neurons in her brain consistent with massive brain damage.' Thaiya had been declared brain-dead in November after Adams said he shook her and she was admitted to a hospital with bleeding in the brain, retinal hemorrhaging and bruises. The incident leading to Thaiya's death occurred on November 12 when her mum Teoka Spruill left her Brooklyn apartment for about an hour, leaving Thaiya with Adams. According to a criminal complaint, Adams told police he held Thaiya off the ground, causing her head 'to rotate forward and back rapidly several times,' and the girl's body then went limp. He again shook her, so hard her head swiveled again several times, and then her body went rigid. Thaiya was asleep when Ms Spruill returned, she said, and the child woke once during the night to ask for juice. Ms Spruill called an ambulance next morning when she heard Thaiya struggling for breath. The youngster was rushed to Brookdale Hospital shortly before 7am and despite numerous operations, doctors concluded her injuries were too severe to overcome and she was eventually taken off life support. It has since emerged that Thaiya may have been the victim of months of abuse at the hands of Adams that was investigated by New York City social services. Ms Spruill and Thaiya's father Terrell Smith disagreed over whether to donate her organs after the toddler was declared brain dead two days after the incident. A judge ordered Brookdale  to keep the child on life support for at least another day to keep her organs alive until the girl's parents resolved their dispute. 'She was born with that, she's going to be buried with that, her body, her eyes - it's what makes her her,' Smith told the New York Times from Thaiya's hospital bed in Brookdale Hospital, New York. Thaiya's father Terrell Smith says she was being systematically abused by her mother's new husband . 'My daughter was born with that, and she's going to lie down with the same thing.' Speaking separately, Spruill told the paper: 'I just think it would be a blessing for someone else's family.' As organ and tissue donation can only occur when there is agreement among family members, it was eventually ruled Thaiya's organs would not be donated. The parental dispute is reportedly the latest in a series spanning Thaiya's lifetime, as Smith claims he made repeated attempts to save her from Adams, who he claims was abusive. Relatives made emotional tributes to the 'smart' and 'sweet' girl at the time of Adams' first appearance in court. 'Thai, she was like the sweetest little girl ever, like you wouldn't have problems with her ever,' Shayne Smith, Thaiya's uncle, told Time Warner Cable. 'She was very smart - very, very smart.' According to court documents, Adams admitted to shaking Thaiya when questioned. And police sources say there are records of a similar shaking incident in the household last month. At his first appearance Adams, who married Thaiya's mother in March, wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two-year-old had died. 'He was shocked. He was very, very upset,' defense attorney Joseph Sieger told the New York Post. Smith said social services took custody of the little girl for a week while they investigated Adams for abuse. She was returned and the case was dropped, he said. The ACS has refused to confirm or deny Smith's claims due to confidentiality restrictions.","Thaiya Spruill-Smith died after 'being violently shaken by stepfather'

"Chelsea Clinton and Jimmy Kimmel teamed up Monday to help announce a new program called Serve a Year that asks college and high school grads to spend a year contributing to their communities rather than immediately moving into college or the work force. The pair spoke at the launch of non-profit ServiceNation's 'Serve A Year' campaign on Monday in Los Angeles. The initiative seeks to make a year of service with organizations like Americorps, Habitat for Humanity and others the norm for graduates with the help of the entertainment industry, where some major players have pledged to insert positive messages about a year of service into programming aimed at Millennials. Chelsea Clinton and late night host Jimmy Kimmel teamed up Monday in Los Angeles to push for Serve a Year -- an initiative that urges high school and college graduates to serve their communities for a year after graduating . 'We know that the millennial generation wants to serve if they are given the right information and opportunities, and so I think that gives particular urgency to our efforts today,' Clinton said . 'It's great to see so many people, especially young people, dedicating yourselves to public service because you care about people and not because a court ordered you to,' Kimmel joked at the Serve a Year launch in Los Angeles on Monday. 'The goal of this mission is essentially to put less focus on yourself and put more focus on others,' he said, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Over the next three years, ServiceNation hopes that mission will be accomplished by portraying the perks of service in television and movies, according to the Serve A Year website. Their hope is that, with the help of partners like Comcast, Airbnb and the Clinton Foundation, non-profits like Habitat for Humanity, Teach for America and Americorps will have both added resources and new recruits after word spreads about the merits of serving a year. Leveraging Hollywood: The initiative seeks to make a year of service with organizations like Americorps, Habitat for Humanity and others the norm for graduates with the help of the entertainment industry, where some major players have pledged to insert positive messages about a year of service into programming aimed at Millennials . 'We know that the millennial generation wants to serve if they are given the right information and opportunities, and so I think that gives particular urgency to our efforts today,' Clinton told the Hollywood Reporter. 'In order to reach millennials, we need to go where they already are, and the entertainment industry has the megaphone and audience to help us get the word out and change the cultural expectation of what it means to grow up in America.' Executive director of ServiceNation, Zach Maurin, told KABC the year of service comes with a paycheck and a scholarship. 'This is about giving them the skills and experiences they need, so they can support themselves while they're helping to change peoples' lives,' Maurin said.

"For many disastrous cooks, boiling an egg is the one task in the kitchen that they can actually master. However, for those seeking perfection - a runny yolk - every time, help might soon be at hand. The New Egg Company, based in Nottingham, has come up with the idea of a pre-cooked egg, which requires little more than five minutes of reheating. The downside? At £1.79 per pack, it'll cost around fives times the price of a standard egg. Eggstraordinary: The Yowk is a pre-cooked egg that promises the ideal yolk every time and even comes with soldiers, salt and a spoon . Marketed as the Yowk - 'simple dippy goodness', the pasteurised egg arrives in a plastic pot having already been cooked in its shell using the 'sous vide' method favoured by many top chefs - essentially the modern equivalent of boiling in the bag. The pot lid doubles up as an egg cup, say the makers and even comes with breadsticks, salt and a spoon to eat it with. The diner simply adds boiling water to the pot and leaves it for five minutes with a perfect, runny yolk guaranteed. This new method may seem no quicker than the traditional way to boil an egg; by immersing it in a pan of water and boiling it for around four minutes. However,  it could extract the potential for arguments over the best way to boil an egg. And the egg overflowth...a runny yolk is many people's idea of egg heaven . Foolproof? The Yowk uses the sous vide method, favoured by top chefs, to produce the perfect yolk . Kitchens can be a hotbed of tension as home cooks dispute the perfect amount of time an egg should boil for, whether eggs should be kept in a fridge or at room temperature; placed in cold water and then boiled; or just in boiling water. New Egg Company managing director Ian Hetherington told trade journal The Grocer that the product was the result of improving on an earlier prototype called 'the Dippy Egg' back in 2013. He said: 'It didn't take off the first time but the concept was still in its infancy. 'We have undertaken a lot more testing to get the product right.' The product is to be unveiled at the International Food Event trade show later this month before aiming to be listed in supermarkets and possibly food and drink outlets in May. A coffee chain has already expressed interest in selling it, along with some retailers, Hetherington told The Grocer.","The Yowk pre-cooked egg simply needs reheating for five minutes to achieve the perfect yolk, say the makers .
Packs will retail at £1.79 each and come complete with an egg cup, spoon, soldier-style breadsticks and salt .
The product looks likely to hit supermarket shelves in May ."
"A father who believed he had the right to smack his young children has had them taken into care by social workers. The parent, from Rotherham, told officials that he thought his children benefited from being smacked. He said that he hit his children on the bottom, legs and arms, using his hand, but that the red marks 'did not last long'. But a judge has now ruled that his 'entrenched' views were harmful to their children. A father who believed he had the right to smack his two young children has had them taken into care by social workers following a ruling at the High Court in London (pictured) The man has now had his third child, a six-month-old girl, taken into care by Rotherham Council officials. It comes after his middle child, now aged three, was also taken into care. It is not clear whether the man's eldest child is in care, although there have also been care proceedings issued in relation to that child. Handing down the judgement at the High Court, Judge Sarah Wright said she made the decision because there was no prospect of the father ever changing his 'domineering behaviour'. She added that the children's mother could not protect the youngsters from her partner's need to have 'total control' over his family. She said: 'It was clear to me that she cannot separate herself from the father and from his entrenched views. 'Sadly, she has put him before her children. She refused to accept any view or opinion that is not his. The parent revealed that he smacked his children on the bottom, legs and arms, using his hand (picture posed by models) 'She singularly fails to appreciate the risk that he poses to any child in his care'. During the hearing, it emerged that the man's son, now aged three, had been removed from the family home when he was just a few months old. Since then, he has been cared for by his 'quiet, considered and thoughtful' maternal uncle. The judgement also revealed that care proceedings had  taken place for another child, during which a family judge criticised the man's 'rigid and inflexible thinking'. The court said the man was not prepared to 'settle for a shade of grey', but saw everything in black and white. He also insisted on his right to smack his children, believing he had done 'nothing wrong', the judgement said. It added that both parents had been 'uncooperative and obstructive' with professionals. During the latest hearing, it emerged that, when the mother fell pregnant again, she tried to conceal her pregnancy so they would not flag up on social services' radar. Despite the mother arranging to give birth at a hospital in a different area, their attempt to conceal the birth failed. The little girl - known as E - was then taken from them under a police protection order. Explaining her reasons for concealing her pregnancy with E, the mother said she feared she would be put under pressure to have an abortion. She also insisted there was no basis for social workers' concerns, saying: 'There is no reason why we are here'. Whilst agreeing he could be 'slightly dogmatic', she said he had never been violent or aggressive, the judgement said. But the court ruled that the mother had 'aligned herself' with the father and said she was 'totally convinced' that he posed no risk to the children. It added that the father 'must feel in control' and was capable of rude, uncompromising and hostile behaviour in his determination to get his own way. 'There is also very little prospect of the father accepting the need to change', said the judge. Despite the parents' objections, Judge Wright ruled that E's welfare demanded that she also be looked after by her uncle and his partner, alongside her older brother.

"The conductor of a sickening racist chant by a University of Oklahoma fraternity has been identified as a graduate of an elite Catholic school in Dallas. Parker Rice, 19, is  an OU freshman. It is believe he did not even live in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity house, which was shut down by the university on Monday. Rice graduated last year from the prestigious Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas. A spokesman for the school's president, Mike Earsing, told Daily Mail Online: 'We know for sure it is one of our students and it is Parker Rice.' Daily Mail Online was the first to confirm Rice's identity. On Tuesday, university president David Boren said he has expelled two students who were identified as 'leaders' of the racist chant. A university spokesman declined to say whether Parker was one of those two students. Scroll down for video . Parker Rice, a University of Oklahoma freshman from Dallas, has been identified as the conductor leading the 'there will never be a n***** in SEA' chant on Saturday . Former classmates took to Twitter to defend Jesuit College Prep and the 'mistake' by Rice (he is pictured here with an unidentified person) Expelled: This is the letter that University of Oklahoma President David Boren sent to two students on Tuesday notifying them that they had been expelled . Former classmates at the $16,000-a-year Catholic school Rice attended also confirmed to Daily Mail Online that he is the tuxedo-clad conductor seen getting out of his seat during the nine-second clip posted online on Sunday. Rice is featured the most prominently in the video, as he pumps his fist and encourages others aboard the chartered bus to sing along with the lyrics: 'There will never be a n***** in SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me. There will never be a n***** in SAE.' The video, taken aboard a party bus Saturday night en route from the campus in Norman to the Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club, caused immediate outrage on Sunday when it was posed on social media. University officials responded by banning the fraternity from campus and demanding that members move out by midnight tonight. Rice (right) has two brothers, one older who has already graduated from Jesuit College Prep and the University of Oklahoma. His younger brother (center) is currently a student at Jesuit College Prep . Parker Rice pictured center at a recent gathering with his friends from Jesuit College Prep . Parker Rice's father Bob is a vice president at an industrial real estate firm in Dallas . Hundreds of students and faculty members marched on campus to protest the fraternity. On Tuesday morning Boran, the OU president who has given fiery rebukes of the fraternity and the racist song, announced that two members of the fraternity had been expelled. 'I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening, racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma,' he said. On Tuesday, Jesuit College Prep confirmed that Rice was the one leading the chant. School president Earsing sent a message to students, parents and alumni saying: 'In the recent video regarding OU and the SAE fraternity it appears that a graduate from Jesuit Dallas is leading the racist chant.' 'I am appalled by the actions in the video and extremely hurt by the pain this has caused our community.' He also vowed to identify all of the students who sang the chant and subject them to university punishment. On Monday he said that he was considering the use of criminal prosecution against the students involved. Rice's father Bob Rice is a vice president at real estate company Weeks Robinson Properties. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment by Daily Mail Online. Cut it off! As one frat brother gleefully sings a racist chant, another steps in and tries to cut off recording of the shameful incident . 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma. The student on the left has been identified at Parker Rice . One former high school classmate who identified Parker Rice as one of the leaders of the chant told Daily Mail Online: 'In my honest opinion, he was following his frat brothers. I don't believe he is a racist, just wanted to fit in. It's fraternity culture. You do what the elders do so you fit in. He truly is a nice guy, but I do question things now.' The student, who did not want his name used also said: 'We have a strong sense of brotherhood at Jesuit and that's why many won't say anything about Jesuit but there were other Jesuit grads on that bus chanting. 'At school he was a football player, he was the funny guy that seemed to never take anything serious. I saw him as a follower who was afraid to step out of his friend group because of fear of not being accepted. He was privileged but most of the kids at Jesuit were.' University of Oklahoma President David Boren today expelled two students identified as playing a leadership role in the singing of a racist chant in connection with an SAE fraternity event. Boren said that the students who played a leadership role had created a hostile learning environment for others. The chant was not only heard by those on a bus, but also impacted the entire university community as it was also distributed through social media. Boren said, 'I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma. I hope that the entire nation will join us in having zero tolerance of such racism when it raises its ugly head in other situations across our country. I am extremely proud of the reaction and response expressed by our entire university family - students, faculty, staff, and alumni about this incident. 'They are “Real Sooners” who believe in mutual respect for all. I hope that students involved in this incident will learn from this experience and realize that it is wrong to use words to hurt, threaten, and exclude other people. We will continue our investigation of all the students engaged in the singing of this chant. Once their identities have been confirmed, they will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.' Packing up: Two SAE fraternity brothers are seen here loading furniture into a moving truck outside the closed frat house on Tuesday . University president David Boren said officials would lock up the frat house at midnight . The university is not identifying the students expelled from OU - and it warns that additional punishments are likely to follow . Out of a job: Howard Dixon, the longtime cook at SAE, will be out of a job now after the university shut down the fraternity . Rice's father Bob Rice is at senior vice president and the manager of the Texas office of Weeks Robinson, a major commercial and industrial real estate firm. According to his company biography, he has helped develop and lease 7million square feet of new industrial property. He graduated from Indiana University. Rice also has two brothers. One older brother graduated from Jesuit College Prep and University of Oklahoma. His younger brother is still at Jesuit College Prep. At least three fraternity members can be seen standing on the bus singing the racist chant. Several more can bee seen cheering and hollering. At least one female voice can also be heard in the cheering. On Monday night, it was revealed that the Delta Delta Delta sorority was on the bus with fraternity members. The OU chapter of the sorority has denied that any of its sisters are under investigation by the university - though the headquarters for the sorority said officials were cooperating with OU investigation.","Parker Rice has been identified by his former high school, Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas .

"The Labour party has upset its own MPs after selling mugs promising a control on immigration. The £5 souvenirs were supposed to drum up cash for the party's election fighting fund. But they have sparked a storm of criticism, with prominent backbencher Diane Abbott branding them 'shameful'. Ed Miliband's promise to control immigration has been used as an unlikely slogan for a £5 red mug on sale on the Labour website . Labour released five mugs to coincide with the Launch of Ed Miliband's five election pledges. Each red mug, sold through the party's website, has one of the pledges written in white. But the one promising 'controls on immigration' has uspet some of the party faithful. Ms Abbott wrote on Twitter: 'This shameful mug is an embarrassment. 'But real problem is that immigration controls are one of our 5 pledges at all.' At 5pm on Sunday there were 267 of the mugs still available, according to the Labour website. The other pledges are: 'A Strong Economic Foundation', 'Higher Living Standards For Working Families', 'An NHS With The Time To Care,' and 'A Country Where The Next Generation Can Do Better'. At 5pm on Sunday there were 267 of the mugs still available, according to the Labour website . Labour MP Diane Abbott, a former frontbencher in Mr Miliband's health team, condemned the mugs - and policy- as 'shameful' A Labour spokesman said: 'Labour has five election pledges. This is one of the election pledges.' Mr Miliband was tackled on immigration last week as he appeared on the first TV contest of the election campaign. Told that the last Labour government's figures on the numbers expected to come to Britain were 'farcical', he admitted: 'Yes, they were wrong. I think that we benefit from our diversity, immigrants over the years have made a big contribution to our country but we do need proper controls. But he refused to set a limit on the number of people he thought could live in Britain before it was full. 'I'm not going to get into your hypotheticals,' he told interviewer Jeremy Paxman on the Sky News/Channel 4 programme. Challenged about his ability to take difficult decisions, Mr Miliband shot back: But am I tough enough? Hell yes, I'm tough enough.' The 'hell yes' slogan has also been seized on by the Labour party, which has had it printed on t-shirts for sale to raise money for campaign coffers. Challenged about his ability to take difficult decisions, Mr Miliband shot back: 'Am I tough enough? Hell yes, I'm tough enough.' The slogan has been put on t-shirts now being sold by the Labour party . David Cameron has come under fire after promising 'no ifs, no buts' to cut net migration to below 100,000. But latest figures released last week show that a total of 298,000 more people arrived in Britain than left in the year to September, as the numbers arriving from the rest of the EU hit a record high. A record 624,000 arrived in Britain in a year, up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. At the same time, 327,000 left, a figure which has barely changed since 2010. Some senior Tories urged Mr Cameron to ditch the pledge, but he has vowed to repeat it for the general election this year too. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Britain is facing quite a lot of pressure because the level of migration has been too high for too long. You see that on school places, and you see that in some places on the health service. 'I can absolutely say to people who are concerned about this, 'I hear you, I hear your concern, I get your message. He insisted he sticks to his pledge: 'you can call it an ambition, you can call it a target. That is what I want to achieve.'","£5 red mugs feature the party's five pledges for the general election .

"A California man who had been hiding in Hawaii for seven years pleaded guilty Thursday to killing his wife and dumping her body in a desert in 2007. Anthony Simoneau, 46, faces 11 years in prison when he is sentenced April 30 for the death of his wife, Fumiko Ogawa. After serving out his sentence, he will be placed on parole for another seven years. Scroll down for video . Justice done: Anthony Simoneau (left), 46, has pleaded guilty to a voluntary manslaughter charge in the 2007 death of his wife, Fumiko Ogawa (right) Punishment: Simoneau, pictured here in court Thursday, faces 11 years in prison when he is sentenced April 30 . Troubled marriage: Prosecutors said Simoneau filed for divorce in 2002 but then changed his mind after his wife inherited a substantial sum of money from relatives in Japan . Simoneau originally had faced a murder charge punishable by a 25-year sentence, but it was later downgraded to one count of voluntary manslaughter as part of a plea deal. Fumoko Ogawa, 41, was last seen alive January 4, 2007, near her home in Point Loma, California. After being unable to reach Ogawa for nearly a year, her family in Japan raised the alarm about her disappearance, but her husband never reported her missing, said NBC San Diego. Her body was found January 20, 2007, near the Bow Willow Campground in California’s Anza-Borrego desert, but she was not positively identified until June 2011. By that time, her husband had left the state. According to published reports, Anthony Simoneau filed for divorce in 2002 after six years of marriage, but had a change of heart upon learning that his wife inherited a substantial sum of money from her family in Japan. When Fumiko went missing, police said her husband went on a spending spree, buying four luxury SUVs, four boats, a motorcycle and three other vehicles, according to Honolulu Star-Advertiser. Mystery: Ogawa was last since in early January 2007. Her remains were discovered in weeks later buried in a shallow grave in the California desert. By the time they were identified, her husband (right) had fled . Nabbed: Last year, police tracked down Simoneau in Oahu, Hawaii, and had him extradited . Several months later, Simoneau picked up and moved to Hawaii, where he got a job as a tour guide on Oahu. Last September, detectives investigating Fumkio Ogawa's killing tracked down her husband and had him extradited back to California. According to Simoneau's plea agreement, the man killed his spouse because of a 'sudden quarrel in the heat of passion.' Initially, Fumkio Ogawa's remains uncovered in a shallow grave in the California desert were thought to be an unfortunate border crosser, but a DNA test determined that it was the missing woman. Prosecutors said the cause of death remains unknown to this day because of the body's deteriorated condition. Throughout the investigation, Simoneau repeatedly insisted that he had nothing to do with Ogawa’s killing. During a court appearance after his arrest in Hawaii, a defiant Simoneau told the judge that he was looking forward to having his day in court and proving his innocence, reported KHON2. Crime of passion: The plea agreement states that the 46-year-old husband killed his wife in a heat of passion during a fight . ‘I miss my wife very much and I will state, for the record, I did not kill my wife. I love her very much okay,’ said Simoneau to Hawaii News Now in 2011. But when a California judge asked him Thursday how he pleads to his wife’s killing, a dejected Simoneau replied: ‘Guilty, your honor.’ Chieko Ogawa, the victim’s mother, told a Japanese TV station that she was disappointed with the outcome of the case. ‘The sentence is so light,’ she lamented in an interview with NTV. ‘He got let off easy.

"Scroll down for video . A new BBC2 television series has challenged one British family to dine through the decades, lifting the cooking pot lid on how eating habits for UK households have changed dramatically since World War II. For two-and-a-half months last summer, the Robshaw family rolled back the years to find out exactly how they would have eaten as a family living in each of the post-war decades in the 20th century. The results, to be screened later this month on BBC2's Back in Time for Dinner programme, were fascinating - if not occasionally stomach churning. Stepping into a different dining room for each decade, the Robshaws - dad Brandon, mum Rochelle and children Miranda, 17; Rosalind, 15 and Fred 10 - lived through how menus have changed. Writing in The Independent, Brandon said the family's normal, 21st century diet was a 'fusion of the functional and the foodie' with easy-to-cook recipes dominating week days and more 'ambitious' dishes being tried at the weekend. Bread and dripping for breakfast, cow-heel pie for dinner... The Robshaw family took on a brave culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in every decade from the 1950s to the 1990s. Pictured, from left to right, Rosalind, 15, mum Rochelle, Fred, 10, dad Brandon and Miranda, 17, in the 1950s episode . Forty years later, the Robshaws found themselves eating in the Nineties, sampling such delights as homemade pasta. 'Within living memory, the way we eat has been utterly transformed, not once but several times, and is still changing,' remarked Brandon . Like most modern kids, Miranda, Rosalind and Fred are in possession of a wide-ranging palate and enjoyed dishes from a global menu, says their dad. So, what was their reaction when they were plunged into the immediate post-war period, when rationing dominated the diets of the early 1950s? Brandon says the family felt 'hungry' all of the time with ten-year-old Fred finding it particularly hard to sate his sweet tooth without the biscuits and snacks that are readily available today. Faced with an 'of-the-time' dining room for each decade; the 1960s kitchen had 'luminous sky-blue walls' and 'radioactive yellow walls', while the 1970s saw a move towards open-plan dining, something which made the kitchen much more of a social hub for families. The Hairy Bikers' Dave Myers pictured with the Robshaw family as they sample the food of the Sixties . Sampling the Good Life... although the Robshaws found that food in the 1970s was more brightly coloured - but perhaps less enticing - than ever before. After all, this was the decade that gave us the Pot Noodle. The rise of the TV dinner: The Robshaw family, pictured above in their 1980s-style kitchen found the decade to be all about convenience, with gadgets aplenty helping them to make meals . The arrival of multiple television sets per household in the eighties stifled mealtime communication however, with TV dinners - effectively a meal on a tray in front of the box - becoming commonplace. 'It brought home to us all how British food has been revolutionised in an incredibly short time,' says Brandon. 'Within living memory, the way we eat has been utterly transformed, not once but several times, and is still changing.' The series looks too at how technology made a difference; a 1950s housewife would be forced to do a daily shop without the luxury of a fridge. While a stay-at-home mum in the eighties would lay out an afternoon tea that might have been made using a Magimix machine for the cake and coffee from a filter machine. The family said there were highs and lows to each decade with particularly dismal offerings including the 'national loaf' that was rationed out to families after World War II. The bread was filled out with potato starch and, according to Brandon, was a one-way ticket to indigestion. Highs included a vegan bean casserole, fresh from the seventies which was 'lipsmackingly good' and a trip to famed restaurateur Anton Mosimann's London eatery, where very eighties nouvelle cuisine and lashings of champagne were served. Here, we take a through-the-decades look at what the Bradshaws experienced. Stepping back in time for a Mary masterclass: Baking supremo Mary Berry teaches the Robshaws how to make a cake as it would have been done in the 1950s . The Fifties . Easily the starkest decade for dining in the last sixty years, the fall-out from World War II meant that families were still using ration books for almost half of the 1950s. Even cups of tea would have to be apportioned out. Bread came in the form of the 'National Loaf' and because flour was scarce, it was often padded out with potato starch, making for an indigestion-inducing crust. How a family might have started the day in the early 1950s, with bread - often the rationed 'National loaf' - and left-over roasted meat fat aka 'dripping' Snacks that modern-day children take for granted were nowhere to be seen and hunger was an all-too-familar feeling. And when mealtimes came, small portions were the order of the day. Bread and dripping (often left-over fat from the Sunday roast), now largely consigned to the history books, was a reality at breakfast time. Vegetables were often taken from community allotments. With no fridges except in the most west-heeled family homes, food was largely eaten fresh and shopping was a daily occurrence. The decade did get better though and the Sixties loomed...with the promise of the first ready-meal. On the dinnerplate: Cow-heel pie and home-grown vegetables . The Sixties . On every level, the 1960s were about liberation. Gastronomically, the country began to breathe easier with rationing a distant memory and plenty of new-fangled ideas hitting the kitchen cupboards. Packets of cereal still familiar to us today - Rice Crispies, Frosties and Corn Flakes - all found themselves on the breakfast table for the first time. The breakfast cereal, now an essential item on most UK families' dining table in the mornings made their first appearance back in the 1960s . Curry but not as we'd recognise it now: Families began to get a taste for spicier food and  Vesta introduced an early ready meal in the shape of a beef curry . The beginning of a tomato-based love affair: Spaghetti bolognese arrived in the UK from our Italian friends...and hasn't left British dining tables since . Fridges became more commonplace, introducing the weekly shop to households. The tin-opener became a big ally in the kitchen as tins of Spam and corned beef were popular dinnertime treats. The Italians gave us our first garlic-infused sample of spaghetti bolognese and we liked it. On the downside, families began to get their first taste of processed food as sugar, salt and preservatives began to enter the equation. On the dinnerplate: One of the first meals in a packet, the Vesta beef curry . The Seventies . Three layers of sweetness! The Fab ice lolly proved a huge hit with youngsters in the 1970s . Dining rooms went open plan for the first time, making them a real social hub of the household for the first time. A freezer added further longevity to food in the family home. It wasn't all sophistication though, power cuts were a frequent event and dad would be found holding a candle as mum tried to concoct dinner in the dark. In an attempt to tantalise British palates, food packaging became brighter and more exciting...and often the bright colours would extend to the products inside. Children would go to the cinema and find such icy treats as Fabs and Sky Rays sold at the half-time interval. Spice came into the cupboards too, as curries became popular. Convenience food arrived in earnest, with the Pot Noodle stocked on supermarket shelves for the first time...much to the delight of students everywhere. Even cookbooks were dominated by making life easier, with casseroles and one-pots a big foodie trend. No self-respecting dinner party host would not think of serving fondue. On the dinnerplate: Curry and chips . Rise of the Pop Tart? Put it in the toaster or just eat it plain...kids went crazy for Kellogg's easy-to-eat snack . The Eighties . This decade saw the family cook look to appliances to make favourites with a more professional finish. Bakers fell in love with the Magimix and coffee tasted better in the filter machine. Working mums would rely on the ping of the microwave to feed their family quickly. The French sent over Nouvelle Cuisine and aspiring chefs went crazy for pretty, tiny portions...fancy food was all the rage in restaurants. Takeaways became a regular family treat. The number of televisions per household rose which saw the rise of the TV dinner, sidelining the dining table in favour of a tray on your lap. In between meals, kids would reach for one of the many snacks that were heavily advertised on television: Skips, Quavers and other high-salt, low nutrition foods were devoured. A more healthier backlash was on its way though... On the dinnerplate: Takeaway pizza . Just like mama used to make: Britons in the 1990s began to try their hand at making pasta at home...cue lots of families buying pasta machines . The Nineties . Health concerns for the first time began to make people think twice when supermarket shopping. A trend towards ditching processed food in favour of organic produce saw people conscious of their 'five-a-day' for the first time. Compared to the stark rationing of the Fifties, shopping was now all about variety with 10 types of apple, 20 types of bread laid before us. Although lots of food still clocked up plenty of air miles to get to our kitchen table, there was an awareness that eating locally was important. We discovered how to make our own pasta. The biggest vice? Booze! Meals would readily be accompanied by a nice bottle of Shiraz and supermarket shelves creaked with bottles of plonk, often at cut-down prices. On the restaurant scene, the gastropub arrived, reinventing old boozers by putting a chef with ambition in the kitchen. On the dinnerplate: Home-made pasta...with a nice bottle of red .

"It's the most famous carpet in the world, has more selfies than Kim Kardiashian can throw a stick at, and has captured the imaginations of millions of travellers. But although time has finally been called on Portland Airport's cult carpet, fans of the post-modern rug are still queuing up to say a fond farewell. Not only does the picture-perfect pile has its own Facebook page (with almost 13,000 likes), Instagram account, and numerous twitter pages filled with thousand of images of Jon Schleuning's iconic design, it has also inspired a range of Adidas trainers, poems, as well as countless mugs and T-shirts. Scroll down for video . At the last count. there were more than 42,000 foot selfies of the colourful carpet  at PDX on Instagram . And last Friday, it was announced that a fragment of the carpet - which is in the process of being replaced - will have a staring role as the grand marshall in Portland's annual Starlight Parade in May. 'We get it, he is a carpet,' Starlight Parade chairman Jeff Deering told Katu.com. 'But most importantly, that carpet represents the hundreds and thousands of employees that work directly for and indirectly for the Portland International Airport. The airport brings in $9.6 billion of economic boon to our state.' 'It's Portland, we keep it weird,' he added. Fans of the carpet shared their delight on social media. Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) wrote on twitter: 'Portland just made a chunk of carpet the grand marshall of a city parade. That’s why I live here!', while Selena Larson (@selenalarson) commented: 'I hope one day to love something or someone as much as Portland loves its airport.' Its striking geometric pattern, by architects SRG Partnership, was something of a departure from the standard oatmeal carpets in 1980's airports . It's difficult to say what's worse here; the carpet of the flip flops and socks combo . Unusually for a floor covering, the carpet has amassed loyal following since it was first laid in the late 1980s . At the last count, there were more than 42,000 foot selfies of the colourful carpet on Instagram alone using the hashtag #pdxcarpet. Its striking geometric pattern, by architects SRG Partnership, was something of a departure from the standard oatmeal carpets in 1980's airports, and was carefully designed to reflect the spirit of the northwest. 'Seeing the carpet means I'm home,' said one tweeter, Cindy Wilson (@mscynthialou), while Schleuning himself has said, 'people love coming back to Portland. The carpet represents home.' Unusually for a floor covering, the carpet has amassed loyal following since it was first laid in the late 1980s . The geometric design also corresponds to Portland's intersecting North-South runways, as seen from the airport's control tower. But if you haven't managed to capture your own foot selfie with the distinctive carpet yet, there's still time. Airport authorities expect the removal of 13 acres of carpet will take about a year.

"The chairman of the House Oversight Committee is issuing subpoenas to two Secret Service agents who witnessed an episode in which two allegedly intoxicated agency officials drove through a secure area at the White House, interrupting a bomb investigation. Oversight Committee head Jason Chaffetz said the agents can shed light not only on the March 4 incident, 'but also on why the Secret Service appears to be systemically broken and in desperate need of both leadership and reform.' Chaffetz had asked Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to allow four agents and officers to testify at a hearing last week on the March 4 incident. Clancy declined the request and instead testified as the sole witness. Scroll down for video . The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, is issuing subpoenas to two Secret Service agents who witnessed an episode in which two allegedly intoxicated agency officials drove through a secure area at the White House, interrupting a bomb investigation . Chaffetz had asked Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to allow four agents and officers to testify at a hearing last week on the March 4 incident. Clancy declined the request and instead testified as the sole witness. Clancy is pictured here at the hearing . The committee is trying to get to the bottom of allegations that two senior agents had been drinking when they drove into the area and nudged a construction barrier with their vehicle as they intruded on the investigation of a suspicious item. Chaffetz said the committee's top priority in its review of the incident is to ensure that the Secret Service keeps the president and his family safe. But he also wants the agency to be transparent. The Republican lawmaker said Department of Homeland Security, the parent organization of the Secret Service, 'requested that information remain secret and be kept from Congress and the American people.' 'Those restrictions are unacceptable. Under such restrictions, the Committee cannot perform its essential duties to evaluate and propose much-needed legislative reforms for this troubled agency,' Chaffetz said. Clancy has been criticized for the agency's handling of the incident and has complained that he was not told about it for five days, which he called unacceptable. He said he only learned about the misbehavior from discussions about an anonymous email that was circulating within the agency. The email described the off-duty agents as 'both extremely intoxicated' and confused about the investigation activity. It said uniformed Secret Service officers at the scene 'were going to arrest both of them, but the UD (Uniform Division) watch commander said not to.' Because Clancy was not made aware of the incident for several days, he was unable to keep surveillance footage that could have shed further light on the matter from being destroyed. It is Secret Service policy to toss out tapes after 72 hours. The only videos that remain from the night in question are those taken of the investigation into the suspected bomb and they do not give a complete picture of what happened after the agents bumped into the barrier. The Homeland Security Department's inspector general is investigating allegations against the agents. The Secret Service had no comment on the subpoenas Tuesday evening. The only videos that remain from the night in question are those taken of the investigation into the suspected bomb and they do not give a complete picture of what happened after the agents bumped into the barrier . Police surveillance video shown publicly for the first time last week shows Secret Service agents in their government vehicle driving through the secured area and nudging a temporary barrier at low speed as it drove toward a checkpoint . But Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson took issue with Chaffetz' complaints about the cooperation given his committee. 'I regret that Chairman Chaffetz and his staff have taken the unprecedented and unnecessary step of subpoenaing two members of the U.S. Secret Service with the responsibility for the protection of the president, his family and the White House complex,' Johnson said in a statement released Tuesday night. 'Chairman Chaffetz's assertion that this department has been ""uncooperative"" is simply wrong.' Johnson said his department offered to let 'a number of Secret Service personnel, including the two that have been subpoenaed' to participate in 'transcribed interviews with committee staff,' but Chaffetz and his team rejected that offer. The DHS head asserted that it is his job, as it is Clancy's, to protect Secret Service agents from the 'visibility, public glare, and inevitable second-guessing, of a congressional hearing' and the agency as a whole from having its work compromised. Johnson said that he also wants to know 'what happened on the night of March 4.' 'This is why the Department's inspector general is conducting a thorough investigation into the matter,' the Homeland Security chief said. In announcing the subpoenas Chaffetz said the Oversight Committee 'understands the sensitive nature of the Secret Service’s work and has made every attempt to perform its oversight duties in light of those concerns.' 'It is disappointing the Department has declined to cooperate. We therefore must take the regrettable step of compelling the agents for interviews before the Committee.'","Committee is trying to get to the bottom of the March 4 incident in which two agents drove into a secure area and nudged a construction barrier .

In a statement issued through Avon and Somerset Police, Ms Watts thanked those who had helped in the search for Becky, saying that she believed her daughter was now 'at peace'. She said: 'I would like to say a big thank you to everyone who took my beautiful angel into their hearts. 'I have felt unable to say anything about Becky until now as the sense of loss and pain is overwhelming. 'But throughout this time I have been so touched and comforted by how people, many of whom are complete strangers, have taken the time to express their condolences.' She continued: 'I feel Becky's presence all around me. I know that she is up in heaven with her nanny and grampy and other people that loved her.

'I have been going through old photographs and she has a beaming smile in all of them. This is how she should be remembered - for her beauty inside and out.' Becky was last seen on February 19. Three days later, police began a missing persons investigation. Her dismembered body was found at a house in the Barton Hill area of the city, three miles away, on Monday March 2. Yesterday, police confirmed that Becky's laptop, tablet computer and mobile phone - which went missing with the teenager - had been recovered. Detective Superintendent Liz Tunks, the officer leading the investigation, said: 'There is likely to be ongoing police activity at properties in St George and Barton Hill for the next couple of weeks as part of our investigation into the murder of Becky Watts. 'There are specific forensic examinations which we need to complete to help establish exactly what happened to Becky. 'We'd like to reassure the local community that our primary aim is to conduct a meticulous and exhaustive inquiry into Becky's death and even though there have been charges brought in this case, it continues to be an active investigation.' On Sunday, hundreds of multi-coloured balloons were released in Bristol in memory of Becky .

"On their first date, Tony Abbott wouldn't stop talking about the split between the ALP (Australian Labor Party) and the DLP (Democratic Labor Party) in the mid-1950s. Later on in their courtship, he would take her trekking down the Kokoda Trail - with a mate in tow - and would lavish her with bouquets of roses. Margie Abbott, Australia's so-called 'First Lady', has opened about how she was wooed by the future PM in an interview published in the latest issue of The Australian Women's Weekly. Margie Abbott (pictured at November's G20 summit, holding a koala bear) has begun taking up a more prominent role alongside her husband . Mrs Abbott (with husband Tony) told Women's Weekly how Mr Abbott wooed her in the late 1980s - with champagne, roses, and discussions about politics . Margie Abbott conducted an exclusive interview with the latest edition of The Australian Women's Weekly . The pair first met on a blind date at a Sydney tavern around 1987 - and six months later he would propose to her in an inner-Sydney restaurant, the pair celebrating with French champagne. 'I think we'd both pretty quickly made the decision that we'd met somebody we wanted to spend the rest of our lives with,' Mrs Abbott told the Weekly. The interview was a rare public moment of candour for Mrs Abbott, who has mostly managed to keep out of the limelight throughout her husband's federal political career of more than two decades. However, she has become noticeably more prominent in Mr Abbott's public appearances since he faced the humiliating prospect of a leadership spill motion in mid-February. In the Weekly interview, the Kiwi-born Mrs Abbott also faced questions about current political issues. She declined to answer questions about her thoughts on the Prime Minister dumping his much-touted paid parental leave scheme. Mrs Abbott, who works with a number of charities, has fulfilled her role as 'First Lady' at official functions. Here she is on Wednesday with her husband, greeting Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and Madame Tran Thanh Kiem . Perks of office: Mrs Abbott is pictured here with the family dog Maisie during a visit to the veterinary clinic earlier this year . Peta Credlin (pictured), Tony Abbott's chief of staff, has been the target of several Liberal party members because of her controversial management style . Mr Abbott has promised a 'better deal' for parents with child care in his next Budget (which he said this week would be 'much more boring' than last year's). Asked about Peta Credlin - the leader's chief of staff who was a central issue among several Liberal MPs in the recent Liberal Party turmoil - Mrs Abbott told the Weekly she juggled a difficult job. Ms Credlin has come under sustained public attack since late last year. The ABC's Four Corners program this week published a text message sent by Liberal Party treasurer Phil Higginson which described her as 'the horsewoman of the apocalypse' and sought her removal. 'At the end of the day, Peta works incredibly hard and it's a tough job,' Mrs Abbott said.

The planned departure of Callinicos - who oversaw the company's fastest years of growth - was confirmed in an email by Uber's Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, which was sent out to investors. Scroll down for video . Family man: Uber's CFO Brent Callinicos (pictured) has revealed he is stepping down from the online taxi service in an epic memo in which he says he is keeping a vow to spend more time with his wife and daughter . A man of his word: Callinicos wrote that he had made a promise to his wife, Julie, not to miss another school play, swim meet, or academic achievement of their daughter, Alexi . Daddy's girl: Callinicos wrote that he wants his daughter, who is in middle school, to 'understand how important time is before time becomes a blur to her too' Successful: In the internal document, Brent Callinicos, 48, who joined Uber Technologies Inc (file picture) in 2013 after serving as treasurer and chief accountant at Google, writes: 'For me, there is no later. It is now' In the email, Kalanick said Guatam Gupta, 'Brent's right hand on Strategic Finance', will be the acting head of the company's finance division until a replacement is either found or named. Callinicos, who will stay on at Uber as an advisor and consultant, is the second financial head of a major Silicon Valley company in only a week to depart with a memo about prioritizing family. Last week, Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette announced in a Google+post that he was quitting his job to travel the world with his wife in what he described as a 'perfectly fine mid life crisis'. In Callinicos inspiring memo, seen by the Wall Street Journal, the CFO quoted philosopher John Dewey: 'Time and memory are true artists; they remold reality nearer to the heart’s desire.' He went on to explain how it is time for him 'to encapsulate what matters most to me', such as helping his daughter 'understand how important time is before time becomes a blur to her too'. 'After 26 years of nonstop work since MBA School, I am going to step back and spend some time with my family and let someone else take this amazing company to the next level as CFO,' he said. Executives: Callinicos's planned departure was confirmed in an email by Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick (left). Right, last week, Google CFO Patrick Pichette also left his job with a memo about prioritizing his family . 'My daughter is in middle school; my wife has been supportively waiting to spend time with me for 28 years. I made a promise to both of them that I would be taking a long break at this stage of life.' Callinicos thanked Uber and his talented colleagues, and said he was stunned by the company's success over the past two years. He added that he will be staying on as an advisor at the firm. '[I] will always be emotionally connected to this company. I will miss everyone here, but, like the rest of the world, I will watch and admire from the sidelines as I begin a new life with my family,' he said. Kalanick's email, which was seen by Reuters and Mashable, also referred to Callinicos's desire to spend more time with his family - and said the businessman had done a 'wonderful' job at the firm. Rise to popularity: Uber, which is valued at around $41billion (compared to the $3.5 billion it was valued at when Callinicos joined the firm in 2013), is now available in more than 53 countries and 200 cities worldwide . 'Brent has done a wonderful job here at Uber but has decided that it is time for his next journey, one where his wife and daughter take the front seat,' the 38-year-old CEO wrote in the email. He added that Uber was around '1/10th' of the size it is today when Callinicos joined the company. Callinicos, who lives in California's San Francisco Bay Area with his family, is one of the highest ranked executives to leave Uber. He also previously worked for The Walt Disney Company.

"Nathan Ker  was diagnosed with a brain tumour after enduring eight months of migraines . Nathan Ker woke up one morning with numbness on one side of his body. When the 24-year-old construction worker went to a doctor the next day, he was sent home with some headache pills and told he was probably suffering from a bad migraine. But the pain didn't go away. For months, he put up with agonising headaches, dizziness and numbness. A New Zealander who had moved to Melbourne two years ago, Mr Ker was suffering and lonely, and turned to a dating site to find some companionship. 'I ended up meeting a beautiful woman named Rikki Milne,’ Mr Ker told Daily Mail Australia. ‘From the moment I met her, I somehow knew she was the one who could help my migraines disappear – by making all my problems seem like they didn't exist.’ But after three weeks of getting to know Milne, the left side of his body turned numb again. ‘I was struggling to talk,’ Ker said. Scroll down for video . The 24-year-old met his fiance Rikki Milne just three weeks before being diagnosed with a brain tumour . The 24-year-old had endured months of headaches but eight months later, doctors found a 'large tumour' ‘Fear struck me harder than it ever had. I was trying to explain to Rikki that it was all normal and it was just a side-effect of my migraines. But I could see the fear in her eyes too. ‘This time the numbness and paralysis didn't last just minutes. I rang my mum, who is a neuro nurse and all I remember her saying was ""call an ambulance"".’ When Mr Ker arrived at the hospital, he undertook a CT scan but alarm bells started ringing when he was told to do a second scan but with contrast dye injected into him. ‘That’s when I knew something was wrong,’ Mr Ker said. ‘Then the doctor walked in and all I remember her saying was: ""I am very sorry and there is no right way to explain this but you have a large tumour in the right side of your brain."" Nathan Ker pictured getting his head shaved after undergoing a surgery to get the large tumour removed . Mr Ker said he didn’t know what was going to happen next, which prompted him to end his relationship with his girlfriend at the time. ‘I told Rikki I couldn't be with her anymore because I was not able to put someone through what I thought I was about to go through,’ he said. ‘But she said: “it would take a security guard to drag her out of there”. ‘I have no idea what kind of pain Rikki would have been in watching it all unfold - my family members were crying on my shoulder while I was sitting in a wheelchair - having to do all this without really even knowing me. ‘She ended up having to hold me up in the shower, dress me and do everything I couldn't do with only one side of my body working. This is now why I call her my other half.’ The New Zealand man pictured here with stitches after having his large tumour removed from his brain . Nathan's brother Jordan (left) pictured with Rikki Milne and mother Sharon Ker during the tough recovery . When Mr Ker went in for his MRI scan, he claims the doctor made a ‘mistake’ after leaving his CT scan on his hospital bed. ‘I read that the prognosis was a glioma and I instantly hoped onto Google to find  survival rates were a 30 per cent for more than a year, and 15 per cent for more than two years,’ he said. ‘I told Rikki that if I made it out of that hospital alive I was going to marry her as soon as I had enough money to put a rock on her finger. Ker received good news when he was told the tumour was non-cancerous . ‘Then right before the scan, she walked in and knelt down beside my bed with a lollipop ring in her hand from the cafeteria downstairs and said: ""I don't need a ring ... Nathan will you marry me?"" ‘I instantly said yes.’ After his MRI results returned, he received some good news - he was diagnosed on September 2 with a meningioma - a benign (non-cancerous) tumour, which is normally found in elderly people. ‘The doctor told me I was a very lucky man,’ Ker said. Following the results, Mr Ker went in for a surgery to have his tumour removed just a week later. ‘The neurosurgeon told me there was a 20 per cent chance I'd never move my left side again and an even higher chance I'd never get the same sort of movement in my left side,’ he said. ‘I remember having tubes and lines put throughout my arms and then waking up being wheeled to the recovery room. ‘I looked at my left side, too scared to move it, then I just open my mouth and start rapping a song I had written and tears started streaming down my face. ‘I looked down and moved the toes on my left side and then my hands. I started saying in absolute happiness, ""I can move my left side!"" over and over again.' Ker, who now lives in Melbourne, is a hip hop artist and hopes to get back into the industry when he's well again . After his surgery, Ker tried to go back to work but was soon forced to leave after suffering seizures . Recalling the time before the tumour was found, Mr Ker said the pain was nearly unbearable. 'My brother Jordan thought I was having a stroke,’ Ker told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I couldn’t move my body so he convinced me to see a doctor but when the CT scans came back – nothing showed up so I thought I was fine, until the migraines started. ‘I had already seen a neurologist and he had prescribed me heaps of different migraine medications to no effect, so I just toughed it out. The pain endured, weeks and turning into months of excruciating migraines during which he suffered physically and mentally. ‘This pain went on for eight months straight,’ he said. ‘Some days, I’d only get a few hours’ sleep and that lasted weeks. ‘I’d wake up in the middle of the night in agony and it would feel like I had a knife inside my head – and the pain and pressure I had on my right eye was unexplainable.' When Ker was released from hospital after his surgery, his fiance took time out of work to look after him. ‘I had found the most amazing woman in the world and couldn't understand why she loved me, but she did and over the next few weeks I slowly regained my strength,’ he said. ‘The recovery was hard and I had to learn how to walk again.’ The 24-year-old woke up one morning when he found half his body was numb where he struggled to move . After being released from hospital, Ker started working again but he soon suffered non-convulsive seizures, which forced him to quit. ‘One day at work, my head went blank and I couldn't even fold a box,’ he said. ‘I couldn't do simple tasks or see friends because I was ashamed of not being able to talk properly. I was back to having my family and fiancé pay for everything. ‘I felt like my brain had just stopped working and I couldn't talk properly but in recent times, my seizures have stopped. ‘But I have promised Rikki I’ll fly her back to our beautiful country New Zealand for a holiday. ‘I owe my thanks to my mum Sharon and brother Jordan, my fiancee and her mother and father Pnina Rosenberg and Troy Milne for accepting me as a son, and the rest of my family and friends for being there for me since day one.’ Family and friends have set up a Give me a Little appeal in a bid to raise funds for Nathan Ker, who has not been able to go back to work since the surgery.","A  New Zealand man endured eight months of excruciating migraines .

"He may be pushing 94, but Prince Philip’s not lost one iota of his sense of humour. Watching his wife sign an empty picture mount – in which a glossy portrait of the monarch was later placed - the on-form royal remarked waspishly: ‘It’s not a very good likeness, is it?’ Philip had accompanied the Queen to Southampton to officially name the new £473 million P&O cruise liner Britannia, in which the finished photograph will, eventually, hang. Scroll down for video . Cheeky: He may be pushing 94, but Prince Philip proved he hasn't lost one iota of his sense of humour today as The Queen launched the Britannia ocean liner in Southampton . And it wasn’t the only cracker uttered by Philip during the course of their visit. On being introduced to P&O’s Human Resource director, Paula Porter, yesterday, he remarked: ‘Humans are not resources!’ Fortunately the executive took the off-the-cuff comment in her stride, laughing afterwards: ‘I thought it was a very good line. I shall be using it again.’ The Queen, 88, also appeared to be thoroughly enjoying herself, even tapping her feet in time to the music of the Band of the Royal Marines as they played a merry jig before Britannia’s official naming ceremony. Wit: Watching his wife sign an empty picture mount – in which a glossy portrait of the monarch was later placed - the on-form royal remarked waspishly: ‘It’s not a very good likeness, is it?’ Tears of laughter: The Queen chuckled during the ceremony and wiped away a tear of laughter . Nowadays the monarch doesn’t actually have to swing the bottle of bubbly – in this case a Nebuchadnezzar (20 bottles) of English sparkling wine from the Wiston Estate Winery near Pulborough, Sussex – used to christen the boat herself. Instead she discreetly presses a button and the work is done for her. The new mechanised system isn’t entirely foolproof, however. When the bottle struck the side of the ship it exploded with an almighty bang, sending one hefty shard of glass speeding to within a few feet of where the Queen was sitting. Fortunately the forward-thinking people from P&O had erected a plastic screen to protect the elderly sovereign. All the same, it was quite a moment and clearly struck a chord with the guest of honour. When the Queen met a line-up of chefs later, including Marco Pierre White, she referred to the incident exclaiming: ‘It exploded!’ Olly Smith, Britannia’s wine expert, replied: ‘It did, didn’t it, Ma’am? Spectacularly' Round of applause: The Queen cheers during the naming ceremony for Britannia . Having a chat: The Queen enjoys a chat during the naming ceremony for Britannia . Round of applause: The Queen claps as the sixth cruise ship she has sponsored is officially named . Enjoying the sunshine: A dapper Duke of Edinburgh appeared to be enjoying his day in Southampton . Is that you dear? The Duke of Edinburgh flips through the programme and stops at a picture of the Queen . Thankfully, however, some traditions haven’t gone by the wayside. ‘God bless her and all who sail in her,’ the sovereign also said. Surprisingly, Buckingham Palace confirmed yesterday, the Queen has only named four civilian ships previously (the QE2 in 1967, Oriana in 1995, Queen Mary 2 in 2004 and Queen Elizabeth in 2010, with the Britannia as the fifth). But the monarch appeared to be thoroughly enjoying herself, chatting nineteen to the dozen with other VIP guests as she toured the vessel. She was heard telling TV chef James Martin, one of a number of celebrity chefs who will be offering classes for passengers: ‘The first time I ever saw white bread was on board the old Queen Elizabeth. It was rather fascinating.’ The ship, which cost its owners £473m to build, is the third P&O Cruises ship to be named Britannia but is easily the largest of the trio, with 15 passenger decks, 13 restaurants and four pools on-board. Britannia was also the name of the Queen's much-loved Royal Yacht which was decommissioned in 1997 under the orders of then Prime Minister Tony Blair. Berthed in Edinburgh's Port of Leith, the ship is now a static tourist attraction but sailed more than 1,000,000 miles during its 40 years in royal service. The new Britannia is expected to rack up a similar number of miles during its own career, although unlike the Queen's yacht, it will host tourists rather than dignitaries. Today, however, dignitaries were the order of the day for the new Britannia, with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh shown around the new ship by a large group of them. Isn't it magnificent?

The Queen is no stranger to cruise ships in any case, having become godmother to no fewer than five - now six, including Britannia. First of the liners launched by the Queen was Cunard's QE2, which was christened in 1967 and made her maiden voyage in 1969. Now permanently moored in Dubai after retiring in 2008, its owners plan to turn it into a floating luxury hotel, although plans for the conversion are currently stalled. Other vessels launched by the Queen include the Oriana in 1995, the Queen Mary 2 in 2004 and Queen Elizabeth, another Cunard ship, in 2010. Well-wishers: The Queen was joined by Darcy Bussell, Anneka Rice and hairdresser Nicky Clarke . Supporter: Chef Marco Pierre White at the event.

Although the Queen is godmother to the largest number of vessels, she is not the only member of the royal family to have launched a cruise ship. In 2007, the Duchess of Cornwall launched Cunard's Queen Victoria at Southampton, returning five years later to blow out the candles on its fifth birthday in 2013. The same year saw the Duchess of Cambridge become a ship's godmother for the first time, with the royal, who was making her last public appearance before the birth of Prince George, invited to christen Princess Cruises' Royal Princess. The vast Royal Princess is one of the largest cruise ships ever built and has space for 3,600 guests, as well as an over-water 'Seawalk' which allows travellers to see what's going on below. Other vessels with royal connections include the Navy's new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth II, which was launched by Her Majesty in Rosyth with a bottle of whisky last year. The Duchess of Cornwall also has a naval vessel to her name, in her case the high-tech nuclear-powered submarine, HMS Astute. She is also the patron of a Cornish river ferry named the Duchess of Cornwall, which launched in 2008 and plies the waters between Falmouth and St Mawes.

"The original suspect in the murder of an America’s Next Top Model contestant and three others was scheduled to be ejected from the US in 2012 but was granted deferred deportation under President Obama’s amnesty policy, it was revealed today. Emmanuel Jesus Rangel-Hernandez, 19, was arrested last month in connection to a triple-homicide in Charlotte, North Carolina, that claimed the lives of aspiring model Mirjana Puhar, 19, her 23-year-old boyfriend Jonathan Alvarado, and 21-year-old Jusmar Isiah Gonzaga-Garcia. His alleged accomplice, 19-year-old David Ezequel Lopez, was taken into custody Thursday and jailed on three counts of first-degree murder. Scroll down for video . Dreamer:  Emmanuel Jesus Rangel (right), 19, charged with the murder of America's Next Top Model contestant Mirjana Puhar (right), was supposed to be deported in 2012 but was granted amnesty . According to a statement released by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and GOP Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rangel was permitted to stay in the country under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Records indicate Rangel, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, was placed in the removal process by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after being charged with drug violations in March 2012. On December 18, 2012, however, removal proceedings were dismissed because Rangel was approved for deferred action under the DACA policy, despite his suspected affiliation with a street gang, of which ICE was allegedly aware. 'Accomplice': Second suspect David Lopez, 19, charged with three counts of first-degree murder in deaths of Mirjana Puhar, Jonathan Alvarado and Jusmar Isiah Gonzaga-Garcia . ‘This raises serious concerns about USCIS’s review and approval of other DACA applicants and points to potential vulnerabilities in the system’ Senators Grassley and Tillis wrote in a letter sent in February to the Department of Homeland Security requesting information about Rangel’s status. Under the amnesty program, which was enacted by President Obama's executive action, more than 675,000 young immigrants since August 2012 have been granted a work permit and reprieve from deportation. Republicans have long decried Obama's executive immigration as a form of backdoor amnesty that circumvents Congress. Homeland Security Department documents say participation in the program can be revoked at any time. US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which approves applications, reported to the House Judiciary Committee last year the government stripped that protection from 113 people as of August. The revocations included one case of gang membership, one aggravated assault, 11 driving-under-the-influence cases and 11 errors by USCIS, according to the committee. As recently as last week, 15 criminal immigrants protected form deportation under DACA were arrested in raid carried out by federal agents. On Thursday, a second suspect, David Ezequel Lopez, 19, was charged with killing the former America's Next Top Model contestant, her boyfriend and another man, in what police were calling a drug-related attack. Lopez voluntarily came to police headquarters to be interviewed. He was then transported to the Mecklenburg County Jail. In late February, investigators arrested 19-year-old Rangel and charged him with the slayings, which have been described as drug-related. Rangel has also been charged in a separate murder that occurred February 22. He is one of three people charged in connection with a homicide at a motel in Matthews, police said. Police would not say exactly what role Lopez played in the Norris Avenue murders. Puhar, a Serbian national, appeared in the modeling show's 21st cycle, which began airing last August. Daily Mail Online reported last month that the 19-year-old fashionista was shot in the head as she opened the door to two robbers, who then killed her boyfriend, Alvarado, and his roommate, Gonzaga-Garcia. James Jackson, the stepfather of Alvarado, 23, said robbery was the reason behind the shooting, explaining that Emmanuel Rangel got the wrong impression that Alvarado had a lot of money on hand after he had paid $1,500 for a car the week before. Victims: Puhar's 23-year-old boyfriend Jonathan Alvarado (left) and his roommate, 21-year-old Jusmar Isiah Gonzaga-Garcia (right) were also killed in the attack . Crime scene: Puhar was reportedly shot in the head when she opened the door to the two suspects at this home in Charlotte, North Carolina . The father also revealed that his stepson, a recent transplant from Puerto Rico, and Puhar were planning to get married after dating for six months. Alvarado openly talked about his drug habit, posted pictures of marijuana on his Facebook page along with those of friends brandishing guns, but Puhar's friends insisted that she never used narcotics. They said it was iill fortune that put her 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' and saw her gunned down in the bungalow she shared with the two other victims. The Charlotte Observer reported on Puhar's emerging career in a story published in 2014. She told the newspaper that her family fled Serbia after the Kosovo War and moved to North Carolina a decade later. Puhar said she began modeling at age 12 and did runway shows at Charlotte Fashion Week. She said she had a troubled adolescence and eventually quit school. 'I was a wild child,' she said. 'I went out, had fun, partied, whatever - I didn't really have the best influences around me.' Rising star: The Serbian national (right) appeared in the reality TV modeling show's 21st cycle . Good girl: Puhar's friends insisted that the 19-year-old was not a drug user. Her boyfriend, however, boasted online about his narcotics habit . Puhar reached the 10th episode of the current season of AMNT before she was eliminated from the competition . After dropping out of high school, Puhar decided to obtain her GED in 2013. Shortly after that, she was cast on ""America's Next Top Model,"" a reality show on The CW network that pits aspiring models against each other. In an interview with CW affiliate WCCB in Charlotte, Puhar described her experience on the show, including meeting co-producer and model Tyra Banks. 'She's amazing. She's definitely a great mentor,' Puhar said. Puhar reached the 10th episode of the current season of the show before she was eliminated from the competition. Banks and co-producer Ken Mok issued a statement mourning Puhar's death. 'We are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic news about Mirjana Puhar. She was a vivacious and promising young woman. Our hearts and prayers go out to her loved ones,' the statement said.","Emmanuel Jesus Rangel, 19, was charged in connection to triple homicide last month; he is also facing charges in unrelated murder case .

The lookalike, who currently works as a PA, said: ‘For some events, for example a teenager having a Sweet Sixteen or another birthday party, then people pay well into the hundreds for a Kim Kardashian appearance because she is their idol. ‘She’s very popular in that age group because she’s such a good role model’, Miss Patton added. ‘At the moment I have a full time job and do the Kim Kardashian stuff as a side hobby, but now because there’s the appetite out there for her, it’s something I’d really like to do full time and create a business out of it.’ Jo'Anne has had so much success as a Kim Kardashian lookalike in Leeds that she estimates earning up to £36,000 over the course of the year . The lookalike, who currently works as a PA, only has to put in around six appearances a month . While she only works as Kim's doppleganger part-time, because there's the appetite out there for her, she says it's something she'd really like to do full time and create a business out of it . Kim Kardashian is a 34-year-old American socialite and TV personality who shot to fame after she starred with her family in the reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians – commissioned shortly after a sex tape of her was leaked in 2007. Kardashian is a somewhat controversial celebrity, not least because of her infamous bottom/waist ratio and rumours of cosmetic surgery to enhance her buttocks, which have expanded proportionally with her fame. Nonetheless, she has successfully launched and marketed her own clothing lines, perfume ranges and spin-off shows and Kardashian’s mobile game, in which players can try to become a Hollywood star, was last year’s fifth highest earning game in Apple’s App Store. She has over 27m Twitter followers and 23m Instagram followers and is currently worth around £41m ($64m). Miss Patton, right, says that Kim Kardashian, left, has done really well for herself and has her fingers in a lot of pies and is flattered that some people think she looks like her . Miss Patton says that Kim's profile has become bigger and bigger, adding that it's not just her bum that's made her a household name but her business acumen . The PA admits that keeping up with Kim's appearance costs over £1,300 per month . In October she starred on the cover of Paper magazine wearing nothing but pearls and a smile, revealing her bare buttocks to the world above the headline ‘Break the Internet’. The following day the magazine released the fully-frontal nude photographs of the shoot, and its website reportedly saw an average of 15.9m views in one day, compared with its usual 25,000. Many have decried Kardashian’s suitability as a 'role model' but Miss Patton said: ‘Kim Kardashian has done really well for herself and has her fingers in a lot of pies [and] I am flattered that some people think I look like her. ‘Her profile has become bigger and bigger - not just her bum - and she has been extremely clever in how she’s marketed herself.’ Jo-Anne, left, aged 8 and, right, at school aged 15, says she was bullied over her looks as a youth . Jo-Anne, left, aged 16 and, right, aged 19, says she would consider being a lookalike as her full-time job . Miss Patton works for celebrity lookalikes agencies in Leeds and London, whose clients include banks, magazine and television companies, and large retail stores . She credits her 27-inch waist and 40-inch buttocks to 'a lot of Nandos together with squats and weights' Miss Patton was bullied at school for her looks and said that to be told she looked like Kim Kardashian helped with her confidence levels. ‘I was more insecure when I was growing up and I was bullied at school’, she said. ‘I had acne, I wasn’t in with any of the cool crowd.. So it’s flattering if a few years later you put on some make-up and people tell you that you look like Kim Kardashian when you go out.’ Nails - £50 . Hair extensions -£460 . Tattooed eyeliner - £450 . Facials - £65 . Fake tan - £20 . Make-up - £50 . Gym membership - £40 . Fake eyelashes - £15 . Clothes - £200 . Hair, skin and nail supplements - £40 . Total: £1390 . The PA admits that keeping up with Kim’s appearance is no mean feat, and with costs of over £1,300 per month, the look doesn’t come cheap. Despite having breast implants 14 years ago, Miss Patton has had no other cosmetic surgery and says she would not like her bottom to be any bigger. She credits her 27-inch waist and 40-inch buttocks to ‘a lot of Nandos together with squats and weights in the gym’, and added that: ‘It’s also important to me that Kim Kardashian is curvy, and is not a skinny role model.’ Two years ago Miss Patton joined celebrity lookalikes agencies in Leeds and London, whose clients include banks, magazine and television companies, and large retail stores. The role of the lookalikes is to 'perform' their character at private parties, conferences, gala dinners and theme nights, as well as mingle with the crowd and have their photograph taken. ‘My first booking was a private birthday party and I was really nervous’, said Miss Patton. ‘I wore a tight cream and black body-con Lipsy dress, because Kim likes those dresses, and did my hair and make-up as best I could. ‘Luckily, the host and all her friends love Kim Kardashian so in the end it was great, as I just smiled and had my picture taken with everyone.’","Jo'Anne Patton, 32, earns up to £36,000 a year for six appearances a month .

"A fashion photographer who was asked by designer Alexander McQueen to take a special series of backstage photographs 11 years ago is showcasing the images in a dramatic tableau for the first time. Nick Knight says the renowned designer invited him to take the snaps at his iconic McQueen Black Event in 2004. The London show featured an atmospheric showcase of black pieces, some from the archive and others designed specifically for the night. Scroll down for video . Fashion photographer Nick Knight has created a stunning series of images created from backstage photographs of Alexander McQueen's 2004 show . Now using material he shot backstage at the event, Mr Knight has now created the unique image called Black, collating the previously unseen photographs of 35 outfits modelled by Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Gemma Ward and Lily Cole among others. Mr Knight says he was asked by McQueen to photograph each model backstage with a view to creating a composite image for the future, and now, more than a decade later, the designer’s vision has now been realised. Mr Knight said: ‘As a close collaborator and friend of McQueen, I had the honour of filming many of his photo shoots from the mid-Nineties onwards.’ 'McQueen was so excited as he neared the completion of the collection for the American Express Black event, he insisted we found a way to shoot it behind the scenes at Earls Court where the show was being held. 'He knew the Black Event was an important moment that should be preserved and shown to the world, so this project has been a great way for me to reflect upon and celebrate our working relationship. Models including Kate Moss, Lily Cole and Naomi Campbell were all captured backstage wearing McQueen costumes for the tableaux which has been broken down into four sections . Nick Knight has turned the previously unseen pictures into a dramatic tableaux . ‘We both knew we had the ingredients to make an incredible image.’ The image, commissioned by American Express, has been released to coincide with the Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty exhibition currently showing at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Lisa Gregg, vice president, American Express, said: ‘Alexander McQueen was renowned for pushing creative boundaries and this was always demonstrated through his legendary work. American Express supported McQueen in his early years as a trailblazing creative, and was privileged to accompany him on the meteoric rise from cutting edge designer to global name. ‘Our partnership with the V&A and the Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty retrospective has given us an exciting opportunity to work with Nick again and to commission this beautiful image, which is a wonderful tribute to our past collaborations with McQueen.’ McQueen was one of the UK's most controversial fashion stars, a man whose flamboyant public image concealed a private life blighted by depression and battles with drink and drugs. The retrospective of his work at the V&A features items taken from his ground-breaking 1992 MA collection shown alongside his last. Savage Beauty, which runs until August 2, includes pieces from the unfinished 2010 collection as well as new pieces lent by McQueen's friends, among them stylist Katy England. The tableaux, called Black, have been released to complement the Alexander McQueen:Savage Beauty retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London . Talented: McQueen, pictured left, during his spring/summer 2006 show and, right, his friend and fashion photographer Nick Knight . McQueen, who was found dead on the 11 February 2010, was one of the UK's most influential designers at the time of his death and was the owner of a little black book that encompassed everyone from royals to first ladies and fashion editors. The son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher, the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in Lewisham, south London, where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters. After leaving school at 16 with a single O-Level in art, the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at Savile Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, before a stint at theatrical costumiers, Angels and Bermans. Both would have huge influence on his later career. McQueen's big break came following a spell in Milan working for Romeo Gigli. On his return to London, he applied to Central St Martins for work as a pattern cutter. Impressed by his portfolio, Bobby Hilson, the head of the master's course, persuaded him to enrol as a student instead. His faith in McQueen paid off. The designer's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by Isabella Blow. Spectacular: A curator puts the final touches to some of the dresses on display at the V&A . Striking: His pieces were adored by fashion press and fashion-buying public alike . Hard to walk in: His shoes were notoriously elaborate and hard to walk in, as several models discovered while on the catwalk . Finishing touches: A curator works on an exhibit (left), while right, one of the structured gowns for which McQueen became famous . Last pieces: These designs are taken from McQueen's S/S10 collection which was inspired by sea creatures . From there, McQueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation, designing David Bowie's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous 'bumsters' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans. The same year, he was appointed creative director at Givenchy, replacing fellow Briton John Galliano, and relocated to Paris. But despite his success, McQueen never forgot his London roots, often speaking of his love for the British capital. Indeed, he once spoke of how inspiring he found the V&A itself, saying: 'The collections at the V&A never fail to intrigue and inspire me. The nation is privileged to have access to such a resource... it's the sort of place I'd like to be shut in overnight.' The museum repaid the compliment, first by including the designer's work in Cutting Edge: 50 Years of British Fashion in 1997, and then again in its Fashion in Motion series. But it is the new Savage Beauty retrospective that will be the largest retrospective of McQueen's work hosted by the museum, with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show. Enfant terrible: One of McQueen's more shocking stunts involved spraying model Shalom Harlow with paint during his S/S98 show . Striking: A V&A assistant poses next to a dress taken from McQueen's The Girl Who Lived In The Tree A/W 2008 collection . Magnificent: As with his shoes, the headgear shown on the catwalk by McQueen was usually difficult to wear . Changing times: McQueen's sea creature inspired S/S10 collection (left) and a dress from his A/W08 Widows of Culloden collection . Among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection, as well as some of his A/W10 designs - the last the designer would ever create. His final collection was never completed, with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in Paris a month after he died. But while McQueen might be gone, his brand lives on and, in the capable hands of his former assistant Sarah Burton, continues to go from strength to strength. 'Lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries, challenged and inspired,' she explains. 'He believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless. Savage Beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time.' 'I am thrilled to announce that the V&A will bring this wonderful exhibition to London to celebrate the extraordinary creative talent of one of the most innovative designers of recent times,' adds V&A director Martin Roth. 'Lee Alexander McQueen was brought up in London, studied here and based his globally successful McQueen fashion brand here – by staging the exhibition at the V&A it feels like we are bringing his work home.' Dramatic:  McQueen was famous for producing pieces that erred on the side of gothic such as these three dresses . Spectacular: Victoriana and bold blooms were also recurring motifs, as these striking gowns make plain . Setting the scene: Savage Beauty opens at the V&A next month, with tickets due to go on sale on the 14th March . The stars turned out in force for the party the V&A held this evening to celebrate the arrival of the exhibition. Supermodels including Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Erin O'Connor all showed up at the event in dresses by the late designer. A-List names from the world of acting also showed up to view the designs, including Colin Firth and Laura Carmichael, while David and Victoria Beckham put in an appearance too. Princess Beatrice flew the flag for the British royals, turning heads as she arrived in a black tuxedo-style dress that was split to the thigh.

"Google was almost prosecuted by the US government three years ago for skewing its search results, according to a confidential report. In 2012, experts at the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who were probing the company after some of its rivals complained about Google’s dominance in internet search, wrote that the company was using anti-competitive tactics, to the detriment of users. The 160-page report, which was obtained by The Wall Street Journal, suggests that Google's algorithms were biased and it was demoting competitors' services, while putting its own at the top of search results lists. The 160 page report, which was obtained by The Wall Street Journal, suggests that Google's algorithms were biased and it was demoting competitors' services, while putting its own at the top of search results lists . It said that key staff members of the FTC were in favour of suing the Californian tech giant for violating antitrust rules, before the agency settled its investigation in 2013. The internal report was written by the FTC’s competition bureau, which opened its investigation into internet search engines in 2011. It said that Google’s 'conduct has resulted - and will result - in real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets.' The report also said that the tech company's actions 'helped it to maintain, preserve and enhance Google’s monopoly position in the markets for search and search advertising' and 'will have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare'. Google claims its facial recognistion 'FaceNet' system is practically perfect, getting the right person 99.96 per cent of the time. The dataset uses more than 13,000 face images from the Internet to measure how accurate the algorithms are at verifying whether two images are of the same individual . 'Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches,' the researchers say. 'To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. 'The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128-bytes per face. 'On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63%. FaceNet was trained on an enormous 260-million-image dataset and performed at an 86 percent and higher accuracy rate. It argued that the owner of the world's number one internet search engine illegally took information from rival websites, such as Trip Advisor and Amazon, to improve its own search ranking system and placed restrictions on websites and advertisers, the BBC reported. Despite this, the FTC settled its multi-year investigation of Google in 2013 after the search giant agreed to some voluntary changes to its practices. This included allowing websites to opt out of having content included in  competing search products. The Journal noted that it's rare for commissioners not to take staff recommendations, but that another report from a different part of the agency didn't back legal action. Jon Leibowitz, who was chairman at the time, said in a statement that Google’s voluntary changes deliver 'more relief for American consumers faster than any other option.' The tech firm said that the review showed the way it sorted its results did no harm to either its competitors or consumers Googling information. Google said in a statement that ‘after an exhaustive 19-month review, covering 9 million pages of documents and many hours of testimony, the FTC staff and all five commissioner agreed that there was no need to take action on how we rank and display search results.’ ‘Speculation about potential consumer and competitor harm turned out to be entirely wrong.’ A representative of the FTC said the agency had no comment on the report. Google said that the review showed the way it sorted its results did no harm to either its competitors or consumers Googling information. A picture of its headquarters in Mountain View, California is shown . Details of the report, which the Journal said were inadvertently disclosed in an open-records request, come as European antitrust regulators decide their next steps in a four-year investigation of Google. Yelp has reiterated its assertions that Google abuses its dominant position in the search market, The New York Times reported. 'This shows the FTC had direct evidence of intentional search bias by Google,' said Luther Lowe, vice president for public policy at Yelp. 'With the FTC agreeing to a weak settlement against the recommendation of professional staff, this anti-consumer behavior has been effectively greenlighted in the United States.' After the regulator made its decision public, Microsoft called it a missed opportunity that was 'weak and - frankly - unusual.'","Federal Trade Commission report was obtained by The Wall Street Journal .

"There's an old adage - if you want something done right, do it yourself. Well, that was certainly the case for Grays Athletic player-manager Mark Bentley. With his side 2-1 down in the second-half to Hampton and Richmond Borough in the Isthmian League Premier Division, defeat was looking likely. Bentley though, wasn't prepared to just stand back and take one; so, in a bold tactical move, the 37-year-old subbed himself into the game, and minutes later, he scored an equalising goal with a header from a corner.

"David Cameron has said he will only take part in one election debate . David Cameron could be given his own election programme if he refuses to show up for televised leaders debates, it was claimed today. Broadcasters last week insisted they would push ahead with plans for three debates in April – including a face-off between the Prime Minister and Ed Miliband. But the BBC is understood to have backed down from threats to 'empty chair' Mr Cameron if he refuses to show. If the corporation pushes ahead with its planned Cameron vs Miliband debate without the Prime Minister it risks being accused of giving an unprecedented platform to the Labour leader, just a week before the election. To meet strict impartiality rules during election campaigns, the BBC is considering giving Mr Cameron his own show in return, the Independent on Sunday claimed today. Labour have accused the Prime Minister of 'ducking and weaving' to get out of the debates and called for new laws to make sure leaders debates always take place. Ed Miliband said he would make 'fair and impartial leaders' debates' compulsory. But the proposal was mocked by the former SNP leader Alex Salmond today. Mr Salmond said he supported having TV debates but added: 'Could you actually pass a law which says that somebody has to turn up at a TV debate? 'What do you do when David Cameron doesn't turn up? Shall we stick him in the clink, do we put him in Wandsworth [prison] or somewhere?' 'I don't think you can actually do that. Surely it's the public who have got to enforce the TV debates by the reaction to people who are too scared to turn up.' Labour said the new system would work on similar lines to the current rules for planning the number, length and timing of party political broadcasts. That would mean parties are consulted but not given the right to veto the debates taking place. Ed Miliband has accused David Cameron of 'running scared' of facing him in televised leaders' debates . Labour believes this could be done by establishing the Broadcasters' Liaison Group as a trust in statute so it is the recognised legal body for deciding dates, format, volume and attendees of the debates. A Labour government would set a deadline of 2017 for changes to be put in place, giving more than enough time to plan the debates for a 2020 election. Mr Miliband told The Observer: 'In recent days the British public has been treated to the unedifying and tawdry spectacle of a prime minister seeking to duck out of the TV debates he once claimed to support with great enthusiasm.' He said the broadcasters had 'made it clear they would not be cowed by his tactics but it is wrong for them and the British public to have governing parties use this kind of pressure in campaign periods'. Mr Miliband added: 'It is time to ensure, once and for all, that these debates belong to the people, not the prime minister of the day.' The four broadcasters - the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel 4 - have said they will stick to their previously-announced plans for three debates during the election campaign, and urged the Prime Minister to 'reconsider' his refusal to take part in these shows, including a head-to-head showdown with Mr Miliband. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (left) said the broadcasters had made a 'mess' of the election debates, but Harriet Harman accused David Cameron of trying to scupper them . Mr Cameron, Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown faced off in TV debates ahead of the 2010 general election . But Mr Cameron's chief spin doctor Craig Oliver said their response was 'disappointing' and restated the Prime Minister's 'final position' was for a single debate to take place in the week starting March 23. The broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven-way debate involving Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Nick Clegg of the Lib Dems and the leaders of the Greens, Ukip, Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru on ITV on April 2, followed by a second show on BBC featuring the same line-up on April 16. A final one-on-one clash with the Tory and Labour leaders invited is scheduled to be broadcast on Sky News and Channel 4 on April 30 - exactly a week before the May 7 election. In a letter to Mr Oliver, the broadcasters made clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if Mr Cameron decides not to take part. Downing Street's Director of Communications Craig Oliver has rejected the broadcasters' ultimatum . Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today accused the broadcasters of making a 'real hash' of trying to organise the debates. She said: 'The prime minister has made a very clear offer. A 90-minute debate involving everybody the week of March 23. 'So we get to the short campaign ... we can get out into the country.' Asked on Sky News' Murnaghan specifically about a head to head between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron, she replied: 'They are up against each other pretty well every week at prime minister's questions. 'Frankly I think the broadcasters have made a real hash of this because the processes and discussions have been going on for months and months now. 'They invited this party and that party. The prime minister has made a very clear offer - get seven parties in the same place, have a 90-minute debate before the campaign starts. 'Otherwise all we are doing all the way through the campaign itself is talking about the debates. 'I think actually we ought to be ... getting out of Westminster, getting out of the TV studios ... talking to people on the campaign trail.' But deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman said there should be a legal framework underpinning the TV debates as there is in relation to pre-election broadcasts and election spending. She told Sky News' Murnaghan: 'I think the debates are an important part of our democracy, in which case let's not have the prime minister of the day ducking and weaving because he is afraid of actually justifying his record. 'Let's have a legal framework set out and then we won't have this all over again next time round. 'The bottom line is - it is not too late for David Cameron to actually say ... I think if somebody is saying I want to be prime minister, I want to be in Number 10 Downing Street, but by the way I'm not going to go out there and debate it, it's not acceptable. 'He should have the guts to go out there and say, this is what I have done since I have been prime minister and this is what I want to do next. 'The fact he won't do that shows that he is not prepared to justify what he has done over the last few years. 'All he seems to be doing is talking up other parties in fact. 'Our democracy is important, more important than any one particular party. It is about people in this country being able to see what they are voting for. 'Millions of people, more women than men, but lots of men as well, don't vote because they don't think politicians are straight with them, they are not prepared to level with them and I'm afraid the prime minister is proving himself a classic example of that.'","Broadcasters have insisted they will push ahead with three debates .

Frustrated, Miss Jerome took her appeal to social media to ask for help in finding the car. And Samantha Taylor, 30, responded after recognising the car and the area it was parked from the description provided. Miss Jerome said she was embarrassed by the fuss but touched by the warm response she had received. Samantha Taylor, from Bredbury, contacted Miss Jerome after recognising the car from the description online . She said: 'I feel so stupid but am really happy to find it, it was such a worry. 'I have to say thanks to Samantha, she had seen the story on the internet. 'She recognised where it was and talked me through how to get there on the phone. I had no idea where it was. Fallon Jerome recieved hundreds of sympathetic responses after appealing for help on social media . 'In future I will take a picture of where I am parked and write the name of the street down.' Miss Taylor, from Bredbury, said she was glad to be able to help the stranded visitor, adding: 'Being from Stockport I know the area and knew where the car was. 'I saw the story on Facebook so sent Fallon a message and talked her through where to go.' Hundreds responded online to Miss Jerome’s plight, expressing sympathy and sharing their own stories of lost keys and missing vehicles. After losing her car, Miss Jerome had said: 'I'm not bothered about looking daft because I know I was and I just want my car back. 'I'm upset and I've been crying, I'm just frustrated I let myself do that. 'I rang the council and was told it hasn't been towed away. 'It was on a residential street that may have been a cul-de-sac and there was a walkway nearby. 'I'm hoping someone will see it and let me know as I just can't find where it is.' Since sharing her plight online the carer has been reunited with the car. Thanking those who came forward for their help she wrote on Facebook: 'This girl can't help it. 'Thank you... for helping. Stupid, won't do that again.' 'Found it.. blond moment! (sic)' she added. The 21-year-old care worker appealed for help online after misplacing her new car days after buying it .","Fallon Jerome lost her car after parking it in Stockport for a job interview .

"A little boy who has been battling an aggressive form of leukaemia has realised his dream of becoming a policeman for the day - thanks to China's version of Whatsapp. Liu Zixi, eight, was diagnosed with the deadly disease in July last year, and has since endured nine rounds of painful chemotherapy. But the little boy has kept his spirits up through three near-death experiences by dreaming of becoming a policeman one day so he can 'catch thieves and arrest baddies', the People's Daily Online reported. He even begged his father: 'I may die soon, but I am not afraid. Help me realise my dream.' Dream: Eight-year-old Liu Zixi dreams of becoming a police officer and 'catching thieves' when he grows up . Determination: But after he was diagnosed with leukaemia, he begged his father to make it happen sooner . Touching: The police commander heard of his wish after word spread through the Chinese WhatsApp . So father Liu Xiaodong decided to make the youngster's dream come true, and began to spread word of his son's plight through WeChat - the Chinese WhatsApp. The story touched the hearts of many in Jilin City, where the family live, and then with thousands across the country. A total of 12,000 yuan (about £1,307) was donated by well-wishers, and Zixi even got a visit from China's National Women's Speed Skating team members. But then the tale reached the ears of Jilin Public Security Bureau commander Fu Zhangkun. 'We are all very moved by his dream of becoming a police officer,' he said. 'It has become a responsibility for us to realise for him.' So the officers and Zixi's 38-year-old father worked together to surprise the little boy - and make his dream a reality. Surprise: The officers worked with Zixi's parents on a treat for the boy, who is currently in hospital . Perfect: They had a special uniform made, and created an honorary role for the little boy . Delight: After a special ceremony, Zixi was put in charge of 'protecting the harmony of the hospital' On Monday, Zixi was visited by a policewoman in his room in the Paediatic Hematology Department of the Number 1 Hospital. She then unveiled a uniform, which had been specially made for Zixi, who was about to become the youngest police officer in Jilin. Zixi was then awarded the title of 'honorary police officer' in a simple ceremony - before Commander Fu sent him off to fulfill his duties 'protecting the harmony of the hospital'. The entire experience has left Zixi delighted. 'I am very happy, I didn't know what I had to do but I have realised my dream,' he said, vowing: 'When I have recovered I will catch thieves.' Future: Zixi is still dreaming of becoming a policeman - saying when he recovers he 'will catch thieves'","Liu Zixi, eight, was diagnosed with leukaemia in July of last year .

"An estimated one in five people will suffer with depression in their lifetime. But scientists have now found that Macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans, such as shying away from a group, losing their appetite and adopting a hunched posture. By studying creatures in a social situation, they hope to learn more about why humans may become depressed, which could improve treatment for the debilitating mental disorder. Scientists have found that Macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans, such as shying away from a group (shown in E) and adopting a hunched posture (shown at A, B, D and E). Image C suggests bullying from dominant monkeys (marked in the pictures with red arrows) in the form of a cut to the monkey's ear. Intimidating behaviour (B and D) may explain the monkeys' depression . Previous studies have used rodents, which 'do not realistically resemble the etiopathological [causal] development of depression, which occurs naturally in a social context,’ according to the study, published in Nature. Researchers at Chongqing Medical University, China, and Wake Forest University in North Carolina, examined depression in cynomolgus macaque monkeys living in social colonies at Zhongke Experimental Animal Co. in Suzhou, eastern China. The cause of depression in some cases, appears to be down to bullying behaviour by dominant members of the colonies, such as intimidating and even attacking lower status monkeys. Each colony was made up of two males and approximately 20 females as well as their offspring, reflecting how they would live in the wild. Twenty females showing symptoms of depression, such as no interest in food, grooming or mating. Dominant behaviour is marked with red arrows, above and depressed monkeys with blue arrows. Feeding: The depressed monkeys spent less time eating and drinking than their healthy peers. Behaviour: They spent less time resting on elevated perches such as shelves and hanging chains, which are favourites with healthier and more dominant monkeys. Movement: Depressed subjects spent more time sitting on the floor and less time walking around. Grooming: The sad monkeys spent less time grooming each other and being groomed, which is a sign of sociability in healthy monkeys. They also spent less time taking care of themselves, by scratching, for example. Nursing: They also nursed their infants less than healthy monkeys. A total of 52 colonies were observed and 1,007 female monkeys screened for depression, Real Clear Science reported. Twenty females showing symptoms of depression, such as no interest in food, grooming or mating, were chosen and compared to 20 ‘happy’ monkeys and 10 that had been kept in isolation and were also thought to be depressed. The researchers found that the naturally depressed and isolated monkeys behaved in a similar way, such as ‘stereotypical prostrated and socially unresponsive posture as well as exacerbation of socially submissive behaviours,’ the study said. Naturally depressed monkeys  displayed a slumped posture, less interest in feeding and sex and diminished communication and reciprocal grooming with others. 'One to two subjects per stable social colony (17–22 subjects) manifested a depressive phenotype that may be attributed to psychosocial stress,’ the study said. The authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops than humans (illustrated with a stock image) than rodent models . As well as behavioural changes, they also identified metabolic differences between depressed and healthy monkeys, which has also been witnessed in humans. The healthy monkeys spent longer feeding and drinking compared to their depressed peers who were not as interested in eating, for example. The authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops in humans than rodent models. ‘This model's stable depression phenotype demonstrates superior validity to traditional rodent models of depression by better approximating the psychosocial stressors encountered by adult humans living in a resource-based competitive society and can aid further investigation into the mechanisms underlying depression,’ they wrote.","Experts from universities in China and North Carolina studied monkeys .

"For most people a ten kilometre run would be enough of a challenge whatever the conditions, but not this lot. Wading neck deep through thick brown gloop, these intrepid athletes were clearly relishing the challenge of one the World's muddiest running races - the annual 10K Muddy Trials.

Two mud-coated contestants clearly enjoy the conditions as they take part in the event which attracts runners from all over Britain . Described by the organisers as 'very, very muddy', the course takes in almost impenetrable ditches and gruelling trails through thick forest and unforgving bog. Racers must first cross fields and make their way through dense woodland after which they ford several streams before plunging waist deep through dark gooey ditches and dragging the,selves towards the finish line. Conditions are so bad that before they set off, runners are advised to tape their shoes to their feet with industrial-strength gaffer tape to stop them getting stuck and coming off in the mud.

"Homeowners with properties worth up to £1million will be able to pass them on to their children tax-free under plans drawn up by George Osborne, it was claimed last night. The Chancellor’s proposal is expected to become a key part of the Tory manifesto, but will not be included in tomorrow’s Budget after it was blocked by the Liberal Democrats. Plans to raise the inheritance threshold to £1million were included in the party’s manifesto at the last election, but were vetoed as part of the Coalition deal in 2010. Scroll down for video . Passing on properties: The tax break would mean just over 20,000 fewer estates would annually have any inheritance liability. A file photo of a road in Wandsworth, south-west London, is pictured . According to Treasury papers leaked to The Guardian, the proposed measures would also reduce the inheritance tax bill on properties worth up to £2million by £140,000. The tax break, which would mean just over 20,000 fewer estates would annually have any inheritance liability, is expected to cost nearly £1billion. In the papers, the officials note that the move ‘will generally be very popular with the public and in the media. It will allow you to say you are exempting those with modest homes from inheritance tax (with up to £1million of assets) exempted in certain circumstances.’ The document, prepared for Treasury financial secretary David Gauke, added: ‘You have indicated a desire to reduce the burden of inheritance tax. ‘Having considered the cost of a substantial increase in the existing nil rate band, you and the Chancellor have indicated you would like instead to introduce a more targeted measure to allow the family home to be passed onto the children of deceased without it leading to an inheritance tax liability. ‘This reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house particularly in London and the South East paying inheritance tax.’ Chancellor: George Osborne’s proposal is expected to become a key part of the Tory manifesto, but will not be included in tomorrow’s Budget after it was blocked by the Lib Dems (file picture of Mr Osborne in 2014) A senior Tory source blamed the leak of ‘old advice’ on the Lib Dems, adding: ‘They are desperate. There is nothing in the Budget on inheritance tax, which we have said repeatedly is an election issue.’ Another senior Conservative added: ‘Usually at this time we get leaks of what’s in the Budget. This is a leak of what’s not in the Budget.’ It is thought that the Lib Dems leaked the papers ahead of the Budget in a bid to paint to Tories as the party of the rich. The number of people who own a home worth more than £1million has risen dramatically, up 50 per cent since before the financial crash. A survey by property website Zoopla last year predicted that there would be 500,000 people owning a seven-figure property by 2015. While most are in London, there have been big rises in the south east and the south west, with smaller increases in Wales and Yorkshire.","Chancellor's proposal expected to become key part of Tory manifesto .

"One chef is giving a new meaning to pot roasts by creating a range of cannabis-infused dishes. Mary Jean Dunsdon, who hosts cookery show, Baking A Fool Of Myself has made a name for herself online for her sultry Nigella-Lawson style delivery and presentation.

'There is still a stereotype of marijuana smokers as a dumb surfer guy or a gangster but it's just not the case any more,' she said. 'The marijuana market is growing rapidly, I think its going to be the new money. 'Marijuana is the new medicine, it's the new recreation, it's the new booze, marijuana is already a massive market. 'Marijuana is the hero that's coming to save the day. 'It's coming to save nana from morphine and shrinking cancerous tumours.' Watermelon has been at the forefront of campaigns to legalise recreational marijuana in Vancouver, Canada - which has 61 medicinal marijuana dispensaries. She has her own online cooking show Baking A Fool of Myself where she demonstrates her recipes . Smoking hot: The 35-year old believes that 'marijuana is the hero that's coming to save the day' Watermelon launched her show on YouTube in 2002 and currently has over 5,000 subscribers who watch her cook and bake with marijuana . The plant's use became legal in Canada in 2000, allowing users to grow the plant for medically approved use only. The current law requires that patients buy their marijuana from producers approved by the federal government. Since launching her show on YouTube, in 2002, Watermelon has been attracting attention from all over the world and currently has over 5,000 subscribers. She said: 'People have responded so well to the show. The first question is what blender do I use, the second is usually, ""will you marry me?"". 'I started smoking pot in my 20s and got involved in baking when I moved back from from New York. 'My friend had a bag of marijuana in the basement and I decided to bake up a batch of pot cookies.

Chef Watermelon poses with one of her creations, oven-baked potato with cheese and marijuana . Smoking hot: For Watermelon, mainstream acceptance has been a long road . 'I see the marijuana industry going super mainstream.' Watermelon's mother, Mary Elizabeth Dunsdon, 72, taught her how to bake and  assists her daughter in the kitchen. Mary Elizabeth said: 'I grew up in the 1940s, 50s and 60s and to me, only gangsters did anything with drugs. 'When Watermelon started baking with marijuana I went out and bought a big fat book on cannabis so I could understand it better and feel comfortable helping her. 'She educated me about how to use it and I saw that it's not about going out and getting stoned.' However, for Watermelon, mainstream acceptance has been a long road. She said: 'Back when I started out with the show everybody was like wow, that's really sweet, but totally inappropriate for television. 'We were ahead of our time and have just been waiting for the world to catch up.' Watermelon,who has drawn comparisons with Nigella Lawson's provocative approach to cooking, sells her baked goods to ten legal marijuana dispensaries in Vancouver.

"The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race started on Saturday with a ceremonial run through Anchorage despite the lack of snow which has forced the organizers to move the competitive start of the race to Monday in Fairbanks. A stalled jet stream has pushed Arctic air and snow into the Midwest and the East Coast, but kept Alaska fairly warm and dry this winter. But the ceremonial start, a chance for fans and mushers to meet in a casual atmosphere, went on as planned in Alaska's largest city. The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race started on Saturday with a ceremonial run through Anchorage despite the lack of snow that has forced organizers to move the start of the race to Monday . A stalled jet stream has pushed Arctic air and snow into the Midwest and the East Coast, but kept Alaska fairly warm and dry this winter . Despite the city receiving only about a third of its normal winter snowfall, Anchorage was still able to stage the traditional ceremonial start to the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. City crews overnight delivered up to 350 dump truck loads of snow and spread it out over city blocks so the show could go on. The festivities started on Saturday morning in very un-Iditarod like conditions, almost 40 degrees with a light rain falling before the start. City maintenance workers stockpiled snow from neighborhoods the past few months and kept it for winter events, culminating with the Iditarod, said Paul VanLandingham with the public works department. This event is designed for fans who can't be on the rugged thousand-mile trail stretching from Fairbanks to Nome. Mushers took off from the start line along Anchorage's Fourth Avenue every two minutes. Fans lined the streets and cheered on the mushers and their Iditariders, who are people who have won auctions to be in the sled. The route covered 19 city blocks before it met up with the city's trail system and ends in East Anchorage. It's a very relaxed atmosphere before the start. Fans arrive early on Saturday morning to mingle with the mushers and pet one of the estimated thousand dogs that will be in the race. The ceremonial start to the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Saturday was a chance for fans and mushers to meet in a casual atmosphere . City crews overnight delivered up to 350 dump truck loads of snow and spread it out over city blocks so the show could go on Saturday . Dan and Kathie Taylor of Akron, Ohio, made their second trip to Alaska after falling in love with the state during an earlier summertime visit. They were surprised how the city prepared. 'I didn't know that they would bring in snow for this,' Kathie said. 'We were wondering what would happen today.' Kathie said she was struck by the 'mushers and just their knowledge, and how they love their dogs unconditionally,' she said. 'And how open they are to talk to everybody,' Dan added. DeeDee Jonrowe, a musher who is a fan favorite, is in her 33rd Iditarod. She spent most of the morning signing autographs, posing for photos and greeting fans like they were long-lost friends. 'It's an opportunity to show people the dogs I raise, and the quality of the dogs I raise,' she said. 'I like that we have a day that we can give back.' Musher Justin Savidis, of Willow, Alaska, pets one of his lead dogs, Twig, a 7-year-old female, before the ceremonial start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Anchorage, Alaska, on Saturday . Musher Justin Savidis of Willow said the start is an opportunity to let the dogs shine in the spotlight and let them have some fun. 'You know, if you're not having fun doing this, there's no reason to do it,' he said. In a somber development, KTUU reported that a sled dog was killed by a car. Handler Linda Clarke told the Anchorage station that said the 3-year-old husky was part of her husband Lachlan Clarke's team for the Iditarod. She said that the animal was waiting near the end of Saturday's ceremonial route when it got free, ran off, and was later hit on Seward Highway. Once the event ends, fans and mushers, with their dogs in tow, will drive about eight hours north to Fairbanks. On Monday, the atmosphere changes as mushers will become all about business for the start of the competitive race. Fans lined the streets and cheered on the mushers and their Iditariders, who are people who have won auctions to be in the sled . This year's Iditarod includes 78 mushers, including six former champions and 20 rookies. The winner will receive a bigger purse, $70,000, which is $19,600 more than what defending champion Dallas Seavey received last year. The new route will remove the hazards of the Alaska Range, including the infamous Dalzell Gorge, where many mushers crashed last year trying to control dog teams moving at breakneck speeds over barren, gravelly trails. The change will put mushers on river ice for about 600 miles, which could create new problems along the unfamiliar route. The winner is expected under the burled arch in Nome, a Bering Sea coastal town, in about 10 days. It's the second time Fairbanks has hosted the official start of the race; similar low-snow conditions in 2003 also forced the start north.","Race started on Saturday with a ceremonial run through Anchorage despite the lack of snow .

"A record has been set for the most snowfall in a day after a tiny Italian village was dumped with 100 inches in 18 hours - forcing residents to ski between houses and climb out of second-floor windows. The village of Capracotta, located in central Italy around 125 miles east of Rome, was hit with the polar blast on March 5 in a remarkable blizzard aggravated by powerful wind gusts. Breaking a 1921 record set in Silver Lake, Colorado, of 76 inches, incredible photos from inside the village show walls of snow carved out from the fronts of doors and shops. Scroll down for video . A man standing in the snow shakes hands with another resident standing at her second-floor window . A resident of Capracotta attempts to dig his way through the record-breaking snowfall . The small village, located east of Rome, received more than 100 inches of snow within 18 hours . The buildup of snow was so fast and furious many residents had to dig their way out of their homes . The clear sky and white snow gave off an eerie blue effect in the village when night fell . Snow remained clinging to the balconies and ledges of buildings following the 18 hour-long blizzard . The snowfall set a world record for the most snow to fall within a single day . Antonio Monaco, the village's mayor, told Italian news agency Ansa: 'It was a spectacle that took our breath away. In some parts of the village the snow was like a long, white wall. 'It was tough but everybody pulled together and made sure that the old people who couldn't leave their houses had the food and medicines that they needed,' The Telegraph reported. According to weather website Meteoweb, it was just one more record in a 'historic winter for Southern Italy, with numerous incidents of frost and snow'. Pictures taken of the village show residents digging through snow that is metres deep and shaking hands from inside the second floor of homes with others standing on the snow piled up outside windows. Remarkably, the town is not located within the Alps - its susceptibility to massive dumpings of snow lies in its unique geography and location. Sitting at an altitude of 1,421metres, it is the second-highest district in southern Italy. It is also close to the sea and sits exposed to cold fronts from the northeast, making it one of the snowiest areas of the world when measured in terms of abundance over short periods of time.

"Seven people have been left injured after a chair lift at a Maine ski resort malfunctioned and started traveling down the mountain backward, prompting riders to jump off, officials said on Saturday. Three people were taken to hospital after the King Pine lift, carrying around 230 people, began operating in reverse at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort in Carrabassett Valley on Saturday morning. However, none are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, resort spokesman Ethan Austin said. Riders who were still on-board when the lift eventually stopped were  evacuated. On Saturday afternoon, David Segre, who was standing in the crowded lift line, described the terrifying moment the machine started traveling backward, picking up speed by the second. Scroll down for video . Wounded: Seven people (some of whom are pictured above) have been left injured after a chair lift at a Maine ski resort malfunctioned and started traveling down the mountain backward, prompting riders to jump off . Evacuation: Three people were taken to hospital after the King Pine lift began operating in reverse at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort in Carrabassett Valley on Saturday. Above, a skier is evacuated from the lift after it stopped . Team effort: None of the seven  are thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries, a resort spokesman said . 'It was really scary. It was like a gear had let loose and it was slowly picking up speed going the wrong way. So all the chairs... they were slipping backward,' said the 42-year-old skier. 'And as gravity works they started to go faster and faster and people were jumping off at the lower levels,' he added, estimating that the lift traveled backward for up to 300 yards before stopping. Susan Haws Clifford, who was on the lift with her daughter, told WMTW News 8 that it 'started heading backwards really fast', adding: 'We were able to unbind our skis and jump off uninjured.' But while some skiers close to the ground leaped off the lift, one man who was not able to ended up going around the loading area and heading up the mountain on the other side, Segre said.

It is unclear whether the injured riders jumped off the lift, or fell off due to its erratic movements. The seven were treated by ski patrol and taken off the mountain for treatment by an emergency medical responder, Austin said. Three of the riders were later transferred to a nearby hospital. Segre told AP it looked like three or four people were being tended to in the loading area of the lift, adding: 'I think everybody was being very careful not to move them until ski patrol arrived.' On Saturday afternoon, photos and videos emerged on social media showing terrified riders, who were stranded meters high up in the air, being evacuated from the malfunctioning lift via ropes.

Famous: The U.S. Alpine Championships are due to take place at the famous ski resort (pictured) in a few days . Officials have said the cause of the accident is under investigation. The chairlift, which can transport 2,100 skiers an hour on 122 chairs, receives routine daily inspections for safety, Austin said. It remains closed in the wake of the incident, according to ABC 9. Sugarloaf was the site of another chairlift accident in 2010 in which a 35-year-old lift derailed, causing five chairs to fall to the ground, injuring eight skiers. That lift was replaced in 2011. The latest incident comes just days before the U.S. Alpine Championships are scheduled to take place at the world-famous ski resort. It will be the fifth time Sugarloaf has hosted the event.","Chair lift at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort malfunctioned Saturday morning .

"Compelling: This picture, taken minutes after MH17 blew up, 'shows a BUK rocket trail' An image of a vapour trail taken minutes after a passenger jet crashed in Ukraine has been hailed as proof it was shot down by a Russian missile. Official investigators believe the picture, first published by The Mail on Sunday last year, holds the key to the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which was blown apart in mid-air, killing all 298 on board. Afterwards, Ukraine and Russia blamed each other, and still do, and the incident fuelled an increasingly bloody civil war which has seen large parts of Eastern Ukraine taken over by military forces loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Dutch and Australian investigators now believe the image represents evidence that the Malaysian Boeing was hit by a Russian-made BUK rocket. They travelled to Ukraine to interview the photographer who took the picture from the roof of his block of flats in Torez, some 12 miles from the site where the missile was launched, and took away the camera as evidence. They believe the image and others taken by the photographer offer clear evidence of the BUK missile attack from a position on the edge of the town of Snizhne in pro-Russian rebel-held eastern Ukraine. Amid fears for his safety he was relocated to a safe house and has been under the protection of Ukraine’s secret service ever since. Analysis by investigators has found the picture was taken at 16.25.48 seconds on July 17. The plane’s data records stopped functioning – as a result of a catastrophic explosion, it is thought – at 16.21.28. Scroll down for video . The dispersing vapour is, according to experts, consistent with a BUK missile, which hurtled towards its target at 1,900mph, having been fired four minutes earlier. The photographer was questioned in detail by investigators about the time and location of his pictures. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I was in my flat in a suburb of Torez, and heard a loud noise – far louder than artillery or grenades. ‘I ran to the window and saw how the wind was spreading the smoke trail above the horizon. Defenceless: All 298 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which was blown apart in mid-air on July 17, last year, were killed . ‘My camera was near the window. I grabbed it and ran upstairs to the roof to take a picture. I took my first picture but saw I had electric cables right in the middle, so then maximized the zoom and took the second. 'Then I turned round and on the other side, to the north, saw a trail of dark blue smoke. I decided that the missile must have hit a petrol station. I climbed to another other part of the roof to take a picture from there. 'It took me three minutes, and I took the third picture. I had no idea that my third picture was the smoke from the just crashed plane. ‘I did not see any plane. So I did not take any more pictures. If only I had known more about what happened then of course I would have taken more. But it was only two hours later when I found out.’ He immediately sent the pictures to a friend, who posted them on Twitter. This fact is seen as decisive because it allowed no time for manipulation of the image. At the time, fake pictures were appearing on the web. Among the dead: Evie, Mo, and Otis Maslin were on board flight MH17 with their grandfather Nick when it was shot down . Leaks from the Dutch probe indicate that investigators believe it likely the BUK was fired not by rebels but by Russian soldiers. These troops ‘might have changed their identities or even been executed by Russian secret service in order to hide everything’, according to Robert Bas, a journalist with Dutch state broadcaster NOS, citing anonymous sources in the investigation. Last week a reporter with RTL, another broadcaster in the Netherlands, said shrapnel he collected from the crash site was tested by forensic experts, including defence analysts IHS Jane’s in London, who said it matched the explosive charge of a BUK. A fragment from the warhead showed a Cyrillic letter, apparently part of a serial number. The combined weight of evidence undermines claims from Russia that the plane was downed by a Ukrainian warplane. In the past there have been claims from Moscow that MH17 was shot down by a Ukrainian air force Sukhoi Su-25. Lethal: A BUK missile system on display during a Russian air show. Investigators say the image and others taken by the photographer offer clear evidence of the BUK missile attack . But Vladimir Babak – the Su-25’s chief designer – disputed this in an intervention that was acutely embarrassing to Moscow. ‘The Su-25 could attack a Boeing at a height of three or four thousand metres, but it cannot shoot down a plane flying at an altitude of 10,500 metres,’ said Babak, president of the company which designs Sukhoi attack aircraft. ‘Our team designed this plane so that it can be used only at low and medium altitudes.’ The Kiev-born aviation expert insisted: ‘I believe that all allegations of the Su-25 involvement in the tragedy are an attempt to cover tracks.’","Photographer took image just after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 crashed .

"The father of an 11-year-old girl who was allegedly the victim of online grooming filmed himself beating the man responsible before killing him in a gory video. The unidentified man, who was 23, was said to have harassed the girl for several months. It is believed he sent pictures to her via Whatsapp and arranged to meet her in the state of Goias, Brazil. Scroll down for video . The father of an 11-year-old girl who was allegedly the victim of online grooming filmed himself beating the man responsible before killing him in a gory video . But he had not realised he had actually been talking to the young girl's father. When he arrived for the supposed meeting, the man badly beat him and filmed it before killing him. A gory video of the attack has been posted online by the girl's father, as a 'warning that those who do wrong, have to pay for it', he said. In it the man can be seen bleeding heavily from a gaping wound around his mouth. In the video an angry exchange can be heard, with the alleged attacker swearing that he will never again try to contact the young girl. He can barely speak as he begs for mercy and appears to be being held up by the neck by the older man. Asked by the girl's father the man, with a swollen lip and face, pleads in Portuguese: 'Never again, never again, never again.' The father is said to reply:  'You will learn from this beating that you will now take you b*****d.' The camera is then taken off the alleged predator's face. He is heard screaming before it cuts out. It comes days after an angry Indian mob broke into a Dimapur prison to kidnap alleged rapist Syed Faird Khan. He was stripped naked and paraded through the streets before being hung by a clock tower . Khan's brother, Syed Jamal Khan, said he was innocent and accused police of trying to falsely implicated him of rape . The young man's body was found three days later in the middle of the thicket where the beating took place, LiveLeak.com reports. Last year a man jailed for the rape and killing of his one-year-old son was reportedly viciously attacked by inmates at a Brazilian prison after turning himself in. Reports claimed Daryell Dickson Meneses Xavier was stabbed in the back by fellow convicts and raped repeatedly after details of his crimes spread through the prison in Taguatinga. Elsewhere an Indian mob broke into a prison where a suspected rapist was being held to break him out for a public lynching this week. Syed Faird Khan was beaten to death and hung from a clock tower in Nagaland state after being put in a cell accused of attacking a 19-year-old student in February. It came after thousands were outraged by the blocking of a film about the high-profile gang rape of a student on a bus in the country in 2012.","The unidentified man, who was 23, harassed the girl for several months .

"The heartbroken parents of a beautiful four-week-old baby boy who died due to complications arising from whooping cough have urged other parents to get themselves and their children immunised against the deadly disease. Greg and Catherine Hughes, from Perth, have set up a Facebook page to honour their son Riley Hughes after he ‘passed away peacefully in the arms of his mummy and daddy’ at 2pm on March 17, aged just 32 days. ‘Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,’ Riley’s dad Greg wrote on the Facebook page Light for Riley. The newborn, born on February 13, died in Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital as a result of pneumonia-based complications arising from whooping cough. Two days before his death, his mother Catherine posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough. Scroll down for video . Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital . ‘If you haven't been immunised against whooping cough (pertussis) please consider getting it done. Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle with it at PMH please keep him in your thoughts!,’ she wrote. 'If you're anti-immunisation/anti-logic/anti-duty of care to your society as a whole, then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing,' Greg added. On March 17 Catherine then posted the tragic news that Riley had died. ‘We are devastated to let everyone know our gorgeous sweet month-old son Riley John Hughes lost his battle with whooping cough at Princess Margaret Hospital earlier today,’ she wrote. ‘He passed away peacefully in our arms after a tough fight. The staff at PMH were amazing and did everything they could to save his little life but the whooping cough was too severe. RIP Riley. Forever in our hearts.’ His mother Catherine Hughes posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for doing 'everything they could to save his little life' 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle,' Catherine Hughes wrote as she urged people to get themselves immunised . Riley’s father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’. Greg wrote that Riley was ‘cruelly cut down before his life had an opportunity to start’. Riley’s father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’ ‘I'm an absolute shell of a man without my baby boy and I'm truly not sure how I'll cope,’ he said as he honoured ‘the short but enormous legacy this little man has left behind’. The Facebook page Greg and Catherine have set up already has over 25,000 likes. Greg wrote that the family’s long-term goal is to ‘be the drivers of change within this country surrounding the treatment, management and long term eradication of this horrific disease. We invite you to share this page with anyone and everyone.’ Catherine told Mamamia that her whole family is immunised and that they had also asked their friends and families to have boosters. The Department of Health says it does not know how the child contracted the respiratory disease, also known as pertussis. Whooping cough is part of the routine vaccination schedule for babies at two months, four months and six months of age. Booster doses are given at 4 years and 10-15 years. Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. 'It's important to listen to the experts,' Mr Senanayake said. 'Whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough, it's a nasty infection.' Whooping cough (also known as ‘pertussis’) is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The government health website says the disease is 'highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months'. Babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine (minimum 4 months old) as the mother’s antibodies do not provide reliable protection. It’s very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do, it’s usually not as serious. Symptoms . The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive ‘whooping’ noise, which is how the condition gets its name. The early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include: . These early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks, before becoming more severe. The second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing. Each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes. Infants younger than six months may not make the ‘whoop’ sound after coughing, but they may start gagging or gasping, and may temporarily stop breathing. Information supplied by HealthDirect.gov.au . The devastated parents have set up a Facebook page that already has over 25,000 likes . According to the department's notifiable disease report, there have been 244 cases of whooping cough in WA in the year to date, compared to 292 cases for the corresponding period last year and 232 cases in the first 10 weeks of 2013. Data recorded on immunisation rates across Australia on the Department of Health's website shows, in 2012, WA had the lowest vaccination rates for whooping cough and for immunisation overall. In WA 91 per cent of children were immunised against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis by 12 months of age and 90.2 per cent were fully immunised. In 2013, the Department of Health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program, 'pertussis remains highly prevalent in Australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases'. 'Epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years. In unvaccinated populations, these outbreaks can be very large. In vaccinated populations, outbreaks are smaller, with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity, and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced,' the report said.","Riley Hughes died in a Perth hospital at just 32 days old on March 17 .

"More than £150,000 of taxpayers’ money has been spent on four traffic-blocking bollards - that cars can drive around. Councillors installed the new rising posts in Gloucester in a bid to promote a ‘cafe culture’, but they have already impaled a police car and been blamed for a downturn in trade by shopkeepers. The posts, which operate between 10am and 5pm every day, have been installed in the city centre on four ‘gate’ streets to keep vehicles out of the pedestrian area. Problematic: Councillors installed the new rising posts in Gloucester in a bid to promote a 'cafe culture' - but they have already impaled a police car and been blamed for a downturn in trade by shopkeepers . But city councillor Sebastian Field said he saw a car getting past one of the bollards, telling a meeting: ‘It was going at quite a speed and it wasn’t too tight. This needs to be sorted out.’ Traders have also voiced concerns about emergency vehicles being delayed by the bollards - which have been jointly funded at a cost of £157,000 by the local city and county councils. Up and down: Traders have voiced concerns about emergency vehicles being delayed by the bollards . And last week a police car entering the zone in pursuit of a shoplifter was impaled on one of the bollards, which suddenly rose up beneath it. City council leader Paul James admitted there were ‘teething problems’ with the system, but claimed it would bring value in the long term. He added: ‘I imagine it must have been pretty tight for any car to pass through but we must report it to highways to address the issue. Of course we want the system to work properly.’ Vernon Smith, cabinet member for highways and floods at the county council, said that planters either side of the bollards would be moved to reduce the gap. ‘It’s been illegal since the Nineties to drive on the gate streets between 10am and 5pm, and the police can enforce against any vehicles which are there when they shouldn’t be.’ The bollards, which began working on March 2, were installed following pedestrian safety concerns.","Councillors installed rising posts in Gloucester to promote 'cafe culture'

"Tuberculosis has spread through a Kansas high school after a single case of the disease was discovered. Some 27 people have tested positive for latent TB infection at the school in eastern Kansas. State and county health officials made the announcement on Wednesday after tests were conducted on more than 300 Olathe Northwest High  students and staff who came into contact with a student with TB disease. Officials called people who tested positive on Monday and those with no sign of infection were to receive letters in the mail. One student with TB at Olathe Northwest High School has led to 27 cases of the infection in eastern Kansas among fellow students and staff . According to the Johnson County Department of Heath and Environment, those with TB infection were not contagious, do not feel sick and do not have symptoms. People with TB disease can spread the bacteria to others, feel sick and have symptoms including fever, night sweats, cough and weight loss. Causes: Tuberculosis is spread from person to person through the air, when someone infected coughs, sneezes, laughs or sings. A person who breathes in the bacteria can become infected. Symptoms: General symptoms may include feeling weak or sick, weight loss, fever and/or night sweats. Symptoms of TB of the lungs may include coughing, chest pain and/or coughing up blood. Treatment: More than 13,000 cases are reported in the U.S. each year. There are also an estimated 10 to 15 million people in the U.S. who are infected with the TB germ, with potential to develop TB disease in the future. If a person gets a TB skin test and it comes back positive, they must take a variety of antibiotics daily for as long as six months. Director of the health department, Lougene Marsh, said: 'The number of individuals with TB infection does not exceed what we would anticipate in this setting.' Tuberculosis can be spread by coughing and sneezing. People with the disease were most likely to spread it to others with whom they have prolonged contact. According to the CDC, TB is caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis which attacks the lungs but can also infect the kidneys, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, the disease can be fatal. The Department of Heath and Environment said those who tested positive for TB will have a chest x-ray and begin a course of antibiotics to kill the TB bacteria. In May, those who were in the same class as the student with TB disease will be given another round of blood tests as it can sometimes take eight weeks for the bacteria to show itself. A total of 9,582 TB disease cases were reported in the U.S. in 2013 - compared to 84,304 cases when the CDC began records in 1953. The same year, 9 million people around the world became sick with TB disease, leading to 1.5 million deaths.

In safe hands: A chimpanzee who was allegedly left isolated in a 'hell hole' for years has finally found romance after being rescued and re-homed . Perfect match: Keepers at the 150-acre Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Florida, say it was 'love at first sight' when 32-year-old Iris clapped eyes on 40-year-old Abdul last month . In March 2015 Iris was retrieved from a roadside zoo in Georgia following an undercover PETA investigation. She had reportedly been kept alone in a 'tiny, barren, and dark cell' for three years. With virtually nothing to do, she allegedly resorted to smearing her own feces on the walls of her enclosure and spent most of her time huddled under a dirty blanket. She was also pale, overweight and her legs were underdeveloped because of a lack of opportunity to exercise. The look of love: Apparently Iris and Abdul have been inseparable and heartwarming footage shows the pair lovingly kissing each other . After being transferred to the Save the Chimps facility, Iris was given immediate treatment. A few days later, when vets had given her the all-clear, she was introduced to her next-door neighbor, Abdul. Recalling the couple's first meeting, a spokesperson from Save the Chimps said: 'She kissed him and he groomed her.' Over the coming weeks Iris will be introduced to more chimpanzees as she gains confidence. Save the Chimps is currently home to more than 250 rescued chimpanzees. Some were in labs, some were in roadside zoos, and some had been neglected, abused or traumatized for years.

"A 35-year-old man who lost 500 pounds must now wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin and says he is still trapped inside his 'own fat suit.' Thomas Towle III, from Gardiner, Maine, admits he suffered an addiction to eating and only took stock when his doctor told him he faced an early death if he did not lose weight. After being a big child, he became even more overweight when he was a teenager and Towle was forced to drop out of high school when he became too embarrassed of his size, reports the Press Herald. Thomas Towle III, from Portland, (seen on right with a friend) lost 500 pounds, but must now wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin . Towle admits he suffered an addiction to eating and only took stock when his doctor told him he faced an early death if he did not lose weight . 'I did an amazing job, I think, of putting a great face on, letting no one know how much being that heavy bothered me,' he said. At one point he weighed almost 800lbs. 'I made jokes at myself to survive. If someone was making fun of me, I made fun of myself harder. That way your jokes didn't hurt me, or at least you thought they didn't hurt me. Inside, it was a totally different story. It crushed me inside.' Towle tried several diets which all worked but as soon as he pulled back, he put the weight on again. He eventually began to lose weight when he got a job at McDonald's and he left the house and moved around more. He said that although he suffered pain in his joints from the excess weight they supported, he was able to sit down on a stool and serve customers. Towle and a friend fit now fit into the shirt he used to wear before he lost weight . He now weighs about 270 pounds, and is nearing his goal of getting below 250 pounds . 'I learned to work at McDonald's, and I lost weight,' he said. 'I was actually getting out of the house. Even though I might not have been standing up and doing exercise, I think the motion, the actual getting out, was a big first step in losing some of that weight.' He lost about 200 pounds through an improved diet and additional exercise, bringing him down to 600 pounds. Eventually Towle decided to have weight-loss surgery, although he had to lose another 50 pounds to be a safe weight to have the operation. In June 2011, Towle underwent gastric bypass surgery and a portion of his stomach was used to create a second smaller stomach. Towle can no longer eat some of his favorite foods as a result because they can make him vomit. He now weighs about 270 pounds, and is nearing his goal of getting below 250 pounds. But he has has to wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin. He says his faces a daily regime of three compression garments everyday as well as creams and powders to treat his extensive rashes and dry tearing skin. Towle needs reconstructive surgeries to remove the excess skin from his chest, abdomen and legs. The procedures are predicted to cost close to $30,000 and Towle thinks his insurance company will pay for at least a portion of the bill, but he is now appealing for help in paying the rest of it on his Go Fund Me page. He wrote: 'I am still trapped inside my own fat suit of skin that just hangs there and affects my everyday life, making it depressing to think I have come so far yet I am still trapped. 'I am asking you to please help me shed this one last obstacle in the way between me and a true new beginning a life that can be lived to the fullest. 'I wish insurance understood I don't want to be the next sex symbol I just want to be free of this burden.'","Thomas Towle III, from Portland, admits he suffered an addiction to eating .

"Jeremy Clarkson could make a return to the BBC as early as next month to front the Top Gear Live world tour, which is set to make more than £10million. BBC bosses are said to be in negotiations about the tour, which was planned to be fronted by Jeremy Clarkson along with co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond under the BBC Top Gear brand. However the future of the shows, which have sold 200,000 tickets, has been cast into doubt after Clarkson was dismissed from the BBC last week for an 'unprovoked' attack on a Top Gear producer. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (right) was due to front the Top Gear Live tour from next month, but talks are now underway about how the shows can go ahead and if BBC branding will be removed after he was dismissed . It is understood  if the corporation tries to block the world tour, which starts in Australia next month, from going ahead they could be liable for refunding tickets at a total cost of around £10million. Fans have paid between £35 and £200 for tickets to the live shows. One option could be to allow the events, which will also take place in London and South Africa, to go ahead under a different name and without some of the key elements of the lucrative BBC show - such as the Stig. A message on the Top Gear Live tour website thanks fans for their 'continued patience'. It says: 'We have not canceled any shows - but we are working through the implications of Jeremy's contract not being renewed by the BBC.' Live Nation, which has been promoting the tour, said it would go ahead in some form but they may have to rebrand. Phil Bowdery said: 'The BBC owns the name and certain aspects of the show. We won;t be able to use any VT of Top Gear. Clarkson, 54, was dismissed from the BBC last month for an unprovoked attack on a Top Gear producer . 'There will be a new name and no Stig because obviously that's their property. We've sold an awful lot of tickets and we want to keep faith with people who bought the tickets.' Sources have claimed there is a small chance the show could go ahead unchanged, but most believe it will have to be significantly changed. It could be renamed Clarkson, May and Hammond Live or MPH Live, the Sunday Mirror reported. Clarkson is already set to return to the BBC on April 24 when he appears as a host on Have I Got News for You. Hat Trick Productions, which makes the show, said there is no reason to believe the show will not go ahead as planned. If the live shows go ahead key elements may have to be removed - such as the mysterious Stig . Tony Hall, the Director-General of the BBC, has had to employ round-the-clock bodyguards after he received a death threat for refusing to reinstate Clarkson. He became a target after taking the final decision to axe Clarkson, the BBC's biggest star, from his £1 million-a-year role presenting the Corporation's biggest global money-spinner. Clarkson's contract was not renewed after an internal investigation found that he had punched producer Oisin Tymon in a 30-second physical assault, following a prolonged verbal tirade in a row over a hot meal. The 54-year-old's fellow presenters, Richard Hammond and James May, are said to be considering offers by the BBC to star in the corporation's planned version of Top Gear, scheduled for 2016. A spokesman from BBC Worldwide said: 'There’s lots of speculation about Top Gear at the moment – however no Top Gear Live shows have been cancelled and we are working through the implications of Jeremy’s contract not being renewed. We will update ticket holders as soon as possible.'","Jeremy Clarkson was due to present Top Gear live on its £10m world tour .

"There are 44,000 male escorts working in the UK but when former glamour model Jodie Marsh tried to interview the British women who hire them for a new documentary, she couldn't find one who would be willing to speak to her. But she found the situation was completely different in the U.S. where women were more open about their desire for casual sex and their willingness to hire an escort to satisfy their needs. One of the women Jodie met for her TLC show, Jodie Marsh On Women Who Pay For Sex, which airs this evening, is Cyndi, 46, from Miami. Scroll down video . Cyndi, 46, from Miami, hit it off with male escort Dom who she hired to go on a date with her . She told Jodie that she was willing to pay $2,500 (£1,700) for a date with her 'dream man' following the end of her 15-year marriage. The mother said: 'I am finding men my age haven't taken care of themselves that well, I like younger men.' On why she chose to hire a younger man to date rather than seek to meet someone on a dating site or through friends, Cyndi admitted it was because she just wanted to have fun and keep things casual. She said: 'I want to get out of the daily grind of my life. It's hard for women to admit we don't want strings either, we feel an obligation to want more from it. 'It's hard to admit to your friends you just want casual sex and a really fun night and not have anything more come of it.' Jodie, right, meets the pair who revealed their date led to a one night stand . Cyndi hired male escort Dom, a father in a long-term relationship, to go on a date with her to a yoga class followed by drinks and dinner. But Jodie discovered they clicked so well, they stayed the night at a hotel where they had sex. Male escorts legally can't advertise sex for money and websites are carefully worded so women know they are not buying sex but companionship. However, as Cyndi discovered, 'extras' are often on offer if both parties are agreeable. Appearing on today's This Morning with Jodie, Cyndi told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden that sex wasn't top of her agenda when she first hired Dom, a 6ft 3 ex-marine. She explained: 'Hiring a male escort was something I was curious about after getting divorced. It served my needs without getting serious. I thought of it as a fun adventure. 'I had an open mind but didn't think it would definitely lead to sex. I thought it would be good experience and chance to hang out with good looking man who paid attention to me. Cyndi appeared on This Morning today via video link as Amanda Holden, left, asked her why she hired a male escort and Jodie, right, revealed they couldn't get a British woman to admit the same . 'Dominic he said he thought I was beautiful and was happy I was there. I suppose he was paid to say that but it felt really genuine.' After spending the night with Dom - whose girlfriend condones his employment - Cyndi told Jodie she would hire him again and would recommend other women do the same if they want a pleasurable night with no strings attached. Jodie told Phillip and Amanda she was concerned about how Cyndi would emotionally handle the one night stand she paid for. She said: 'She definitely had a real connection with him and I was worried she could fall for him as they clicked so much and had such a great time.' Jodie, 36, is currently celibate and said on today's This Morning she would hire a male escort to join her at a party rather than attending as 'an older single woman on my own' But Cyndi insisted on This Morning that she knew what she had signed up for. 'In this experience I could separate my emotions as I knew what I was involved with, it was what it was,' she said. 'We are humans and I thought he was adorable and sweet and we had a physical connection and chemistry but I wasn't going to let my heart get involved. 'I wasn't hiring him to fall in love and have kids with him. I would do it again and absolutely recommend other women do it if the situation is right and you are emotionally in control of your feelings.' Jodie, 36, agreed that she would also hire a male escort to accompany her on dates - but as she's been celibate for the past four years there would be nothing sexual involved. Jodie had to travel to America to interview women who have paid for sex with male escorts as none in Britain were willing to be open about it . On Jodie's TLC show, she also meets male strippers, pictured, as well as gigolos and the women who are forgoing dating and relationships for an evening with a professional lover . She said: 'I have hired an escort before and I would use one again if I was going to a party rather being an older single woman on my own. 'Women feel threatened by other single women so if you are there with a fella people don't see you as a threat.' The TV presenter, who has also had success as a body builder, said she wasn't surprised she had to travel to America to research her latest documentary after finding nobody in Britain willing to admit they hire male escorts. She said: 'Not a single woman admitted to using them! We met so many of British male escorts and they really love their job. 'British people are not just reserved, they just do not want to speak openly about anything.'

"From iPhones to the latest Apple Watch, most people find it difficult to accurately recall what the 'most recognizable' brand's logo looks like when tested, according to a new study. The reason for this is because people are constantly hounded with logos which makes it difficult to remember them, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles found. When asked to draw the Apple logo, only one in 85 participants were able to recreate it correctly in terms of shape, bite size and leaf shape and orientation. However, less than half of participants were able to identify it from a set of 12 similar Apple logos with altered features, according to the study which was published last month. Scroll down for video . From iPhones to the latest Apple Watch, most people find it difficult to accurately recall what the 'most recognizable' brand's logo looks like when tested, according to a new study. Less than half of participants were able to identify the logo correctly from a set of 12 similar Apple logos with altered features (to find out which is the correct logo, scroll down to the bottom of this article) During the first stage of the selection quiz, the participant is asked how confident they are from a rating of one to five; one being the most confident and five the least confident. Most people who participated felt the Apple logo was highly memorable before attempting to recall the details of the logo, according to researchers. The second part is actually spotting the logo out of a set of 12 apples which are separated into three columns of four. When asked to draw the Apple logo, only one in 85 participants were able to recreate it correctly (pictured above) in terms of shape, bite size and leaf shape and orientation . While it might initially be thought of as an easy task, when faced with all of the varying logos, it becomes increasingly difficult. Considering the fact that people are exposed to the Apple logo on products from mobile phones, computers and laptops, it could be expected that good memory would hold strong when correctly recognizing the logo. The reason for this is because people are constantly hounded with logos which makes it difficult to remember them, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles found. While people are often exposed to the logo, they stop paying attention to the details of it which could be due to the fact that it is so simple and widely available (above left, an Apple iPhone 5C and right, the new Apple Watch that was displayed on Monday) However, 'memory is often tuned towards remembering gist-based schematic information' researchers said, which means details can be quickly forgotten. 'The ubiquitous Apple logo is a simple design and is often referred to as one of the most recognizable logos in the world,' wrote researchers. The Apple logo, which has had seven different versions over the years, has kept the same silhouette of an apple since first designed in 1977 (above the first Apple logo by co-founder Ronald Wayne in 1976 depicting Sir Isaac Newton) 'Participants showed surprisingly poor memory for the details of the logo as measured through recall [drawings] and forced-choice recognition.' The findings provided support for theories of attentional saturation, in attentional amnesia and reconstructive memory, as well as how availability can lead to overconfidence when it comes to memory. The results in the study also did not differ between Apple and PC users. The Apple logo, which has had seven different versions  over the years, has kept the same silhouette of an apple since first designed in 1977, which has remained the same ever since, according to Adweek. While people are often exposed to the logo, they stop paying attention to the details of it which could be due to the fact that it is so simple and widely available, said researchers. Similarly, when it comes to other logos such as the Google letters, many people have difficulty remembering the correct colors. Researchers said this is because attention and memory are not always tuned to recalling what we consider memorable. 'Increased exposure increases familiarity and confidence, but does not reliably affect memory,' they wrote. 'Despite frequent exposure to a simple and visually pleasing logo, attention and memory are not always tuned to remembering what we may think is memorable.' Did you spot the correct logo? The Apple logo is pictured at the bottom of the third column. The Apple logo, which has had seven different versions in total over the years, has always kept the same silhouette of an apple since it was first developed by designer Rob Janoff in 1977. The first and original logo was a woodcut by co-founder Ronald Wayne in 1976 featuring Sir Isaac Newton, but was later changed to the apple silhouette, which has remained the same to present day. The Apple silhouette over the years: above from top left Apple's logo from 1977-1998; top center 1998; top right 1998-2000; bottom left 2001-2007; bottom center 2007-2013; bottom right 2013-currently.

"NHS officials in the West Midlands are proposing to pay family doctors £150 an hour – as well as £200 towards staffing costs - to work on Easter Saturday . GPs are in revolt over NHS plans to offer them a ‘paltry’ £650 for opening their surgeries on the morning of Easter Saturday. Officials in the West Midlands are proposing to pay family doctors £150 an hour – as well as £200 towards staffing costs – to work for three hours that morning. But a number of GPs have condemned the size of the payments and say they’ll only turn up if the money is 'quadrupled'. The offer is being made by NHS managers in the West Midlands to avert an expected surge in A&E attendances over the Easter weekend, in early April. Most GP surgeries will be closed for four days in a row from Good Friday, 3rd April, through to Easter Monday, which is also a bank holiday. Many patients who fall ill in this time will go to A&E as they are still unaware of how to contact their out-of-hours service or of the NHS 111 helpline. A&E units are still under intense pressure even though winter is almost over and the numbers of seriously ill patients has declined. Figures for last week showed that the NHS as a whole failed to meet the target of ensuring that 95 per cent of patients were seen within four hours. This has not been met since September but health officials are hoping that the situation will finally improve in April, when the weather turns milder and winter illnesses begin to abate. But they are concerned that a sudden surge in demand when GPs are closed over Easter will cause extra pressures and set hospitals back again. NHS officials are offering surgeries in the region covering Birmingham, Solihull, Hereford and Worcester £650 to open for three hours. This includes £150 per hour paid to one GP for three hours and the remaining £200 to pay for receptionists or practice nurses. Guidance obtained by Pulse magazine  urges practices to sign-up to the arrangement by tomorrow afternoon. It states: ‘We are keen for practices to offer sessions if possible and have agreed a costing. ‘Please confirm if you wish to participate at earliest convenience to allows us to assess impact and by close of play on Wednesday 11th March at the latest.' The offer is being made by NHS managers in the West Midlands to avert an expected surge in A&E attendances over the Easter weekend, but many GPs have said the offer should be 'quadrupled' (file picture) There are 600 practices in two regions being offered the payments which include the Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country as well as Arden, Herefordshire and Worcestershire. But a number of GPs took to the Pulse website to express their disgust at the size of the payments. One wrote: ‘GPs in England work for such paltry sums it’s embarrassing.’ Another said: ‘Now they’ve established the principle of paying, tell em to quadruple it.’ One, a GP partner, a senior doctor in charge of a surgery, said: ‘I do not get out of bed for less than £300 per hour’ – although it was not clear from his tone whether he was joking. And a practice nurse said: ‘A plumber would get paid more, a solicitor would get that per hour. We are seen of no value.’","NHS officials in West Midlands are proposing to pay doctors £150 per hour .

"Nine wild beavers are to continue to live free on a Devon river after they passed health checks. The animals - the first wild beavers to breed in England for 800 years - were captured earlier this week and given crucial blood tests. Their clear results mean the beavers should be released back into the wild on the River Otter by the end of the month. A family of beavers is to continue living free on a Devon river after passing health checks that included blood tests. Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, said the animals won't be put in a zoo, but will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind . Ministers wanted the remarkable animals to be rounded up and put in a zoo after they were spotted last year. But Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild in the first project of its kind. Their approval last month was conditional on the beavers being assessed as free of the disease Echinococcus multilocularis, which can be harmful to humans. Now that tests have revealed that the four adult beavers are free of the disease, and if they pass a few more tests, they are set to be released onto the river. The Echinococcus multilocularis parasite is a small tapeworm. Its eggs can cause alveolar echinococcosis (AE) - a disease in humans brought on if a person swallows the tapeworm's eggs. High risk people include hunters, vets and other people who come into contact with carriers. This includes wild foxes, or coyotes, household dogs and cats or other animals that eat wild rodents infected with AE. Beavers may also pick up the eggs from their surroundings. Humans can be exposed to these eggs by 'hand-to-mouth' transfer or contamination. Devon Wildlife Trust, which will monitor the beavers for the next five years, said they had passed a ‘vital hurdle’ in one of the most important schemes in the history of English conservation. Beavers, which are native to England, were common in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the Middle Ages. They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter. It later became clear there were nine of the animals, two pairs of breeding adults and five juveniles, and they had been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years. It was unclear where they came from – but they had thrived without any outside interference. Environmentalists were delighted at the unexpected finding, but were horrified when Defra, the Government’s environment department, decided last year that they would round up the beavers. Officials said the animals posed a risk to other wildlife and might spread parasites and disease, and insisted they must be put in a zoo or even culled. That decision was reversed six weeks ago when Natural England granted Devon Wildlife Trust a licence to monitor the beavers as part of groundbreaking conservation programme. There are at least nine beavers thriving along a 12 mile (19km) stretch of the River Otter near Exeter (shown on a map). They have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years, completely unnoticed until just over a year ago . The reason for the beavers’ presence in Devon (pictured) remains a mystery. There is a slim chance they travelled from Scotland, where they have been successfully reintroduced on several rivers, or even from Europe, where there are a greater number of reintroduction programmes . The animals will be allowed to live naturally on the river, while wildlife experts monitor the impact they have on the environment. Dan Smith, communications officer at the Devon Wildlife Trust, said yesterday: ‘The beavers are at a private site in Devon. They will be there until we get the rest of the results and then we can released them back on to the river, hopefully within a few weeks.’ Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams. Some people think they may slow down flood waters, as well as boosting wildlife diversity. Farmers and anglers have that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes. As well as being a rare victory for native English wildlife, conservationists say beavers directly benefit the environment. Friends of the Earth campaigner Alasdair Cameron said: ‘This is fantastic news for all the people who fought to save these beavers. We always expected them to be disease free, but it’s wonderful to have it confirmed. ‘We now need to get the beavers released back into the wild as soon as possible - and then get on with working to return the species to other suitable parts of the country too.’ Environment minister Lord de Mauley said: ‘I am very pleased that all four of the adult beavers have been tested by experts and found to be free of Echinococcus multilocularis, a disease which has the potential to be harmful to humans should it become established in the UK.’ The reason for the beavers’ presence in Devon remains a mystery. There are several captive breeding programmes in the UK, including thirty miles away in western Devon, on the other side of Dartmoor. But none of the animals is unaccounted for. There is a slim chance they travelled from Scotland, where they have been successfully reintroduced on several rivers, or even from Europe, where there are a greater number of reintroduction programmes. They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter. A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile. A screen grab of video footage of the beavers is shown .
