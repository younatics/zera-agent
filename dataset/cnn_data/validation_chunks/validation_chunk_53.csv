"Top Gear presenter James May has been spotted at the BBC where he is believed to have been in talks with creative director Alan Yentob. The pair were seen laughing and chatting as they walked outside the BBC headquarters in Portland Place, London, where Mr May was stopped by a passer-by for an autograph. The BBC declined to say what the meeting between the two was about. But it comes just days after Mr Yentob said he hoped Richard Hammond and May would stay at the corporation following the sacking of co-host Jeremy Clarkson - who was today seen taking delivery of a new Mercedes. Scroll down for video . Top Gear presenter James May has been spotted at the BBC where he is believed to have been in talks with creative director Alan Yentob . The BBC declined to say what the meeting between Mr Yentob and Mr May was about. But it comes just days after the BBC chief said he hoped Richard Hammond and May would stay at the corporation following the sacking of co-host Jeremy Clarkson . The pair were seen laughing and chatting as they walked outside the BBC headquarters in Portland Place, London, where Mr May was stopped by a passer by for an autograph . Mr Yentob said that, although he hoped the pair would stay on the show, he admitted the trio were 'very attached'. He also told the Media Show that it was 'perfectly natural' for the pair to have reservations about continuing Top Gear without Clarkson. He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. 'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.' He added: 'The question of what happens next for Top Gear is a conversation which must go on between the controller of BBC2 Kim Shillinglaw, between Andy (Wilman - producer of Top Gear) and the team.' Clarkson, who was dramatically dropped from the BBC following an investigation into a 'fracas' with a junior producer, seemed relaxed if a little fatigued as he made his way from his home in west London to a waiting cab before a new car was delivered to his home. Clarkson was seen taking delivery of a black Mercedes CLK 63 AMG car at his flat . BBC director general Tony Hall sacked Clarkson, 54, after an internal inquiry found he had launched an ‘unprovoked verbal and physical attack’ on junior producer Oisin Tymon, 36 . Detectives have since said they have a duty to investigate 'where we believe an offence might have been committed' and experts claimed the Clarkson, 54, may be charged with actual bodily harm for his punch-up earlier this month . It appears Jeremy Clarkson has decided to take it easy after what must have been a tiring few weeks, sporting a slightly unkempt look as he left his home today . The former Top Gear presenter was earlier seen looking tired and unshaven as he left his flat in west London . Clarkson, who was dramatically dropped from the BBC following an investigation into a 'fracas' with a junior producer, wore a quilted jacket, checked shirt and jeans . Onlookers said he was 'less than his cheery self' as he made his way to a waiting cab - rather than driving himself . Sources have told MailOnline that ITV are prepared to offer him £10million to sign for the trio, with Clarkson's executive producer and schoolfriend Andy Wilman having reportedly met with them. Top Gear’s replacement in the Sunday 8pm BBC 2 slot this week was Caribbean with Simon Reeve. The show got an average of 2.58million viewers peaking at 2.78m, compared with Top Gear's average of 5.5million this series. BBC director general Tony Hall sacked Clarkson, 54, after an internal inquiry found he had launched an ‘unprovoked verbal and physical attack’ on junior producer Oisin Tymon, 36. The row broke out after the star complained no hot food was available at the Yorkshire hotel where the TV crew were staying after a day’s filming. Detectives have since said they have a duty to investigate 'where we believe an offence might have been committed' and experts claimed the Clarkson, 54, may be charged with actual bodily harm for his punch-up earlier this month. But Tymon's lawyer, Paul Daniels, issued a statement in which he said: 'Mr Tymon has informed the police that he doesn't want to press charges. The BBC has hired bodyguards to protect Lord Hall around the clock after he received a death threat for sacking Clarkson . He was pictured today being followed by security as he made his way to work at the BBC headquarters . The bill to licence fee payers for extra security is expected to run into thousands of pounds after a menacing email to Lord Hall, apparently from an obsessive Top Gear fan overseas . 'The events of the last few weeks have been extremely unpleasant for everyone involved. The matter has taken a great toll on Oisin, his family and his friends. 'Quite simply, Mr Tymon just wishes to return now to the job at the BBC he loves, as soon as possible. Further, the BBC have, in his view, taken action with a view to addressing the issues at hand. 'Mr Tymon agrees with the BBC's stated view that all parties should now be allowed to move on, so far as possible.' The BBC has hired bodyguards to protect Lord Hall around the clock after he received a death threat for sacking Clarkson. He was seen arriving with his security detail still in tow at the BBC headquarters this morning. The bill to licence fee payers for extra security is expected to run into thousands of pounds after a menacing email to Lord Hall, apparently from an obsessive Top Gear fan overseas. But Scotland Yard insisted the threat was not considered grave enough to warrant diverting its own officers to guard Lord Hall. Scotland Yard has said police were investigating an allegation of threats to kill Lord Hall made via email. A spokesman added: ‘Inquiries are ongoing to establish where the email came from. At the moment we think it was sent from abroad. ‘We do not have any officers guarding him. The security is being organised by the BBC.’","Clarkson was dramatically dropped from the BBC following 'fracas'

"Levi Johnston is returning to the nest. The former reality star and teenage boyfriend of Bristol Palin has moved into his mother's garage along with his wife Sunny and the couple two daughters, Breeze, 2, and newborn Indy. This as the couple reportedly can no longer afford the home Johnston has lived in off and on for the past six years. Scroll down for video . Levi Johnston and his wife Sunny (above with son Tripp) have been forced to move into his mother's garage with their daughter Breeze, 2, and newborn Indy . Making matters worse for Johsnton is that ex Bristol Palin is asking him for over $60,000 in back child support for their 6-year-old son Tripp (above) Now, according to Radar Online, Levi and family have settled into their new home - Sherry Johnston's garage. Johnston was sentenced to three years in prison in 2009 for dealing OxyContin after she sold the pills three times to undercover officers. The actual arrest happened while her son was dating Palin, who was pregnant, and whose mother was campaigning for vice president. 'They couldn’t even get a loan for a small camper to live in temporarily. That was their first plan, but four banks denied them,' said a source close to the family. 'They’re not being welcomed with a warm greeting but what choice does his mom have — leave her grandkids homeless?' And more than a few people claim the couple's financial problems are a result of the way  Johnston's wife has been spending their money. 'She just spends his money on stuff for her - hair extensions, clothes, shoes, expensive makeup, all sorts of unnecessary purchases,' said the source. 'And it’s all while she tells Levi that the money being spent is going towards clothes, diapers, food for their daughter and food for them. He’s not being a deadbeat dad. He’s such a good dad.' This as Johnston, 24, is reportedly working every single day as an electrician in Wasilla, Alaska. His wife meanwhile has been fired from two jobs she reportedly had for just a month. Johnston and his wife lived with his mother for some time three years ago, and recently the family moved in with Johnston's sister Mercede.

'Bristol and the Palin family have no clue how broke Levi now is!' said the source. Johnston's wife is hooting down the source's claims however, writing on her Facebook Tuesday; 'The disgusting things people will say and do out of jealousy... Smh. You wil get yours.'","Levi Johnston and his wife Sunny have been forced to move into his mother's garage with their daughter Breeze, 2, and newborn Indy .

"A pair of student lovebirds who met in their first week of university got engaged just three months later. Doting 19-year-olds Kate Wood and James Carter plan to spend the rest of their lives together after their eyes first locked over a badminton net in their freshers' week. Three months later, James got down on one knee, produced a diamond ring and proposed to Kate during a romantic getaway. Kate Wood and James Carter met at the University in East Anglia and got engaged three months later . James and Kate met whilst playing badminton during freshers' week . James proposed to Kate in January whilst the couple were on holiday in Istanbul, presenting her with this pretty diamond ring . The students at the University of East Anglia, in Norwich, are to move out of their halls of residence and into a flat together. Politics student Kate told student newspaper The Tab how they met on 3 October: 'We were playing badminton and we got talking and at first neither of us were really trying but then we got to talking more and we didn't really want to ever stop.' She added: 'When I got home I told all my flatmates that I had met someone really special. 'The next day we went down to the lake near campus and sat for about four hours doing nothing but talking. We went out together that night and it went perfectly.' The couple spent nearly every day together before they took a trip to Istanbul, where Kate is from, in January. It was there that computer science student James, from Berkshire, popped the question at 1am on 3 January - three months after they had met. Kate said yes and admitted she struggled to hold back the tears during the romantic moment. The couple clearly like to joke around with one another as Kate wore this T-shirt which reads 'Property of James' and includes arrows pointing to her breasts . James and Kate got engaged on the 5th of January and announced it on Facebook, pictured, but don't plan to marry until they graduate . The couple have announced their engagement on Facebook and admitted it did come as a surprise to their parents. Kate said: 'Our friends are not surprised and our parents are over the moon but at first they found it a bit weird but they knew straight away things were different between us.' She said they are not bothered about people who may criticise them for getting engaged so soon into their relationship as she says people can't judge them if they don't know them. She added that 'the ring and the engagement are symbolic of our commitment to each other' but they do not have any plans to actually tie the knot for the foreseeable future. They don't intend to marry until after they have both graduated and Kate said they have no plans to start a family till after then either.","Kate Wood and James Carter met during their first week of university .

"In what was Britain’s first industrial war, huge amounts of munitions were needed - but the men who dominated manufacturing jobs had left to fight. So it was down to more than 600,000 women to take on roles in mills, laboratories and factories to help the First World War effort on the Home Front. And these photographs show women munitions workers making shells and fuses for the first time in a Greater Manchester factory in 1915. Teamwork: Women munitions workers began making shells and fuses for the first time in this factory in Oldham, Greater Manchester, in 1915 . Posed up: One electrical engineering firm that diversified and began to employ women in 1915 was owned by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti . Many firms in the North West and elsewhere converted to start making munitions in the war, with women now working alongside men in these jobs. And one electrical engineering firm that diversified and began to employ women in 1915 was owned by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti in Oldham. The company had previously made meters and transformers, but switched production to fuses and 18-pounder shells in 1915. In the same year, Mr de Ferranti hired the first female supervisor - family friend Olivia Forbes, who ended up working for the firm for 40 years. It was her job to recruit new female workers at the factory, where there were more than 1,000 women working by the end of the war in 1918. Katie Belshaw, curator of an exhibition on Manchester’s war effort, said: ‘It was something that had to be done because the men were going off to fight. Hard work: Many companies  converted to start making munitions during the war, with women now working alongside men in these jobs . Getting involved: Britain was facing a huge shortage of munitions on the front lines in 1915, leading to what became known as the Shells Crisis . ‘But instead of the women coming in and doing the same job that a male skilled worker would do, they broke down the job into smaller pieces.' She told MailOnline: ‘They would have worked on turning the shells and finishing them - making them smoother once they had been manufactured. ‘They even were driving trucks around the factory, operating lifts - they really were doing what the men were doing.’ Britain was facing a huge shortage of munitions on the front lines of the war in 1915, leading to what became known as the Shells Crisis. The Government appointed David Lloyd George as munitions minister, which prompted the construction of new shell factories across Britain. The exhibition at Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry features diaries, company archives, sketches and letters written by Mr de Ferranti. Diversifying: The company had previously made meters and transformers, but switched production to fuzes and 18-pounder shells in 1915 . Family: The exhibition at Museum of Science and Industry features diaries, sketches and letters written by Mr de Ferranti (second left, back) These include letters the engineer wrote to his sons Basil and Vincent fighting at the front and rare sketches of his munitions. Also featuring are images of his daughter Vera who worked on the production line at her father’s factory during the war. And there will also be a section on the Munitions Inventions Department, which received ideas submitted by the public on how to win the war. Examples of rejected inventions range from training seagulls to defecate on enemy periscopes to mounting machine guns on artificially frozen clouds. Rachel Knight, head of exhibitions at the museum, said visitors will be given an ‘insightful, original and personal take’ on the war. The Innovation Race: Manchester’s Makers Join the First World War is open at the Museum of Science and Industry from Saturday until April 2016. Suffragist and suffragette leaders volunteered their members to take the place of men in industrial work after they went off to fight in the war. While the offer was at first met with scepticism by the Government, eventually the numbers of men leaving meant they had to take on these women. More than 600,000 women became employed in munitions factories and performed other roles such as working as bus conductors or farm hands. Then, in 1918, the right to vote was given to 'respectable' women aged over 30 who were householders, or married to householders. Historians have debated how much this was down to the war effort, with some saying the vote was a token of thanks for women’s efforts in the UK. Others believe war sped up a process which began before the conflict started, with it highlighting women’s huge economic value to Britain. It is also said the women’s political cause gained credibility during the war because they served such a huge role - especially in the medical services. In 1928 women were given equal voting rights with men, with 15million females eligible to vote in the general election the following year.","600,000 women took on roles in mills, laboratories and factories to help First World War effort on Home Front .

"A pregnant model, who is less a month away from giving birth, has come under fire from her Instagram followers after sharing a series of saucy lingerie-clad selfies flaunting her barely-there baby-bump. Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old underwear model and animal rights activist, has documented her changing figure via her Instagram page throughout her pregnancy earning herself a huge number of fans in the process. However, as her pregnancy has progressed, more and more people have begun criticizing the mother-to-be, claiming that her unusually trim and toned figure could be doing damage to her unborn child. 'I would be so nervous!' one critic wrote. 'The baby is probably really small and I would imagine she will have a hard time making milk.’ Scroll down for video . Mom-to-be: Sarah Stage, a Los Angeles-based lingerie model, has been documenting her changing pregnancy body and many of her 1.1m Instagram followers cannot believe she is eight months pregnant . Another added: 'Feed the baby! She's just cares about her looks, not the growing of the baby. So sad that the baby [will be] so tiny when he comes into the world.' The model’s pictures have garnered thousands more similar comments, many of which criticize her for being 'unhealthy' and unnaturally small for a pregnant woman. But while Sarah has faced her fair share of criticisms, others were more complimentary with their comments. 'Everyone is body shaming her. It’s really sad how quick everyone is to judge her and say that she is starving her baby, before actually educating yourselves on why she may look so small,' one person wrote. Proud: Sarah refuses to hide her eight month pregnant body in maternity clothes and prefers to flaunt it in lingerie . Meanwhile, another fan noted: 'Cuteset bump ever!' Despite her critics, Sarah refuses to hide her eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes and prefers to flaunt it on social media for the world to see. Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent and lives in Los Angeles, shuns baggy dresses and instead dresses her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa, spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah has continued to model whilst carrying. Multi-talented: Sarah is a lingerie model and animal rights activist and adorns billboards in the states . Sarah's first modelling gig was at the tender age of two and the star, who is signed to Elite Model Management, has since adorned billboards and starred in countless campaigns. According to Malaysian Digest, Sarah indulges in occasional cheeseburgers and maintains her trim frame is down to daily gym visits. Comments from her followers include ones such as: 'she looks like me on a normal day' and 'my belly after a burger'. And despite some of her followers criticizing her unique physique, one medical professional claims that, if she feels healthy and happy, Sarah has no need to worry about her baby. Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant. Gym bunny: The model credits her svelte figure to her regular work-out sessions in the gym . 'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. 'Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established. Fan club: Comments from her followers include ones such as 'she looks like me on a normal day' and 'I had to look at it for ages to notice she was pregnant' Popular: Sarah has over 1m Instagram followers who regularly comment on her trim baby body .

"Mark Ward, 24, was stopped by police in 'death trap' BMW while driving his heavily pregnant sister . A car enthusiast has been banned from the roads after he was caught driving his heavily pregnant sister in his 'death trap' car. Mark Ward, 24, was stopped by officers on a coastal road in Prestatyn, North Wales, who found his modified BMW 328 had several defects including wires danging from the glove box. It also had interior door panels missing, a faulty horn, 'stretched and worn' balding tyres which were the wrong size and an anti-lock braking system that did not work. The car, which was scratched and dented, was seized and impounded and a further examination revealed it had a quick release steering wheel, to help get in and out of the vehicle quicker. Ward, of Thornhill in Cumbria, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at Llandudno Magistrates Court, and was given a year-long ban with an extended test and 80 hours community work. But the unemployed welder, who was driving at around 28mph when he was pulled over in August last year, has hit out at his conviction, claiming police made 'an example' of him. Ward, who paid £550 for the car in 2013, is part of a car club that holds track races, car shows and family fun days and described himself as a 'competent driver' who would never put others at risk. He said: 'All of the modifications that were made to my car were done so for the shows and races that I take part in. I kept it in very good condition. 'On the day that I was pulled over I was driving within the speed limit. My sister Adele was heavily pregnant at the time and I would not put her or anyone else at risk by driving a car which I believed to be unsafe. I am a competent driver and I pay my tax, insurance and MOT. 'I don't drink or smoke or go out causing trouble. I have never been in trouble with the police before but now I have a criminal record for dangerous driving and it will ruin job prospects for me in the future. 'I am a massive car enthusiast and I have been modifying cars ever since I passed my driving test five years ago. Police found his modified BMW 328 had several defects after he was stopped on a coastal road in Prestatyn . His car had electrical wires dangling from where the glove box should have been and interior door panels missing. He also had a removable steering wheel to make getting in and out of the car easier (all pictured) 'My BMW had a number of modifications but it had passed its MOT two months before I was pulled over so I had no reason to assume it wasn't safe to drive. 'I used to use the car for shows, drifting and track races, so I removed the interior panels to make the car more lightweight and added a free-flowing exhaust to extract more power from the engine. 'The wires that were on show were cable tied and secure and there are no laws which say mechanisms cannot be on show. It makes no difference to the car.' He added that he had intended to take the car off the road after noticing the handbrake was locking one wheel instead of two but had been asked to drive the car as part of a funeral procession. The balding tyres were 'stretched and worn' and were not even the correct size for the vehicle (pictured) Ward, of Thornhill in Cumbria, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at Llandudno Magistrates Court, and was given a year-long ban with an extended test and 80 hours community work after the car (above) was seized . Ward, who has owned 25 cars since passing his driving test five years ago, said: 'A week before I was pulled over I had a bump on the tracks when I was drifting. I repaired it, drove it home and parked it up. 'A couple of days later I was asked to drive the car as part of a funeral procession, so I did that and the next day I was pulled over. 'BMWs have a common fault with the handbrake. I have had 70s and 80s cars and not one of them has had anti-lock breaks. If I genuinely thought the car was unsafe it wouldn't have been on the road. 'I now accept that the tyres were really bad and there's no excuse for that. It was a lack of judgement on my part.' The motor enthusiast, who paid £550 for the car in 2013, is part of a car club that holds track races, car shows and family fun days .

It is only lucky that this vehicle was not involved in a serious collision as it was a death trap.

"Australian scientists have made a major breakthrough in treating Alzheimer's with a new drug-free method that can restore memory loss. Researchers at the University of Queensland's Brain Institute hope to be able to trial their new 'cheap and mobile' ultrasound device within two years on humans. The treatment attacks the neurotoxic amyloid plaques that cause memory loss and cognitive failure with ultrasound waves. Scroll down for video . Researchers at the University of Queensland's Brain Institute hope to be able to trial their new 'cheap and mobile' ultrasound device within two years on humans. Research director Professor Jürgen Götz hopes the new method will revolutionise Alzheimer's treatment by restoring memory for sufferers. Research director Professor Jürgen Götz hopes the new method will revolutionise Alzheimer's treatment by restoring memory for sufferers. 'We're extremely excited by this innovation of treating Alzheimer's without using drug therapeutics,' Professor Götz said, according to The Australian. 'The word 'breakthrough' is often misused, but in this case I think this really does fundamentally change our understanding of how to treat this disease, and I foresee a great future for this approach.' The mobile device could be used by patients in their own homes several times a year,eliminating the need for expensive drug treatment that costs up to $250,000, Prof Götz said. 'With an ageing population placing an increasing burden on the health system, an important factor is cost, and other potential drug treatments using antibodies will be expensive,' he said. The mobile device could be used by patients in their own homes several times a year,eliminating the need for expensive drug treatment that costs up to $250,000, Prof Götz said. 'In contrast, this method uses relatively inexpensive ultrasound and microbubble technology which is non-invasive and appears highly effective.' Almost two thirds of all dementia patients in Australia suffer from Alzheimer's, which accounts for almost 250,000 people. The total number of dementia cases in Australia is expected to rise to 900,000 by 2050.

"Roughly 70 percent of strawberries grown in Australia are being treated with a pesticide that is supposed to have been banned across the world because it depletes the ozone layer. Nine strawberry growers in Victoria's Yarra Valley are still using methyl bromide to fumigate crops, despite it being banned by the United Nations Montreal Protocol more than two decades ago, the ABC reports. The odourless gas was meant to have been phased out in Australia by 2005. Roughly 70 percent of strawberries grown in Australia are being treated with a pesticide that is supposed to have been banned across the world because it depletes the ozone layer . But the Victorian growers, who produce 100 million strawberry runners a year, are still using almost 30 tonnes of the pesticide annually. They claim alternatives would drive business into the ground and cost 15,000 jobs, so they regularly apply for a critical use exemption from the United Nations. Methyl bromide, an odourless and colouless gas, was banned because it depletes the ozone layer . 'Internationally, we've gotten rid of 85 per cent of methyl bromide, and it's a great win for mankind — in fact it's the best environmental gain that's been made,' Dr Ian Porter, UN Methyl Bromide Technical Options committee's co-chair, told the ABC. 'It's frustrating ... but we don't want industries to fall over economically or technically. We don't want more disease or pests in Australia.' Growers suggest their costs could soar by 500 percent if they were to stop using the pesticide, which could see a punnet of strawberries soar to more than $10. The Victorian farms still using methyl bromide - who are part of the Toolangi Certified Strawberry Runner Growers' Cooperative - said the industry had spent $700,000 on research to find alternatives to the pesticide. 'The soils at Toolangi are clays with high organic matter, and alternative treatments used in other parts of Australia do not work well in these conditions, especially in cold temperatures,' they said. They said banning it would mean consumers have less availability to strawberries and more berries would be imported - implying the health standards may not be the same as in Australia.

"At just 19 years of age, Ella Henderson has achieved fame and fortune with a chart-topping album after being a finalist on The X Factor. This week, the singer from Lincolnshire was moved to meet other teenagers her age who are not as fortunate. She visited the Sebastian’s Action Trust in Slough, a Comic Relief supported charity that helps terminally-ill children and their families. Ahead of her performance on this evening's Red Nose Day Night, Ella here reveals the inspirational people she met and how your money really makes a difference... Ella takes a selfie with a fan as she visits Sebastian’s Action Trust in Slough, a Comic Relief supported charity that helps terminally-ill children and their families . Ella said: 'When I perform tonight on the night of TV for Red Nose Day, I will be thinking of Chase and the other incredibly brave young people who I met earlier this week at the Comic Relief funded project, Sebastian Action's Trust in Slough. 'Sebastian's Action Trust supports families from diagnosis through a child's treatment and beyond. 'Dedicated Financial Support workers who are funded by money raised through Red Nose Day provide practical support and stability during the emotionally difficult time. 'In a couple of weeks Chase celebrates her 18th birthday. But she is living with a life-limiting cancer diagnosis and has made the decision to stop her painfully tough treatment. She's still filled with infectious energy and her huge personality is impossible not to warm to. We're almost the same age, I can't imagine having to make such huge decisions. The singer, pictured joining in a music session during her visit, said: 'The families and staff at Sebastian's Action Trust were some of the most inspirational people I've met' Ella, centre in a black top, is urging people to donate to Comic Relief to support the work of charities like Sebastian's Action Trust who provide practical support and stability to those with life-limiting cancer . 'The Trust was set up after the death of Sebastian Gates in 2003. The nine-year-old recognised how his illness affected his family and wanted to help build a specialist respite centre for families with seriously ill children. 'His dreams were made a reality after his death thanks to the hard work of his mum Jane, who was recognised with an OBE earlier this year. Jane is an incredible woman and a true credit to her brave son. 'She explained to me that one of the big problems families face when looking after a seriously ill child is their finances. There is so much practical and emotional stuff to deal with, such as hospital visits and treatment that often parents can't work. And if you can't work because you need to look after your child, then how do you find the money to pay the rent? A Red Nose like this one modelled by Ella costs £1 with at least 60p going to Comic Relief . Ella said she will think of the inspiration people she met at Sebastian's Action Trust when she performs on Comic Relief - Face The Funny on BBC One this evening . 'I met a family at the Trust who were too overwhelmed to cope with their money worries. Ten-year-old Reece needs a bone marrow transplant to cure a blood disorder called severe aplastic anaemia. His older sister Danielle is the same age as me. She quit sixth form and started work in a coffee shop when her brother got ill to help with the family's cash flow. 'But their mum Cathy got behind on rent and council tax, which added a massive amount of stress to an already very difficult situation. When the Trust helped Cathy to get her finances sorted, the relief was immense. 'The families and staff at Sebastian's Action Trust were some of the most inspirational people I've met. It makes me proud to be part of Red Nose Day and I hope we can all raise as much money as possible to support an incredible project like this one.'

"A group of California parents have filed a lawsuit against a daycare center accusing two instructors of pricking thumb tacks into the legs of their young children as a . form a discipline and threatening the toddlers to keep them quiet about the abuse. The civil suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Tuesday, says . the teachers involved in the abuse, which occurred between 2013 . and 2014 at a Tutor Time franchise, were fired after their . actions came to the attention of management, but that the . daycare center concealed their actions from parents. The suit follows an investigation by state authorities who . cited the center in Agoura Hills, west of Los Angeles, after . finding at least one instructor 'used tactics to intimate and . scare children,' according to documents from the state . Department of Social Services. Four California mothers have filed a lawsuit against the Tutor Time daycare center in Agoura Hills, accusing instructors there of pricking their children's legs with pins as a way of discipline . The lawsuit filed on behalf of four parents, identified in court papers as Nicole Z., Kim M., Debbie S. and Krista L., says their 2- and 3-year-old children suffered cruel and unusual abuse in a recurring . practice known at the center as 'pica pica,' which translated . from Spanish means 'prick prick.' 'If a boy was deemed inattentive or failed to follow . directions, these teachers would stick a pin into the child's . legs,' said the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of the parents by personal injury attorney Robert Clayton. 'The push pin was pressed deep enough into the legs to . inflict pain and injury on the child,' the court papers read. The lawsuit accuses the two instructors, named as Rosa Nepomuseno and Jessica Morales, and the operators of . the center of negligence, failure to report abuse, assault and . battery, breach of contract and other wrongdoing and seeks an . unspecified amount in damages. Caseworkers from the state Department of Social Service visited the daycare center last May and uncovered evidence that serious violations had occurred there, reported 7Online. As a result of the investigation, three Tutor Time workers were fired, including one who knew about the abuse but failed to report it. A former worker told the station that the classroom for 2-year-olds was overcrowded, with two instructors having to look after about two dozen toddlers. The lawsuit alleges that the sister of one of the alleged victims was “made to watch the defendants inflict this brutal punishment on her twin brother, which resulted in severe mental and emotional injuries to her. In a phone interview with Daily Mail Wednesday, attorney Robert Clayton said the first plaintiff in the lawsuit found out about the alleged abuse a year ago from a terminated Tutor Time teacher, who told the woman about the push pins, not knowing that she had a son at the daycare center. The attorney said when he contacted the management at Tutor Time, ‘they weren’t denying it happened, but they didn’t think it was a big deal.’ The boys’ families, however, were of a different opinion. Clayton said: ‘They were shocked. They could not fathom this had happened to their children, especially in a place they trusted…They made the parents feel very safe.’ The lawyer representing the four mothers said whenever parents would notice scrapes and pokes on the toddlers’ legs and mention it to instructors at Tutor Time, the standard response was, ‘they’re just boys.’ But according to Clayton, the teachers named as defendants in the lawsuit threatened the children to keep quiet about the pin pricks. Painful punishment: The lawsuit alleges 2- and 3-year-old children suffered cruel and unusual abuse in a recurring practice known at the center as 'pica pica,' which translated from Spanish means 'prick prick' Clayton claimed that whenever one of the instructors would see the toddlers approach other staffers at the daycare center, she would tap her pocket containing thumb pins to warn them not to say anything about the ‘pica pica’ ritual. The attorney said his clients’ children have been receiving counselling to help them deal with nightmares and bed-wetting allegedly resulting from the trauma. ‘They are frightened every time they see anything sharp,’ the lawyer told Daily Mail. The law partner at the LA-based firm Taylor and Ring further said his clients want to see change. ‘They want to see that this never happens to another child,’ said Clayton. Clayton said he has been getting calls from other parents, suggesting that there could be more victims out there. Lydia Cisaruk, a spokeswoman for Tutor Time, told Reuters in an . email that the company acquired the center from its franchise . operator last August but the purchase was unrelated to the . allegations of abuse. 'Before the acquisition, this matter was addressed by the . franchise owner/operator in conjunction with the licensing . authorities,' she said. 'Staffing changes were made prior to the . school coming under corporate ownership last year.' Tutor Time as a corporate entity was not served as a . defendant in the lawsuit, Cisaruk said. The suit names as defendants the two instructors and Little . Scholars Inc, which Cisaruk said operated the center as a . franchisee.","Four California mothers are suing Tutor Time daycare center in Agoura Hills for alleged abuse .

"A retired teacher was sent an NHS bill after he received hospital treatment in England – because he lived in Wales. Nicholas White, 64, was taken ill while visiting relatives in Cambridgeshire in December. He was stunned when staff at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, near Huntingdon, said he would be getting a bill for almost £2,000 in the post because he was ‘technically a foreigner’. Nicholas White, 64, from north Wales, was taken ill while visiting relatives in Cambridgeshire. After a three-day stay at Hinchingbrooke Hospital he was sent a bill for £1,775 because he was classed as a 'foreigner' The hospital have since apologised, and claim they explained to Mr White that he could pass the bill on to his GP so they could arrange for it to be paid by the local health board. However last week Mr White was shocked when he received an ‘unsettling’ demand in the post saying that the £1,775 bill was overdue. ‘It was very stressful,’ he said, adding: ‘I’ve worked for 40-plus years and always paid my taxes, so to be suddenly told that I was going to be charged for treatment on the NHS was shocking. I was infuriated.’ Hinchingbrooke Hospital has admitted that the invoice was sent to Mr White in error and should have been sent to his local health authority . Mr White, who lives in the village of Dyffryn Ardudwy in North Wales, fell ill while visiting relatives shortly before Christmas and spent three days undergoing tests at Hinchingbrooke Hospital – the first NHS hospital to be run by a private company. Mr White said: 'I was told that because I was Welsh I counted as a foreigner and would  have to pay' He was released, but several weeks later was offered a gastroscopy, where doctors put a camera into a stomach to identify any problems. Moments before the procedure in January, Mr White claims he was ushered into a side room by an administrator and told he would be sent a bill for the examination and his previous stay. The father-of-two said: ‘She said that because I lived in Wales I was technically a foreigner and would be sent a bill – my wife nearly fell off her chair. For them to have been talking to me about payment moments before they took me for treatment was totally wrong.’ A few weeks after the procedure, which found he was suffering from a hernia, Mr White received a bill for £1,775 – marked ‘important’. Initially he ‘didn’t worry too much’ as his GP had told him that the health board would deal with the invoice, so he simply passed it onto his surgery. But last week he was sent a reminder which said the balance was ‘overdue’. A spokesman for Hinchingbrooke NHS Trust denied referring to Mr White as a ‘foreigner’ and claimed they sent him the invoice at the request of his GP surgery. They added: ‘We agreed with the GP that we would send the invoice directly to the patient, and he would pass it on to the practice. We’re sorry if there was any confusion.’ But a spokesman for the Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board said: ‘The invoice should have been sent to the health board. We would have paid it directly, without involving the patient.’","Nicholas White, 64, was taken ill while visiting relatives in Huntingdon .

"The story of an abandoned puppy who was beaten so badly that he had to have his leg amputated has prompted donations of almost £18,000 for charity after users read about it on the internet. Ralf, owned by Sue Utley, 66, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire has over 1,300 Facebook friends and his story has raised the substantial sum for Rain Rescue, the charity that rescued him. He was found on Christmas Eve, 2012, savagely kicked and discovered dumped in the street, crying in agony. Since having his leg amputated, little Ralf has become an internet sensation and raised around £18k for the charity that saved his life, Rain Rescue . A vet gave two heartbreaking options – the pup should either be put down or face a gruelling leg amputation. Experts couldn't be sure that the little dog would adapt to having just three legs. But he was given the chance, and today Ralf is an internet star who has even saved other pooches on doggie death row. Owner Sue says: 'Ralf was just four months old when he was found dumped in the street in Rotherham by a volunteer from Rain Rescue, a local dog charity. 'I'd been a dog foster carer for them and offered to take him in for a while. The poor lad was in a bad way, crying in pain from an injury to his front leg. Born fighter: Rain Rescue paid for Ralf to have his leg amputated from the knee down, but vets couldn't say how he would cope with life on three legs . Brutal: Ralf had been kicked so badly that it had shattered his left elbow and dislocated his right shoulder . 'Ralf had been kicked which had shattered his left elbow and dislocated his right shoulder. 'I couldn't believe someone would hurt a puppy. The vet's news was stark - put him to sleep or operate.' Rain Rescue paid for Ralf to have his leg amputated from the knee down, but no-one really knew how he would cope with life on three legs. Mrs Utley said: 'I knew that Ralf would try to nibble at his stitches, so that day I bought him a baby's t-shirt to wear, meaning his stump would be covered up.' She and her husband Pete, 67, found it tough watching Ralf struggling to walk. 'It took him ages to realise his old leg had been removed and he was constantly falling over. Eventually this caused a haematoma in his stump,' she says. Sadly the vet then had to remove his shoulder, but luckily Ralf's feisty spirit pulled him through and Mrs Utley was smitten. Sue Utley fostered Ralf and decided to set up a Facebook page in his name, uploading photos and sharing his escapades with his now 1,300 friends . Little charmer: Sue writes Ralf's Facebook updates in a broad Yorkshire accent allowing his mischievous character to shine through . 'Fostering was supposed to be short term but as people offered to adopt him I just couldn't bear to let him go,' she said. 'He was such a character, always hiding things and getting up to mischief.' She decided to set up a Facebook page in Ralf's name, uploading photos and sharing his escapades. She wrote Ralf's updates in a broad Yorkshire accent and his personality shone through. 'Helped me mam with the dishes today,' he barked. 'She weren't happy though, shouted at me to get out the dishwasher and stop lickin' the plates.' She also uploaded photographs of Ralf wearing his tiny t-shirts. As he grew, so did his collection. She said: 'He had stripy ones, Superman ones, sailor boy ones. 'His Facebook friends loved seeing what he was wearing every day. Ralf is now raising money for the charity Rain Rescue and helping save the lives of other animals . 'Many of these dogs (in local dog pounds) are traumatised, injured, or sick and needing vet treatment,' says Sue, 'But thanks to Ralf and Rain Rescue they're alive.' 'Soon he was boasting nearly 2,000 friends and I decided to put his popularity to use and get him his own JustGiving page, meaning people could leave donations for Rain Rescue.' To date, Ralf has raised nearly £18,000 and Mrs Utley could not be prouder. 'Ralf had been left to die on the streets, and now he's helping save the lives of other animals,' she said. 'He's a little hero. He may hobble about on three legs, but to me he's just perfect. 'He's saved the lives of dogs in death row who are in the local pounds, the ones that are due to be put to sleep. 'Many of these dogs are traumatised, injured, or sick and needing vet treatment. 'But thanks to Ralf and Rain Rescue they're alive.'

"President Vladimir Putin has accused Western spies of plotting to undermine his rule and attempting to 'destabilise' Russia before the elections at a meeting of the Federal Security Service earlier today . President Vladimir Putin has accused Western spies of plotting to undermine his rule and trying to 'destabilise' Russia before the elections. Public organisations are being used by Western security services to achieve their own goals, the Russian president said at a meeting of the Federal Security Service earlier today. He vowed that Russia would stand firm in the face of what he described as attempts to isolate the country politically and economically following the Ukrainian crisis. In the speech he said: 'The attempts by Western security services to use public, non-governmental organisations and non-political groups for their own benefit, mostly to discredit the authorities and destabilise the situation in Russia, have not stopped. 'Actions are being planned for the time before the election campaigns in 2016 and 2018.' Putin approved a law to force non-governmental organisations that engage in 'political activity' to register with the Justice Ministry as 'foreign agents' and file a report to officials every quarter in 2012. Critics claimed it was a move designed to try and silence groups that criticised his human rights record. His new comments mean that Moscow will not relax their scrutiny of non-governmental groups that receive foreign funding. Putin added that he was always open to dialogue with the opposition - but was confident the country would come out as a winner in the standoff against the West. He said: 'The situation around our country will change for the better, but not because we will make concessions, bend down or trifle with someone. 'No one has succeeded in scaring our country or pressuring it and no one will.' Putin spoke before officials and said he was confident Russia would come out as a winner in the standoff against the West . He added: 'We always listen to constructive criticism of the authorities' action or lack of action at any level and this dialogue is always useful and simply necessary. 'But it would be pointless to have debates with those who take orders from an outsider, in the interest of another country.' During the meeting Putin also praised Russian security services for thwarting the work of more than 300 foreign spies and agents, and said it was 'especially important' to tighten procedures to protect state secrets.","Vowed that Russia would stand firm in standoff against the West .

"While many couples will choose to honour their love by getting tattoos that symbolise their commitment, it's not often that friends and family will choose to join in the fun. When Marlee and Jordan Follman decided to tie to knot after five years together, they set out to start their life as husband and wife in a manner distinctly their own, leaving their mark on each other- and their wedding guests. The young couple, from Brisbane, hired a mobile tattoo van for their reception, commissioned a set of custom designs, and celebrated their nuptials by getting matching tattoos- along with 15 of their loved ones. Marlee and Jordan Follman, from Brisbane, decided to tie to knot after five years together . 'Both Jordan and I had tattoos before we met each other, and have covered ourselves more since then so it was really a part of ourselves,' Marlee told Daily Mail Australia. The pair, who met while they were studying at university, wanted to celebrate their love in a public way that was fun and unique to them, and decided to pull out all the stops to make sure their wedding reflected that. 'After four years together we went out to dinner, and were just talking about our future plans and marriage came up,' Marlee said. 'I asked if Jordan could see us getting married one day and he said he would want to, the conversation turned to - well if that's what we want to do, why don't we do it next year?,' she said. 'We settled on a date and that was that! After a high-5, we finished dinner and walked back to the car. I remember saying - are we really going to do this? And Jordan said, yeah why not? We both want to, let's just do it.' 'Our ceremony was beautiful, my Dad and our dog Pinto walked me down the aisle,' said Marlee . Marlee and Jordan wrote their own vows to read at the wedding, and they ended up being very similar . 'We wanted our wedding to reflect us as people - and to show our love for each other, and we look back on it knowing we achieved that,' Marlee said . From there, the couple collaborated on all the details of their wedding, including Marlee's hair colour, which she dyed to a vibrant purple, the colour it was when they first met, to 'pay tribute to the 'us' that was back then'. After a few hiccups, including a change of wedding venue six months out, rescheduling the date to lock down their wedding celebrant, and a bout of food poisoning two nights before the wedding, Marlee and Jordan were ready to say their 'I do's'. The morning of the wedding, Marlee and Jordan headed down to Officeworks in their pyjamas and then split up to prepare for the evening's ceremony. 'I had my mum and my two sister-in-laws and my bestie with me, we just sat around talking laughing and working on origami cranes for the wedding- these were all filled with handwritten notes to every guest, from me, a personal party favor,' Marlee said. After Marlee was in her wedding dress, she and photographer Jess Jackson went down to meet Jordan for the 'first look' as she stepped out of the elevator of her hotel. 'It was so nerve wracking and exciting. When we were waiting for the lift another guy was there waiting, and Jess asked if he would mind if we got in there alone - and sort of pointed to me and said it was my wedding day,' Marlee said. 'The guy said, ""Yeah, I would mind, I'm going to work"". I just couldn't stop laughing,' she said. 'It was nice to be brought back down to Earth and remember that even though it was our special day - the world keeps turning for everyone else.' The young couple hired a mobile tattoo van for their reception, and commissioned a set of custom designs . After the couple had said their vows, they headed outside for one of the most unique elements of the wedding- the signing of the registry while getting matching tattoos . Marlee and Jordan tattoos matching designs of swans with a love heart for their wedding . Marlee and Jordan chose their celebrant, Paul Vogue, because they knew he would understand what they wanted their wedding to look like. 'It was important to us that we had someone like Paul, who knew legally what needed to happen in the wedding - but considered that to be somewhat boring - what else can be done in the ceremony?' Marlee said. 'He encouraged us to be creative, and to most importantly, be ourselves.' 'Our ceremony was beautiful, my Dad and our dog Pinto walked me down the aisle, and Jordan's brothers and my brother stood beside us. Our vows were a surprise to each other - and ended up being remarkably similar,' Marlee said. 'I had been crying on and off all day - just nervous and excited for everything, but managed to feel completely confident during our vows. Jordan was the one who ended up crying - it was the first time I've ever seen him cry,' she said. After the couple had said their vows, they headed outside for one of the most unique elements of the wedding- the signing of the registry while getting matching tattoos. Marlee enlisted the services of one of her good friends, Luke Bishop, who operates Bishop's Mobile Tattooing . 15 of the couple's guests decided to get tattooed on the night, which Marlee said was a surprise . 'My Mum even got a massive tattoo. It was such a surprise as she has never really liked them,' Marlee said . 'Jordan and I wanted to get matching swans with a love heart. There's no real deep an meaningful reason for them, just a design I really liked and something that was a bit of a mystery to people when they see it,' Marlee said. 'We wanted a tattoo van there because we thought it was an awesome way to celebrate.' Marlee enlisted the services of one of her good friends, Luke Bishop, who owns and operates Bishop's Mobile Tattooing, with the inspiration for allowing their guests to join in the inking. 'When we approached him with the idea he thought it was awesome, and drew a flash sheet of 'love' images people could select from to get tattooed,' Marlee said. 15 of the couple's guests decided to get tattooed on the night, which Marlee said was a surprise. 'A lot of our family are more conventional and conservative than we are, so we weren't sure if they'd join in with getting tattooed or really like the idea, but we had discussed it and knew we wanted it - so we weren't worried,' Marlee said. 'My Mum even got a massive tattoo. It was such a surprise as she has never really liked them, but she was feeling the love that day so she got her husband's name, and her two kids. It was awesome,' she said. 'It's special to know you have people in your life who love you enough to get a tattoo,' Marlee said . 'The whole weekend of festivities was unique to us - we were surrounded by friends and family who were loving and supportive,' Marlee said . Marlee and her bridesmaids spent the morning working on origami cranes filled with handwritten notes to every guest as a personal party favor . 'It's special to know you have people in your life who love you enough to get a tattoo - and even though it was to celebrate a love in their own lives - it's cool to know they will always remember our wedding as a part of that tattoo.' Marlee and Jordan also chose to leave their mark on one another in a different way, combining their last names to start a new family line. Marlee, whose last name was Wiseman and Jordan, whose last name was Follett, melded their  surnames, and officially became Mr and Mrs Follman. 'We wanted our wedding to reflect us as people - and to show our love for each other, and we look back on it knowing we achieved that, and that the hard work we both put in to make it happen really paid off,' Marlee said. 'The whole weekend of festivities was unique to us - we were surrounded by friends and family who were loving and supportive, they were open minded enough to accept what we wanted to do - and they laughed at our jokes and references even if they didn't get it,' she said.

"Actor Joaquin Phoenix is fronting the latest animal rights campaign condemning the horrific conditions in China's dog leather trade. The Hollywood star  felt compelled to appear in a new video by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) after being shown sickening undercover footage taken by the group. It showed terrified dogs being savagely beaten to death with a stick before having their skin ripped off their bodies and turned into leather. Introducing the clip, Phoenix said it was 'one of the worst things I've ever seen' before detailing the barbaric treatment of the animals as the viewer is shown shocking scenes inside Chinese factories. Scroll down for videos . Undercover footage by an animals rights group shows factory workers beating dogs to death before ripping their skin off their bodies and turning it into leather to fuel a global trade in canine fashion accessories . The carcasses of dogs hang in the slaughteryard, the ground thick with their blood. PETA Asia's investigator saw workers peel the skin off dogs who were still alive . Hollywood actor Joachin Phoenix felt compelled to appear in a new appeal by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) after being shown sickening undercover footage taken by the group in December . A pair of gloves made using dog skin. With dog meat restaurants popular in many parts of the country, several establishments later sell the animals' skin to leather producers, which likely sell to Western stores . He says: 'Dogs like these are taken from China's streets and beaten to death. 'Their skin is turned into leather gloves, belts and other accessories. 'Terrified dogs watch as those ahead of them are kicked and beaten over the head and then have their throats slit and the skin peeled right off their bodies. 'When their turn comes - it won't be quick.' The original footage, released by PETA in December, shows workers standing by a door at a slaughterhouse in the northern province of Hebei. As dogs are led through, the men kill them with a heavy stick. Sometimes it takes several blows to finish off the unwitting animals. Meathooks sway grimly in the foreground. PETA Asia's investigator saw workers peel the skin off dogs who were still alive. Terrified dogs are snatched off the street and thrown into cages before being slaughtered and skinned . The skin is then turned into leather and sold to unsuspecting customers around the world, including, the group claims, in Britain. Phoenix said: 'If you buy leather gloves, belts or shoes, remember there no easy way to tell who's skin your really in. 'If you love dogs like I do, the please never buy or wear leather, whether it comes from a dog, a cow or any other animal.' In December, PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk said: 'PETA is sure that Britain, Australia and the U.S. are not exempt from the dog leather trade. 'Many British high-street retailers are importing cheap leather from China, so products made from dog skin are almost certainly on the shelves and in people's wardrobes. 'Skin looks the same, whoever it comes from, and Chinese dog killers are not likely to advertise their skins honestly, so it's impossible to tell if those leather gloves or wallets are made out of dog, cow, pig, or goat skin. 'PETA is calling on British shoppers to consider the terror that dogs and other animals endure when they're mercilessly slaughtered and make the safe, vegan choice in clothing and accessories for the holidays and every day.' Without conducting expensive DNA tests, it is virtually impossible to know exactly what kind of animal   leather is made from. The organisation said it visited three slaughterhouses and six processing plants in central China during a year-long investigation into the slaughter of dogs and the production of dog skin. Cruel hand: A pile of dog corpses on the back of a van. Their skin is being used to make gloves, shoes and other leather products at a factory in China, reports an animal rights charity .

A dog slaughterer told PETA Asia's investigator that the facility bludgeoned and skinned 100 to 200 dogs a day. About 300 dogs are kept in the compound, and some can be seen frantically climbing over one another in an attempt to escape the packed holding cell. Although the dog-meat industry in China is well known, this is the first time that the production of Chinese dog leather has been captured on camera. News agency Reuters confirmed the use of dog skin during a visit to an open-air leather processing workshop, where workers stretched washed hides to dry in the sun. With dog meat restaurants popular in many parts of the country, several establishments later sell the animals' skin to leather producers, workers at the Hebei workshop said. 'There are restaurants that sell dog meat and people that eat dog meat,' said one leather producer, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media. 'These places have a person who specially comes and collects the skins; they'll go to each place and take a few,' he said, referring to the producers. 'It happens all over the country.' Officials of the quasi-governmental China Leather Industry Association declined to be interviewed, saying they had no knowledge of dogs being used in leather production. The Ministry of Agriculture did not respond to repeated requests for interview on conditions in the slaughtering industry, which it oversees.

The plants PETA visited were producing leather for export, said Haleigh Chang, one of the organisation's representatives. 'One owner of a processing plant told us they export dog skin as lamb skin,' she said, adding that lack of transparency on the part of producers made it hard to estimate the size of the dog skin sector within the overall leather industry. China has faced criticism for its treatment of animals, including bears, whose bile is used in traditional medicines. Tigers are also bred and killed, in some areas, for their pelts and bones.

"Discarded stone tools made by early humans have formed a vast 'carpet' in part of the Sahara desert in what scientists say could be the first man-made landscape. Archaeologists working in southern Libya have found that large sections of a 350km (217 miles) long escarpment has been built up from dropped stone tools. They discovered as many as 75 tools in just a single square metre of ground along the slopes of Massak Settafet, near Fezzan, Libya. Scroll down for video . The Massak Settafet escarpment (above) near Fezzan Libya could be the world's first man-made landscape . And they have estimated that there could be between 500,000 and five million tools created by early humans for every square kilometre of Africa. This is the equivalent amount of rock as that used to build the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. It is hard for scientists to say precisely when humans started making tools because the more primitive remains look like a natural object rather than a human artefact. The oldest-known instruments are the Oldowan stone tools from Ethiopia, which date back about 2.6 million years. The Acheulean tool technology period - up to 1.76 million years ago - featured large stone hand axes made from flint and quartzite. Towards the end of this period, the tools became more refined and then followed the so-called Levallois technique, which saw the creation of scrapers, slicers, needled and flattened needles. About 50,000 years ago more refined and specialised flint tools were made and used by Neanderthals and it is believed it was at this stage tools were constructed out of bone. As human culture advanced, artefacts such as fish hooks, buttons and bone needles were used. Cut marks have found on animal bones that have been dated to be 3.4 million years old - around the time that a squat ape-like ancestor called Australopithecus afarensis - known as Lucy - roamed Africa. The researchers behind the study claim their findings may force a rethink on how we define human history and the impact we have had on the environment. Dr Marta Mirazón Lahr, a reader in human evolution at the University of Cambridge, said: 'The term 'anthropocene' is now used to denote the point at which humans began to have a significant effect on the environment. 'The critical time may well be the beginning of the industrial revolution about 200 years ago. 'Some talk of an 'early anthropocene' about 10,000 years ago when forests began being cleared for agriculture. 'Making stone tools, however, dates back more than two million years, and little research has been done on the impact of this activity. 'The Messak Settafet is the earliest demonstrated example of the scars of human activity across an entire landscape. 'The effects of our technology on the environment may be considerably older than previously thought.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Public Library of Science One conducted a survey of the site in the Sahara in 2011 by randomly examining plots along the plateau of the Massak Settafet enscarpment. They sifted through the sandstone rocks in each plot searching for those that showed signs that they had been worked by humans. One of the key pieces of evidence for human tool making is a characteristic bulge or dent on the surface of a stone known as a bulb of percussion. This is created by the angular blow from a human as they attempted to knock flakes off larger pieces of rock. The researchers estimate there are millions of stone tools like the one above littering the landscape in Libya . The stone tools were discovered along a 217 mile long escarpment in Messak Settafet in southern Libya . The researchers found an average of 75 man-made tools in each square metre they looked in - ranging from large flakes knocked off boulders that were used for cutting to sophisticated stone shapes. They found evidence that specific tools had been used to wedge into pieces of stone to help slit it in certain ways. Dr Robert Foley, from the Leverhulme Centre for Evolutionary Studies at the University of Cambridge who also took part in the study, said: 'The Messak sandstone, now in the middle of the vast sand seas of Libya, would have been a high quality rock for hominins to fracture. The Messak Settafet runs for 350km (217 miles) and much of it appears to have been shaped by human hands . 'The landscape is in effect a carpet of stone tools, most probably made in the Middle and Upper Pleistocene. 'It is clear from the scale of activity how important stone tools were, and shows that African hominins were strongly technologically dependent. 'Landscapes such as these must have been magnets for hominin populations, either for ""stone foraging trips"" or residential occupation.' The researchers say that the intensive stone tool industry in the Messak Settafet also shaped the landscape in a way that helped later human inhabitants. The landscape is dotted with small quarrying pits where stone was bashed out from larger boulders to leave holes around two metres wide and half a metre deep. Scientists looked for bulges or dents on the surface of stones, like above, for signs of human modification . The rocks above appear to have been broken off a larger boulder or had chunks bashed off them by humans . These pits would have helped to trap water, which would have attracted game. In many of these pits the scientists found 'trapping stones' - large rocks used for traps and ties for game or cattle over the past 10,000 years. By combining their data with previous extensive surveys carried out across Africa, the researchers also attempted to estimate roughly how much stone had been used as tools and discarded during human evolution. Although stone tool manufacture dates back at least 2.5 million years, the researchers limited the estimate to one million years. They estimated that there could be an average of between 0.5 and 5 million stone artefacts per square kilometre across Africa. The research team from the University of Cambridge studied the rocks in metre square plots on the groun .","Archaeologists at the University of Cambridge found huge numbers of stone tools on the ground in Massak Settafet near Fezzan in southern Libya .

"Though most brides dream of their one-off wedding dress being hand sewn by designer couturiers, that could soon be a thing of the past. One company in China is now making 3D printed bridal dresses. Unveiled at the TCT + Personalize Asia exhibition Shanghai this weekend, the dresses have been created using advanced technologies and nylon powder, rather than silks, lace and chiffon. The future of fashion? Two 3D printed wedding dresses were unveiled this weekend at Shanghai's TCT + Personalize Asia technology expo, created by Chinese designers specialising in digital technology . But despite their less-than-luxury beginnings, the designers claim the dresses are soft to touch, comfortable to wear and durable too. Created by Chinese 3D printing specialists Xuberance, who also make ties, hair pins, jewellery and home accessories using the technology, the dresses could signal fashion of the future. Rather than the revered traditional dressmaking skills of Parisian couturiers, normally fantasised about by brides-to-be, these dresses are made using a process called selective laser sintering (SLS). The dress 'fabric' is constructed by using lasers to fuse together the nylon powder, slowly building up the material in layers. Each dress takes around one week to make, using advanced digital technologies and laser techniques, to fuse together nylon powders. The specialist process however, comes with a high price tag . The cost of the 3D printed wedding dresses is yet to be revealed, but a bridal veil made using the same specialist process is expected to retail at 20,000 Chinese yuan (approximately £2167.35) And it's not just dresses and accessories that Xuberance applies their innovative digital technology to. Though details have been kept under wraps, a 3D printed wedding cake and sugar flowers were also on display at the exhibition. But if you were hoping to cut costs by skipping the bridal shops, it seems unlikely. A 3D printed veil  created using the same process currently costs 20,000 Chinese yuan (approximately £2167.35), while a metallic effect headpiece retails at 5,000 yuan (around £541.84) in the company's online shop. The dresses are, as with the most sought-after haute couture bridal designers, being given the 'price on request' treatment, but since they each take a week to 'print out', costs are likely to be high. Despite shunning traditional fabrics like chiffon or lace, the tech-savvy dresses are intricately detailed and designed to resemble the real thing, but offer new scope for more ambitious patterns . Would you wear Xuberance? Though bridal dreams are traditionally filled with thoughts of Chanel, Vera Wang and Oscar de la Renta, new technology could soon change the face of wedding fashion .","Forget gowns hand made by couturiers - these come from 3D printers .

"A woman who negotiated a year-long 'open marriage' with the husband she'd been with for 17 years and took the chance to sleep with 12 strangers has opened up about her wild year. Robin Rinaldi, 50, had always considered herself a 'good girl', but ended up being so transformed by what she referred to as her 'wild oats project' that she left her husband after the 12 months ended. Rinaldi, who lives in San Francisco, had previous slept with only four men including husband Scott Mansfield. 'WIld oats': Robin Wright, 50, negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years, which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship . But during her year of abandon, she bedded ten men and two women, whom she picked up online, in bars and at sex classes. She made the life-changing decision to pursue sex with other people in 2008 - and has written a book about her exploits called The Wild Oats Project. Rinaldi described her relationship with Mansfield, a brewer and wine-maker, as 'stuck in a rut', adding that 'our once-a-week sex life was loving, but lacked spontaneity and passion'. But she decided to make the change after begging him for years to have a child with her, and finally realizing that he wouldn't after he got a vasectomy. Struggle: Wright said her husband, Scott Mansfield, right, was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children, driving her to want lovers instead . Reliving the fraught decision in her book, she wrote: 'I refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers... If I can’t have one, I must have the other'. Under the terms of her new deal, Rinaldi took out an apartment, where she lived from Monday to Friday and would bed her conquests. But over the weekend she would go back to Mansfield, and the two would live as a married couple, without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart. Initially, the two agreed not to sleep with mutual friends, get into any 'serious' relationships or have unprotected sex - but ultimately failed to stick to them. Rinaldi wrote how she started out by posting an online ad, entitled Good Girl Seeks Experience. In the post, she wrote: 'I'm a 44-year-old professional, educated, attractive woman in an open marriage, seeking single men age 35-50 to help me explore my sexuality.' Account: Rinaldi describes every step of the 'project' in intimate detail in her newly-released book, The Wild Oats Project . The next day, she had 23 offers, she recounted to the New York Post. Her first encounter was a 40-year-old lawyer, whom she bedded in her apartment on the second date. Describing the night, she wrote: 'We stumbled to the bed, where he turned me onto my hands and knees and took me from behind. 'We had intercourse twice and, after he left, I felt satiated.' She later moved on to much younger men, and described texting her husband goodnight from a Las Vegas hotel room moments after a 23-year-old paramour left the room. Two of her 12 encounters were with women, one of which was a threesome. Describing another encounter, she writes explicitly about taking a new-found pleasure in fellatio. In the extract, quoted by the Daily Beast, she wrote: '[penises are] beautiful… I took pleasure in mastering them from up close, watching them expand and harden, tracing the ridges of their warm architecture against the roof of my mouth.' However, after the raucous year, Rinaldi admitted, she could not turn back. Attempts to rekindle their marriage after the year failed - and Rinaldi began sleeping with one of the men from the past year, whom she refers to by a pseudonym. She wrote: 'The turning point was hearing from Alden. He sent me an e-mail, out of the blue, several months after the project had come to an end. 'Before long, we were having sex again. Being with him was exquisite. After reconnecting with Alden and falling deeply in love with him, there was no going back.' Irretrievable: After Rinaldi's year of uninhibited encounters, she was unable to rekindle her loving marriage with Mansfield, and the two now have different partners . Rinaldi has now lived with 'Alden' for five years in a monogamous relationship, while Mansfield has also moved on. The former couple now consider themselves at peace - and Mansfield was even happy with her writing the book, detailing every aspect of their sex lives and her previously secret exploits with other men. Speaking to the Daily Beast about how he responded to the book, she said: 'His response was, ""You have to write it. If you write it well, it won’t really be about us, it will be about lots of marriages.""'","'Good girl' writer Robin Rinaldi had been with Scott Mansfield since 1990s .

"Arrested again: Radio DJ Neil Fox was arrested after voluntarily attending a central London police station today in connection with a sexual assault . Radio DJ Neil Fox was today arrested for the third time on suspicion of sexual offences. The 53-year-old, who has been suspended from his job at Magic FM while police inquiries continue, is accused of a woman in the 1990s. In September Fox, who lives in Fulham, south west London with his wife and children, was arrested in relation to four alleged incidents against two women. Two months later he revisited a central London police station where he was accused of three more offences. Today Scotland Yard confirmed he had been arrested again in relation to an additional alleged incident. The eight alleged incidents are said to have taken place in the 1990s, in 2007 and in the past year. Fox, a former Pop Idol judge, vehemently denied the allegations after his first arrest. Today a Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Officers from Westminster arrested a 53-year-old man last September following four allegations of sexual assault against two women. 'Three of the allegations are non-recent; one is from earlier this year. 'The man was arrested at a business address in central London and taken to a central London police station. 'Officers subsequently searched addresses in Fulham and the Littlehampton area of West Sussex. 'On Monday December 8th he returned on bail to a central London police station and was arrested for a further three sexual assaults involving different women. 'Two allegations are said have happened in the 1990s, the third was said to have happened in 2007. Scroll down for video . 'Today, he voluntarily attended a central London police station and was further arrested for an allegation of sexual assault against an additional female victim. This offence is said to have happened in the early 1990s. 'The man has now been bailed to return pending further inquiries to a date in late March.' Mr Fox was first held by detectives on September 30 at the Magic FM offices in London just moments after coming off-air . Following his arrest last September the DJ, who rose to fame in the late 1980s at London's Capital Radio, vowed to clear his name. Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, began his career in local radio before moving to Radio Luxembourg and then London's Capital Radio in the late 1980s. He presented various slots there and in 1993, landed the job of presenting the Sunday afternoon Network Chart Show, later known as the Pepsi chart. His big TV break, which brought him to a wider audience, was as a judge on ITV talent show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman, and Nicki Chapman. Fox later appeared in the BBC Three sketch show The Wrong Door. He left Capital in 2005 and joined Magic 105.4, where he presented the breakfast show until being suspended following his arrest last September. Speaking outside the south west London home where he lives with his 41-year-old wife and three children the day after being arrested, he told gathered reporters: ‘Obviously I had a very stressful day yesterday - it was a complete surprise. ‘I haven’t really got much very to say in terms of a statement at the moment. I need to go and speak to my lawyer and see where it all stands and just see where we are.’ ‘I’ve got three young children trying to get on with their school life and you have to respect their privacy in all of this. 'It’s nothing to do with them, obviously. It’s to do with me and the serious allegations made against me, and obviously what I want to do is work hard to clear my name. 'As and when I've got more to say I will.’ Officers spent some seven hours questioning the DJ before bailing him. He was suspended from his regular slot at Magic FM as a result, with the station eager to allow him 'to devote his full attention to dealing with these matters. 'All other aspects of his contract will remain unchanged while matters are resolved. 'We can make no further comment at this stage.’ Fox's arrest is not part of Operation Yewtree - the high profile Scotland Yard investigation into alleged sexual offences that was sparked by the Jimmy Savile scandal. Fox (far right) is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. He has also presented a Channel 5 show based on the Top 40 Chart .

"It is an incredible moment when, after hours of waiting, you finally get to see a whale swimming in the ocean. And wildlife photographer, Jon Cornforth, 43, managed an even rarer sighting when he witnessed two of the majestic mammals exploding out of northern Pacific Ocean together, before coming crashing down in unison. The rare event was documented off the coast of Hawaii and took place near the humpback whales' breeding grounds. In sync! The gigantic sea giants rose out of the water together, and crash into the waves in unison . Scientists still do not fully understand why 40-tonne whales choose to throw themselves out of the water- but why two would decide to leap into the air at the same time is a greater mystery still . Jon Conforth has been capturing humpback whales for 15 years and says he doesn't have time to think about a composition or change camera settings when witnessing the perfect breach . Cornforth said: 'When this double breach happened, I knew that I had just seen something special, but prayed that my camera had captured the moment. 'I was howling with joy as I quickly scrolled through my images and realised that magnitude of what I had just photographed. 'Keep in mind, that I was doing this while still motoring my small boat in heavy seas with several whales still very close by.' The photographer has been capturing humpback whales for 15 years and says he doesn't have time to think about a composition or change camera settings when witnessing the perfect breach. 'I don't have time to think about composition or change my camera settings,' he said. 'I simply do what I've become proficient at and point my camera and push the shutter button.' Although he may only see the leap unfold in a second, his camera is firing at 10 frames per second to get the detailed shot. Fun with friends! The whales frolic in the waves in unison, propelling themselves into the air to the delight of photographer Cornforth . Majestic: The sight of a humpback whale rising out of the waves is breathtaking for any onlookers . It is not been categorically proven by scientists why the sea giants propel themselves out of the water, though it has been suggested it is a form of social communication. Some say it is a form of warding off predators, with larger mammals creating a resounding smash as they hit the surface. Other explanations say it simply a way of removing parasites from their bodies. It is not categorically proven why whales breach out of the waters but some think it is ward off predators with the sound . Other suggestions for why they breach are to rid themselves of parasites and communicate with other whales . Female whales can often be seen nudging their calves to the surface in order to learn how to breach. Whatever the reason, the sight is still a breathtaking one, especially when you are metres away from the 40-tonne creatures. The photographs capture the sheer power of these mammals, which can reach 62.5 ft in length. Humpback whales are common in the Hawaii area, as they migrate here annually to breed in the warmer waters . Humpback whales are known for their mystical songs, which can travel for vast distances through the ocean. They are omnivores, but can be found near coastlines feeding on krill, plankton and other small fish. Annually the whales migrate to warmer waters closer to the equator to breed.

Located 415-417 Collins Street, the retail property was auctioned off in front of a crowd of 200 spectators, while 12 parties vied to call the place their own.

"Two bungling armed raiders who fled an attempted robbery empty handed and were chased down the road by customers after pointing a gun at a cashier have been jailed. Luke Carty, 27, and Jason Dalton, 26, were captured on CCTV bursting into a petrol station in Coventry during the attempted raid last August. The hapless pair were later caught when detectives found their clothes dumped nearby which contained their DNA. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Luke Carty (left), who was captured on CCTV pointing a gun at the cashier, was sentenced to six years and seven months behind bars, while look-out Jason Dalton (right) was jailed for six years and four months . In the 30-second CCTV video released by police, Carty is seen pointing a gun at the cashier's chest while demanding he hand over the takings from the till while Dalton stands as a look-out by the door. Incredibly, the cashier refused to hand over the money and the pair fled the BP garage empty-handed. The garage worker and two brave customers then chased the men for half-a-mile but lost them when they disappeared behind the nearby Craven Arms pub. Officers from West Midlands Police later discovered a hoodie and T-shirt used by Carty as a makeshift mask. Threatens cashier: CCTV footage shows Luke Carty pointing the gun at the cashier and demanding the money from the till . Acting as look-out: Dalton, 26, is seen standing nervously by the entrance to the BP garage . DNA taken from the clothing returned a match to both men and on September 12 last year they were arrested after officers spotted them acting suspiciously around parked cars. Both initially denied being involved in the armed raid with Dalton, of no fixed address, claiming he'd lost the T-shirt on a drunken night out. But they later admitted attempted robbery and possessing an imitation firearm at Coventry Crown Court. On Friday Carty was jailed for six years seven months while Dalton was handed a six year four month prison term. Detective Constable Stephen Phillips said: 'This was an audacious armed robbery in the middle of the day. Failed attempt: Carty, 27, appears to grab something from the counter before running away . Fleeing: The men desperately scramble out of the door empty-handed after being refused money . 'We suspect the handgun was an imitation but clearly the cashier wouldn't have known that in the drama of the situation. 'The staff member was exceptionally brave and gave chase while relaying details to police with a swift 999 call. 'Dalton and Carty managed to escape but crucially we seized clothing used during the attack - and it proved their downfall because forensics analysts returned a DNA hit pointing to them as the offenders. 'These are dangerous men who have rightly been handed lengthy jail sentences.' Chased: After leaving the petrol garage, the men were chased half a mile by the cashier and customers .

"The battle for live streaming smartphone video heated up Thursday as Twitter launched its Periscope application, taking on fast-rising online rival Meerkat. The Periscope app, like Meerkat, allows anyone to stream live video to a wide audience with their smartphone. It comes as Meerkat, a cult hit, unveiled a fresh round of capital investment. Scroll down for video . Twitter says the Periscope app is available to iPhone users, and lets them broadcast live video and audio online. And Android version is in the works, the firm said. When Meerkat first launched last month it imported a user's Twitter followers as well as showed who they were following. However, this was said to have annoyed Twitter and the social network cut off Meerkat's access to this service. Meerkat has found a way around this though by adding a search feature that lets users find their favourite Twitter users. The new app 'lets you share and experience live video from your mobile phone' and is 'a perfect complement to Twitter, which is why we acquired the company in January,' Twitter's Kevin Weil said in a blog post. The Periscope team outlined a range of possibilities for the service, including how it can turn any smartphone user into a global reporter. 'What if you could see through the eyes of a protester in Ukraine? Or watch the sunrise from a hot air balloon in Cappadocia?' the Periscope team blog said. 'It may sound crazy, but we wanted to build the closest thing to teleportation. 'While there are many ways to discover events and places, we realized there is no better way to experience a place right now than through live video.' The team said it sees tremendous potential for the app, which is available to iPhone users with one for Android devices in the works. 'Whether you're witnessing your daughter's first steps or a newsworthy event, Periscope offers an audience and the power of a shared experience,' the blog said. It was even forced to tweak the service due to its popularity. Popular members of this new social network quickly noticed notifications would appear every single time someone followed them. Periscope says it has now officially turning off all notifications for now. 'Later we'll change so default is off, but users can opt in,' the company told Business Insider. Earlier this month, as Meerkat was becoming a craze at the South by Southwest festival, Twitter cut Meerkat's access to some features, which could limit its ability to grow. The same day, Meerkat announced it had raised $14 million in venture funding, and founder Ben Rubin sounded unfazed by the Twitter announcement. In a Meerkat stream announcing the new funding, Rubin called Periscope 'a very slick product, a very beautiful product' but that there was room for multiple players in live video. The Periscope team outlined a range of possibilities for the service, including how it can turn any smartphone user into a global reporter. 'If you have a good idea and you don't think there's 10 other smart teams working on it already, then you don't have a good idea,' he said. The funding round was led by the private equity group Greylock Partners, whose Josh Elman joined the Meerkat board. 'It's not about competition, it's about this massive pie,' or market, that's being created, Elman said in the Meerkat stream from a San Francisco park. Elman added that while other live video services had been available before, they did not take off because of a lack of network capacity and enough people using smartphones for video. 'This truly feels like a beginning of a new era,' Elman said. Meerkat effectively turns your phone into a portable webcam and lets you live stream whatever you point your handset's camera towards. It has a simple premise: press the Stream button, point the phone's camera at a scene and a link to stream is automatically tweeted from a connected account . Meerkat said in a blog post that the funding round participants also included Comcast Ventures, Entree Capital, Raine Ventures, Sherpa, Slow Ventures, Universal Music Group, 'and many awesome friends like (actor) Jared Leto, (investor) David Tisch and (YouTube co-founder) Chad Hurley.' The funding has star power as well with participation from the United Talent Agency (UTA) which represents Hollywood actors and Sound Ventures, which includes the actor Ashton Kutcher. 'We aspire to become the most comprehensive and most impactful participatory live streaming community,' Meerkat's blog said. The Periscope app, like Meerkat, allows anyone to stream live video to a wide audience with their smartphone ©Andrew Burton (Getty/AFP/File) Meerkat has become a key political tool in recent weeks, with Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush 'meerkatting' his speech last week before Georgia's state legislature. 'Every minute -- literally every minute -- of every day of the campaign will be available live to anyone who wants it, no matter where they are,' Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior advisor to President Barack Obama, wrote in a column. Commercial uses for Meerkat-like apps are also likely, says Anna Francis at the digital marketing group My Social Agency. Because video has a stronger impact than other content, Francis said in a blog post, 'Meerkat has an opportunity to change social media forever and make a big impact on digital marketing.'","Periscope app allows anyone to stream live video to a wide audience .

"The end of the hated annual tax return will be signalled by the Chancellor today. George Osborne will use his last Budget before the General Election to unveil digital tax accounts for millions who currently have to complete self-assessment forms. They will work like online bank accounts and keep an up-to-the-minute record of all the tax someone owes or has paid. George Osborne will unveil digital tax accounts for millions in his Budget today . New digital tax accounts are designed to end hassle for individuals but also boost business by significantly cutting down on red tape. Individuals and firms can already choose to fill in their annual tax return online, but this is simply the paper form on a website. Once a year, and a year behind, taxpayers have to send HMRC information it already holds on income – meaning many people end up with tax affairs that are out of date and incorrectly coded. They have only one opportunity a year to interact with tax officials to reconcile their account and notify them of any change of circumstances. The digital accounts will allow such updates at any time. It will mean users can see all the taxes they need to pay without having to complete a tax return, and pay taxes they owe when it suits them – by linking to their bank account so they can pay in instalments or by direct debit, for instance. There will be particular advantages for businesses, which currently have to pay different taxes at different times, including VAT, corporation tax, income tax and National Insurance. By early 2016, all five million small businesses and the first ten million individuals will have access to digital tax accounts. All businesses in the UK and 55million individuals will have one by the end of the next Parliament. Those who have difficulty gaining access to the internet will continue to be allowed to submit paper returns, or be offered support. Officials claim the system will cut the time it takes to complete tax returns from an average of 40 minutes to just ten minutes a year. The accounts will allow tax to be paid at any time and will radically simplify the payment of various levies for businesses. Because the system will be automatically updated with information from employers, pension providers or banks, taxpayers will not have to submit duplicate information about their income. The populist reform is the centrepiece of an intensely political Budget. Mr Osborne will hail the Government’s economic record, saying 1,000 jobs a day have been created during its time in power – more than the rest of the EU combined. The Chancellor will seek to frame the choice facing voters as one between an economic plan that is working but only half complete, and the ‘chaos’ of a weak Labour government. Other Budget announcements are expected to include: . The Chancellor is expected to say: ‘The critical choice facing the country now is this: do we return to the chaos of the past? Or do we say to the British people, let’s work through the plan that is delivering for you? ‘Today we make that critical choice: we choose the future. We have a plan that is working – and this is a Budget that works for you.’ Falling inflation and lower borrowing costs are expected to slash the Chancellor’s projected borrowing bill by around £20billion over the next five years. Officials claim the online system will cut the time it takes to complete tax returns from an average of 40 minutes to just ten minutes a year . Better-than-expected borrowing forecasts mean that by the end of the next Parliament, Mr Osborne is expected to have £10billion a year to play with if the Tories remain in power. This would allow him to fund his commitment to raise the income tax threshold further to £12,500, and the 40p rate threshold to £50,000 by 2020. But officials insist there will be no debt-funded ‘giveaways’, saying any tax breaks must be paid with public spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere. The Chancellor says he will raise £5billion in the next Parliament by cracking down on tax avoidance, including a new ‘Google tax’ to stop big multi-national firms shifting profits around in efforts to avoid paying tax in the UK. The lifetime allowance of tax-free pension savings is likely to be cut from £1.25million to £1million – as revealed in the Mail this month. The move would jeopardise Labour’s plans to use cuts to pension tax relief to fund a reduction in student tuition fees to £6,000 a year. Savings of up to £40,000 a year qualify for tax relief with a limit of £1.25million over the lifetime of a pension pot. Above this, a tax of 55 per cent applies. A lifetime allowance of £1million would cap final-salary scheme payouts at £50,000 a year and defined-contribution payouts at around £26,000 a year. The news comes as it emerged that George Osborne is expected to let widows, widowers and surviving civil partners of police or firemen killed on duty to keep their spouse’s pension if they remarry. At the moment, they lose their pension if they remarry or move in with a new partner. The Government recently changed the rules on this for Armed Forces spouses.","George Osborne will use his last Budget to unveil new digital tax accounts .

"Heart-stopping camera footage has been released of two gunmen calmly strolling through Tunisia's National Bardo musuem in the terror attack which left 23 people dead. The one-minute video posted on the government's Interior Ministry Facebook page shows the two men scurrying through the Tunis museum, carrying assault rifles and bags. One of the attackers is wearing a baseball cap and a heavy jacket, while the other has a red hoodie and tracksuit pants. At one point, they encounter another man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs. They briefly acknowledge each other and let the unidentified man walk free before unleashing the deadly attack in the country's largest museum.

The video also shows stills of the dead gunmen who were killed in a firefight with security forces, including a picture indicating at least one was wearing an explosive belt. ISIS claimed Wednesday's attack on foreign tourists in Tunis, the deadliest involving foreigners in Tunisia since a 2002 suicide bombing on the island of Djerba. Tunisian fighters make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to ISIS in Syria, with as many as 10,000 having signed up. The government said the two gunmen had trained in jihadi camps in Libya before the attack inside the heavily secured Tunisian parliament compound. Among the 23 dead in Wednesday's attack, 17 were cruise ship tourists, including British mother-of-two Sally Adey. They also included a Tunisian policeman. Mrs Adey, 57, from Shropshire, had been on a cruise of the Mediterranean with her husband, Robert, and was on an excursion to the museum.

Police in Tunisia have arrested five people described as directly tied to the two gunmen. Four others said to be supporters of the cell were also arrested in central Tunisia, not far from where a group claiming allegiance to al Qaida's North African branch has been active. ISIS issued a statement and audio on jihadi websites applauding the dead gunmen as 'knights' for their 'blessed invasion of one of the dens of infidels and vice in Muslim Tunisia'. As investigations into the massacre continue, Tunisian security officials have been asked why the world-famous museum was completely unprotected. The government now plans to deploy the army to major cities to bolster security following the shootings. In an address to mark 59 years of independence from France yesterday, Tunisia's president Beji Caid Essebsi said: 'We won't win if we don't stand together. We will be merciless in the defence of our country.' The attack is a huge blow for Tunisia's tourism industry (which accounts for seven per cent of the country’s GDP) and its government.

"For the first time since April 1865 curators have brought together most of the artifacts from the night that President Abraham Lincoln was shot at Ford's Theatre just blocks from the White House. A new exhibition, Silent Witnesses: Artifacts Of The Lincoln Assassination, running from next Monday to May 25 at the theater's campus will give an unprecedented look at the 16th president's death 150 years later. The tiny Deringer pistol that delivered the fatal wound, a blood-stained flag and garments used to cradle Lincoln's head and his coat and top hat offer an intimate look at a moment that changed history, said Ford's Theatre curator Tracey Avant. Scroll down for video . A large photograph depicting President Abraham Lincoln and First Lady Mary Lincoln is displayed at a new exhibit entitled Silent Witnesses: Artifacts Of The Lincoln Assassination at the Ford's Center for Education and Leadership across the street from the historic Ford's Theatre in Washington .

The exhibit is open to the public March 23 to May 25 and coincides with the 150th anniversary of the Lincoln assassination on April 14 . 'There were real people behind these artifacts,' she said. 'We'll never know what would have happened if he hadn't been assassinated, but we know the impact he has left even with his live being cut short.' Curators present the history in four acts to show how Lincoln's final night transpired. Act 1: A Night Out . Starting five blocks away from the theater at the National Museum of American History, visitors can see the black carriage that brought the president and Mary Todd Lincoln to Ford's Theatre along with a young couple as their guests, Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris. In those days, presidents provided their own transportation, and this was one of the Lincolns' three carriages. A playbill would have greeted the Lincoln party when they arrived, announcing the final night of the comedy Our American Cousin. Orchestra seats were $1, while private box seats sold for $6 and $10.

The Lincolns arrived late to Ford's Theatre, and the performance had already begun. Actress and theater manager Laura Keene saw the first family and stopped the show, and the orchestra played Hail To The Chief, drawing cheers and applause. A rarely seen violin and drum sticks from the theater's musicians now recall that moment. Theater goers later said that Lincoln looked happier than he had looked in years. Lincoln and his guests took their box seats, and the show resumed. An illustration showing the assassination of US President Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre, left. Lincoln died at 7.22 a.m. on April 15, 1865 . John Wilkes Booth's derringer pistol used to kill President Abraham Lincoln is also on display . Act 3: The President is Shot . Not long after the start of Act 3, a well-known actor named John Wilkes Booth slipped into the presidential box. He carried a small Deringer pistol and fired at Lincoln's head from just inches away. When Rathbone tried to stop him, Booth slashed at the young Union officer with a large knife and jumped down to the stage before escaping. A young doctor rushed to Lincoln's aid, and Keene, the lead actress, brought water. Keene kept blood-stained fragments from her dress from when she cradled the president's head in her lap. An American flag decorating the presidential box also was folded and used as a pillow for Lincoln's head. An Associated Press correspondent at the time, Lawrence Gobright, recovered the pistol in the theater box and turned it over to police.

Act 4: The Vigil . The wounded president was taken across the street to Petersen House as doctors tried to save his life. Outside, the public gathered for an all-night vigil until Lincoln's death at 7:22 a.m. on April 15, 1865. For the first time since that night, Lincoln's blood-stained Brooks Brothers Great Coat is being reunited with Mary Todd Lincoln's black velvet cloak that she wore by his side.

"The estranged wife of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling turned her romantic rival's words against her in court Friday, playing a recording that showed her husband showered V Stiviano with millions of dollars in gifts. In closing arguments in the trial seeking the return of more than $2.8million in community property the Sterlings acquired over six decades of marriage, Shelly Sterling's lawyer relied on the words of Miss Stiviano to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy. ‘The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,’ Stiviano said in snippet. ‘That's it, that's over. End of case,’ attorney Pierce O'Donnell said. Testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court wasn't as clear-cut even after Sterling's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks Donald Sterling drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of Stiviano's $1.8million Spanish-style duplex near Beverly Hills. Scroll down for video . Back in court: V. Stiviano, 32, pictured here arriving at Los Angeles Superior court Friday, painted two conflicting portraits of Donald Sterling, saying he was a kind, generous mentor and father figure to her but was a 'bigot' who was mean to others . A trick up her sleeve: Donald Sterling's wife, Shelly, had her lawyer play a recording in court Friday that showed her husband showered V Stiviano with millions of dollars in gifts . While an accountant for Sterling conservatively estimated that Stiviano got more than $3.6million in Sterling gifts that included a Ferrari and Paris shopping spree, O'Donnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than $1million in cash, saying the lower figure lined up with Stiviano's own admissions on the witness stand, depositions and court filings. Judge Richard Fruin Jr, who didn't indicate how soon he would rule, had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the Sterling family's real estate company to Stiviano's bank accounts. Defense lawyer Mac Nehoray reiterated that point in his closing argument. He attacked the credibility of witnesses, particularly Donald Sterling, who had suggested Stiviano got her name on the home title illegally because she was part Hispanic and had buddied up to a Hispanic banker and escrow officer. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Donald Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers basketball games. In the furor sparked when the remarks were made public, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2billion. Nehoray spent most of his argument trying to convince the judge that the law doesn't allow Shelly Sterling to go after a third party like Stiviano because of a breach of fiduciary duty by her husband. Key witness: Stiviano was called to testify in the non-jury trial of a lawsuit brought by Donald Sterling's wife, which seeks the return of $3.6million . ‘Say he gave $2,000 to a call girl,’ Nehoray said. ‘Mrs. Sterling can't go and try to get that money back. We know that's not how it works.’ In her testimony earlier Friday, Stiviano painted two conflicting portraits of Sterling, saying from the witness stand that he was a kind, generous mentor and father figure to her but was a bigot who was mean to others. She also testified that the 80-year-old billionaire real estate mogul spent far more time with her and members of her family during the two and a half years she spent as his personal assistant, driver and confidante than he did with his own wife and children. ‘We were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual. He became my everything and I became his all,’ she said, though she repeated under oath that the relationship was never sexual in nature. Shelly Sterling, who accused Stiviano of fraud when she testified Wednesday, has painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and is now out to hurt him. Wife speaks: Shelly Sterling, estranged wife of former Los Angeles Clippers basketball team owner Donald Sterling, and her attorney Pierce O'Donnell arrive at Los Angeles Superior Court Friday. Mrs Sterling painted Stiviano as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts . Stiviano, seen here outside the court Thursday, testified that tolerating Sterling's racist moments was 'part of the job' Stiviano has not disputed Donald Sterling's largesse, though she has quibbled with the sums at stake and has emphatically denied she used sex to manipulate him. She repeatedly testified that Sterling tried to manipulate her. The apparent contradictions finally led Shelly Sterling's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, to confront Stiviano with the question: ‘Who is the real Donald Sterling?’ ‘The real Donald Sterling is a con artist, a bigot ... he's mean, he's despicable,’ Stiviano replied, before quickly adding that to her, he was ‘kind, loving, sweet ... a mentor, a father. ... He treated me as he treated no one else.’ She added that tolerating his racist moments was 'part of the job' that had its rewards in the way he treated her and her family. Stiviano broke down in tears as she described the Clippers owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boys. Platonic relationship: The 32-year-old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the Clippers owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature . She said, he said: Stiviano rejected the idea that she used sexual favors to manipulate the married billionaire and insisted that he was the one who tried to manipulate her . In her testimony Friday, Miss Stiviano claimed that she was not the only recipient of cash gifts from her octogenarian benefactor, and she named a male friend of Sterling's who accompanied them on trips to Dubai, Paris and Thailand. Shelly Sterling said outside court that the assertion was crazy, and she described the man as a longtime family friend who despises Stiviano. The judge allowed the testimony as Stiviano's lawyer tried to show where large, unexplained checks may have gone from Sterling's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $1.8million duplex, luxury cars, jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman Shelly Sterling asserts was his mistress. Stiviano said she saw cashier's checks given to the man for $800,000 for a 'so-called business deal' involving a property in Los Angeles and a check for $75,000 to reimburse him for the Dubai travel. Stiviano couldn't say if any of that money ended up in accounts identified as sources for the home purchase. She has denied that those were her bank accounts, and Sterling's lawyers couldn't make that connection.

She said he provided money, but it was not regular income — and that became a problem in late 2013 when she wanted a job. 'As long as you're with me side by side, I will take care of everything you need,' she said he assured her. But Stiviano became suspicious when he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement.

"Gerry Adams has been named by an influential American magazine as a former IRA commander who personally passed ‘death sentences’ on its enemies. Adams, 64, has long denied belonging to the terror group. But the New Yorker magazine has published a damning 15,000-word assessment of allegations against him. Scroll down for video . New Yorker magazine has accused Gerry Adams, pictured, of being a former IRA commander . It claims that Adams himself issued the order to ‘disappear’ mother-of-ten Jean McConville who was dragged screaming from her Belfast home by a masked gang in 1972 after she was suspected of being a British Army informer. Last year Adams was arrested by police investigating Mrs McConville’s murder. He has always denied any involvement and was released without charge. The article names Adams as having been a senior member of the IRA and the military commander responsible for the Belfast Brigade. None of the claims is new but their collation by the magazine – in a devastating essay entitled ‘Where the bodies are buried’ with another headline saying Adams ‘authorised murder’ – is seen as a sign that the Sinn Fein president can no longer regard himself as the ‘acceptable face’ of Irish Republicanism in America. The magazine claimed that Gerry Adams, pictured, joined the IRA in the 1960s and passed 'death sentences' Patrick Radden Keefe, the author of the New Yorker essay, wrote: ‘It is believed that Adams joined [the IRA] as a teenager, in the mid-Sixties. Several former IRA volunteers confirmed to me that Adams was a member of the group.’ He said Adams had presided over a meeting of IRA bombers in Belfast to plot the 1973 bombing campaign in London. The article also said Adams dispatched an IRA member to New York to procure Armalite assault rifles for use against the British Army, having them smuggled back aboard the QEII ocean liner.","New Yorker magazine has printed  15,000-word profile on Gerry Adams .

"Imagine walking into your living room after a stressful day at work, to find the lights automatically dim themselves to suit your mood. It might sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but this is already possible, thanks to a gadget called Muse. The device, which went on sale in the UK this week (ending Sat), is designed to track people’s brain waves, in the same way that fitness trackers count the number of steps a person has taken, or monitor their heart rate. Muse the gadget monitors users brain waves to adjust the lighting in every room they walk into to suit their mood . The plastic headband is designed to track brain movements in the same way as fitness trackers count steps . Users wear a plastic headband across their forehead, with sensors at the front and above the ears, to track their brain activity. This information is then beamed via Bluetooth to the user’s mobile phone or computer, where it is ‘translated’ into an image of a summer’s day in the country. People who have lots on their mind will see clouds rolling across the screen, whilst those who manage to empty their thoughts will be met by a clear blue sky. The product, developed by Ariel Garten, a Canadian neuroscientist and former fashion designer, launched in North America last year, and is designed to help people relax. ‘Muse is a brain fitness tool that helps you do more with your mind,’ the company says. ‘By seeing your brain’s performance in real time as well as over time, you can enhance the mental skills you already have and do more with your mind than you ever thought possible. ‘You are able to see your data, you can track it and see how your brain becomes calmer over time.’ According to Mrs Garten, Muse is prescribed by doctors in the US and Canada to treat people suffering from stress, anxiety or insomnia. Researchers are also investigating whether the £239.90 gadget can be used to reduce the recovery time for surgery patients, as well as to treat epilepsy and Attention Deficit Disorder. However, the device can be used for some more flamboyant tricks as well. Researchers are also investigating whether the £239.90 gadget can be used to reduce the recovery time for surgery patients . Mrs Garten told a conference in Barcelona that Muse could be rigged up to in animate objects, so that users could control them with their minds. In one instance, it was used to make a chair levitate. In another, partygoers were able to don the plastic headband and pour themselves a beer from a keg. It can also be linked to lighting and heating systems, in order to change the feel of a room depending on the user’s mood. The devices are likely to be embraced by serious technology fans, who are also willing to wear gadgets like Google’s internet-enabled glasses on their face. However, it may take a while for the gadgets to hit the mainstream. Mrs Garten said she had used her background as a fashion designer to ensure the device was as elegant as possible. ‘We approached this as a design problem. How do you make something slick and that fits into people’s lives,’ she said.","Muse is designed to track people's brain waves and monitor stress levels .

"A guest at an 007-themed swingers' party drowned in a swimming pool after apparently downing most of a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey. The 35-year-old man was one of about 30 pleasure-seekers at the 'James Bond meets Pussy Galore' event in a £2.5million country mansion in the Home Counties. He is thought to have entered the pool naked with a woman he had met at the party before suddenly starting to thrash about in the water and then sinking to the bottom. Organiser Janet Harrison (left) with  friend in an image from a website that promotes the swingers' parties . The sex party was reportedly 'just getting started' when a 35-year-old man drowned in the swimming pool of the £3million gated property (pictured is a pool at the mansion) Detectives are investigating the 'unexplained' death and the 50ft covered pool has been sealed off while toxicology tests are carried out to check that the water is safe. The party was one of the regular swingers' events put on by retired management consultant Richard Stanley, 66, and his partner Janet Harrison, 58, at their eight-bedroom home in Radlett, Hertfordshire. The couple, who appeared in a Channel 4 series last year, say they do not run the sex parties as a business, but ask for contributions to their costs. The event on Friday night featured 007 references including a roulette wheel, a woman covered in gold paint inspired by Goldfinger and chocolate replicas of the weapon from The Man With The Golden Gun. The man got into difficulties in the water just after midnight. The death happened at a swingers party run by Richard Stanley and Janet Harrison, pictured in the Channel 4 documentary Jon Richardson Grows Up . The owner of the house, who organised the sex party, said there were safety notices around the pool . 'The party was really only just getting started,' a guest told the Sun. 'I was in the garden when a naked couple walked into the heated pool. She was white and in her 30s or 40s, he was black. 'There is a steep incline in the pool, which is about 3m deep, and the guy went in deeper by himself and started whacking the water. I thought he was playing. 'After a while the woman screamed and I saw the guy lying on the bottom. His body looked like it was moving, but then I realised it was ripples in the water.' Revellers dragged the man out and performed CPR on him at the poolside, but he could not be revived and was pronounced dead at Watford General Hospital. The victim, who told other guests he was called Edmund, was not a regular at the parties. He is believed to be Nigerian and from north-west London. The woman who entered the pool with him, who was not well known by other guests, was left distraught. Mr Stanley said the victim had apparently 'severely dented' a bottle of Jack Daniel's he brought with him before entering the pool. The group's website states that there are health and safety rules for using the large indoor swimming pool . The couple have been hosting sex parties at the mansion - which includes a dungeon - for 10 years . He added: 'I heard a shout and ran over. I dived in fully clothed, pausing only to take my iPhone out of my pocket. He was enormously heavy. Three of the guys pulled him out, with me pushing him from behind. They put him straight into the CPR position and tried to revive him. One of the guests was a qualified nurse. 'I got straight on to 999. The call operator gave very clear instructions, which I shouted to the team performing CPR. We kept doing that until the ambulance arrived. 'Then the police turned up – there were about a dozen officers in total by the end of the night. After interviewing various people, the inspector said to me, 'this is a non-suspicious death'. It may well be that he had a heart attack.' The mansion boasts a sex dungeon, a dance room with a pole and a sauna for the 'hot-blooded sexual Olympians' who attend the parties. Mr Stanley and his partner decided to go ahead with a planned Alice In Wonderland-themed party on Saturday night after receiving messages of support from their regular guests. The property features a converted attic which Mr Stanley calls the 'dungeon in the sky' The tragedy struck in the early hours of Saturday at the mansion (pictured) in Radlett, north of London . The mansion's owners say the pool complies with all health and safety rules and has been inspected . 'My first reaction was that having a party the following night was not going to be appropriate,' Mr Stanley said. 'But we had so many supportive emails and texts saying things like, 'the first thing you do if you fall off a horse is get back on it', and 'it was what he would have wanted'. 'Somebody said when a plane crashes into the Alps, you don't stop all aviation. You sit down around a table and think about whether you could have done anything differently. 'That's what we are doing. The health and safety people will come over this week and we will go through what we could do better.' Mr Stanley said he would invite the victim's friends and family to visit his house and set up a memorial there if they wished. A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'An investigation is on-going at this time to establish the circumstances surrounding the man's death, which is being treated as unexplained pending the outcome of a post-mortem. This is due to take place in the next few days.' A documentary showed pornographic films are played on a large screen during the parties and a pole has been fitted to the centre of the dancer floor . The website states: 'To assist those who feel torn between eating out or frolicking, we ease the burden by feeding you to a fair standard'","Guest at 'James Bond meets Pussy Galore' swingers' party drowned .

"Everyone has settled down in front of the television or into their bed at some point only to realise they have left the kitchen light on. Now a new gadget will allow homeowners to flip their lights on and off using their mobile phone, without having to change all their current light fittings and switches. Engineers have developed a device that attaches on top of traditional light switches to enable them to be turned on and off from anywhere in the home. Scroll down for video . Switchmate fits over existing light switches meaning it can be used in most homes without needing rewiring . The developers say the device, called Switchmate, means households can benefit from smart lighting without the need for expensive rewiring. Switchmate can be controlled using a mobile phone app over Bluetooth and uses a physical toggle inside the device to move the light switch. Imagine walking into your living room after a stressful day at work, to find the lights automatically dim themselves to suit your mood. It might sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but this is already possible, thanks to a gadget called Muse. The device, which went on sale in the UK this week, is designed to track people’s brain waves, in the same way that fitness trackers count the number of steps a person has taken, or monitor their heart rate.

The product, developed by Ariel Garten, a Canadian neuroscientist and former fashion designer, launched in North America last year, and is designed to help people relax. It can also be linked to lighting and heating systems, in order to change the feel of a room depending on the user’s mood. According to Daniel Peng, co-founder of California-based Switchmate, the device works like a robotic finger for the lights in your home. The app can be used to set timers so the lights come on at prearranged times or proximity so lights turn on when you walk into a room with your phone. Mr Peng said: 'Switchmate allows you to remotely control your lights via your smart phone, but you can still press the button on the Switchmate face plate to manually flip the switch. 'A lot of our users set timers to make their homes look occupied when they are away, great for making your home safer when you are on vacation. 'You can also have the proximity setting on such that as you approach your home, your lights will turn on automatically for you.' Many smart lighting solutions either require switches to be rewired but recently some manufacturers have developed smart bulbs that can connect to mobile phones. However, these take the light switch out of the loop entirely, meaning lights need to be left in the 'on' position all the time for the bulb to work. Switchmate attaches to the outside of the light switch using magnets and has a button on its face allowing lights to be turned on and off as usual. This means that should their mobile phone run out of batteries or they are unable to connect to the device, they can still turn their lights on and off. The developers, who raised $139,000 in a successful funding crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, are also now working on a version that connects to the internet. The battery powered Switchmate uses a physical toggle inside the device to flip traditional wall mounted light switches (shown above) - working like a robotic finger than can be controlled using a mobile phone app . This means residents can turn their lights on and often while even while they are abroad on holiday. Switchmate is apparently compatible with two types of light switch - traditional flat 'rocker' switches and toggle switches. The developers say the device is also thin enough to be used on switches on multiple switch face plates and the battery will last between eight to twelve months. The team behind Switchmate are currently taking pre-orders with a single unit costing $49 (£32). However, at that price, it means kitting out the average home is unlikely to be cheap. The device is currently only available in the US and Canada, but Mr Peng said they hoped to have it available in other countries soon. It also cannot currently be used to control lights that use dimmer switches. Switchmate can be used with two different switch types - toggle switches (left) and rocker switches (right) The developers say Switchmate will be available in three different colours - gold, silver and white (all above) The device (shown above) can still be used like a traditional light switch by pressing the button in the middle . Mr Peng said they are hoping to develop new features in the coming months. He said: 'We designed Switchmate to make your lights smart in seconds - it snaps onto your existing light switch with magnets, connects to your phone, and allows you to automate your lights just like that. 'Because it just snaps over your light switch anyone can do it, and you can take it with you when you move in the future. 'Switchmate allows you to remotely control your lights via your smart phone, but you can still press the button on the Switchmate face plate to manually flip the switch.'","Switchmate is fixed onto existing light switches using a magnetic fastener .

"Millionaire Robert Durst was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in California, as well as drug and weapons charges filed in New Orleans, attorneys said in court papers Friday. In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, William Gibbens and Dick DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed. They say he should be released. 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on. ... They're gonna find nothing,"" Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, told  KTRK-TV. 'I think Louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie.' Scroll down for video . 'Invalid arrest': Robert Durst's legal team accused authorities in documents today of arresting the real estate heir illegally, as his attorney blasted Louisiana officials for wanting a piece of the 'publicity pie' 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on ... They're gonna find nothing, Dick DeGuerin (pictured), the lead attorney on Durst's team, said Friday . The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans. The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested. They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel. The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated 'to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama The Jinx. The six-part documentary concluded Sunday. Durst, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family, was charged with murder in California for the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings — that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001. Frail: Durst is on suicide watch at a Louisiana detention center. He is expected to appear in court Monday . Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance. Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested. Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room. However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge. In the case, prosecutors could seek to play portions from The Jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay. While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing. 'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.' In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview. 'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person. In this video, he came across as a very sympathetic person.' Prosecutors are not commenting on the Berman case while Durst is still held in Louisiana, where he also faces firearms charges.","Durst's legal team say authorities made an 'invalid arrest' March 14 .

"Inmates at a state prison in Florida have were allegedly stripped naked, sprayed with toxic chemicals, and had their beds taken away for little or no reason as part of a brutal disciplinary regime. Prisoners at the Northwest Florida Reception Center, near Panama City, were reportedly beaten and even threatened with having their fingers broken while other guards manipulated surveillance cameras to perpetuate the harsh system which they called 'the program'. According to allegations from prisoners and former guards, the perpetrators and their superiors engineered a conspiracy of silence around the shocking practices, which meant that any concerns raised were swept away. 'Brutality': Central to the harsh allegations is corrections officer Captain James Kirkland, left, who was reportedly a prolific user of chemicals on inmates. Rommell Johnson, right, was an asthmatic prison who died after he had pepper spray used on him . Meanwhile, they claim, those who voice concerns were harassed, mocked and even fired as a consequence of trying to speak out. The allegations about Northwest Florida, which have prompted several investigations and lawsuits, were collated and published in a long report by the Miami Herald. In the most extreme circumstances, a prisoner even died during one of the apparently routine 'gassings'. Rommell Johnson, an asthmatic inmate, was blasted with burning pepper spray in June 2010 despite having been treated for his condition that same morning. The Herald reported that officers then left him laying in his cell, while he foamed at the mouth. By the time they called paramedics, it was too late and he soon died. Prison complex: The alleged abuse took place over years at the Northwest Florida Reception Center, above . Using pepper spray - and in more extreme cases tear gas - is a legal and recognized punishment in the Florida prison system, used to subdue very disruptive inmates. But, according to the reports, use of the dangerous chemicals - which are blasted repeatedly into inmate's cells through a flap - was taken to extremes at Northwest Florida. The punishment was allegedly used so routinely that corrections officers would fake excuses to use the gas, and in some cases would even fill out paperwork justifying their use of the gas the day before. One officer, Captain James Kirkland, would reportedly gas inmates as punishment if they filed complaints about him. Some said he would lash out for completely irrational reasons, such as seeing inmates holding rubber bands. One prisons officer, Jerry Sellers, said Kirkland accused him of 'cowardice' for not joining in with a depraved scheme to 'break every finger' in an inmate's hand to punish him. Sellers then claims he was forced to resign by a superior. Kirkland, and five other guards, were eventually charged and arrested over abuse at the prisons - but the officer, who was reportedly suffering mental health problems, killed himself before he could stand trial. Prisoners also reported having their mattresses taken away, and going as long as 72 hours with nothing to sleep on but a hard, prison-issue bedframe. The abuse is said to spread over years at the prison. Authorities have since pledged to reform the system and tighten up disciplinary procedures for corrections officers. However, critics say that the heads of the prison service say that until the heads of the prison are gone, the problems will persist. Josh Glickman, a civil rights lawyer representing a prisoner who is suing the authorities, said: 'The individuals actually responsible for the abuse to repeatedly occur and continue are still very much a part of today’s Department of Corrections'.","Prisoners at Northwest Florida Reception Center allegedly mistreated .

"The United . States will have to negotiate with Syrian President Bashar Assad for a political transition in Syria and is exploring . ways to pressure him into agreeing to talks, U.S. Secretary of . State John Kerry has admitted. Washington has long insisted that Assad must be replaced . through a negotiated, political transition, but the rise of a . common enemy, hardline militant group Islamic State, has evidently softened the administration's stance towards him. In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Kerry did not repeat . the standard U.S. line that Assad had lost all legitimacy and . had to go. Syria's civil war is now into its fifth year, with . hundreds of thousands killed and millions of Syrians displaced. Scroll down for video . Admission: Secretary of State John Kerry admitted Sunday that the White House is trying to engage the Syrian dictator in negotiations . 'We have to negotiate in the end,' Kerry told CBS News. 'We've always . been willing to negotiate in the context of the Geneva I . process,' he added, referring to a 2012 conference which called . for a negotiated transition to end the conflict. Kerry said the United States and other countries, which he . did not name, were exploring ways to reignite the diplomatic . process to end the conflict in Syria. 'What we're pushing for is to get him (Assad) to come and do . that, and it may require that there be increased pressure on him . of various kinds in order to do that,' the secretary of state . said. New problem: The U.S. has been more willing to deal with Assad since the rise to power of ISIS in Syria and Iraq . Opposition: Assad's regime is under attack from rebel soldiers, such as those above, as well as ISIS's hordes . 'We've made it very clear to people that we are looking at . increased steps that can help bring about that pressure,' he . added. The United States led efforts to convene a U.N.-backed peace . talks in Geneva last year between Western-backed Syrian . opposition representatives and a government delegation. The . talks collapsed after two rounds and no fresh talks have been . scheduled. Russia convened some opposition and government figures in . January for talks on the crisis but they yielded little progress . and the main opposition coalition boycotted them. 'To get the Assad regime to negotiate, we're going to have . to make it clear to him that there is a determination by . everybody to seek that political outcome and change his . calculation about negotiating,' Kerry said. 'That's under way right now.  And I am convinced that, with . the efforts of our allies and others, there will be increased . pressure on Assad.'. Syria sank into civil war after a peaceful street uprising . against four decades of Assad family rule began in March 2011. The revolt spiraled into an armed insurgency, which has deepened . with the rise of Islamic State and other hardliners. Assad seems more likely to survive the Syrian crisis than at . any point since it began. Iran's support for Assad is as solid . as ever, with Russia showing no sign of abandoning him. Before: U.S.-Syria negotiations haven't always been this strained. He is pictured above with Nancy Pelosi in Damascus in 2007, before civil war broke out . U.S-led forces started air strikes against Islamic State . group in Syria and Iraq in the summer. Washington has said the . campaign in Syria is not coordinated with the Syrian military, . which also views the group as its enemy. The war has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced . close to half the population, according to the United Nations. Damascus accuses its Western and Gulf Arab opponents of seeking . to destroy the country by providing aid to an insurgency now . dominated by jihadists, who also pose a threat to the West.

"Killer pilot Andreas Lubitz can be heard responding ‘hopefully’ and ‘we’ll see’ when he ran through in-flight landing checks with the captain of his doomed aircraft. His chilling responses came just a few moments before he encouraged Patrick Sondenheimer to go the toilet and took control of the flight. Later Mr Sondenheimer is heard shouting ‘open the god damn door!’ as he desperately tried to break back into the cockpit. The exchange was revealed yesterday as pictures of Lubitz as a child and a teenager emerged, and it was claimed his girlfriend may be pregnant. Scroll down for video . New photographs: Pictures of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz as a teenager (left) and child (right) emerged yesterday, along with a yearbook entry . Grim task: Rescue workers inspect the remains of the Germanwings Airbus A320 and its victims at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes . Passengers screamed as Mr Sondenheimer attempted to smash his way in with a crowbar after Lubitz locked him out and put the plane into a descent. But the only sound from the cockpit was Lubitz breathing as the aircraft plummeted at 3,500 feet per minute before smashing into the French Alps, killing all 150 of those on board. The transcript from the plane’s black box recorder revealed Lubitz’s responses to the landing checks and him calmly encouraging Mr Sondenheimer to go the toilet. After Mr Sondenheimer left him at the controls, he switched the autopilot from the cruising altitude of 38,000ft to 96ft – a move that was certain to crash the plane over the Alps. German investigators have found torn-up sicknotes in Lubitz’s Dusseldorf flat which showed he had hidden the extent of his illness from his employers. At least one of the medical certificates covered the day of the crash last Tuesday. The 27-year-old was also said to be ‘living on the edge’ because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot’s licence. And his relationship with blonde maths teacher, named by German media as Kathrin Goldbach, was said to be in trouble, with local reports suggesting she may have been pregnant. Maths teacher Kathrin Goldbach – who had planned to marry Lubitz next year – reportedly told pupils that she was ‘going to be a mum.’ Search: The speed of the crash meant that most of it was obliterated and no bodies have been discovered intact . Debris: A road is now being built to the crash site in the Alps near the French town of Digne-les-Bains in an attempt to help recovery workers . She was also said to have travelled to the scene of the crash, only to arrive and discover that he was the perpetrator of the disaster. Miss Goldbach, 26, told the pupils at the Gesamtschule in Krefeld, near Dusseldorf, she was pregnant, German newspaper Bild reported. The pair met as teenagers while working together at a Burger King in his home town of Montabaur. They moved together to Dusseldorf and shared a flat after he qualified as a pilot around four years ago. They intended to marry but his constant demands and desire to be ‘in control’ meant that by the time of the crash she was looking to end their relationship. Reports emerged that police searching his flat had found a ‘small mountain of pills’ and he had apparently been refusing to take his antidepressant medication. An excerpt from his school yearbook said he would ‘become a professional pilot so as to sell his cocktails around the world’. Yesterday a British air safety expert said Lubitz was able to hide his medical problems because of a ‘gaping hole’ in the system for monitoring pilot health. Under confidentiality laws rules, which also operate in the UK, patients do not have to tell GPs where they work and doctors are not able to tell employers about any health issues because of patient confidentiality. The onus of reporting any health issues rests solely on employees. Remembrance: Flags representing different nations are deployed during a ceremony with relatives of victims in  Le Vernet, France, yesterday . Respectful: A man stands in front of a headstone in Seyne-les-Alpes, the closest accessible site to where the Germanwings plane crashed . Tony Newton, a British pilot and Civil Aviation Authority examiner, said: ‘It’s a gaping hole. It would happen in the UK as well.’ On the in-flight recording, described in German newspaper Bild, Mr Sondenheimer is initially heard apologising for a short, 26-minute delay in the departure from Barcelona, and promising to make up the time on the routine flight to Dusseldorf. During snippets from the conversation, he also explains to his colleague that he had not had time to go to the toilet before they left Spain. Lubitz tells him he can go to the toilet ‘at any time’ in a tone described as ‘laconic’ by French authorities. After completing their mid-flight checks for landing, Lubitz says to Mr Sondenheimer again: ‘You can go now.’ Two minutes later Mr Sondenheimer agrees to go, and says: ‘You can take over.’ There is the sound of a seat being pushed back and a click of the closing door. Shortly afterwards there is a loud bang, like someone trying to enter the cockpit. This is followed by a ‘loud, metallic banging against the cockpit door’ – believed to be Sondheimer using a crowbar to try to break in. As the jet plunges towards oblivion an automated warning sounds: ‘Ground! Pull up! Pull up!’ The pilot is heard shouting: ‘Open the god damn door!’ when he realises they are moments from death. As an adult: Lubitz can be heard responding ‘hopefully’ and ‘we’ll see’ when he ran through in-flight landing checks with his aircraft's captain . Taking photos: Forensic experts from the French gendarmerie disaster victim identification unit working under a tent near the site of the crash . At 10.40am – eight minutes after the drama began – the aircraft’s right wing hits the mountain. The final sounds are more screams from passengers as the plane disintegrates and disappears from radar. The speed of the crash meant that most of it was obliterated and no bodies have been discovered intact. A road is now being built to the crash site in the Alps near the French town of Digne-les-Bains in an attempt to help recovery workers and investigators. Mr Sondenheimer’s grandmother, Marianne, told how he had dreamed of becoming a pilot as a boy. She said: ‘My grandson is dead and all because of an idiot who did this to his whole flight and killed so many people. 'I just cannot understand it. How could he do this?’ Mrs Sondenheim, who is in her 70s, said her grandson was determined to become an airline captain, even as a schoolboy. She added: ‘He was just 34 years old. 'Now this – I cannot bring myself to watch the news any more, it is too much to bear. A young man is dead with so many others.’ She said Mr Sondenheimer was a father of a daughter of six and a son of three. He had changed from long haul to short haul flights to spend more time with his family.","Responses came moments before 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz encouraged Patrick Sondenheimer to go to toilet .

"A hound called Coco has become caught up in a remarkable international custody battle after being ‘rescued’ by a couple who are now facing a lawsuit from a woman claiming to be the rightful owner. Coco was found wandering a beach in Aruba, in the Caribbean Sea, last October by husband and wife Lisa and Dan O’Connell, who claimed she was in shocking condition. The O’Connells, from North Attleboro in Massachusetts, said that they thought she was a stray. Scroll down for video . Coco was found wandering around on a beach in Aruba, in the Caribbean Sea, last October by husband and wife Lisa (pictured) and Dan O’Connell, who claimed she was in shocking condition . An Aruba resident called Cornelia Hajdinyak told the O’Connells that Coco was actually hers – and called Whitey Pinky. She has set up a Facebook page to support her claim . Ms O’Connell told WBZ-TV: ‘She was dehydrated, she seemed hungry, she seemed sad. She absolutely looked like a dog that nobody was caring for.’ Husband Dan added: ‘The dog had many ticks on it and its paws were raw, either from the hot sand or the hot asphalt.’ They both claim that the dog wasn’t wearing a collar and that no other form of identification was visible. Believing that they were being good Samaritans, they called a vet to get the dog treated then contacted an Aruba animal rescue centre to help process adoption of Coco. However, when they returned from their vacation they received a message from an Aruba resident called Cornelia Hajdinyak who told the O’Connells that Coco was actually hers – and called Whitey Pinky. The O’Connells launched a crowd-funding page to help pay their legal bill and keep the dog stateside . Ms Hajdinyak, in a Facebook page to support her claim, said that Whitey Pinky ‘only lives two minutes from the beach’ and is used to going there ‘with her best friends Buddy and Wolly, which live just next door'  that they 'all know their way home’. As well as posting photographs and videos of the dog on the page, she published emails that she’d written to the O’Connells, describing how she found her in 2011 at the front of her house and adopted her. She wrote: '[Whitey Pinky] loves running, hiking, walking, swimming, bicycling, being on a boat, catamaran or jetski, driving in the car; there is nothing she doesn't want to be part of!' She claims that the dog was 'confiscated' within two days by the O'Connells, leaving little time for a proper search, but they argue that Hajdinyak waited two weeks before she began looking for her. The O’Connells remain determined to keep Coco, who they’ve become very fond of. They believe that returning her ‘would put her life in jeopardy’. Now both sides have brought in lawyers in a bid to secure custody of the animal and the case is set to be settled in court. The O’Connells launched a crowd-funding page to help pay their legal bill, which has reached several thousand dollars.","Massachusetts couple found what they thought was a stray dog in Aruba .

"TV presenter Laura Csortan has been ridiculed for her alleged penchant for photoshopping Instagram snaps. Despite her denials, at least the former Great Outdoors presenter can know she is in good company. Her fellow accused include the likes of Beyonce, Kim Kardashian and home grown supermodel Miranda Kerr, all of whom have come under fire for appearing to tweak their pictures. Scroll down for video . Hashtag no filter? Miranda Kerr is among a host of stars accused of using photo editing tools to appear slimmer in her Instagram pictures . Spot the difference: Miranda raised eyebrows by posting a picture in 2013 on Instagram (right) which was a slimmed-down version of the original (left), taken at the 2012 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show . While many Instagram users are guilty of adding a flattering filter to their selfies, it seems the stars are taking it a step further, and using photo editing tools to appear thinner. Miranda Kerr has twice been accused of needlessly slimming down her waist in pictures posted to her Instagram account. In 2013 the supermodel attended a Michael Kors event in Japan wearing a cut-out gown, but raised eyebrows when she uploaded a picture in which her already slender waist appeared noticeably smaller. Real life vs Instagram: TV presenter Laura Csortan has been repeatedly accused of tampering with her images to make her already incredible figure appear smaller . Tell-tale signs: A number of Csortan's Instagram snaps show evidence of photoshop including a blurry background . Not quite right: This picture shows Laura's waist looking skewed and obviously slimmer than in a duplicate image posted on a friend's account . In another incident, the 31-year-old issued an apology for posting a picture which she claims she did not realise had been photoshopped. Miranda shared a picture of herself with her then fellow Victoria's Secret Angels Doutzen Kroes and . Alessandra Ambrosio backstage at the 2012 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. But some of her 5.5million followers were quick to point out that her waist appeared significantly thinner than in the original photograph. When Kim Kardashian took a trip to the Versace house in March 2014 she faced criticism for the picture on the right, in which she appeared to have slimmed her waist and hips . British reality star Lauren Goodger has been accused of smoothing her waist to appear thinner, as shown in this picture posted when she attended the Clothes Show last year . After making headlines around the world and a facing an army of fans questioning why the incredibly slim and fit star would need to photoshop her body, Miranda said in a statement: 'When I re-posted the photo this week to support the girls I screen grabbed it off the internet when I was working in Japan. I had no idea it was Photoshopped.' For her part, Laura Csortan has flat-out denied slimming down her body in her Instagram pictures, despite obvious signs of tweaking such as blurring and skewed lines appearing in the snaps. She has previously told Daily Mail Australia she uses filters, Instagram settings and occasionally a blemish remover app. Beyonce is no stranger to  controversy, she has previously been accused of slimming down her pictures and in this snap, taken whilst she was holidaying in the South of France, it looked like her waist was slimmer . These two photos were taken just two days apart whilst Geordie Shore personality Charlotte Crosby holidayed in Perth in February, in the picture on the left she looks rounder than she does in her Instagram snap . Lauren appears to be a fan of heavy filtering, as shown in the softened selfie on the right . 'Apart from using the filters on Instagram, I have never altered any of my pictures,' she has said. British reality stars such as Charlotte Crosby and Lauren Goodger have previously posted pictures to the social networking site where they look considerably smaller than in paparazzi pictures of them taken on the same day. Of course, stars like Beyonce and Kim Kardashian are no strangers to being accused of altering their photographs. When singer Beyonce posted photographs of her summer holiday to Instagram last year she was accused of slimming down both her waist and legs. And when Kim took a trip to the Versace house last year the picture she posted to the social networking site made her look thinner than those taken of her by the photographers waiting outside. They say the camera never lies, but some seem to be telling a few fibs. Here are some more stars that might have been given a helping hand... In these pictures of Britney Spears, which were taken on the same day in November, she looks considerably slimmed down in the picture on the right which was posted to her Instagram . Holly Hagan has lost a lot of weight over the last year, however, she looked like her waist was slimmer in this picture posted to Instagram (right) around the same time that she attended the NTAs (left) Jennifer Lopez has beautiful skin already but it looks as though she used a filer to make it completely flawless in this picture taken as she promoted The Box Next Door in January .","Miranda, Laura, Kim K and Britney appear thinner in Instagram snaps .

"She's famous for her colourful hats and now, a fascinating collection of previously unseen letters to her milliner has revealed just how much the Queen adores them. The letters, written to long-serving hat-maker Philip Somerville over 25 years, the missives also touch on Her Majesty's passion for corgis and her knowledge of running a business. Others contain thanks for hats made by Mr Somerville and a touching sentence in which the Queen describes herself as 'almost the only person' who wears hats all the time. Scroll down for video . Passion for hats: The Queen's love of colourful headgear has been revealed in letters to her milliner . Four of the epistles are now set to go under the hammer alongside a set of invitations and signed cards sent to Mr Somerville, who died last year aged 84. But it is the letters that are likely to attract the most interest, with auctioneers saying they could fetch as much as £2,000 when they are sold later this month. In one of the notes, which was written to Mr Somerville and dated January 5, 2009, the Queen thanks him for a Christmas present of a china corgi. 'Thank you so much for the charming china Corgi you gave me for Christmas,' she wrote. 'I am so pleased to have it and it is a good portrayal of the breed. It will join my assorted collection of them!' She added: 'Can I once more express my great gratitude for all the help and the fine hats I have had over the years from you.' Recipient: Philip Somerville, who died last year aged 84, made the Queen's hats for over 25 years . Handwritten: In the missives, the Queen details her love of corgis and thanks Mr Somerville for his work . No stamp needed: The stamp-free letters also reveal that the Queen does get some perks from Royal Mail . In another from February 25, 2007, she writes: 'Thank you for your letter telling me of the outcome of your business. 'I am very glad to hear that you will still be able to work for me... I know how difficult business can be nowadays - specially with matching fabrics for someone like me who must be almost the only person who wears hats constantly!' Another thank you note written on January 19, 2008, reads: 'Thank you so much for my Christmas present. It is sitting here on my desk and is very enjoyable. 'I fear this is very late - I seem to have been so busy even in the holidays. I am glad to hear your pacemaker is working well for you, it must be a great relief. 'I expect there will be a need for a few hats in the coming months!' Philip Somerville began making hats for the Queen in the early 1980s, a role he held right through to his retirement in 2008. Famous fan: Princess Diana was among the flock of celebrities and royals to wear Mr Somerville's creations . Stunning: Mr Somerville's designs also appeared on the red carpet and in fashion magazines . Taking over: Most of the Queen's hats, including the one pictured, are now made by Angela Kelly . He also made hats for Princess Diana, the Duchess of Kent, Queen Silvia of Sweden, and members of the Dutch and Greek royal families. Other clients included well-known figures such as Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Joan Collins and Lady Thatcher. His hats were also worn by a string of Bond girls including Famke Janssen in 1995 film Goldeneye, and Sophie Marceau in The World Is Not Enough from 1999. 'The letters are fascinating because they give a very rare glimpse of the Queen’s personal side, revealing her to be very sweet, humble and funny,' says Lydia Wilkinson, co-ordinator of the auction, which takes place at Fraser's Autographs in London on 20th March. 'The majority of people only ever see the Queen in her official role where she is required to be formal and quite serious, but these letters show a completely different side to her. 'The Queen is a big fan of hats and it’s quite clear from the correspondence that she and Mr Somerville, as her milliner, were very close. 'The market for Royal memorabilia is always strong so we are expecting a large amount of interest in these letters, not just from the UK but from the US as well where the Royal family are much loved.' From colourful cocktail numbers to elaborate feathered headpieces, the Queen is almost as famous for her hats as she is for her constitutional role. In France, her headgear is looked upon with total fascination, while in the UK, Her Majesty's hats are traditionally the subject of bets during Royal Ascot week. Since the death of Mr Somerville, most of the Queen's hats are the work of her dressmaker, Angela Kelly, who was also responsible for the ivory number worn to greet the President and First Lady of Mexico earlier this week. But regardless of who is making them, as these photos reveal, Her Majesty is never anything less than beautifully turned out.

"A lamb believed to be the biggest ever born in the UK weighs as much as a toddler. The super-sized animal - christened The Big One - was delivered via caesarean section on Tuesday  at Ty Mawr Farm in Denbigh, north Wales. It tipped the scales to a whopping 24lbs 2oz - almost three times the size of an average newborn lamb. The Big One (right) towers above other lambs that have also been born on the farm this week (left) Dafydd Fon Ifan, who works full-time on the farm with parents Edmund and Llinos, said: 'The lamb is absolutely huge. 'It was delivered about five days early so it makes you wonder what size it would have been if the pregnancy had gone to term. 'We have had big lambs before but I have never seen anything like this. 'As soon as it was delivered the vet weighed it straight away and she was just smiling because of how big it was. 'Dad and I guessed about eight or nine kilograms - we couldn't believe it when she said 11. It is about the size of a three or four-week-old lamb.' The previous record holder for the biggest lamb in the UK was Joan, born in Lancashire in 2013. The Big One is 2oz heavier. Dafydd, 18,  said: 'The ewe went into labour early and we didn't even have a chance to deliver naturally. 'We had to take it to the vet for a caesarean because of the size of the lamb. 'It is healthy though, it's spot on. The ewe is doing well too. They are together but she just can't keep up with the lamb's demand for milk because it is so big. 'So I am having to feed it a lot of milk by bottle too. It will be interesting to see how he develops.

'I think it is the biggest to have ever been born in the UK. I did some research online and a lamb called Joan was born a few years ago at 24lbs, so ours is 2oz heavier.' The biggest lamb born at the farm previously was around eight kilograms. The family are now considering whether to send an application to the Guinness World Records to have The Big One's record claim substantiated.","Delivered via caesarean section at Ty Mawr Farm in north Wales .

Temperatures are expected to rise further on Monday and Tuesday, raising concerns about flooding in the areas that still have snow pack on the ground. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration says eastern New England and western New York will be hardest hit by this melt - with an estimated five inches of water locked in snowpack in eastern New England. Melting is also an issue for the regions rivers which can become blocked with ice. Meteorologist Ryan Maue, of Weather Bell Analytics, warned that spring might take a while to fully win out. Temperatures will remain unseasonable cool into next week and another system with snow potential is headed for the Midwest, he said.

"A new biography makes the startling claim that Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger purposely kept Steve Jobs' cancer a secret despite learning that he was very sick hours before his company bought the animation studio. Iger learned that Job's cancer had returned half an hour before Disney announced it was buying Jobs' Pixar studio in 2006. But in an extraordinary show of faith the CEO of Disney decided to keep the Apple co-founder's condition a secret for three years, according to a new biography of Jobs obtained by Bloomberg. Secret pact: Steve Jobs, right, talks with Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger at an Apple media event in 2006, a new book makes the startling claim that  Iger purposely kept Jobs' cancer a secret despite learning that he was very sick hours before buying Jobs' Pixar . Confession: On the day of the deal in 2006, the pair found a secluded spot on the Pixar campus in Emeryville, California, pictured, where Jobs put his arm around Iger's shoulder and revealed that his cancer was back . In the book titled 'Becoming Steve Jobs' by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli, due to be published on March 24, details emerged of the business pact that made Jobs' Disney's largest shareholder. Iger reasoned that Disney's $7 billion deal for Pixar was not about Jobs or his medical condition so it did not need to be disclosed, according to the biography. The book details how Iger told Jobs: 'You're our largest shareholder, but I don't think that makes this matter. You're not material to this deal. We're buying Pixar, we're not buying you.' Jobs, the prolific co-founder of Apple, was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003. He underwent surgery to remove it in 2004, but the tumor returned and he had a liver transplant in 2009. The book details how on January 24, 2006, the proposed day of the deal, Iger was at Pixar's headquarters for the ceremony when Jobs asked to go for a private walk. As the pair found a secluded spot on the campus in Emeryville, California, Jobs put his arm around Iger's shoulder and revealed that his cancer was back. Secret: Iger, right, reasoned that the $7 billion deal was on the value of Pixar, not Jobs, left, or his medical condition, so, after consulting a lawyer, the deal went ahead . Pixar deal: Steve Jobs, famous founder of Apple Computer, sits beneath the symbol of another of his ventures, Pixar Animation Studios, on January 24, 2006, Disney bought the firm for $7 million, despite Job's cancer . Marriage: Steve Jobs and his wife, Laurene Powell, are pictured at the Pixar Exhibit Launch 2005. The couple married in 1991, and she, along with his doctor, were the only ones who knew  he had cancer at first . Pixar: Ralph J. Guggenheim (right), an executive at Pixar Animation Studios, talks with an animator in the office. The firm has become a powerhouse animation studio for Disney, responsible for producing hits like Toy Story . Iger said Job's confided: 'Frankly, they tell me I've got a 50-50 chance of living five years.' Iger added: 'So I look at my watch and we've got 30 minutes. In 30 minutes, we're going to make this announcement. We've got television crews, we've got the board votes, we've got investment bankers. Pixar is an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California. It is best known for its CGI-animated feature films and has produced fourteen feature films, beginning with Toy Story in 1995. The firm, established in February 1986, has become a powerhouse animation studio for Disney, responsible for hits like Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Brave and Monsters, Inc. Additionally, the studio has earned 15 Academy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and eleven Grammy Awards. 'The wheels are turning. And I'm thinking, 'We're in this post Sarbanes-Oxley world, and Enron and fiduciary responsibility, and he is going to be our largest shareholder and I'm now being asked to bury a secret.' Up until that point, only Jobs' wife Lauren Powell and his doctor knew he had cancer. According to excerpts from the book, after Jobs' revelation, Iger asked Alan Braverman, Disney's top lawyer for advice. Braverman quickly agreed that Disney could go ahead with the acquisition. So the deal was done. However, just three years later, Jobs took a medical leave of absence. Iger said: 'In that three-year period, I always knew exactly what was going on with Steve medically. He and I would talk all the time, and since I kept things secret he confided in me.' The book, which will be published on Tuesday, paints a more sympathetic picture than the 2011 biography by Walter Isaacson, which focused on  Jobs' messy personal life and tough temperament. The Apple co-founder died in October 2011.","New Steve Jobs biography 'Becoming Steve Jobs' details claims .

"Many pregnant women worry about sleepless nights and how they will juggle the demands of a newborn with daily life. But for Karla Kirby, 38, her pregnancy is simply filled with gleeful anticipation of giving her new baby away. For the chef, who lives in north Lincolnshire, is currently pregnant with her eleventh child, and as a surrogate mother, has already waved goodbye to ten biological children of her own. Karla Kirby with two of her own children, Jordan and Joshua, and some of the children she ahs given birth to as a surrogate mother . In an interview with The Mirror, Karla said she decided to become a surrogate as she loved motherhood and was keen to help other people have a family of their own. With two children of her own, and in her late teens, she overheard a conversation where people were discussing surrogacy and decided to contact the organisation Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy (COTS) to find out more. After a counselling session to make sure she was ready, she opted to be a 'straight surrogate' using her own eggs and the intended father's sperm which she artificially inseminated herself. Karla chose to help a couple where the wife was infertile, and became pregnant after the eighth attempt, with her first surrogate child, Ethan, in 2001. She said seeing the emotion on the new parents' faces when she handed over the baby helped her realise she had made the right decision and 18 months later, became a surrogate again, going on to give birth to Nia in 2002 and Carey in 2003. Her own two children, who were now aged six and seven, always knew the children she was carrying would not be part of their family and there was no stopping her. Karla (right) and her wife, Taz, with one of the surrogate children immediately after the birth . Close: Karla said she is aware Taz worries about her health and would like her to retire from surrogacy . 'I had Macey in 2005, Maddie in 2007, Tyler in 2008, George in 2009, Hayden in 2011, Saskia in 2013 and Oliver in 2014 - the parents all name their own babies,' she told The Mirror. Karla has bounced back quickly from each drug-free birth, although at 29 weeks pregnant, she is currently facing the prospect of delivering her 11th surrogate child via caesarian section due to a low lying placenta. Karla married her partner Taz last summer and praised her for her support during the last three pregnancies, although she said she was aware that her new wife would like her to retire from surrogacy. She said it was strange to know there were ten children out there who shared her genes and she kept in touch with some of them including George and Macey who were flower girl and pageboy at her wedding. However, she said while she was aware that each pregnancy brought with it additional health risks, she was not ready to give up. 'What I do helps to make people’s dreams come true - you just can’t put a price on that,' she added. Karlas is cuurently 29 weeks pregnant and due to a low lying placenta, could be faced with having a caesarian .","Karla Kirby is now pregnant with her eleventh surrogate child .

"San Francisco has solidified its reputation as the city with the least affordable housing, where you need to earn more than $142,000 to afford a median-priced home. The West Coast hub of America’s booming tech industry was named the most unaffordable metropolitan area in the US by HSH.com, a mortgage tracking site, which estimated how much money a person must earn annually to afford the principal, interest, taxes and insurance payments in 27 metro areas across the country. The mortgage research company based its estimates on the National Association of Realtors' fourth-quarter data for median home prices, and its own data on average interest rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages and a 20 per cent downpayment.

Going for a song: Pittsburgh ranked the most affordable metro area in the country for the third quarter in a row, requiring a salary of under $32,000 . Based on the estimates, Pittsburgh ranked the most affordable metro area in the country for the third quarter in a row, requiring a salary of under $32,000. The historic ‘Steel City’ also had the lowest median home price at $135,000, and it tied Washington DC for the lowest mortgage rate at 3.98 per cent. Potential homebuyers operating on a shoestring budget also can find affordable housing in Cleveland, St Louis and Cincinnati, where required salaries range between $32,010-$33,485. On a national scale, with 20 per cent down, a buyer would need to earn a salary of $48,603.82 to afford the median-priced home. Boston, New York, Los Angeles and San Diego landed on the high end of a spectrum, requiring salaries of $80,000 and higher to afford homes with median prices ranging between $383,000-$493,000. The Big Apple, which has the highest mortgage rate in the nation at $4.22 per cent, was the fourth most unaffordable metro area on HSH's list, requiring homebuyers to earn $87,535 to meet the expense of a house with the median price of $393,000.

"A ten-day-old clouded leopard kitten at a Tampa zoo just melted everyone's hearts by relaxing and just being cute as he was washed under a water faucet. The endangered kitten, who has not yet been named and is being cared for at the Lowry Park Zoo, has just began to open his eyes and hasn't even taken his first step. And when zoo staff members wash him in the sink and feed him with a bottle, he's as cute as ever. The ten-day-old clouded leopard kitten, who has yet to be named, is being fed and watched over by staff at the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida . Staff members said he has barely opened his eyes, has yet to walk and will be watched 'round-the-clock' for the next few months . The kitten is given 'round-the-clock' care where he'll be fed and watched after for about three months by staff, according toFOX Tampa Bay. He is expected to start walking in about two weeks, and zoo staff will determine his future home in the next few weeks. Four-year-old clouded leopards Yim and Malee were paired as potential mates in 2011, when they arrived at the zoo, by the Clouded Leopard Species Survival Plan, which supports the conservation of the endangered animal. They then conceived their first born - the kitten who was born this month. Vice President of animal science and conservation at the zoo Dr Larry Killmar said the birth 'signifies a milestone accomplishment' for the conservation programs. 'Species survival programs for animals like the clouded leopards take years of planning, development and staff commitment. The kitten will contribute to the long-term viability of our conservation efforts within the managed population,' Killmar told FOX. The kitten is expected to start walking in a couple weeks. He is the baby of two four-year-old clouded leopards at the zoo who were matched as potential mates in 2011 by a conservation group . The clouded leopard is an endangered species and it is common practice in zoos to hand-raise all new born kittens . Clouded leopards are the smallest of the 'big cats', weighing between 30 and 50lb when fully grown. The cat - the most talented climbers among the cats - is classified as 'vulnerable' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) and its total population is no more than 10,000. This is down to factors such as deforestation, illegal trading and poaching commercially. Some parts, such as claws, skin and teeth are also consumed for decoration purposes. As such, it is important to do as much as possible to ensure the health and well-being of the threatened animal. It is common practice in zoos to hand-raise all newborn clouded leopards. The cat is most commonly found in the Himalayan foothills through mainland Southeast Asia into China.","The kitten is being cared for at the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida .

"A son whose no-nonsense dad gave him a fitting punishment for being a bully - and sent his story viral - has seen the error of his ways. Kayden Robenhorst, 13, said 'thank you, I deserved that' to dad Timothy, who surprised him with a run, 60 push-ups and gardening chores at 4am in freezing Green Bay, Wisconsin, after finding out he'd been mistreating a classmate. A photograph showing Kayden and Timothy posing with a sign explaining his sentence has been shared thousands of times online. Spelling it out: Timothy Robenhorst was shocked to heard his son, Kayden, had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him . Just desserts: Kayden, 13, is pictured above in the midst of a 'knuckle push-up', part of his grueling punishment . From above: Kayden said of the punishment 'I learned my lesson, and he's a good dad for doing it' Another condition of the punishment is that it remains Kayden's own Facebook profile picture and cover photo until Robenhorst relents. The surprise punishment, carried out Wednesday in 32-degree weather, came after Timothy got wind that his son had insulted a classmate, and later pushed him into a locker while walking between classes. Robenhorst, who heard what had happened from friends, decided not to let his son know in advance, but sprang the punishment on him at 4am. Punished: Kayden, pictured, was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs . After sitting him down and explaining what was about to happen, he dressed him up, stood over him during the push-ups then sent him out on the run. Describing the experience to DailyMail.com, Kayden said: 'It was stupid of me - I saw a kid and said a stupid, random comment.' 'When he found up, he woke me up at 3:30 in the morning, and he sat me down on the couch. And when I didn't come up with a good enough excuse to save my butt, I told the truth. 'He made me do 50 knuckle push-ups, run a mile, then come back and do incline push-ups. And I'm still not done.' 'I think it's a really good punishment - I learned my lesson and he's a good dad for doing it.' The two planned to have Kayden apologize to the boy in question in front of his whole class, but school authorities decided a private meeting would be a better solution. Kayden also apologized a second time when there were no teachers and parents around. Speaking about his high-profile parenting, Robenhorst said: 'He understood - he knows it was wrong and there have been no hard feelings since.' 'He actually has said ""Thank you, I deserved that, I understand it was wrong."" I believe he also apologized to the child another time the other day.' 'He didn't question his punishment - he had a look on his face, you can see he wasn't very happy when he was getting his picture taken - but it's been successful.' 'And seeing it go around the way it's been going around - I would do anything to put this out there and say ""Hey, don't let your child get away with this crap"". Even small bullying can turn into something big.' Apology: Kayden was made to say sorry to his victim in front of his whole class at Pulaski Middle School, pictured . Kayden, who lives with Robenhorst, who is a business consultant, and his wife, used to live with his mother in South Carolina, where he had a difficult past. But his father said he has seen him transform since coming north, and is now doing well at Pulaski Middle School. Under the original post, Robenhorst had written: 'I teach my kids they do not start fights but if someone puts their hands on them they finish it. 'This is what happens when you become a bully! I don't put up with it and at 4:30am today my son found out what happens when you pray on people for no reason and bully! 'Please share this to end this behavior everywhere! Nothing changes until you take a stance and it only takes one person to start a revolution!' Kayden concurs, adding: 'It's a good message and I hope lots of people see it'.","Kayden Robenhorst, 13, was given tough punishment by dad Timothy .

"Families face a high street Easter egg hunt following evidence some supermarket websites have run out of supplies.

Similarly, the Morrisons website is listing many top brands as ‘out of stock’, while Asda’s web store also has only a limited range left. Scroll down for video . Families face a high street Easter egg hunt following evidence some supermarket websites have run out of supplies . The Tesco website carries a red letter warning stating: ‘Sorry this product is currently not available’ on the vast majority of popular big brand eggs . Easter eggs listed as unavailable at Tesco include a host under the Cadbury brand, including the Dairy Milk giant egg, Roses, Caramel, Milk Buttons, Oreo, Flake, Twirl, Heroes and Wispa. Other branded eggs that are apparently sold out include Rolo, Galaxy Indulgent, Kitkat Chunky, Toffee Crisp, Terrys Chocolate Orange and Ferrero Rocher. The evidence suggests that the supermarkets have miscalculated demand for the eggs, which have been at the centre of a price war give-away as part of a wider battle to tempt shoppers through the door. Industry research suggests the average price of an Easter Egg is down by 9.7per cent this year following a series of special promotions. Morrisons triggered the Easter Egg crunch by slashing the price of many medium versions of the big brands, such as Smarties, Rolo and Maltesers to just £1. Tesco responded by offering Galaxy and Minstrel eggs on sale at a half-price £3 each with more pricey Thornton Premium eggs for sale with £2 off. Asda and Sainsbury’s have been offering their own deals. Similarly, the Morrisons website (pictured) is listing many top brands as ‘out of stock’, while Asda’s web store also has only a limited range left . Shoppers reported that Tesco stopped selling many big brand Easter eggs on its website before the weekend and more popular products were added to the list by this morning. All four big brand giant eggs are unavailable, as are six out of eight large eggs and seven out of nine medium eggs. The firm’s website is still offering some more expensive luxury eggs and its own label creations. Despite the evidence from Tesco’s own website, a spokesman said: ‘We have a fantastic range of Easter eggs available in stores and online, all at great prices and offering some amazing deals for customers.’","Tesco site shows majority of big brands eggs are 'currently not available’

"Suspended: Dr Adam Osborne (pictured) was suspended by the GMC two weeks ago amid sex with patient allegations, and has now stepped down as director of the company he owns with his wife . The psychiatrist brother of Chancellor George Osborne has resigned from his private medical company, leaving it with assets of just £551. Dr Adam Osborne, 38, was suspended by the General Medical Council two weeks ago pending an investigation into allegations he had a two-year sexual affair with a vulnerable woman patient – a married mother of two with psychiatric issues. Now he has stepped down as a director of Elitemed, the private company he co-owns with his wife Rahala Noor, a plastic surgeon. The company recently filed accounts which showed it was worth just £551, had £71 in the bank and owed creditors £7,337. Documents also revealed Rahala Noor, 37, who was previously secretary of the company, took over as the sole director. The couple each own 50 per cent of the company, but GMC rules mean Osborne cannot practise as a doctor until an investigation into the allegations is concluded. If they are upheld he could be struck off, although the GMC says the current suspension is not an indication of guilt. Another firm called Devonport Psychiatry, which was registered to Osborne’s West London home, appears to have had its 0845 number disconnected since The Mail on Sunday revealed he had been suspended by the GMC. He has also taken down his personal website. Elitemed was set up in 2010 shortly after Osborne was suspended over earlier claims which centred on his relationship with a cocaine-addicted prostitute. At the time, the GMC said his ‘relationship’ with the woman had ‘clouded his judgment’ and led him to prescribe anti-psychotic drugs, dishonestly use a false name and fail to inform her GP. The doctor was also disciplined for prescribing contraceptive pills to Rahala – who was then his girlfriend – and an anti-smoking drug to a family member. Osborne married Noor in a Muslim ceremony in 2009 after he had converted to Islam and changed his first name to Mohammed. A news report about his conversion was last year hidden by Google after a request from an unknown person following a controversial ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling in the European Court of Justice. This gave people the right to have ‘no longer relevant’ items removed from internet searches. Probe: George Osborne's brother cannot practise as a doctor until the investigation is concluded . Osborne is the youngest brother of the Chancellor and one of four sons born to Sir Peter Osborne – who co-founded wallpaper company Osborne & Little. After studying medicine at Manchester University, he became a junior doctor at the city’s Wythenshawe Hospital, a job he was forced to quit after the allegations of handing out falsified prescriptions.

"A care worker has today admitted targeting a professional poker player as part of a 'honeytrap' robbery but denied luring him to his death, a court heard. Leonie Granger, 25, swapped numbers with 56-year-old Mehmet Hassan after meeting him at a casino in Mayfair in London's West End. The father-of-three was found dead a month later after he invited Granger back to his flat in Islington, north London, following a night out, where he was allegedly tied up and beaten. Leonie Granger, 25, (left) has admitted targeting professional gambler Mehmet Hassan (right) in a 'honeytrap' Granger told the Old Bailey the plan was discussed with her boyfriend Kyrron Jackson and his friend Nicholas Chandler, both 28, on the day she met Mr Hassan - February 25 last year. She said: ‘That’s when they first said something about getting someone’s number, get their number and then we’d rob them.’ Asked what words they used, she replied: ‘Honeytrap. Like getting their phone nicked or something, nothing serious. Just go to the casino, get someone’s number, come back out, that was it.’ Her barrister Orlando Pownall QC asked her whether there was any discussion of the consequences to the victim or to herself, which she denied. Later that night Jackson and Chandler dropped her off at the Palm Beach Casino and parked around the corner. She said she was dressed casual in a pair of boots, a dress and a leather jacket when she went inside and met Mr Hassan, who sometimes won as much as £15,000 in one gambling session. CCTV shows Granger and Mr Hassan entering the Mayfair casino on the eve of his murder in March last year . Just hours after the pair were captured on CCTV, Mr Hassan was tied up and kicked to death in his home . Granger (pictured with Mr Hassan in CCTV, left, and posing together at the Palm Beach Casino in London's Mayfair, right) was giving evidence in her case at the Old Bailey today . ‘He said he liked my hair. He offered to get me a drink, asked me what I was doing there,’ said Granger. ‘I said I was just looking around the casino, see what it’s like.’ Granger admitted using the name ‘Rachel’ when she gave him her phone number. The next day Mr Hassan texted her: ‘Left just after you, did you get home alright? Mehmet’. Granger, who worked at a care home for elderly people with dementia in Gillingham, Kent, replied: ‘I am working until 7 lol. What you do? Do you live around West End or just socialise?’ Granger exchanged numbers with Mr Hassan and the pair began texting before arranging a night out in March last year - the night before he died . Mr Hassan replied: ‘I live in Islington, I’m a professional poker player. Don’t laugh Rachel because believe me I’m quite good. With your brains and my money we can make you into a great player.’ Granger then said: ‘I would like to become a good player just don’t have the funds to get into it.’ His reply said: ‘Funds is my department Rachel, please it will be my pleasure to wine and dine you.’ Granger told the court that she told Jackson and Chandler she had spoken to someone in the casino but 'that was it'. When asked how much time she had put into the whole project, she told the court that at this stage 'not a lot'. Mr Hassan was allegedly tied up and kicked to death after he took Miss Granger back to his north London flat in the early hours of March 24, last year. He was found lying in a pool of blood in his bedroom after his sister, Abide Ispanedi, raised the alarm at 9pm. A pathologist concluded his death was ‘multi-factorial’ and consistent with kicks to the head, neck and chest. Granger, Chandler and Jackson were all arrested soon after police launched a murder investigation. Film footage found on Granger’s phone showed all three smiling and laughing while handling wads of £50 notes stolen from Mr Hassan, it is claimed. Granger denies murder and conspiracy to falsely imprison Mr Hassan but has admitted her part in the robbery of Mr Hassan. Film footage found on Granger’s phone showed all three smiling and laughing while handling wads of £50 notes stolen from Mr Hassan, it is claimed . The pair visited the Palm Beach casino, where they swapped numbers and Granger used the name 'Rachel' Chandler, of Barking, east London, and Jackson, of Lewisham, southeast London, deny robbery, murder and conspiracy to falsely imprison Mr Hassan. Chandler and Jackson also deny two further counts of conspiracy to commit robbery, two count of conspiracy to possess firearms with intent, two counts of conspiracy to possess imitation firearms and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Leonie Granger, 25, swapped numbers with Mehmet Hassan in a casino .

"A five-year-old boy has been left traumatised after he was lured behind a building at his school and attacked by five  classmates before being made to face them again  just an hour later. Ewan Potter was kicked and punched in the playground of Living Faith Lutheran Primary School at Murrumba Downs in Brisbane's north two weeks ago. He was left with some 'cracking bruises' and clear psychological effects, but his father Anthony says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist. Ewan Potter was kicked and punched in the playground of Living Faith Lutheran Primary School at Murrumba Downs in Brisbane's north two weeks ago . Mr Potter was told by the school the group of boys - aged five and six - organised for the on-duty teacher to be distracted so they could carry out the attack on February 26. 'Ewan told me he was tricked into playing with the boys. They lured him behind the building and when he tried to run away they chased him and caught him,' Mr Potter told Daily Mail Australia. 'They dragged him back and started kicking and punching. 'The bruises are still there on his knees. He had a couple on his arms and chest. Luckily he didn't have any broken bones or blood gushing out.' His parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as 'restorative practice'. 'They made Ewan go back to face all five boys so they could see what the bullying had done to him - how traumatic is that?' he said. 'He went to sleep that night with a stick to protect himself. I sat on the floor of his bedroom.' Ewan was left with some 'cracking bruises' and clear psychological effects, but his father Anthony (right) says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist . Ewan, pictured here with his sister, was kicked and punched behind a school building by five young boys . Four of the boys remained in the same class with Ewan the next day, while the little boy who admitted to being 'the boss of the group' was moved to another classroom. 'It's gang violence. I can't believe six-year-olds can be pre-meditating attacks like this. One admitted to being the boss and getting four others involved,' Mr Potter said. The parents of all five children were called in and given behavioural orders  to work on at home, while age-appropriate consequences were enforced at school. Principal Jane Mueller said the school  had taken swift action and were 'saddened' by the bullying. 'I fully understand the concerns of parents of any child impacted by such an incident, and by the same token, I'm also conscious of our responsibility to teach these very young students at the infancy of their school career what is right and wrong,' she told the Courier Mail. Ewan's parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as 'restorative practice' Ms Mueller said  the boys involved were still being monitored in the playground and consequences were being implemented at home with the support of parents. 'No matter what these parents do at home to help them, these kids have got away with a slap on the wrist. If we keep letting them get away with violence, how is it going to stop,' Mr Potter said. 'For my own child's safety I have to rely on other parents to take a proactive approach.' Mr Potter said he was hesitant to take Ewan back to school the day after he was bullied but didn't want him to fear it altogether. 'I just sat him down and told him what they did was wrong. I still sit there asking if he's okay. He's been really quiet and shut down. 'I don't know how much it's going to affect him. I still can't believe it happened.'","Ewan Potter was attacked by classmates at Brisbane school last month .

"For Earth-bound optical telescopes, the surface of Venus is shrouded beneath thick clouds made mostly of carbon dioxide. To penetrate this veil, probes like the Magellan spacecraft use radar to reveal remarkable features of the planet, such as mountains, craters, and volcanoes. But now, astronomers have combined the Green Bank Telescope with the radar transmitter at the Arecibo Observatory to make remarkably detailed images of the planet's surface from Earth. Pictured is a projection of the radar data of Venus collected in 2012. Striking surface features, like mountains and ridges, are easily seen. The black diagonal band at the center represents areas too close to the equator to obtain well-resolved image data . The radar signals from Arecibo in Puerto Rico passed through both Earth's atmosphere and the atmosphere of Venus. Here they hit the surface and bounced back to be received by the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia in a process known as bistatic radar. This capability is essential to study not only the surface as it appears now, but also to monitor it for changes. By comparing images taken at different periods in time, scientists hope to eventually detect signs of active volcanism. They believe images such as this could also reveal other dynamic geologic processes that could provide clues to Venus's geologic history and subsurface conditions. Spanish astronomers have revealed a new theory for a 'Y' shape on Venus (annotated image from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter in 1979 shown). They say it is formed by winds pushing a 'wave' of clouds on the planet. These winds move faster at higher altitudes, creating the odd shape . 'It is painstaking to compare radar images to search for evidence of change,' said Bruce Campbell, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, . 'The work is ongoing. In the meantime, combining images from this and an earlier observing period is yielding a wealth of insight about other processes that alter the surface of Venus.' Venus is slightly smaller than Earth but has a similar mass. It is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million kilometres), and takes about 225 days to orbit the sun. One day on Venus lasts as long as 243 Earth days. Its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets. It's believed that its atmosphere contributed to a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet inhospitable. The planet's extreme high temperatures of almost 480°C (900°F) make it seem an unlikely place for for life as we know it. High-resolution radar images of Venus were first obtained by Arecibo in 1988 and most recently by Arecibo and GBT in 2012. When astronomers first started taking images of Venus, they were somewhat baffled by a mysterious 'Y' shape that covered the entire planet. Last week researchers say they have an answer - high intensity winds are distorting a 'wave' of clouds to produce a stretched effect. The discovery could also reveal how similar processes take place on other slow-rotating bodies in the solar system. The latest theory was proposed by astronomers from the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC) in Granada, Spain, in collaboration with the university of the Basque Country and the Institute of Astrophysics and Space Sciences of Portugal. On Venus strong winds move the upper atmosphere 225 mph (360km/h), circling the planet every four to five Earth days. But the planet itself takes almost 243 Earth days to complete an orbit - meaning the winds are much faster than the rotation speed of the planet. The winds have a mostly constant speed at different latitude, but nearer the pole they circle the planet quicker as the circumference of the planet is smaller. This ultimately gives rise to this 'Y' shape, as the clouds at the top and bottom of the shape are moved more quickly. To take the stunning images, astronomers combined the Green Bank Telescope (right) in West Virginia with the radar transmitter at the Arecibo Observatory (left) in Puerto Rico .","Astronomers took images with Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia .

"Remains sifted out of the ground zero rubble during the original recovery efforts following the September 11 attacks have been identified as those of a 26-year-old New Jersey man. Matthew David Yarnell, dubbed a 'merry prankster' in an obituary that appeared in the New York Times, became the 1,640th victim identified from among the debris thanks to DNA testing, NBC New York reports. Yarnell was vice president of technology at Fiduciary Trust International. He was in a meeting on the 97th floor in the south tower when United Airlines Flight 175 struck. Family remember the Carnegie Mellon graduate as a funny man. 'He liked to have fun,' his mother Michele Yarnell told the Times not long after the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Identified: The remains of Matthew David Yarnell have been identified from the original debris found at ground zero following the September 11 attacks . The death toll stemming from the attacks at the World Trade Center stands at 2,753. Of those, 1,113 victims have not been identified through a DNA match to items provided by families — toothbrushes, combs, clothing or swabs from relatives. Yarnell was working on the 97th floor of the south tower when UA Flight 175 struck . With ever-advancing technology yielding results that were impossible a dozen years ago, the unique genetic code gleaned from the bits of bone is the only hope for families waiting for anything tangible to officially confirm what they already know: Their loved one is dead. In some cases, scientists have gone back to the same bone fragment 10 or 15 times, using new technology to attempt to extract DNA diminished by fire, sunlight, bacteria and even the jet fuel that poured through the towers. The painstaking process involves pulverizing the bone fragments, adding a special chemical to the powder and then spinning it all in a centrifuge to break open the bone cells so DNA can be extracted. Then comes the last, critical step — looking to match it to an item with the victim's DNA provided by families — part of the medical examiner's collection of 17,000 contributions. Family members have long endorsed the ongoing identification process, even as some protested last year's move of the remains to the museum site, which they fear could be prone to flooding. 'Don't put them in the basement,' Rosemary Cain, who lost her firefighter son at the trade center, said at a protest against the move. 'Give them respect so 3,000 souls can rest in peace.' Other families supported the move, saying the repository is a fitting site for the remains. 'It will show the world the way we treat our dead,' Lee Ielpi, who lost his son in the attacks. 'Let's get them back to the site.' New technology: With new technology yielding results impossible a dozen years ago, forensic scientists are still trying to match the bone with DNA from those who died on Sept. 11, 2001, and have never been identified . A person demonstrates how to use a device used for milling and extracting DNA, at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner in New York. Yarnell became victim number 1,640 identified from the debris. Over 1,100 remain unidentified . The question is: How long and at what cost will the forensic team keep working to identify these last 9/11 remains? The team's annual salary budget is $230,000, plus costs for follow-up work by other scientists and staff. Desire said that as new technology becomes available, the efforts to identify the fragments will continue indefinitely. Charles Strozier, founding director of the Center on Terrorism at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that work must continue 'because our relationship to the Sept. 11 disaster hinges on being able to identify and pay respects to those who died.' For Desire, it's not just a grim scientific task — it's personal. He was under the still-standing towers minutes after the two hijacked planes hit them, having rushed down with the then-chief medical examiner, Dr. Charles Hirsch. As the towers toppled, the men were struck and bloodied by falling glass and debris. 'It's a service and an honor, working on something that has transformed American history,' he said. The death toll stemming from the attacks at the World Trade Center stands at 2,753. Of those, 1,113 victims have not been identified through a DNA match to items provided by families — toothbrushes, combs, clothing or swabs from relatives . Impossible to forget:There have been no identifications of 1,113 missing people and 7,703 of the samples of human remains cannot be identified .","Matthew David Yarnell was at a meeting at Fiduciary Trust International on the 97th floor when United Airlines Flight 175 struck below .

"Two bungling teenagers stole a a £100,000 Lamborghini during a break-in only to crash it two miles later. Connor Smart, 18, and friend Jason Grant, 17, had broken into the the Aberdeen home in the middle of the night where they stole three sets of car keys. The pair made off with the Lamborghini Gallardo and a BMW X5, worth £60,000, as well as four mobile phones, an iPad, a TV and £500 cash. Connor Smart (left) and Jason Grant (right) broke into a car owner's home in the middle of the night and stole three sets of car keys . But the car thieves lost control of the high powered Lamborghini and crashed into a van just two miles away. Officers were then led directly to Smart's family home after the car owner used an app to track down one of the stolen iphones. The pair denied the offences but a jury of eight men and seven women took just 40 minutes to find them guilty at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. Car owner Colin Crighton and his partner woke up in the early hours of the morning to find his cars had gone along with the keys for his Aston Martin Vanquish. The bungling car thieves stole a high powered Lamborghini Gallardo, worth a staggering £100,000, but crashed it just two miles away . Grant and Smart also took at BMW X5, worth £60,000, as well as four mobile phones, an iPad, a TV, wallet, handbag and £500 from the property in the west end of Aberdeen . Police were called out to reports of a car crash on the city's Lewis Road at about 3:09am. When officers arrived at the collision scene, they found the damaged Lamborghini and a van lying on its side on a pavement. The driver had left the scene. Neighbour Kimberley Murdoch told the court she had seen Grant driving the Lamborghini in the early hours of August 4 after hearing loud revving coming from outside her bedroom window. Kimberley Murdoch, 26, said there were lots of high performance cars in her neighbourhood and thought it was a strange time of the morning for her neighbour to be out. 'I heard the revving of what sounded like a super car,' said the medical student. 'It was approximately three o'clock in the morning.' The 26-year-old said she initially thought it might be her neighbour's Bentley or Aston Martin but when she looked out of her bedroom window, she noticed both cars were still parked outside. The pair had tried to deny the offences but the jury of eight men and seven women took just 40 minutes to find them guilty at Aberdeen Sheriff Court (pictured) Ms Murdoch then saw a white Lamborghini drive past her window a few minutes later. She said: 'I saw that there was one occupant in the car. It was a male. 'It appeared that the driver wasn't familiar with driving that type of vehicle. 'The revving was extremely loud for the speed that the car was trying to go at.' Sheriff Graeme Buchanan remanded both teenagers, who live in Aberdeen, in custody and deferred sentence until next month for background reports. He also instructed the fiscal to carry out investigations after one of the jurors complained about an alleged obscenity being shouted by one of the teenagers as they were led away from the dock.","Connor Smart and Jason Grant stole two high-end cars during a break-in .

Former Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen was born in which country? a) South Africa . b) New Zealand . c) Australia . Answers: Bulgaria, St Eliguis, Charles Babbage, Seurat, New Zealand . But that isn't the end of the nail-biting ride - when given the option to take the money and run Mr Skarbek opted to risk the $500,000 for a chance of becoming a millionaire. As his wife of 19 years, Jenny, joined him on stage for his winning moment on Monday, Mr Skarbek, from Hawthorn, Victoria, said he had been given a second chance at life and was determined not to waste it. 'I came here to win $1 million and that is what I am going to do,' he said. Mr Skarbek told Daily Mail Australia that the moment he decided not to take the $500,000 was the moment it 'stopped being about the money.' 'It's about more than the money now. It's about proving to myself that I can do it. 'A lot of people might think it's crazy not to leave with the $500,000 and I know it would have been so easy, but I do back myself.' Mr Skarbek hit financial trouble after being diagnosed with mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. His six-month treatment cost $50,000, putting further strain on the couple who said they were trapped in the renting cycle. 'My wife and I have been living hand to mouth and even had to call on our parents to help cover the blow-out on medical bills with my six-month cancer treatment. Million Dollar Minute has saved us,' he said. Things started to turn around when Mr Skarbek was given a clean bill of health and was told he had got on to the the show in the same week. After missing out by only one question last week Mr Skarbek was delighted to finally reach the $500,000 milestone . Mr Skarbek, who spent years dragging his wife Jenny to pub trivia nights, got into debt when he had to pay sky-high medical bills to treat his cancer . 'Sometimes you get in a rut. You know things will improve eventually but it's hard to see how. Then I got the great medical news and found out I was going to make the show,' he said. 'A whole series of things just started coming my way.' He said it was also a 'great comfort' knowing he had already locked in a pretty substantial prize of more than $300,000. Upon learning he had secured the safety jackpot, Mr Skarbek said his wife suggested he should should share their good fortune, donating to The Smith Family charity. Mr Skarbek says his 78-year-old mother Sophie has always supported him, with his parents helping him and wife financially . 'Jenny was thinking about how tough some people do it and what a magical thing it would be to win that money and help someone else that's in need,' he said. Surprisingly, Mr Skarbek said he wasn't a particularly good student at school, instead saying he inherited his thirst for knowledge from his father. 'Ever since I was a little kid a lot of my family used to nickname me 'The Professor'. I was always reading,' he said. Mr Skarbek, pictured as a child with family members, said travelling the world was the 'greatest gift' he was given . He spent his younger years travelling the world with his family which he said was the 'greatest gift' he was ever given. A young Mr Skarbek was nicknamed 'The Professor' Mr Skarbek said he has been an avid trivia player at his local pub for as long as he can remember and was elated to find his years of training could be put to good use. 'This is the only chance I've had to actually do something with my trivia skills,' he said. With a 'life-changing' amount of money coming his way, Mr Skarbek said it was his wife that was having trouble comprehending how much their lives will change. He plans to become a homeowner after spending years renting and wants to satisfy his wanderlust by taking his wife to Europe for the first time. Being the sensible man he is Mr Skarbek said he won't be rushing to hand in his notice at work however after spending 15 years in the energy industry he thinks might use his passion for trivia to get into the entertainment business. 'You never know, I might land a job on Channel 7,' he joked. Mr Skarbek returns on Tuesday afternoon to be the first contestant to ever play for $750,000.

Singing at the top of her lungs: They say third time lucky and after two musical flops it appears Patricia Krentcil - aka Tan Mom - is back for one last shot . She appears to be dressed for sunny weather, in a pair of tiny hot pants and sandals, suggesting the shots were taken last year or she jetted of to warmer climates for her musical exploits. Her new dance track is a collaboration with singer-songwriter Adam Barta and produced by Jake Benson. The same duo were behind the peroxide blonde's other disco failures 'It's Tan Mom' and 'Life of the Party'. In her new song Krentcil - who once admitted that she topped up her tan 20 times a month - sings about her outrageous adventures like spray tanning at the airport and running on the beach topless. Really going for it: The 46-year-old mother-of-five from Nutley, New Jersey, was photographed in the recording studio as she sang lyrics from her new pop song 'Rock My Freakin' Body' She also croons about her stint in rehab: 'If you think I’m drinking wine, ain’t no more since I did time, at the rehab with Michael Lohan, got all sober and now I’m flowin!' Rock My Freakin' Body is currently available to download for 99 cents and is yet to break into the top ten charts. When she's not singing, Krentcil's other passions include nightclubbing and going in for Botox injections. Out of control: Krentcil (pictured her in 2012) was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 after being accused of taking her then five-year-old daughter, Anna, to a tanning booth . In the spotlight: Anna Krentcil, six, being held by her father, Rich, pictured at their home on May 2, 2012 . Krentcil was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 after being accused of taking her then five-year-old daughter, Anna, to a tanning booth. The girl, who has fair skin and red hair, told a school nurse she had 'gone tanning with mommy' when staff at her school asked her about burns on her skin. Krentcil denied taking her daughter to a tanning booth and said the child was burned by the sun while she played outside. In 2013 Krentcil filed for divorce  from her husband Richard. According to reports she decided to call off the eight-year marriage after he failed a lie detector test about his infidelity on a television show called The Test. However, it's not known where the couple's relationship stands now.

"Tony Abbott is refusing to apologise for controversially saying taxpayers shouldn't fund the 'lifestyle choices' of Australians in remote communities despite backlash from indigenous leaders. The Prime Minister sparked outrage when he backed a West Australian plan to close 150 remote communities on Tuesday, saying governments couldn't endlessly subsidise people who chose to live far away from schools and jobs. 'It is not the job of the taxpayer to subsidise lifestyle choices,' Mr Abbott told ABC Radio in Kalgoorlie on Tuesday. Tony Abbott is refusing to apologise for controversially saying taxpayers shouldn't fund the 'lifestyle choices' of Australians in remote communities despite backlash from indigenous leaders . 'Fine, by all means live in a remote location, but there's a limit to what you can expect the state to do for you if you want to live there. 'What we can't do is endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in Australian society that everyone should have.' Labor and the Greens are demanding he apologise for comments they have described as racist and highly offensive. Speaking on Sydney's 2GB Radio on Wednesday, Mr Abbott defended his comments saying he was just being realistic and stating a 'general principle'. 'If you or I chose to live in a very remote place, to what extent is the taxpayer obliged to subsidise our services?' he told host Alan Jones. Mr Abbott's chief indigenous adviser, Warren Mundine (left), disagreed with the PM saying: 'It is not like retiring and moving for a sea change, it is about thousands of years connection' Speaking on Sydney's 2GB Radio on Wednesday, Mr Abbott defended his comments saying he was just being realistic and stating a 'general principle' 'It is incredibly difficult for the kids to go to school if there's only half a dozen of them and getting teachers there is all but impossible. 'Similarly, it's very difficult for the adults to get a proper job if there's no employment within hundreds of miles and this is where we have to be a little bit realistic.' But the prime minister's chief indigenous adviser, Warren Mundine, disagreed with his comments. 'That is a complete misconception of what it is and he's wrong in that regard,' Mr Mundine told Fairfax Media. 'It is not about a lifestyle, it is not like retiring and moving for a sea change, it is about thousands of years connection, their religious beliefs and the essence of who they are.'

Mr Mundine said the prime minister's comments were a misconception . The hashtag #lifestylechoices started trending on Twitter on Wednesday following the PM's comments.

The hashtag #lifestylechoices started trending on Twitter on Wednesday following the PM's comments . Mr Neumann accused Mr Abbott of trying to undo any progress made in closing the gap of indigenous disadvantage. Mr Abbott said it was reasonable for state governments to stop funding services in remote communities if the costs were out of proportion to the benefits. Greens senator Rachel Siewert slammed the comments as 'unbelievably racist' and completely out of touch with reality.","Tony Abbott has refused to apologise for controversial comments .

"You could be forgiven for not recognising the face (or rather the body) in Emporio Armani's latest underwear campaign. The stylish black and white photos show a torso that is suitably chiselled, immaculately groomed hair, a dash of designer stubble and, of course, the brightest - and tightest - white pants. DJ Calvin Harris, 31, has undergone a startling transformation in recent years; his once skinny frame replaced with a rippling physique that could put many a male model to shame. When images from the glamorous shoot were released, they quickly went viral. Wow! What happened to Calvin Harris? The superstar DJ, said to be worth £44million, is the star of a new underwear campaign by Armani... but he wasn't always to easy on the eye . Pre-muscles: The 31-year-old Scotsman from Dumfries, pictured here in 2007 and 2009 respectively, once favoured the skinny-boy look with longer locks and paler skin . Swoon: The DJ has all but given up alcohol and has a regular exercise routine that has honed his body...he joins David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo as one of Armani's boys in briefs . Harris, said to be the world's richest DJ with a personal wealth of around £44million, says his enviable six-pack is down to largely ditching alcohol - he hasn't drunk for a year - and a dedication to working out. The pop star, from Dumfries in Scotland, seems to be enjoying what has become known as the 'Gary Barlow effect', where men get more attractive as they advance in years. In the boy band's heyday, the Take That star was famously the least attractive member, something he himself admitted to - and trailed in the wake of his more athletically-blessed peers when it came to fan mail. Yet in the group's renaissance, Gary has captured the hearts of a new generation of  fans. Following a strict diet, the songwriter has shed the pounds that once dogged him and managed to keep the weight off. A smart haircut, light beard and personal stylist have seen his popularity soar. After the weight loss, he said: 'I’ve just not got the sort of body where I can pick and choose what I eat. I’ve got to go for one thing and stick by it. So I’ve tried not to have sugar and caffeine, etc, and it’s boring, it’s really boring. 'But it works for me. The result is that I feel good.' Better second time around: Gone is the peroxide hair of Gary in the first incarnation of Take That...replaced by a gentle quiff, light tan and more slimline figure . Not so gorgeous George: On the set of Nineties television show Baby Talk, Mr Clooney sported bouncy hair and double denim but has grown older gracefully, and bagged a beautiful lady to boot. The actor is pictured earlier this year with new wife Amal Alamuddin . Not always Prince Charming: Harry's flame-red hair, (captured left at Eton College in 2003) has softened with age and a career in the Army has ensured his slight physique is a thing of the past . Bleached hair, two earrings and a shiny jacket: The fashion disasters of a young Justin Timberlake, pictured left in 1997 and, right, spotted last month looking positively debonair in New York . Not even the thinking woman's crumpet... Hugh Laurie took a while to shine but a hit series, House, in the US transformed the way the opposite sex viewed him . Channelling Malfoy? An early shot of actor Daniel Craig (left) feels a long way from 007. Right, the actor in his more familiar guise at the press call for new Bond film Spectre in December last year . He's not the only male celebrity to have improved with age however. Universal heartthrob George Clooney's legion of adoring fans will mostly agree that the Hollywood actor/director has matured like a fine wine, suiting a smattering of grey hair much more than the more bouffant look that he sported in the Eighties. Other stars offering hope to mere mortals fearing their middle years include Hugh Laurie, who became an unlikely desirable as the front man of US television hit House. The latest incarnation of James Bond, Daniel Craig, has definitely become more attractive as he's clocked up more miles. Photos of the actor in his 20s show badly-dyed blonde hair and none of the super-fit physique that 007 fans have lusted over. Chart-topping makeover: Fear of appearing on television on a Saturday evening, on BBC show The Voice, propelled The Kaiser Chiefs lead singer, Ricky Wilson, into re-thinking his look . Hirsute suits you, sir: David Beckham (pictured left in 1999) has changed his looks many times but most will agree his brooding, bearded look since retiring from football is his best . So much better blonde: Ryan Gosling sporting darker hair and a fresher face back in 2002 and looking much more delicious last year at the Cannes film festival in 2014�� . The fashion designer Marc Jacobs hasn't been shy in showing off his gym-honed body in recent years but wasn't always quite so muscular; photos of the designer from his pre-work out stage reveal unkempt hair and an unremarkable physique. Younger stars who, like Calvin Harris, seem to have grown into their bodies as they reach their thirties include Justin Timberlake. The former N-Sync singer's youthful looks, complete with an earring in both lobes, might not have attracted the attention of now-pregnant wife Jessica Biel. And Prince Harry might not have enjoyed so much female attention without his Army training routine. Photos of the prince as a teenager, dressed in Eton gowns, reveal a slim frame and a redder tint to his hair. Other remarkable transformations from geek to god include Ricky Wilson, frontman with band The Kaiser Chiefs, who spruced up via weight loss and a beard, to appear on BBC1's The Voice. The star blamed the excesses of touring for his previously chubby appearance, saying: 'I used to drink loads and I wasn't as happy as I am now. I used to just get stuck into junk food on tour.'","Calvin Harris is the world's richest DJ and is said to be worth £44million .

"Clocks are springing forward this weekend, but Friday will still feel like winter for much of the country. Temperatures of 10 to 30 degrees below average were expected from the South to Northeast, along with heavy snow in the Mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service. The late-winter storm means school is canceled yet again for students in several states, and many households found themselves without power. State offices and legislatures shut down, too. In the Washington area, federal offices were open but on a two-hour delay. Residents hoped the storm would be this tough winter's last wallop, with spring bringing relief soon. Thousands of stranded motorists endured long waits on Thursday lasting nearly 24 hours for some as parts of Kentucky saw up to two feet of snow and frustrated travelers dealt with gas tanks and stomachs close to empty. Scroll down for video . It just won't desist! Workers clear piles of snow  in the Chinatown neighborhood in Washington on Friday as the storms continue . Temperatures are dragging at around 30 degrees below average across the country and snow is still falling in most states . Thousands of motorists endured  waits on Thursday lasting nearly 24 hours for some as parts of Kentucky saw up to two feet of snow . Snow plows kept up their fast pace as dropping temperatures created the risk of icy highways . The massive traffic jam stretched for about 26 miles. National Guard soldiers and emergency workers made safety checks on the frustrated travelers. 'You see miles and miles of tail ends and tail ends. It's not a very good sight,' National Guard Spc. Jeriel Clark said as his group of soldiers handed out food and water while patrolling snowbound Interstate 24 in far western Kentucky. Larry Weas spent a cold night hunkered down in his car. To conserve fuel during his 11-hour ordeal, he kept his car turned off for long stretches of time and scooped snow into a bucket to have something to drink. 'This has been a lesson of survival,' said the 54-year-old, who is diabetic. By Thursday evening, state highway officials said interstate routes in Kentucky were open again. Snow plows kept up their fast pace as dropping temperatures created the risk of icy highways. On Friday, rising temperatures could lead to flooding, officials said. Gov. Steve Beshear said flash flooding could be a concern. A man's plan to walk from Detroit to Toronto ended on Thursday in the middle of frozen Lake St. Clair, when an icebreaker spotted him, the U.S. Coast Guard said. A lookout on the Cutter Neah Bay spotted the 25-year-old man walking on the lake about 9.30am Thursday, 1.5 miles from Ontario's Seaway Island, the Coast Guard said in a statement. It said the 140-foot icebreaker sent a crew on foot to check on him. The crew questioned him and treated him for hypothermia, the Coast Guard said. Temperatures could rise in southern states on Friday but officials warn that could lead to flooding . Make way! This man shovels a path for himself near his home in Lexington, Kentucky, which is being pummeled by snow . 'He was in the beginning stages of hypothermia,' Lt. Joshua Zike, commander of the cutter, told the Times Herald of Port Huron. 'It took him a long time to formulate his thoughts.' The man, a U.S. citizen, wasn't dressed for conditions on the lake, had no flotation gear and no form of communication, the Coast Guard said. Zike said he was carrying a backpack with food and clothes, a sleeping bag and tarp. A plane from Atlanta skidded off a runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport while landing Thursday, crashing through a chain-link fence and coming to rest with its nose perilously close to the edge of an icy bay. The Delta flight veered off the runway at around 11.10am, authorities said. Emergency responders were still assessing people, but any injuries appeared to be minor, the Fire Department of New York said. The plane came to rest in several inches of snow. Passengers trudged through the snow in an orderly line after climbing off the plane. Both the airport's runways are closed until further notice, which is standard procedure after such incidents. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines said the passengers were bused to a terminal. It said the airline will work with authorities to figure out what caused the crash. Forecasters predict the weather will persist this way for most of the month as winter drags on . The sloppy serving of winter weather kept Virginia State Police busy, fielding 1,155 calls for service statewide over four hours. From noon to 4pm on Thursday, troopers responded to 491 traffic crashes and 222 disabled vehicles. The majority of the crashes involved damaged vehicles only. A Virginia State Police team recovered a vehicle and a deceased passenger in Buchanan County after the car was swept into the Russell Fork River. Officials say the driver was able to escape, but the passenger was swept away with the vehicle. Sleet and ice coated north Alabama in a treacherous glaze Thursday, making travel difficult and forcing schools, government offices and businesses to shut down yet again because of the weather. Forecasters said travel problems could persist through early Friday because of subfreezing temperatures. Police in Irondale suspected icy conditions as a factor in a crash involving more than a dozen vehicles including 18-wheeler trucks near the I-459 and I-20 interchange. Thursday's heavy snow kept most people home and cars off the streets, but Rob Pressly had other plans. The 29-year-old got a little stir crazy after doing some work at home, so he decided to strap on his cross-country skis and take a tour of Capitol Hill. Though Pressly has been skiing for years, Thursday was his first time trying it out on city streets. He said he'd been tempted by other storms in the six years he's lived in Washington, and after seeing that his neighbors had yet to shovel their driveways, he figured the city was in a similar state. The trip from his home to the Mall took him about 20 minutes, Pressly said.","Late winter storm means school is canceled in many states, many households are without power .

"These pictures of botched tattoos may make you think before you get inked. Luckily for the unfortunate few who have been left with inking mishaps, there are talented artists out there who can work miracles. Lal Hardy, a tattooist at New Wave Studios, London, is tasked with turning disaster pieces into masterpieces. Lal has shared some of the cover-ups he's most proud of and proves that with a bit of handiwork and a lot of experience, dodgy tattoos can be given a new lease of life. Scroll down for video . Lal Hardy is tasked with turning people's disaster pieces into masterpieces, such as this Marilyn Monroe, left, he shaded in to create an artsy monster, right . Speaking about why people come to see him to have their inks modified, he said: 'The reasons really vary from some that are just plain bad, some designs are dated, some want bigger work or others are names of ex-lovers. 'Personally, I am brutally honest with people regarding cover-ups. If I think it can't be covered I tell the client, the same if I think they have unrealistic expectations as to how a tattoo can be covered. I now only take on cover-ups or reworks that I feel will work.' Four of Lal's most prized cover-ups include a lion design that was transformed from some squiggles into a fierce inking. Lal says he transforms 'plain bad' ones, adds to some - like this seemingly unfinished lion tattoo - or makes dated ones more modern . More straightforward renovations include a robin playing card, left, which Lal re-vamped by changing it into a sparrow and adding a border, right . Speaking about the renovation work, he said: 'The lion was done by an amateur artist and because it was only partially done, it was possible to salvage it and cover it up.' He also worked his magic on a faded design by transforming it into a bold and colourful rose. Another botched design he fixed was a faded Marilyn Monroe inking. 'The cover up worked because the client researched a design he wanted, his original Monroe was faded and the new design had lots of detail and shading so lent itself well to a cover up,' said Lal. He also worked his magic on this faded design by transforming it into a bold and colourful rose, right . More straightforward renovations include a robin playing card, which Lal re-vamped by changing it into a sparrow and adding a border to give a splash of colour to the new piece. 'The cover-up process depends on various factors like the size of the tattoo, how faded it is and the density of the dark pigments in it as darker colours are harder to cover,' he explained. 'The amount of clear skin around it is also a consideration as this can open up the opportunity to incorporate the cover-up in a bigger piece. The placement of the tattoo on the body can also be a major factor in whether or not a cover up can be done.'

"Finding a new flatmate is often a challenge, but for one Swedish teenager only men as 'good looking as hell' will do. Alicia Hansson had also demanded that potential cohabitors were 'charming' and knew how to put a toilet seat down, in her advert on the flat-hunting Facebook group page in Gothenburg last week.

Ms Hansson had appealed for good-looking men who were 'charming' and knew how to put the toilet seat down after use . Ms Hansson told MailOnline: 'I've lost count on how many messages I've received, and am still receiving, and how many wonderful, handsome and charming men there are out there searching for company. 'I wish them all the best to find what they're looking for- I'm sure they will.

"One of the world's weirdest fish has been captured making a rare appearance near the surface. With its bulbous eyes, flat body and tiny fins, the Mola Mola is an unusual sight in the blue waters of California. But short of shying away from the camera the fish appeared to strike a pose. The photographs of the bizarre-looking ocean sunfish were taken by experienced diver Daniel Botelho. Scroll down for video . One of the world's weirdest fish - a Mola Mola - has been captured making a rare appearance above the water by diver Daniel Botelho in San Diego, California . Mr Botelho has spent years photographing the intriguing species all over the world. Despite their large and intimidating presence, he found the fish to be friendly and gentle - with one even following him like a pet. The 34-year-old said: 'They are usually very shy but once they get used to you they can follow you like a pet. 'In my case I had a gentle Mola Mola following me all the time until I got back to the boat. It reminded me of my dog. Mola Mola spend most of their days in deep waters but rise to the surface to be cleaned by other fish and birds . They are the heaviest known bony fish in the world and usually weigh around 2,000lb although larger specimens can weigh up to 5,000lb. Above, a Mola Mola curiously pokes its head up near a boat . Mr Botelho can be seen behind the Mola Mola (left), which is usually found in deeper waters (right) 'I have a special affection for Mola Molas, I love them and I am always looking for the challenge of interacting and photographing these fish.' Mola Mola are the heaviest known bony fish in the world and weigh around 2,000lb. They can grow up to 13ft in length and cannot close their mouth fully. They spend most of their days in deep waters but rise to the surface to be cleaned by other fish and birds. Mr Botelho added: 'They also cause a huge impact on people and I have several photos that have become viral on the internet just because people are amazed by the fish's shape. 'Some wrote to me attesting that they never even thought there could be such a fish in the seas.' Sunfish, or Mola Mola, are the heaviest  bony fish in the world. The largest specimens can reach 14ft vertically and 10ft horizontally, weighing nearly 5,000lb. Sunfish develop their truncated, bullet-like shape because they are born with a back fin that never grows. Instead, it folds into itself. Mola in Latin means 'millstone' and describes the sunfish’s somewhat circular shape. They are a silvery color and have a rough skin texture. They are found in temperate and tropical oceans around the world, and are often mistaken for sharks when their huge dorsal fins emerge above the water. Their teeth are fused into a beak-like structure and they are unable to fully close their relatively small mouths. Two Mola Mola rise to the surface.

"It has long been seen as a mythical and powerful city, lost for more than 2,000 years beneath the sea. Explorers have traveled to Crete, Malta, Sicily and Santorini in search of the the mysterious metropolis of Atlantis - described in detai by Greek philosopher Plato. But a computer expert has challenged these theories after he claimed the lost city did not sink at all, and said he had tracked down the site - to an area on land in Morocco. Scroll down for video . A German computer expert claimed remains of the lost city of Atlantis may not lie beneath the sea, but instead on the coast of Morocco after the ancient metropolis was overwhelmed by a large wave 2,000 years ago . Michael Hubner used clues given in Plato's descriptions to calculate coordinates of the lost city of Atlantis . Michael Hubner claimed Atlantis was overwhelmed by a tsunami, which then receded leaving the remains undiscovered, near the coast of Marrakesh. The German computer expert formed his theory using mathematics to calculate the precise GPS coordinates of the lost city. He meticulously gathered every detail he could from Plato's 'Timaeus' and 'Critias' which describes Atlantis in detail and gives in total 51 clues about the mysterious city. These 'clues' include that Atlantis was near the sea and had a ring-like structure surrounding its centre. Crucially, it was also said to be 3,100 miles from Athens. This area includes Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Other clues were that Atlantis was not in ancient Europe or Asia and had very high and big mountains, with Morocco having the Atlas mountains. It was also said to lay west of Egypt and Tyrrhenia. Using these details Hubner put the measurements into a computer programme and used a map which divided the area into 400 squares. The site pinpointed by Hubner had many of the 51 clues, including being surrounded by concentric circles . Hubner's theory challenges previous ideas about Atlantis, that it lies somewhere beneath the sea . Hubner marked the areas where more characteristics were present and came out with one region which had the most clues - the Souss Massa plain in Morocco, about 100 miles south of Marrakesh. He then took the GPS coordinates and went to have a look himself. What he found appeared to have many of the attributes of Atlantis described 2,600 years ago by Plato, regarded as one of the greatest Western thinkers. This map of Atlantis - oriented with south at the top - was drawn by 17th century scholar Athanasius Kircher, who pinpointed the mythical continent as being in the mid-Atlantic before it was lost to the sea . The site was in a desert basin just seven miles from the sea and in the centre was a small mound, similar to the raised area at the heart of the ancient city described by Plato. Surrounding it were circular dry riverbeds, matching Plato's description of the city being surrounded by concentric circles, which alternated between land and sea. Hubner concluded it was highly improbable that all the characteristics of Atlantis were present in this area purely by chance. The findings are described in Mark Adams' book . The theory is described as 'the most convincing on paper' by Mark Adams in his book, 'Meet me in Atlantis.' Adams wrote: 'The measurements for the diameter of his outermost ring and distance of his capital from the Atlantic Ocean varied by only about 10 percent from Plato's numbers.' The author also found support for Hubner's idea that rather than sinking into the ocean, Atlantis was overwhelmed by a large wave. The area around Souss Massa is prone to earthquakes, which can cause tsunamis of the size needed to flatten a city. Hubner had claimed that the idea of Atlantis being beneath the sea was simply an example of the real elements of the story being lost over years of retelling. Also Morocco has historically not been examined by archaeologists, suggesting many undiscovered remains that may hold the key to the lost city could exist. Hubner formulated his theory in 2008. Before he died in 2013 he met Adams and took him to the precise site he had pinpointed from his calculations. The theory differs from many hypotheses that place Atlantis as a lost city beneath the sea, as described by Plato. Earlier this year orichalcum, a form of metal, was found beneath the sea off the coast of Sicily and is believed to have come from the lost metropolis. A total of 39 ingots were found in the wreck of a 2,600 year old cargo vessel thought to be from Greece. Atlantis was first described by the Greek philosopher Plato more than 2,000 years ago. While many believe the story is a myth created by Plato to illustrate his theories about politics, others insist it is based on a real historical disaster. According to Plato's account, written around 360BC, Atlantis was a major sea power located in the Atlantic. It was larger than ancient Libya and Asia Minor (modern Turkey) put together, and was 'the way to the other islands, and from these you might pass to the whole of the opposite continent'. His account included detailed descriptions of the island - with mountains in the north and along the coast, and a plain in the south. Its kings were descended from Poseidon - the god of sea - but their divine lineage became diluted as they mixed with mortals. By around 9600 BC the island had conquered much of Western Europe and Africa and enslaved its enemies. This date would make the city nearly as old as the end of the last ice age and pre-dates the earliest recorded city states, found in what is now Iraq, so seems rather unlikely. After a failed attempt to invade Athens, the entire island sank into the sea 'in a single day and night of misfortune'. Over the centuries, scholars have attempted to locate the real Atlantis - believing the account was based on a real ancient superpower. One of the most plausible theories is that Plato was describing the Minoan civilisation on Crete and the neighbouring island of Santorini which was devastated by a massive volcanic eruption around 1600BC. Some believe the Atlantis myth was inspired by the Black Sea floods of around 5000BC - an event that may have also generated the flood stories which appeared in the Old Testament.","For centuries experts have believed Atlantis is a lost city under the sea .
But Michael Hubner claimed remains of city were actually on land .
He said a tsunami had overwhelmed Atlantis, flattening the ancient city .
Waters had then receded, leaving remnants of city near coast of Morocco .
Hubner used 'clues' given in Plato's description of Atlantis to pinpoint site .
Identified 51 details and used them to calculate coordinates of Atlantis .
Clues were that Atlantis surrounded by circles and 3,100 miles from Athens ."
"YouTube is filled with useful kitchen tutorials, teaching viewers everything from how to slice an onion without shedding tears, to the easiest way to peel a boiled egg. But there's one video which could be heading straight to the top of the 'most useful kitchen hacks' list. 'How to open a bottle of beer with a sheet of paper' was uploaded by Rhys Morgan this week, and it does exactly what it says on the tinnie. So the next time you forget a bottle opener you don't need to worry. Mr Morgan's method is so ludicrously simple it's a wonder no one has thought of it before. All you need to successfully crack open your beer is one piece of A4 paper. Mr Morgan who lives in Cardiff, Wales starts off by vertically folding the paper in half. He then folds the half lengthways again, pressing firmly so the creases of the paper hold. He keeps folding the paper in half vertically until he ends up with only a small amount of paper left. Mr Morgan starts by vertically folding a piece of A4 paper in half (left) before he folds it in half again (right) Then he folds the remaining paper lengthways to create a 'V' shape from the paper. He places the 'V'-shaped paper against the underside of the bottle and applies pressure . And with one swift upwards move he pops the cap of the bottle, successfully releasing the beer from its bottle-topped prison. The 21-year-old Cardiff University student said he invented the trick when he found himself at a party with bottles of beer and a broken bottle opener. He told FEMAIL:'I learnt the trick  during the summer.' 'I was at a garden party with, tragically, a broken bottle opener. We needed to create some kind of bottle opener, and I thought that strengthening a sheet of paper by folding it could help it act as a lever to pry the top off!' After folding the paper thrice the forms a 'V' shape with the paper . He then places it on the underside of the bottle (left)  and in one swift move pops the cap (right) Success! He has managed to open a bottle of beer without a bottle opener . Mr Morgan said his trick will work with all types of paper, down to kitchen roll. On his account he explained:' Some people are pointing out that the paper looks thicker than standard paper. 'It's just high GSM paper printer that I happen to have at home. This trick still works fine with thinner paper, all the way down to kitchen towel.' His video currently has more than 350,000 views.. The English Literature student is overwhelmed by the popularity of the clip. 'I had no idea the video would ever take off like this so this is all a bit of a shock at the moment,' he said. Do try this at home.","Rhys Morgan's YouTube tutorial has more than 350,000 views .

"Empire star Taraji P. Henson has issued a groveling apology to the LAPD admitting her son was not racially profiled. The actress unleashed a scathing attack on officers earlier this week, accusing them of pulling over her 20-year-old son Marcel 'for no reason' to 'illegally search his car' in Glendale, California, in October. But after the force released dash-cam footage showing the car streak through a red light, Henson has backtracked. The video, released on Friday, shows Henson admit to having marijuana and Ritalin on him, before an officer also finds hash oil, a grinder and a knife. After a short and calm conversation, the officer lets Henson drive off without a ticket. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Apology: Tajari P. Henson posted this message on Instagram after it emerged her son was pulled over in October for skipping a red light and let off without a ticket despite having marijuana on him . Henson hit headlines earlier this week after saying her son Marcel (pictured together at a film screening in April last year) was racially profiled by police in Glendale and at the University of Southern California . Hours later, his mother wrote on Instagram: 'I would like to publicly apologize to the officer and the Glendale Police Department. A mother's job is not easy and neither is a police officer's. 'Sometimes as humans WE overreact without gathering all of the facts. As a mother in this case I overreacted and for that I apologize. 'Thank you to that officer for being kind to my son. Love Tajari P. Henson.' Henson made headlines earlier this week after telling Uptown magazine: 'It was bogus because they didn't give him the ticket for what he was pulled over for.' Under questioning, Henson told officers that he had a prescription for the marijuana but could not find it. He said he did not have a prescription for the Ritalin and that a friend had given it to him. However the officer, speaking calmly, lets him drive on without a ticket. The dashcam footage was obtained by The Los Angeles Times, which noted that race did not seem to be a factor when Henson was first pulled over. 'I am not going to give you a citation for running that yellow because that would actually put a moving violation on your driving license, and you are going to have to go to traffic school and all that stuff, so I am helping you by not giving you a violation on it. All I am going to do is take the weed from you,' the officer can be heard saying in the video. Traffic stop: Footage has emerged of police pulling over Marcel Henson, son of actress Taraji P Henson, in Glendale, California, in October. Henson said this week her son was racially profiled during the stop . New footage: Despite Henson saying her son was pulled over for no reason, he actually ran a lighted crosswalk as a pedestrian crossed and admitted to having marijuana and Ritalin on him . Sobriety test: Marcel Henson, 20, told the officer he had smoked marijuana two hours before driving, and the officer asks him to get out of the car to see if he is under the influence, but determines he isn't . The officer told Henson he could go to court with the citation and show proof he has a prescription for medical marijuana. Otherwise he could just pay a fine. 'It felt like this was a little better than the other one,' the officer said. 'I am giving this to you too because you smoked weed about two hours ago… and a warning if you have Ritalin on you and you're not supposed to, don't do it. 'That's a big violation and I wouldn't want to do that to you.' The boy's mother made her controversial comments to Uptown magazine earlier in the week. The Empire star said that not only was her son pulled over by police, but was stopped by cops at the University of Southern California for 'having his hands in his pocket. Henson revealed she had planned to transfer Marcel to USC, but had now decided to send the 20-year-old to the historically black Howard University, her alma mater. Empire star Henson, 44, says her son was stopped at the University of California (file picture) for no other reason than having his hands in his pockets . A University of Southern California chief vowed to carry out his own investigation into the alleged incident Henson spoke about in the magazine. The school's public safety director, John Thomas, said he was 'disturbed' by the reports. After learning of the USC allegation, Thomas revealed that he too had experienced racial profiling as a teenager . In a statement, he said: 'I was deeply disturbed to read news reports about a prospective student who felt profiled on or near campus because of his race. 'We encourage reporting of allegations of bias and I hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother. 'I would like to look into this matter further and better understand who was involved and what took place. 'As someone who personally experienced racial profiling as a teenager, I have a stake in learning more about this incident and doing all I can to reach a just resolution.' Henson has revealed she has now decided to send her 20-year-old son Marcel to historically-black college . New hit: Henson currently stars on Fox drama Empire as Cookie Lyon, the recently-released-from-prison ex-wife of a music mogul (played by Terrence Howard) He said he was not yet clear on which police departments were involved and that 'any allegation of bias or unequal treatment by university officers would trigger an investigation that I would supervise along with the university's Office of Equity and Diversity'. He continued: 'It is my expectation and that of the university that our department uphold the highest standards of constitutional policing, affording equal rights and respect to all persons.' Marcel is Henson's only child, and his father was her high school sweetheart. After revealing her son's ordeal, the 44-year-old said in the interview: 'So guess where he's going? Howard University. I'm not paying $50K so I can't sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus. Proud mother: Henson and her son pictured on January 20, 2013 - attending a celebration for leading women in Washington, DC . Also in the interview, Henson spoke about how happy she was to be one of now many black women leads on the small screen in shows like Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder. 'It feels good that there's not just one black person. I don't like that we get fixated on one or two at a time, or three at a time. 'If you look at Caucasian Hollywood, every year there's a handful of new faces you've never seen before, then after that, they got five movies coming out and they're introducing you to more talent. So I'm just so happy to see what's happening on television right now. We have options and that's how it should be,' Henson said. Empire aired it's two-hour first-season finale last week, and has already been green-lighted for a second season. Henson plays Cookie Lyon on the show, the ex-wife of a rap music mogul (played by Terrence Howard) who was recently released from prison after taking the fall for his drug-dealing business. The show has had several guest starts in the music industry including Snoop Dog, Courtney Love, Rita Ora, and Jennifer Hudson.","Taraji P.

"A German tourist has been killed by a shark after having his leg bitten at an Egyptian beauty spot that is a popular destination for British holidaymakers. The attack happened at a resort on Egypt's Red Sea, and police have revealed it is the first fatal shark attack in the region since 2010. The 52-year-old man's body has been moved to a local hospital after the attack yesterday. Scroll down for video . A shark attacked and killed a 52-year-old German tourist off Al-Qusayr in Egypt (library photo) Officials are conducting an investigation into the attack, which saw the man's leg bitten off at the knee. State news agency Al-Ahram report that the tourist was swimming with his wife when the attack happened. An official from the German Embassy in Cairo says they received reports that a German citizen died in the area but are not aware of the cause of death. It was the first fatal shark attack in Egypt since a string of maulings in 2010 that left a German woman dead and three Russian tourists wounded in another Red Sea resort. The attack happened just off Al-Qusayr, at a popular spot for tourists swimming . The shark attack is the first reported incident in five years, since one German woman was killed back in 2010 . In 2010, the German pensioner was mauled to death as she snorkelled in relatively shallow waters around the resort, which is famed for its scuba diving sites. She died just a day after Egyptian authorities lifted a 48-hour ban prompted by four other savage shark attacks. One victim lost a hand and another lost a leg. The Red Sea is home to several species of shark, but the type believed to have been behind the 2010 attacks was the oceanic whitetip common to the region. A red flag serving as a warning of shark sightings will be fluttering over Red Sea resorts following the death . The attacks in 2010 forced the government to close off a stretch of beach in the Sharm el-Sheikh resort for a week. In 2009, a shark killed a French woman off another resort close to where the German tourist was attacked on Sunday.","German man, 52, had his leg bitten off at the knee at Red Sea resort .

"Classical music can help slow down the onset of dementia, new research has found. Scientists discovered that patients who listened to experts of Mozart had enhanced gene activity in the brain in areas including memory and learning. Meanwhile, the music also affected the activity of a risk gene connected to Parkinson's disease. Classical music can help slow down the onset of dementia by enhancing gene activity in the brain, new research has found . The Finnish researchers found the changed activity was only present in 'musically-experienced' patients, who listened to music regularly, suggesting the importance of familiarity with music. For the study, participants were asked to listen to Mozart's violin concert No 3, G-major, K.216, a piece that lasts 20 minutes. The experiment was carried out on both musically experienced and inexperienced participants. The research involved participants listening to Mozart (pictured) for 20 minutes . The study showed that genes were enhanced in those deemed 'musically experienced' in areas such as dopamine secretion, which is when a neurohormone is released in the brain, synaptic neurotransmission, which is how neurons receive information, and learning and memory. Meanwhile, the music appeared to down-regulate genes associated with neuro-degeneration, which is the progressive loss of the structure or function of neurons. The researchers said several of the up-regulated genes were ones which are responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds. This suggests a common evolutionary background of sound perception across different species, they said. One of the most affected genes in this area was synuclein-alpha (SNCA), which is also a known risk gene for Parkinson's disease. Study leader Doctor Irma Jarvela, of Helsinki University, said: 'The up-regulation of several genes that are known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggest a shared evolutionary background of sound perception between vocalizing birds and humans.' He added: 'The effect was only detectable in musically experienced participants, suggesting the importance of familiarity and experience in mediating music-induced effects.' Dr Jarvela added that the findingscould give give further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying music therapy. The effects of this are still largely unknown.","Research saw patients listen to Mozart's violin concert No 3 for 20 minutes .

"A former male model and a restaurant bus boy are both missing after a building exploded in New York City on Thursday afternoon. Nicholas Figueroa, a 23-year-old former Hollister model who lives in Harlem, was on a second date at Sushi Park on Second Avenue with a girl he met at work. A bus boy at the restaurant, Moises Lucon from Queens, has also been reported missing, a law enforcement official told the Wall Street Journal. Police said they also are trying to determine whether six other people reported missing - but not thought to have been in the destroyed buildings - were connected to the explosion. Scroll down for video . Missing: Nicholas Figueroa, 23, was on a date with a Bowlmor Lanes co-worker when the restaurant exploded . Search: His family said payment records show he was there but they cannot trace him . Figueroa was at the restaurant with a girl he knew from his job at Bowlmor Lanes on Manhattan's Chelsea Piers. After the explosion at 3.17pm, she was rushed to Bellevue Hospital with a broken nose, the New York Daily News reported, but Figueroa has not been located. Firefighters have yet to pick through the rubble of the three buildings that collapsed. On Friday, they used high-powered water towers to extinguish pockets of fire still burning at the site. Pommes Frites, the restaurant that collapsed next to explosion site, said on Facebook that all its staff are safe. Figueroa, who lives in Harlem, was reported missing when he failed to show up for work at 5pm on Thursday and payment records show he paid for the meal at Sushi Park minutes before the blast. Tyler Figueroa said his brother and his date were paying for the meal when the blast occurred. The date, who is in the hospital, remembers only stumbling outside before losing consciousness, Tyler Figueroa said. Mystery: The girl he dined with has been taken to Bellevue Hospital with a broken nose . Horrific: A suspected gas explosion saw the building collapse at around 3.15pm on Thursday . Destruction: An image taken on Friday morning shows the huge hole where the three buildings once stood . His family told the Daily News they have searched every hospital in Manhattan and do not know where to look next. 'Right now we don't really know what to do, we're just praying,' his family told the paper. His brother, Neal Figueroa, told WABC he was confident in his brother, whom he called 'Superman', would be found alive and well. 'I know he's strong enough to get out of this,' he said. The 23-year-old's Facebook page shows he modeled for the clothing company in 2013. He graduated from Buffalo State College in December with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and a minor in intelligence analysis, spokesman Jerod Dahlgren said. He has been working at Bowlmor Chelsea Piers for the past few months as a front desk attendant and laser tag attendant, according to spokeswoman Leslie Norden, who said employees were deeply concerned for their hardworking colleague. Scene: He had been at Sushi Park (the brown storefront on the left) on East Village's Second Avenue . Intense flames consumed buildings on Second Avenue and 7th Street following the explosion at 3.15pm - about an hour after Con Edison inspectors visited the building and found the gas-related work being done there 'unacceptable,' according to officials. 'Preliminary evidence suggests a gas-related explosion,' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. He said the incident 'appears to have been caused by plumbing and gas work that occurred in 121 2nd Avenue' and the the investigation is ongoing. After the explosion, the site of the blast and two neighboring buildings caught alight, eventually causing all three to crumble to the ground - leaving a massive hole on the end of the block. Nineteen people were injured, four of them critically. Five first responders, among them four firefighters and an EMS worker, also suffered minor injuries. Two of the critical patients have been taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Cornell suffering from burns to their airways.","Nicholas Figueroa, 23, took a co-worker to Sushi Park on Thursday afternoon when a massive explosion  set the building alight .

"A man who married and impregnated a 12-year-old girl has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years in jail for persistent sexual abuse. Judge Deborah Sweeney said on Friday the 27-year-old Lebanese man, who cannot be named, had persisted in pursuing his Australian victim despite her initial reluctance. He then 'married her' before he sexually assaulted her on numerous occasions between January 11 and February 5 last year. The Australian girl was pregnant when her 26-year-old Lebanese husband was charged with ongoing child sex abuse. A 27-year-old man has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years behind bars . The pair held their 'wedding', which was allegedly arranged by her father, in the girl's lounge room in the Hunter region in NSW, in January last year. It is alleged the man gave the child $500 as a wedding gift. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the man told the court today that 'his cultural and religious beliefs doesn't excuse his behaviour'. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, the girl was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy and then miscarried in February after complaining of  abdominal pain. The girl, now 13, didn't want to marry the student because of the 14 year age gap but the man bombarded her with text messages after he first laid eyes on her in a mosque in November 2013, court papers stated. The man pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court in October to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a 25-year maximum jail sentence. The 27-year-old Lebanese student and the 12-year-old Australian girl spent their wedding night as a motel in the Hunter region of NSW where they had sex several times . The charge takes in 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14, with which the man was originally charged. He was ordered not to contact his victim for two years. Police allege the man married the Hunter Valley girl in an Islamic ceremony earlier last year. The girl's father will face trial this year. The father, who is in his 60s, allegedly arranged the illegal marriage. The father allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. He was charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Court documents say the girl met the 27-year-old man at a mosque in November 2013  after he approached her father and asked to meet her. Police allege the young girl's father enabled his daughter's sexual assault by organising the unlawful marriage - including allowing them to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before the ceremony. The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police allege. A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. The imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500. In court documents it is claimed that since the marriage the pair engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis until February when their relationship was discovered by a Centrelink worker, when the man tried to get registered as the girl’s legal guardian in order to obtain welfare benefits. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the [then] 26-year-old,' the police report states. The man has had his student visa cancelled and is now living in an immigration detention centre.","A Lebanese man who 'married' a 12-year-old girl has been sentenced .

"Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichette has revealed that he is quitting his job to travel the world with his wife. Pichette, 52, shared the decision, which he called a 'perfectly fine mid life crisis full of bliss and beauty', in a Google+ post on  Tuesday afternoon. 'After nearly 7 years as CFO, I will be retiring from Google to spend more time with my family,' he wrote - adding that he will only be leaving the company once they find a replacement. Canadian-born Pichette explained that the idea of retiring first came to him last September while he was watching the sunrise from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro with his wife, Tamar. Scroll down for video . Stepping down: Patrick Pichette, Google's chief financial officer (pictured in 2012), has announced he is retiring after nearly seven years working for the company. He plans to travel the world with his wife, he said . 'And Tamar out of the blue said ""Hey, why don't we just keep on going"",' he wrote. '""Let's explore Africa, and then turn east to make our way to India, it's just next door, and we're here already. '""Then, we keep going; the Himalayas, Everest, go to Bali, the Great Barrier Reef... Antarctica, let's go see Antarctica!?""' He told her: 'It's not time yet, There is still so much to do at Google, with my career, so many people counting on me/us - Boards, Non Profits, etc,' he wrote. 'But then she asked the killer question: So when is it going to be time? Our time? My time? The questions just hung there in the cold morning African air. 'A few weeks later, I was happy back at work, but could not shake away THE question: When is it time for us to just keep going?' He explained that this is the right time to step down, as two of their children are away at college and the third is working for a start-up in Africa. Family: Pichette said it is time to retire because his three children are no longer living at home. He will also celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary with his wife (center) this year and said 'she deserves more' Turning point: He first thought of retiring as he and his wife watched the sunset from Mount Kilimanjaro last year (pictured with their guides) and she said she wanted to keep traveling with him rather than go home . 'Nobody is waiting for us/needing us,' he wrote. The couple will also celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary this year. In that entire time, it has been 'non-stop work' for him. 'She deserves more,' he wrote. 'Lots more.' Pichette explained that he would be staying with Google, where it has been a 'privilege' to work, until the company finds a replacement and he will be remain there throughout the transition. He concluded: 'In the end, life is wonderful, but nonetheless a series of trade offs, especially between business/professional endeavours and family/community. 'And thankfully, I feel I'm at a point in my life where I no longer have to have to make such tough choices anymore. And for that I am truly grateful. Carpe Diem.' Pichette can afford to step down. Bloomberg Business reported that his salary is $650,000. In 2012, he was paid a $492,115 salary and a $2.7 million cash bonus, CNN Money reported. And in addition to his salary and bonuses, he earned in nearly $31 million from his Google stock incentives from 2010 to 2013, the Associated Press reported.

He told the company he would be retiring on March 4 and it plans to find a new CFO within the next six months, Google said in a statement. CEO Larry Page also shared Pichette's leaving notice on his own Google+ page. 'Well worth reading -- it will warm your heart,' he wrote. 'Patrick has been a joy to work with and I wish him all the best on his new adventures!' Pichette was born in Montreal, attended the Université du Québec à Montréal and received an MA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Oxford. He worked for Bell Canada before Google.

"Utah lawmakers have passed a bill that would make it the only state to allow firing squads for carrying out a death penalty if there is a shortage of execution drugs-some even claim the firing squad death is more humane. The passage of the bill by the state Senate on Tuesday comes as states struggle to obtain lethal injection drugs amid a nationwide shortage. The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Paul Ray of Clearfield, touted the measure as being a more humane form of execution. Ray argued that a team of trained marksmen is faster and more humane than the drawn-out deaths that have occurred in botched lethal injections. Scroll down for video . is the past becoming the future?: This June 18, 2010, file photo shows the firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah and may soon be put back in practice . The bill gives Utah options, he said. 'We would love to get the lethal injection worked out so we can continue with that but if not, now we have a backup plan,' Ray told The Associated Press. Before they are shot to death, inmates may have a last meal. In Utah the prisoners will not be allowed a final cigarette - as has historically been the custom before facing a firing squad. They may offer a final word right before their execution. Firing squad executions are usually executed by five or so police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles in rapid succession aimed at the chest. The prisoner is then hooded and over their heart is placed a small circular target. In one of the rifles is a blank bullet so each gunman can believe they were not the one who fired a fatal shot. The state has carried out three executions by firing squad since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Utah's last firing squad execution was that of murderer Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. He was pronounced dead just two minutes after the 12:15 am execution at 12:17 am. Opponents, however, said firing squads are a cruel holdover from the state's wild West days and will earn the state international condemnation. 'I think Utah took a giant step backward,' said Ralph Dellapiana, director of Utahns for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. He called firing squads 'a relic of a more barbaric past.' Dellapiana said the legislature should be discussing whether, not how, to execute citizens. Whether Ray's proposal will become law in the conservative Western state is unclear: Utah Governor Gary Herbert, a Republican, won't say if he'll sign the measure. His spokesman, Marty Carpenter, did issue a statement this week acknowledging that the method would give Utah a legitimate backup method if execution drugs are unavailable. Utah American Civil Liberties Union representative Anna Brower said the organization is still holding out hope that Herbert will not sign the bill. The legislation would make Utah 'look backwards and backwoods,' she said. The measure narrowly passed the House in February, where additional lawmakers had to be called in to break a tie vote. But it made it through the Senate on an 18-10 vote with no debate on Tuesday. Four Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the bill. Salt Lake City Democrat Gene Davis was the only one to speak. He said he was voting against the bill because it 'only puts another alternative on the table' instead of doing away with executions altogether. Ray said he didn't expect much debate on the proposal because it seemed many lawmakers had made up their mind about the idea from the start. More humane?: Republican  Paul Ray says the aim of his firing squad bill is to give Utah an option as states struggle to obtain lethal injection drugs amid a nationwide shortage and is actually more humane . A few were persuaded to support it once they learned Utah law already calls for the state to revert to the firing squad if a court ever declares lethal injection unconstitutional, he said. The legislation would reinstate the use of firing squads more than a decade after the state abandoned the practice. Utah is one of several states to seek out new forms of capital punishment after a botched Oklahoma lethal injection last year and one in Arizona that took nearly two hours for the condemned man to die. Legislation to allow firing squads has been introduced in Arkansas this year. In Wyoming, a measure to allow firing squads if the lethal drugs aren't available died. In Oklahoma, lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow the state to use nitrogen gas to execute inmates. Protest: Randy Gardner of Salt Lake City, the older brother of Ronnie Lee Gardner, the last inmate to be killed by firing squad in Utah in 2010, protests with a group opposed to capital punishment in January . Utah's proposal keeps lethal injection as the primary method of execution, but it allows for the state to use firing squads if the state cannot obtain lethal injection drugs. States across the country have struggled to keep up their drug inventories as European manufacturers have refused to sell the lethal concoctions to prisons and corrections departments because of their opposition to the death penalty. Texas' supply will be used up if the state goes forward with two lethal injections in the next two weeks. The Texas deadline is the most imminent, but other states are struggling, as well. The head of Utah's prison system has said the state does not have any lethal injection drugs on hand and would have to obtain some in the years ahead if an execution were to be scheduled. May not sign: Utah Gov. Gary Herbert  will not say if he'll sign a bill to bring back the firing squad but does say the method would give Utah a backup execution method . States turning to alternative drugs have been faced with legal challenges from inmates, something Ray has said Utah could sidestep if it has a backup execution plan in place. Utah lawmakers, concerned about intense media attention, stopped offering inmates the choice of a death by firing squad in 2004. A handful of inmates on Utah's death row were sentenced before the law changed and still have the option of going before a firing squad after their court appeals are exhausted. Utah's last execution was by a firing squad in 2010, when Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles. Gardner ate his final meal on the Tuesday before his execution at 6:30 p.m. and elected to fast before his shooting. His last meal included steak, lobster, 7-Up, apple pie and vanilla ice cream at a cost of $35 to the state, corrections officials said. Gunshots: Utah State Prison (right) after Ronnie Lee Gardner (left) was executed by firing squad on Friday, June 18, 2010 in Draper Utah . Asked by a prison official if he wanted to say anything, Gardner responded simply: 'I do not, no.' Gardner was hooded and over his heart was placed a small circular target. In one of the rifles was placed a blank shot so no one would know who killed him. A barely audible countdown was interrupted by two loud bangs in quick succession. It was 12:15 a.m. He was pronounced dead at 12:17 a.m. The state has carried out three executions by firing squad since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The first U.S. inmate executed after that ruling was Gary Gilmore, who was killed by firing squad in early 1997. The Washington, D.C.-based Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment, says a firing squad is not a foolproof execution method because the inmate could move or shooters could miss the heart, causing a slower, more painful death. One such case appears to have happened in Utah's territorial days back in 1879, when a firing squad missed Wallace Wilkerson's heart and it took him 27 minutes to die, according to newspaper accounts.","The passage of the bill by the state Senate on Tuesday comes as states struggle to obtain lethal injection drugs amid a nationwide shortage .

"A man who tipped the scales at 35 stone due to years of binge drinking and eating junk food says he should be given gastric bypass surgery on the NHS in order to lose weight. Mark, 45, from Glasgow suffers from lymphangitis - a painful swelling of his legs - and is at risk of diabetes because of his size. He struggles with his mobility and has had to have hand rails and extra banisters fitted around his home to help him use the stairs. He also needs straps to help him lift his limbs into bed and can't put his own shoes on because of his girth. Scroll down for video . Scottish Mark who tips the scales at 35 stone due to years of binge drinking and eating junk food says he should be given gastric bypass surgery on the NHS in order to lose weight . 'I feel restricted in what I can do, caged,' the father admitted. He said gastric bypass surgery, which costs £9,000 on the NHS, is his only hope. 'I have always been a big guy. From the age of 13 a lot of drink and food. I reckon lager had a lot to do with the weight initially,' he explained. 'I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I have lost weight and it's the easiest thing in the world to put it back on. All I am looking for is help to keep it off by restricting what I can eat.' He says his problem with food is an addiction and he should be supported in the same way people are when they try to give up addictions to cigarettes and alcohol. 'Especially in Scotland we live in a fried culture, everything is fried and greasy or fat, usually that stuff tastes the best. There's not enough healthy options out there. 'It's an addiction, all I want is that wee bit of help.' Mark shares his story on Channel 4 show NHS: £2bn A Week And Counting which aims to show viewers the dilemmas the health service faces when trying to decide who to treat. Mark shares his story on Channel 4 show NHS: £2bn A Week And Counting which aims to show viewers the dilemmas the health service faces when trying to decide who to treat . Mark, who has been married to wife Lorraine for 30 years, has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the NHS in Scotland for a third time. He can't afford to pay for the op privately as he was made redundant from his job at a delivery company two years ago and is now on benefits. He said: 'It all boils down to money. Your life means nothing if it costs too much.' He admitted he knows people watching will think he doesn't deserve to have the operation on the NHS. But in the long run, it could save NHS funds as they wouldn't have to treat him for diabetes or other health conditions he may develop as a result of his obesity in the future. Professor David Kerrigan, a bariatric surgeon who treats both NHS and private patients, agrees that weight loss surgery can be cost effective for the NHS. He said: 'I know a lot of people won't have any sympathy for the sort of patients I treat but these people have real problems. They are not a little bit chubby wanting to look better, they are ill because of the obesity they developed. 'I don't care how or why they got it, I know they are at the bottom of a deep hole they can't get out of and the surgery offers them an escape. 'This surgery is transformative for people's lives, there are very few operations we do that can achieve that.' Marks added: 'If it stops me getting diabetes then it benefits me and them, those costs can then go somewhere else.' The show also interviews other people desperate to be treated on the NHS to show viewers how difficult it can be to decide whose need is greater. There are children born with cerebral palsy who need Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) - a procedure that can significantly reduce muscle stiffness helping them to walk more easily and reducing painful muscle spasms. Mark, who has been married to wife Lorraine for 30 years, has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the NHS in Scotland for a third time . Meanwhile, Becky, 24, from Grimsby, is one of thousands of women in the UK in need of IVF treatment in order to fulfill her dream to become a mother. Three cycles of IVF on the NHS costs £10,000 and Becky has been denied the treatment because her partner, Mark, 38, a scaffolder, already has a child from a previous relationship. Becky is infertile thanks to getting an STI when she was a teenager and she said she's heartbroken that IVF is her only chance to have a baby. She said: 'When I was younger I couldn't wait to grow up and have a family. I have always loved kids so when you have been told you face a life with no children it's pretty tough, you have to live with that every day, it's not a nice feeling. 'It guts you to think you were stupid enough to trust someone and they gave you an STI. And then to find out later in life that's the reason you can't have children, it guts me. 'I sometimes feel disgusted with myself. People make mistakes, I was young and stupid, it was not my fault. I didn't know he was sleeping with Tom, Dick and Harry behind my back. 'It's so hard, family and friends keep making announcements that they are having a baby and you are happy for them but deep down you're gutted as it's all you ever wanted.'

"Hillary Clinton's emails won't likely turn up many insights about the 2012 Benghazi terror attacks, according to a onetime Clinton confidant, because she can't type. Dick Morris, who helped President Bill Clinton navigate domestic policy and led his 1996 re-election effort before imploding in his own 'bimbo eruption' scandal, wrote Monday on his blog that Mrs. Clinton 'doesn’t know how to type.' 'That’s right. She writes everything out in longhand. Really. Anyone who has spent time in meetings with her knows about her endless yellow pads.' Morris' insights, although dated, came as the former secretary of state visited the White House for a rare sit-down with President Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton visited the White House on Monday and tweeted this old photo of her hugging President Obama, while a former aide to her husband compared her email scandal to the Watergate tapes and said the Obama team likely created it to torpedo her chances in 2016 . PRESSURE: Clinton is facing tough questions about what's on a private email server that hosted all her emails for the four years she spent as America's top diplomat . Former Clinton insidder Dick Morris has turned against Hillary, dishing dirt about her past and suggesting what her weak spots might be . 'Her emails will most likely turn out to be very short and quick,' he predicted. 'She wouldn’t spend a lot of time pecking out long letters. No way. That’s why the Benghazi Committee needs to also look very closely at the emails on private accounts that Hillary’s closest aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, maintained.' 'Anything more than a few lines were most likely written by someone else on her behalf,' Morris continued. 'There’s a reason why Hillary set up and used private emails with them for official business: all the important emails were likely written by her staff. Without access to them, we won’t know what was going on.' A congressional panel is investigating the circumstances surrounding a 2012 terror attack on State Department facilities in Benghazi, Libya, while Clinton was secretary of state. The revelation that she exclusively used a private email account – otuside the control or automatic archiving of the Obama administration – has fed Republican accusations that she hid her involvement in a post-attack cover-up in the weeks before the 2012 election. At least two aides, Mills and Abedin, used personal email accounts on Clinton's private server, kept at her Chappaqua, New York home. Clinton's hour-long White House visit on Monday followed her appearance on a Washington, D.C. domestic policy panel hosted by the far-left Center for American Progress, and before she headlined an awards ceremony for journalists. She took no questions from reporters at the evening event, even though her unauthorized private email server has dominated news coverage, her aides are under subpoena and she is expected to launch a presidential campaign in the coming weeks. At the earlier liberal event, she endorsed a German-style system of subsidies to companies so they would keep more people employed. 'President Obama and Secretary Clinton enjoy catching up in . person when their schedules permit,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday in a cryptic statement to reporters. 'This afternoon they met privately for about an hour at the . White House and discussed a range of topics.' Moments after the White House confirmed the meeting, Clinton tweeted an old photo of her hugging Obama in the White House Situation Room. The president has had a frosty relationship with his former top diplomat since 2008 when thetwo squared off for the Democratic presidential nomination. IT'S THE AIDES, STUPID! Email accounts of former State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills (left) and her top deputy Huma Abedin (right) are where Benghazi-related emails likely lurk, says Dick Morris . THE ADDRESS: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Clinton damaged his ambitious quest for the brass ring by starting the rumors that he was born in Kenya and lacked a valid U.S. birth certificate. The resulting conspiracy theories have dogged his presidency since Day One. Clinton's Twitter message, though, defended key provisions of the president's signature health insurance overhaul, which was an extension of her own failed attempt at reform while her husband was president. 'Repeal those things? Embrace them!' she tweeted. Morris has a checkered past. He famously resigned from Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign two months before Election Day after it was revealed that he paid a prostitute for sex and let her listen in on his phone calls with the president. His most recent star turn came with a lengthy Fox News Channel contract which wasn't renewed after he spectacularly blew his forecast for the 2012 presidential contest. Mitt Romney, the once famous pollster predicted, would coast to victory and unseat Obama. But Morris has been a thorn in Hillary's side since being bounced from her orbit in 1996. YUK-YUK: Clinton joked about her email scandal on Monday night at a journalism award dinnner: ''No more secrecy, no more zone of privacy. After all, what good did that do me?' When she ran for president in 2008, he penned a vicious 'fact check' article claiming that her 'main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent.' 'Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party,' for a year after her college graduation, he wrote. And 'she flunked the DC bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar.' Morris did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But he said Sunday on a New York talk radio program that 'when we talk about ""Will Hillary survive the email scandal?"" – it’s just like asking in 1973 and 74, ""Will Nixon survive the Watergate tapes?""' 'By delaying the day of reckoning' for all her private emails, he said, 'she's risking shipwrecking not just her candidacy, but the entire [Democratic] Party.' 'I think Obama wants [Elizabeth] Warren, not Hillary,' Morris added. 'I think the reason the email scandal got released to the newspapers by the administration was because they wanted to torpedo Hillary.'","Dick Morris writes that the former secretary of state writes everything in longhand .

"A 35-year-old divorcee enlisted her family and friends to help her ravage and eventually destroy her beautiful bridal gown over the course of seven months before she ceremoniously torched it in a bonfire. After splitting from her husband of eight years in 2014, Dayna Rumfelt, from Wasilla, Alaska, knew she didn't want her wedding dress hanging in her closet for the rest of her life. Her desire to rid herself of the memory-filled garment prompted her to devise Operation Destroy The Dress, a detailed plan which would enable Ms Rumfelt to wreak havoc on her gown by dragging it through the mud and donning it for a day of paintball shooting, among other things. 'It felt so freeing,' she told The Huffington Post. 'For a long time after my divorce, I felt like I had a monkey on my back dragging me down into the mud.' Dirty dress: Divorcee Dayna Rumfelt, from Wasilla, Alaska, spent seven months destroying her wedding gown, including covering it in mud, after she split with her husband of eight years in 2014 . Finally over: Operation Destroy The Dress ended when she set her gown ablaze in a backyard bonfire . She continued: 'When the dress adventure began, I started to feel that less and less.' Ms Rumfelt's adventure began when she was photographed modeling her white gown at the Rage City Rollergirls roller derby game, where she coached the skaters from the sidelines as a bench manager, all the while clad in her fancy frock. Her friend Spenard Itch, who was also helping from the sidelines, wore a suit so she could match Ms Rumfelt's bridal attire. Next Ms Rumfelt and her friend Laura Burns, who was also going through a divorce, wore their dresses as they jumped into Reed Lakes.

"A Virginia middle school student received a 364-day suspension last September, after officials said they found him with a marijuana leaf. However, the 11-year-old's teacher parents, Bruce and Linda Bays, have said that three field tests proved their son did not have a leaf from the plant. A Virginia middle school student received a 364-day suspension last September, after school officials said they found him with a marijuana leaf. Speaking to the Roanoke Times, the Bays said there are varying accounts of the September 22 incident involving their son, identified as R.M.B. The couple said they'd heard the boy, who at the time was enrolled in Bedford Middle School's gifted and talented program, had displayed the leaf in a school bathroom, in his homeroom in another account, and while riding the school bus in yet another version. An assistant principal later searched the boy's backpack and pulled out both a lighter and a leaf, before he asked a school resource officer -  who is a deputy for the sheriff's office - to step in, according to the newspaper. Linda Bays told the Roanoke Times 'I asked, ""Can I see the leaf?"" and the deputy said, ""No, it’s already in evidence."" We have never seen the leaf. He’s been out of school for six months.' R.M.B. received an immediate ten-day suspension, before the nearly year-long suspension was issued during a September administrative hearing, the newspaper reported. The Bays told the Roanoke Times that at a November juvenile court hearing, they found out about the leaf's multiple negative test results - and that a prosecutor planned to drop their son's marijuana possession charge. Linda Bays told the newspaper 'I immediately sent a letter to [the school's operations chief Dr. Frederick Duis] requesting a new hearing,' and claimed he told her 'The court system and the school system were two different entities.' The Roanoke Times reported that the couple has sued both the school district and the sheriff's office, claiming school officials violated their son's constitutional due process rights and that the sheriff's office committed malicious prosecution. The Bays told the Roanoke Times their son is being treated by a psychiatrist for depression and panic attacks, and is now anxious regarding being in public. Attorney Jim Guynn, who's representing both defendants, told the newspaper that the resource officer thought the leaf was from a marijuana plant. 'It’s the same punishment and exactly the same result,' Guynn told the Roanoke Times regarding how the school deals with fake drugs and real ones identically. The Bays told the newspaper that their son's denied any wrongdoing multiple times. Linda Bays told the Roanoke Times 'Why would you want an 11-year-old gifted-and-talented student out of school for 364 days?'

"A man has been sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder and conspiracy in the deaths of six people, including a prostitute who featured on an HBO reality show. Johnathan Allen Cochran's sentence came down after he pleaded guilty in late February as part of a plea deal in which he will testify against others charged in the case, The Oklahoman reported, citing court documents. One of the victims in the November 9, 2009 attack was Brooke Phillips, who had appeared on the HBO reality show 'Cathouse.' She was pregnant at the time. 'Cathouse' documents the Moonlite BunnyRanch in Mound House, Nevada, which is a legal brothel. Victim: Brooke Phillips was killed in the November 9, 2009 attack. Phillips had appeared on the HBO reality show 'Cathouse' (left) which documents the Moonlite Bunny Ranch brothel in Mound House, Nevada . Slayings: Also killed were Millie Barrera, left, Casey Mark Barrientos, center, and Jennifer Ermey, right . Also killed  were Jennifer Ermey, Millie Barrera and Casey Mark Barrientos. Additional murder charges were filed because both Phillips and Barrera were pregnant. In 2013, the Associated Press reported that 'Investigators allege Barrientos ran a drug and prostitution ring out of a south Oklahoma City house where the victims were killed.' The wire service reported that Indian Brotherhood gang member Denny Phillips 'and a second man, David Allen Tyner, 31, allegedly were involved in illegal drug sales with Barrientos and plotted to kill him because they weren't happy with the amount of money they were being paid.' Tyner claimed that Denny Phillips - who was not related to Brooke Phillips - encouraged him to commit the murders, according to the Oklahoman. The newspaper reported that Tyner 'is serving life sentences without parole in connection with the crime.' The Oklahoman, which cited an affidavit, reported that on November 9, 2009, Tyner let Cochran and Russell Lee Hogshooter off near the Oklahoma City home where the murders would take place. Tyner then reportedly went to the house by himself. Johnathan Allen Cochran, left, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder and conspiracy in the deaths of six people. He has been accused of working with Russell Lee Hogshooter, right, and David Tyner . Denny Phillips, seen in this file photo, allegedly encouraged David Tyner to commit the murders. Phillips' trial will take place next month. He was not related to Brooke Phillips . Tyner claimed to have murdered Barrientos with a gun - after overhearing gunshots take place in a living room while he was inside a bathroom, the newspaper reported. Referring to the affidavit, the Oklahoman said Tyner pursued Barrientos out of the home, got back, and saw the bodies of the slain female bystanders. He also claimed to see Cochran and Hogshooter with knives covered in blood. The house was lit ablaze by Hogshooter - then he, along with Tyner and Cochran, burned the clothes they were wearing, hid their firearms in the ground, then took off, the Oklahoman reported. Phillips' trial will take place next month, and Hogshooter's preliminary trial will take place in May, according to the news outlet. District Attorney David Prater told The Oklahoman that families of the victims agreed to the plea deal to secure Cochran's testimony. Killed:  Brooke Phillips was pregnant at the time of the November 2009 slaying . Investigators were informed by Tyner that both Hogshooter and Cochran participated in the attacks, leading to the charges against them, according to the newspaper. News9 reported that US marshals apprehended Cochran in November as he was getting the mail. Marshals showed up at Hogshooter's trailer in November, and they arrested him after he attempted to flee, according to the television station. Shortly after the November 2009 murders, Moonlite Bunny Ranch owner Deninis Hof told CBS News upon learning of Brooke Phillips' death 'That's terrible, terrible, terrible. We're sad.' 'It's been the saddest few days of the 54 years at the BunnyRanch,' Hof said at the time.","Johnathan Allen Cochran has been sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder and conspiracy in the deaths of six people .

"This is the bizarre moment a sword wielding raider calmly leans down and strokes a dog during a terrifying pub raid. The masked man was captured on CCTV briefly lowering his weapon to pat the sandy coloured dog, while a number of bound hostages cowered nearby. The duo, armed with a three-foot long machete and half a pool cue, stormed into the Strawberry Duck in Clayton, north Manchester. Scroll down for video . This is the moment that the masked raider stroked a sandy coloured dog during a terrifying pub raid in Manchester . The masked men stormed behind the bar at the Strawberry Duck in north Manchester during the raid . The pair were wielding a three-foot long machete and half a pool cue, which they used to threaten staff and customers . The balaclava wearing raiders bolted the pub's doors shut before rushing behind the bar and threatening staff in the middle of a Saturday lunchtime. Frightened workers opened the till, before being marched downstairs by their captors who then bound their hands  together with cable ties. It was as one of the men was left alone to guard the handful of frightened hostages, that he oddly bent down and started to stroke the dog. The moment of kindness happened as his accomplice was out of the room ransacking the pub for more money. A police spokesman said the two men left the pub with a quantity of cash and ran off down the canal in the direction of the city centre. CCTV footage of the robbery on at 12.40pm on February 7, has now been released in the hopes of identifying the robbers. The masked duo got their hands on the pub's takings after forcing staff to open the till . The robbers bound together the hands of terrified staff and customers after ordering them into a downstairs room . As one of the raiders was left alone to guard the hostages he stroked a pet dog that had wandered into the downstairs bar . Detective Constable Alexander Day said: 'Almost four weeks has passed since the robbery and I hope that by releasing this footage it might help to identify who the two men responsible for this terrible incident are. 'This is still very much an active investigation and I would like to reassure anyone who may have been concerned by the events of that day that we are committed to finding the offenders. 'I would also like to pay tribute to the pub's owners and staff who managed to stay calm and reassure the customers who had been caught up in this terrifying situation. 'If anybody has any information at all, no matter how little you might think it is, then please contact the police.'","Masked raiders armed with machete and pool cue storm Manchester pub .

"A sour appearance on business competition show Shark Tank actually ended in success for start-up founder Jesse Genet. The 27-year-old taped this past year, pitching her company Lumi which sells DIY kits to print custom designs on T-shirts, bags, and other surfaces. But the shrewd angel investors on the show refused to bite at Genet's offer of a 5 per cent stake in her company for $250,000, believing she was overestimating the worth of the business of $5 million. Scroll down for video . The pitch: Jesse Genet, CEO of DIY screenprinting company Lumi, failed to get an investment when she appeared on Shark Tank in a recent episode . Empty handed: The sharks felt that the 27-year-old's valuation in her company was too high and she refused to compromise on lower offers . Success: Shortly after the episode was taped, Genet applied for and was accepted into leading Silicon Valley start-up incubator Y Combinator . Shark Kevin O'Leary estimated that she was only taking back $100,000 in profits after taxes and found the $5million valuation a little aspirational. 'That’s 50 times your free cash flow - It’s ridiculous,' he said. O'Leary and fellow shark Laurie Greiner offered Genet an alternative deal, based on a much-lower valuation of her company, but Genet refused to budge, leaving the show empty handed. As she ended her bargaining with the sharks, Genet remained positive saying: 'I'm going to make this into a credible company'. And it appears she was right. Just one month after her episode aired she has already doubled her profits. Shortly after taping the show, Genet applied for and was accepted into Y Combinator, one of Silicon Valley's most prestigious start-up incubators. She joined the incubator in December and in just three months has increased her profits to $2.5 million by expanding her product line and redesigning her website. '[The comments] were dicey, but I can handle that,' Genet told Business Insider. '[Shark Tank] helped us realize what was really big about our business and what was not scalable.' On Tuesday, she presented her company at YC's biannual Demo Day, showing off a whole new line of products not shown on Shark Tank - including custom stamps. On the right track: In three months at Y Combinator, Genet has doubled her sales to $2.5 million. Above, photos show how Genet's patented printing technique works . Genet started her business three years ago, after finding a method for printing on natural surfaces with a negative film, developed my an inventor in the 1950s. Genet spent two years trying to track down the inventor, and ended up convincing him to sell her the trade secret formula for $50,000. Kickstarter helped her raise $270,000 to get the business started, and now her product is sold in retailers like Michael's.","Jesse Genet, 26, pitched her DIY screenprinting business on a recent episode of Shark Tank .

"Chocolat author Joanne Harris blasted the app, saying what starts out with blanking out a few words ends with 'burning libraries' As one person bluntly put, it is ‘f****** horrifying’. An app that blanks out swear words in e-books has prompted outrage among writers including Chocolat author Joanne Harris, who have accused it of censoring their work without permission. Last night Mrs Harris, 50, took to her blog to write a scathing critique of the Clean Reader application which has been designed to help parents protect their children from explicit content. It operates on a sliding scale from ‘clean’, which removes only the worst swear words, to ‘squeaky clean’ which even takes out ‘damn’. Condemning the app on her blog, in a post titled ‘why I’m saying “f*** you” to Clean Reader’, Mrs Harris, whose book was turned into a Hollywood film starring Juliette Binoche, 51, and Johnny Depp, 51, likened the programme to examples of suppression from history. She said: 'Anyone who works with words understands their power. Words, if used correctly, can achieve almost anything. 'To tamper with what is written – however much we may dislike certain words and phrases – is to embrace censorship. ‘We’ve been down this road before. We should know where it leads by now. It starts with blanking out a few words. It goes on to drape table legs and stick fig leaves onto statues. 'It progresses to denouncing gay or Jewish artists as “degenerate”. It ends with burning libraries and erasing whole civilizations from history.’ She added: ‘Apps like Clean Reader change the text without the author’s permission. 'They take the author’s words and replace them – sometimes very clumsily – on the basis of some perceived idea of “bad words” versus “good words”. 'No permission is sought, or granted. There is no opt-out clause for authors or publishers.’ Mrs Harris was not the only writer to take offence to the app, which is downloadable on Apple and Android devices and is free. Laurie Penny, a journalist and author, said: ‘There’s now an app for taking the swearwords out of books. I find this f****** horrifying’. Charlie Stross, a science fiction writer wrote on Twitter: ‘This - from an author’s point of view - is an obscenity: algorithmic censorship of ebooks.’ The app has three settings, clean, cleaner and squeaky clean (left) that will blank out offensive words on a table reader. The 'squeaky clean' setting will even cross out 'damn' and 'darn' (right) Linda Acaster, a novelist from Yorkshire, argued: ‘The first act of a dictatorship is to censor books. The second is to ban them. The third is to burn them.’ And last night members of the public waded into the row, with one posting on Twitter: ‘A horrifying slippery slope’ Another wrote: ‘Really bad news. And damn stupid. See what I did there Clean Reader!’ In an attempt to placate the anger, messages were posted by the Clean Reader Twitter account, including one which read: I’m sure the F-word isn’t the only thing that makes your books great!’ But it only appeared to add fire to the row, with one writer posting ‘you should have a very serious think about your app. It’s censorship, plain and simple.’ Clean Reader was designed by American couple Jared and Kirsten Maughan amid concern about a book their daughter had read. Publicity material for the app, states: ‘We told her that there was probably an app for this type of thing that would replace profanity with less offensive words and perhaps we should get her a tablet that she could use to read books with. ‘To our surprise there wasn’t an app like this. The more we thought about this idea the more we wanted it to be a reality. 'Eventually we decided we would do all we could to bring Clean Reader to the world.’","Joanne Harris, author of Chocolat, has lead charge against censoring app .

"A desperate attempt to stop China's precious 'water pandas' dying out forever has begun on the Yangtze River. The Yangtze finless porpoise is facing the same fate as their cousin, the river dolphins which were officially declared extinct in 2006, wiped out by human development in the world's most populous country. There are just 1,000 of the fresh water mammals left living in the world's longest river, but number are declining by more than 13 per cent every year, the People's Daily Online reports. At that rate, the finless porpoises - who are known for their mischievous smiles, and referred to affectionately as China's pandas of the water - will be extinct within a decade. Endangered: The Yangtze finless porpoise is critically endangered and could be extinct within the decade . Mission: Fishermen and experts have known joined together to try to halt the decline . But now local fishermen have joined forces with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and China's Institute of Hydrobiology to try and turn the tide for the porpoises, after the Ministry of Agriculture and the Yangtze River Fishery Supervision Bureau decided it was time to save the species. The Yangtze Finless Porpoise Conservation Project officially began this month when a fleet of carefully navigated boats headed out into Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province. The lake is almost twice the size of London and hit the headlines last year after it dried up, thanks to the Three Gorges reservoir - the world's biggest dam - and a drought. But the freshwater lake, the largest in China, is also home to almost half the surviving finless porpoises - a total of 450 animals. The project aimed to catch the Yangtze's last remaining water mammals, attracting them using sonar to allow them to collect data on their health, gender, weight and measurements. The strongest animals were then taken to be released into other areas, where scientists hope they will help increase the populations. Plan: A new project sees some of the strongest animals from the largest population being relocated . Future: Experts hope the animals they catch in Poyang Lake will help increase populations elsewhere . WWF's porpoise project protection commissioner Zhang Xinqiao said they had managed to catch 36 finless porpoises since March 11. 'After physical examinations we have temporarily placed 11 of them into holding cages and eight of these will be relocated to their new homes in April,' he added . It is thought the porpoises will be moved to waters in two conservation areas on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces.","Yangtze finless porpoises are classified as 'critically endangered' by WWF .

"One is an eminent scientist whose life story has been turned into an acclaimed film that has won actor Eddie Redmayne an Oscar. The other is a former self-employed businessman and father of three who enjoyed skiing, camping and hiking. But Professor Stephen Hawking and Steve Isaac both battle with motor neurone disease, a degenerative illness that has left them unable to move or speak. Steve Isaac, pictured with his son Fraser, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in February 2010 . Mr Isaac, pictured on a holiday with wife Debbie, has revealed he wants to end his life on his own terms . The 56-year-old former businessman, from Hampshire, relies on a computer system to communicate . While professor Hawking, 73, has flourished despite his disability, writing the best-selling novel a Brief History of Time, Mr Isaac, 56, has reignited the debate on the right to die, telling a documentary he wants to end his life on his own terms. Mr Isaac, who lives in Hampshire, has already been rendered unable to speak by his degenerative condition and like Professor Hawking, he relies on a computer system to communicate. His works by moving a cursor with his eyes and blinking to type but doctors have told him his eyes could also give in to the disease, which causes paralysis, and Mr Isaac has made it clear that it is at this point he would not wish to continue living. For four years Mr Isaac allowed his filmmaker son Fraser, 24, to record his decline in order to raise awareness about the illness and the truth about the devastating impact it has had on his family. Mr Isaac, pictured with wife Debbie and son Fraser, has already been rendered unable to speak by his degenerative condition . Mr Isaac allowed his filmmaker son Fraser, 24, to record his decline in order to raise awareness about the illness and the truth about the devastating impact it has had on his family (pictured) Appearing in Channel 5’s Filming My Father: In Life and Death , Mr Isaac, tells the camera: ‘If I am no longer able to communicate, so as to express my opinion, and this is verified on two occasions, 48-hours apart, by two doctors, then I would wish for my ventilation to be stopped and to manage my peaceful death.’ His wife of 30 years, Debbie, 55, said the achievements of Professor Hawking, make it harder for others with the disease who are expected to cope just as well with the condition and flourish. After the film The Theory of Everything thrust the academic’s long life and success into the spotlight and won Redmayne, 33, an Academy Award for his portrayal of Hawking, Miss Isaac said people do not realise he is an ‘exceptional’ case. Mr Isaac is the latest in a long line of terminally ill patients who have demanded for the right to end their lives, most notably Debbie Purdy, who died in December last year at the age of 51 after a year of refusing food. Debbie, 55, said the achievements of Professor Hawking (pictured), make it harder for others with the disease who are expected to cope just as well with the condition and flourish . She lived with multiple sclerosis for almost two decades and was a vocal campaigner for the ‘right to die’. Under current laws in England, it is an offence to encourage or assist anyone to commit suicide. However, campaigners last night raised concerns that the programme could ‘normalise’ suicide for the disabled and said the focus should be on improving quality of life. A spokesman for Care Not Killing said: ‘We have deep concerns about this programme. It’s vital that we do not normalise, in any way, suicide as an option for those who are disabled. 'There are many people who are suffering from a whole raft of debilitating conditions who would be horrified at the suggestion that they should end their life. 'What we need to be doing is focussing on how we ensure he has the very best quality of life and doesn’t feel like he is becoming a financial or care burden on his family or on society as a whole.’ While Mrs Isaac does not want to lose her husband and the father of her three children – Carly, 27, and twins Fraser and Hannah – she supports his wish to choose when and how he dies. She told the Mail: ‘Steve should have what he wants. Either way I don’t like the idea of losing him but I believe strongly that it’s his life and he should have what he wants. You have all of these thoughts and emotions but at the end of the day it is down to him. ‘I can’t imagine what it will be like when we get to that but that’s what I believe. It’s his life and he should be able to choose. Mr Isaac is the latest in a long line of terminally ill patients who have demanded for the right to end their lives . The documentary follows Mr Isaac’s struggles from diagnosis in February 2010 to his decision to have a tracheotomy in August 2014, hoping it would allow him to live a further three years . The family say the aim of the documentary, broadcast next Wednesday, is to increase awareness of the disease . ‘The whole thing is quite surreal, having end of life conversations, but he’s open enough to talk about it and while he wants to live if he can’t communicate that’s the time he wants to end it. 'You don’t get any practice at this, you’re just in it. There’s no way out and no happy ending. We know we’re going to lose him but as to how, if he can’t communicate that’s the time.’ But it is not a decision that sits easily with the whole family and Fraser reveals his concerns to the camera. He said: ‘He says he wants to be switched off after he can’t communicate but I can’t actually imagine doing the tests and being like “can you respond?” How do you judge what communication is? ‘For him to be completely himself and alive and for us to say okay, bye dad, you can’t communicate, and just turning off the machines. That to me is the worst way to go.’ The family say the aim of the documentary is to increase awareness of the disease. Mrs Isaac claims the public view it largely through the lens of its most famous sufferer, Professor Hawking. However, as he was very young when he was diagnosed, it progresses much more slowly than usual. Even allowing for this, Professor Hawking’s longevity is remarkable. While Mrs Isaac does not want to lose her husband and the father of her three children – Carly, 27, and twins Fraser and Hannah – she supports his wish to choose when and how he dies . The impact the disease has had on Mr Isaac's family is laid bare in the documentary, to be broadcast on Wednesday . Mrs Isaac said: ‘People don’t understand at all. People might see a tiny touch of it but they are not there to witness it, it’s ghastly. It’s a disease people just don’t know about. They might know the name, they might know it through Stephen Hawking. 'I’m not medical but even I know he’s the exception to the rule. People look at him and probably think people with motor neurone disease will live a very long time. His is an extremely exceptional case.’ The impact the disease has had on his family is laid bare in the documentary, to be broadcast on Wednesday. It follows Mr Isaac’s struggles from diagnosis in February 2010 to his decision to have a tracheotomy in August 2014, hoping it would allow him to live a further three years. In the intimate footage, which lifts the lid on what it is really like to live with a motor neurone disease sufferer, Mrs Isaac talks candidly about the strain it has put on their family and relationship. She said: ‘It’s incredibly hard. I don’t want to be a widow and I don’t want to lose him but how much more can you cope with? ‘I’m really shocked. I thought, when he became ill we’d almost become closer and closer but almost it’s the opposite and I can’t believe that’s happened. I’m shocked that it draws people apart rather than together.’ Speaking about the tracheostomy she added: ‘I was thinking the other day, if it was my decision, not that it ever would be. 'It would be so hard to say no knowing that he wants it but really and truly, I think myself and the kids are just exhausted with the whole thing and he’s going to die, really, really sadly he’s going to die. 'Be it tonight or tomorrow or in a month or two months or a year. It’s just dragging out the inevitable. So if I had to say, I would say don’t do it.’ Filming My Father: In Life and Death (Verve Productions/Channel 5) will be broadcast on March 11 at 7pm on Channel 5.","Steve Isaac was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in February 2010 .

"With a murder conviction hanging over her head, it would have been easy for her to hide away. But instead, Amanda Knox has tried to lead a normal life in the US over the past three-and-a-half years. She has graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle with a degree in creative writing, penned theater reviews for a weekly paper and become engaged to musician Colin Sutherland. And now, she has been sensationally cleared, alongside her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, of the murder of her former roommate, Meredith Kercher, who was found dead in Italy seven years ago. Surrounded by her father, Curt Knox, mother, Edda Mellas and Mr Sutherland, Knox, 27, broke down in tears as she addressed the press following Italy's Supreme Court's ruling on Friday night. Scroll down for video . Free: Amanda Knox (seen addressing the media alongside her fiance, Colin Sutherland, left, on Friday after she was sensationally cleared of murder) has tried to lead a normal life over the past three-and-a-half years . Engaged: She has graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in creative writing and become engaged to Sutherland, a musician. Above, Knox with Sutherland outside her mother's house on Thursday . Placing her hands over her chest, she said: 'Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life. I am the lucky one.' The former inmate added that she is 'so grateful to have my life back'. In December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the brutal murder and sexual assault of Kercher, a British student. They were sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison respectively. However, after they had already served four years in prison, an appeals court in Perugia - where the student was discovered dead - threw out the couple's conviction and declared them innocent. Knox returned to the US, before another U-turn in the case saw a court in Florence reinstate her original 2009 conviction and increase her sentence to 28-and-a-half years in January 2014.

But on Friday, Italy's highest court overturned that murder conviction with its final ruling in the seven-year-long case, definitively ending the grueling legal battle waged by Knox and her co-defendant. Mostly left alone by the media in Seattle since her return from Italy, Knox, who says she will never willingly return to the country, completed her studies at the University of Washington last year. The former exchange student has also spent time with her family and friends over the past three-and-a-half years - and recently started working as a freelance reporter for the West Seattle Herald.

Another court reinstated the convictions in 2014 . 'She's very good. She's knowledgeable about her subjects she writes well and she gets stuff on deadline,' Robinson said. 'She's a local person. We knew that she was interested in writing.' Knox's articles have included a review of a production of the David Henry Hwang play 'Chinglish' and a story about a kidney disease survivor to mark National Kidney Month. She has also written a memoir about her life and her experiences in Italy, which was published in 2013. She was paid a reported $4million for the work.

"A plague of mutant ginger rats first spotted in Scotland are feared to have made their way south of the border, it was revealed last night. A shocking video taken by two revellers in Newcastle-upon-Tyne shows 60 large rodents scurrying down the street in a popular area of the city on Saturday. Now, there are claims the rats could be the same giant ginger species recently spotted 60 miles away in Hawick in the Scottish borders - which were feared to be moving south. Scroll down for video . Rats: A shocking video taken by two revellers in Newcastle-upon-Tyne shows 60 large rodents scurrying down the street in a popular area of the city on Saturday . Marc Donaghey, 22, and his girlfriend Brooke Salkeld, 21, captured the footage of around 20 rats - but said in total there were at least 50 or 60 of them running around the street. Mr Donaghey said: ‘We walked around the corner and we saw dozens of rats. You only see a few on the video but when we first went around the corner there were about 50 or 60. ‘They were all over the bins and then running down the road. There were a few other people walking past so I’d shout “watch!” and then they saw them. They were disgusted.’ The video shows rats scuttling over the cobbles of a back lane and onto a nearby stretch of grass, squeaking loudly. The rodents are feared to be the same as the beasts spotted in Hawick last week. Shocking video: There are claims the rats in Newcastle could be the same giant ginger species recently spotted 60 miles away in Hawick in the Scottish borders - which were feared to be moving south . Running: The video shows rats scuttling over the cobbles of a back lane and onto a nearby stretch of grass . Numerous sightings were being reported to the council on a daily basis - and the rodents are believed to have ginger fur because freed domestic rats have been breeding with wild Scottish rats. Newcastle City Council’s environment manager Edwin Foster said: ‘Littering and poor refuse storage attract vermin. Traders have a legal responsibility to make sure they store and dispose of their refuse correctly.’ ‘Pest control officers have been treating this area and will continue to do so, but people must understand the rats are there because people are leaving rubbish for the rats to feed on. ‘ . In Hawick, one businessman said he had seen ‘dozens’ of rats at a time on an industrial estate, while a pest controller in Scotland confirmed that he had been killing rodents on the site for months. But he added that it was becoming increasingly difficult to exterminate the creatures due to fear of killing other animals. A Scottish Borders Council spokesman said it was monitoring the rats there. Last year, a 2ft-long rat was captured in Cornwall . A new breed of genetically-mutated ‘super rats’ is spreading at alarming speeds, experts say. The rodents, which have been seen elsewhere in Britain over the past year, are twice as large as normal species and cannot be killed with traditional substances. Earlier this year a swarm of mutant 20-inch rats that are immune to poison were found in Swindon, Wiltshire. Scientists have been charting the super rat invasion into new communities by monitoring their progress in 17 counties in the UK. Genetic testing by Huddersfield University has revealed that the rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poisons. Research earlier this year found that the swarm of ‘super rats’ spotted across the country is expected to outnumber humans two-to-one by next year. Last year, a 2ft-long rat was captured in Cornwall, with other huge rodents seen in Kent and Liverpool. Birmingham reported the most rat-related call-outs, with 5,100 in the past year.

"Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams is facing calls to apologise to the family of a man who was shot three times in an IRA punishment attack . Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams is facing calls to apologise to the family of a man who bled to death after being shot three times in an IRA punishment attack. Andrew Kearney, 33, was abducted from his West Belfast flat and shot by masked raiders in July 1998 weeks after allegedly punching a senior IRA member during a bar brawl. His sister Eleanor King said Mr Adams privately apologised for the killing of the father-of-one but has refused to do so publicly. Speaking as part of an RTÉ documentary about paramilitary 'punishment attacks', she said: 'He should have come forward and told the IRA what to do. 'As in to come forward and admit it publicly. And, yes, give a public apology. 'And in my opinion, if he had done that, even if he didn't call for anybody to be arrested or anything, but just even the public apology and the public acceptance, it would have caused the family a lot less heartache over the years.' King said her family had been republicans their whole lives and that her mother Maureen welcomed Gerry Adams 'with open arms' after her son had been killed. 'The first thing he told us was that he was extending an apology from the top of the republican movement,' she said. Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey told the programme that Adams acknowledges meeting the family but is unaware of what was said. The documentary also features Thomas Marley, whose son Gerard took his own life in 1997 after he was the victim of two punishment attacks. Mr Marley said: '(The IRA) kept on doing it, killing people with their shotguns blowing legs off, using bars. They thought it was fun, it was the right thing. But it wasn't.' Punishment attacks by paramilitaries were common during The Troubles and were often supported by local communities. They increased after the 1994 ceasefires. They began in majority republican communities but loyalist paramilitaries soon began carrying out their own punishment attacks. In 1998, Andrew Peden was packing up his car for a trip to the seaside with his young family when he was abducted by the Ulster Volunteer Force. Andrew Kearney, 33, (right) was shot three times  in an IRA punishment attack and his sister Eleanor King (left) is now calling for an apology from Mr Adams . They beat him for 12 hours before shooting him in both legs with a shotgun. He spent several months in hospital. Both of his legs were amputated above the knee. The attack happened just three weeks after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and its promise of a bright future for the people of Northern Ireland. During the Troubles, most of the attacks took place in North and West Belfast. What began in republican areas was copied by loyalists who went on to carry out more punishment beatings and shootings than republicans. Former UVF prisoner Tom Winstone, director of a restorative justice programme on Belfast's Shankill Road, told the documentary: 'It might just surprise you how much mistrust there was in loyalist communities towards the police. 'When you are talking about punishment violence, I think everyone understands and knows that it's wrong but unfortunately a lot of people didn't bat an eyelid about that.' Above The Law, a Below The Radar TV production in association with the RTE Investigation Unit, will be broadcast tomorrow on RTE ONE at 9.35pm. Mr Kearney's mother Maureen (left) met with politicians and journalists to plead with all sides involved in last-ditch negotiations in Northern Ireland to do all they could to save the peace process .","Andrew Kearney, 33, was shot and bled to death in IRA punishment attack .

"The police force that guards the desert state of Utah will soon ask for volunteers from among its members for a particularly macabre duty. Five-man firing squads are to be formed and trained in preparation for a move that critics say risks dragging America back to a 'more barbaric past'. Facing a crisis in the lethal injection system by which most Death Row inmates are normally executed, Utah's leaders have just approved a solution that harks back to the violent spirit of its Wild West past. Pictured is the Utah firing squad execution chamber, where death row inmates are strapped into the seat in front of a wooden board to stop bullets, and beside sandbags that absorb blood splatters . The state has become the first to bring back the firing squad. Gary Herbert, Utah's Republican governor, conceded that he found the concept 'a little bit gruesome', but stressed that it would be used only if injection drugs are not available 30 days before a scheduled execution. Yet such a scenario looks increasingly likely. Thirty-two states still have the death penalty, and America's Death Rows are clogged with more than 3,000 condemned prisoners because of a string of botched lethal injections. These have allowed lawyers to halt the scheduling of supposedly painless executions on the grounds that they breach a constitutional ban on 'cruel and unusual' punishment. To make matters worse, supplies of the sedatives used are drying up. Many of the most effective drugs are made only in Europe, but the EU has told manufacturers they cannot sell them if they are to be used for lethal injections. U.S. drug manufacturers have already stopped making them, worried about being associated with executions as a growing proportion of Americans come out against the death penalty. The result? In 2014, 35 people were executed in the U.S. — the fewest since 1994. Last July, appalled witnesses described how convicted Arizona double murderer Joseph Wood lay gulping and gasping like a landed fish for two hours as a cocktail of drugs failed to do their job of sedating him and then stopping his heart. Now, with Utah's dramatic announcement, opponents of capital punishment are questioning whether even Wood's fate is less barbaric than a squad of shooters blasting away at someone tied to a chair. Witnesses described how double murderer Joseph Wood (pictured) lay gulping and gasping for two hours when a cocktail of drugs failed to sedate him . Although a firing squad may sound like a long-gone relic of frontier justice, the largely Mormon state of Utah did use one five years ago. In 2010, Ronnie Lee Gardner, a convicted murderer who had killed a lawyer during a court escape attempt, threatened to sue Utah if it didn't allow him to be shot. The state had stopped offering Death Row inmates the option of a firing squad in 2004 — but because Gardner had been convicted before the law was changed, he was still able to choose it. Gardner, who had been on Death Row for 19 years, said: 'I guess it's my Mormon heritage. It's so much easier . . . and there's no mistakes.' Even though history has shown the killer's statement is not true, Utah's executioners will attempt to carry out the gruesome ritual with clinical precision. Attached to the state prison at Draper, the small execution room — built in an old canning factory — is flooded with fluorescent light from the ceiling and has no decorations on its white cinderblock walls. There are two slits for the marksmen cut into a wall, through which they aim their rifles. Observation windows — protected by bulletproof glass — line the side walls of the square chamber. Screwed to a raised platform 25ft from the shooters' wall, a chair is flanked by sandbags to absorb blood and prevent ricochets. Behind the chair is thick wooden panelling to stop the bullets. The entire structure is painted black. The inmate is bound to the chair with leather straps around the wrists, ankles, shoulders, waist and forehead — his immobility is crucial if the shooters are to hit his heart. Locating the heart with a stethoscope, a doctor fastens a piece of white cloth two inches square, with a circle in the middle, over the left breast of the prisoner's jumpsuit. Unseen by the condemned, or the victim's relatives and media representatives witnessing the execution on either flank, the squad of marksmen file in to take up position behind the wall facing their target. Ronnie Lee Gardner appears before a judge where the date for his execution by firing squad was set for June 2010. Gardner was a convicted murderer and said death by firing squad was 'so much easier... and there's no mistakes' The officers are chosen from a pool of volunteers, with priority going to those from the local force where the inmate's crimes were committed. There are always more volunteers than places on the squad. Each officer is given an identical .30 calibre Winchester rifle, loaded with a single round. Following a Utah tradition which means no marksman knows whether he has fired a lethal shot, one of the rifles contains a blank round made of wax. More ammunition is on hand if a second volley is needed. When the moment comes, the prison warden will pick up a microphone in the execution chamber and typically give the prisoner two minutes to say his last words. The governor then pulls a black hood over the inmate's head and leaves the room. Unable to hear the countdown in the marksmen's enclosure, witnesses at Gardner's execution said they waited in awful suspense for 30 seconds until a deafening burst of almost simultaneous gunfire rang out. The target over his chest had three, possibly four, holes. A watching reporter said he saw Gardner then move his left arm, briefly clenching and unclenching his fist. He also saw, under the bottom of his hood, what looked like his jaw moving. As two minutes passed, he wondered if Gardner might need to be shot again. Murderer Gary Gilmore's (pictured) last words were 'let's do it', moments before he was killed by firing squad. The phrase later became the inspiration for Nike's 'just do it' slogan . Instead, a prison official wearing blue plastic gloves stepped into the chamber, lifting the hood just enough to check the pulse on his neck. He then raised the hood further, shining a torch into his eyes to confirm he was dead. In this situation, death is technically caused by blood loss from the rupture of the heart or tearing of the lungs. The prisoner is meant to lose consciousness when shock causes a fall in the supply of blood to the brain. If the shots are accurate, he is dead in seconds. However, if the marksmen miss the heart — intentionally or by accident — the inmate will bleed to death slowly. This occurred in Utah in 1879 when a firing squad missed murderer Wallace Wilkerson's heart. A white paper target had been placed over it, but Wilkerson — who had not been tied down — stiffened at the final moment. His movement dislodged the target just as the marksmen fired, and Wilkerson leapt up screaming: 'Oh my God! They've missed it!' It reportedly took him 27 minutes to die. Anti-death penalty campaigners claimed the shooters missed his heart on purpose to prolong his agony. Utah's death penalty supporters insist that a well-trained firing squad would be faster and more humane than the protracted deaths caused by botched lethal injections. Opponents counter that a firing squad is 'brutalising' and barbaric. In the past, politicians have also complained that condemned men have chosen a firing squad as a last burst of attention-seeking. In Utah, condemned men have opted for it over lethal injection because it seems more manly. In 1977, Gary Gilmore, one of the most notorious Death Row inmates of modern times, became the first person executed in the U.S. after a ten-year moratorium was lifted by the Supreme Court. The double murderer demanded to be executed by firing squad. Asked if he had any last words, he simply replied: 'Let's do it.' (This week, the advertising executive who came up with the sports brand Nike's 'Just do it' slogan revealed he had been inspired by Gilmore.) Utah, in fact, has dispatched all three of the prisoners killed by firing squad in the U.S. since the death penalty was restored in 1976. The third was murderer John Albert Taylor, who refused to be sedated before he was shot in 1996 (though he did ask for a cigarette). Utah — a state founded in bloodshed between Mormon settlers, native tribes and federal troops — may have a sentimental attachment to the law of the gun. But other states are proving no less ruthless in their determination to find an alternative to lethal injections. Death by lethal injection remains the most common method of state-sanctioned execution. Pictured is the gurney at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary where death row inmates are injected . Politicians in Alabama and Tennessee have voted to bring back the electric chair, while Wyoming's state assembly passed a Bill to reintroduce firing squads. In Oklahoma, where prisoner Clayton Lockett writhed and groaned for 43 minutes in a lethal injection disaster last year, they have voted to execute people by gassing them with nitrogen. But only in Tennessee and Utah have these macabre initiatives made it onto the law books. Even Texas, which in some years executes more people than the rest of America put together, recently announced it is down to its last dose of lethal injection. Will a well-aimed shot to the heart kill a man as surely and humanely as a lethal injection in the arm? The next man to find out may be former cult member Ron Lafferty, Utah's longest-serving Death Row inmate, who claimed God told him to kill his sister-in-law and her baby daughter in 1984 because she opposed his belief in polygamy. Lafferty has requested a firing squad — no doubt when the time comes, his execution will spark a fierce bout of soul-searching in a nation that longs to be regarded as modern and compassionate, but on this issue is dragged back to its blood-soaked pioneer past.","The U.S. faces a crisis in sourcing the drugs needed for lethal injections .

"The Australian businessman who allegedly masterminded an international paedophile ring has labelled himself 'bigger than Ben-Hur', maintaining that he isn't worried about what people think of him. Peter Gerard Scully, 51, was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, and killing another young girl, but says he isn't concerned about being sentenced to life in prison. 'I get bigger than Ben-Hur and people get interested. There is nothing I can do about it, so why worry about it?' Scully said. Scroll down for video . Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. 'If I get sentenced, I get sentenced. That is something out of my control,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald. Scully has been accused of sexually abusing two girls, aged 10, and 11, and forcing them to dig their own graves while they were held captive in his house. While the former businessman admitted they stayed in his house, he would not confirm the abuse. 'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened. That is something to talk about in the court which is the proper forum. There's nothing I can do to change what they [the girls] said,' Scully said. Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show one of Scully's victims, a 13-year-old girl, being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, leading to renewed calls to reintroduce the death penalty. The videos, including one called 'The Destruction of Daisy' shows whipping and torture along with other horrific acts, and was described by police as the most shocking child pornography that has ever been discovered in the Philippines. 'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. As a result of the horrific nature of his alleged crimes, the 51-year-old said he had been threatened by prisoners in the jail in southern city of Cagayan de Oro. Scully said that he was trying to avoid confrontation in order to not be harmed by any of the 300 prisoners in the jail, but that they were actively trying to scare him. Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme . Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. The former businessman claimed his internet marketing business was the reason for his move from Melbourne to the Philippines in 2011 as a result of lower wage costs. Scully is a father of two children, now both adults, and claims to have been married to the same Chinese woman three times before divorcing. He was arrested on February 20 after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon, and he was formally charged on Friday. It is claimed he abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers for his 'pay for view' online child pornography business. Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested . He returned to Australia  accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling in 2011, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said. An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.

"Arrested:  Ayou has been accused of double murder . A woman in China has been accused of killing her husband and mother-in-law, before trying to sell her babies for £7,000 each. Mail-order bride Ayou, 21, was bought for little more than £3,000 from Vietnam by 32-year-old Lai Binghao and his father, Lai Shehui. She was arranged to be married to Lai Binghao and less than a year after the nuptials, Ayou gave birth to twins, according to People’s Daily Online. Her mother-in-law moved into the couple's home in Chaozhou in South China's Guangdong province, to help look after the two baby boys. But when Lai Shehui went to visit the family on March 2, he found his wife and son tied up and strangled in bed. Ayou, given her name because her husband's family could not read her photocopied identity documents, and her babies were missing. Twins: The baby boys were born less than a year after Vietnemese Ayou and Chinese Lai Binghao were married . Grieving: When Lai Shehui (pictured) went to visit the family on March 2, he found his wife and son tied up and strangled in bed . Buying wives from abroad has become increasingly common in some of China's poor rural areas, where a gender imbalance has developed due to a traditional preference for sons and the country's family planning policies. Across China, 118 males are born for every 100 females, according to government statistics. In some rural areas, men can be expected to own a house, car and have considerable wealth before they can attract a Chinese bride. But with many unable to do so, the trade in overseas brides, which is often linked to human trafficking, has grown in China. In less than 24 hours, Chaozhou Public Security Bureau arrested Ayou on suspicion of murder. On March 4, police took her to the scene of the crime and the twins were found in a nearby town where they were being sold for £7,000 each. Grieving Lai Shehui said: 'The children are not even 3 months old. 'Their father and grandma are dead and their mother is in prison. How can I bring them up on my own?' Police believe Ayou and three Vietnamese men strangled her husband and mother-in-law. Others involved in the trafficking of the babies have also been arrested. The marriage between Ayou and Lai Binghao was set up by a Vietnamese marriage arranger.

"It was supposed to be a special moment when Laura Strange cradled her newborn daughter in her arms for the first time. But instead of enjoying the happy arrival, the 25-year-old was preparing to say goodbye to the tiny infant. At little over two hours old Haley, swaddled in a hospital blanket, was taken away from her mother and it could be two years before the pair are reunited. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: New mother Laura Strange, 25, is forced to say goodbye to her daughter Haley just hours after she gave birth to the infant . Strange will have to serve the remainder of her two year prison sentence before she can take back custody of her daughter . Little Haley is one of 340 babies born each year to mother's serving sentences at Valley State Prison, in Chowchilla, California. With on average 120 inmates pregnant each month only a handful of women are lucky enough to avoid separation from their infants. Strange said: 'I accept the consequence of my crime; I accept the fact that I broke the law. But what does that have to do with my child? Inmate Laura Strange was shackled to the hospital bed after giving birth to her second child . 'Giving her up was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. 'I hurt every second of the day for her.' Photographer Mark Allen Johnson was allowed access to the prison and its pregnant inmates to capture the struggle of giving birth behind bars. Being pregnant does not secure expectant mother's special treatment at Valley State, the world's largest prison for women. With nearly four thousand inmates, they are forced to continue to rub shoulders with murders and violent offenders at the 640 acre site. 'Being pregnant does not give you better treatment,' one expectant mother complained. Another alleged received threats of violence from her fellow detainees while she was with-child. Blonde-haired Strange was taken from her prison cell at the onset of labour to Madera Community Hospital where she gave birth by cesarean section. Just two hours after the delivery, a booming voice breaks the silence of the ward, 'Strange, fifteen more minutes.' Eager to enjoy their last few moments together, the new mother quickly feeds the infant from a bottle of baby formula whispering: 'Momma doesn't want to send you away on an empty stomach.' Gazing down at the shackles around her ankle that confine her to the hospital bed, Strange shakes her right foot. 'My damn leg fell asleep again,' she moans. 'Five more minutes,' the voice shouts, interrupting her final moments with Haley. Trembling, Strange quietly pleads, 'Why me?' As the newborn finishes her bottle a nurse arrives and prises the infant from her mother's grasp before walking out of the door with the child. Just an hour later Strange is on her way back to Valley State Prison, where she will spend two years behind bars for drugs charges. While she serves the remainder of her sentence her mother, Anita, who is already looking after her son Gerard, will take care of Haley.

Jasmine Jones, 19, who is nine months pregnant with her first child, waits for a doctors appointment in a holding cell . Pregnant Jasmine Jones, 19, is serving two years for robbery and possession of a deadly weapon . According to the California Department of Correction and Rehabilitation (CDCR), the state has one of the largest prison systems in the world. In the past two decades, the system has grown 554 per cent, raising the number of inmates from 24,569 to 160,655. The Atlantic Monthly asserts that the CDCR 'holds more inmates in its jails and prisons than do France, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Singapore, and the Netherlands combined.' At any given time, approximately 120 are pregnant at Valley State Prison on average each month. But with over 340 babies born annually to female inmates, only a handful of these children are able to avoid separation from their mothers. The State of California operates three mother-infant prisoner programs that allow those who qualify to live in a low-level prison setting with their newborn if the duration of their sentence is less than six years. With as few as 75 beds in the program, many prisoners  are forced to give up their babies for adoption or foster care, or, in some cases, they give parental custody to friends or relatives. Melissa Bates is one of the lucky ones. She and her daughter are serving her  sentence of two years and seven months together at Oakland Community Prisoner Mother Program (CPMP). The low-level prison houses up to 24 women inmates who gave birth behind bars and aims to keep mother and child together. For those not so lucky and who do not have family who can step in, a host family is provided. They are put on standby ahead of the birth and wait for a call from prison officials telling them when they are needed. They can then care for the newborn for as little as a couple of weeks to as long as a couple of years, depending how much of the sentence is left to run. Mother-of-three Margaret Bell gave birth behind bars and gave her infant son to a host family from the Babies Out of Bondages Program, a Christian organization run by The Church Of Glad Tidings. The pair were reunited after the 36-year-old was given parole from State Valley and given a room in a church-run house for prison mothers. Melissaa Bates is one of the lucky ones. She and her daughter are serving a two year and seven month sentence together at a community based facility as part of Community Prisoner Mother Program. The Oakwood Community Prisoner Mother Program has just 24 beds for mothers who give birth behind bars . There are only 75 prison beds in the Community Prisoner Mother Program in California .

Margret Bell, 36,  is reunited with her son Devin.  The Mother-of-three is currently on parole from prison and living at 'The House Of Ruth,' a transitional housing unit for prison mothers and women at risk, run by the Church Of Glad Tidings. Margaret Bell and Son Devin have been reunited after she was released from prison . Amber Marich, 25, who is seven months pregnant  and serving a two-year sentence for distributing drugs, is not the first person in her family to end up behind bars. She also has a uncle serving life, a father who has served multiple prison sentences. Inmates who are pregnant are given little or no rehabilitation for their drug use and criminal lifestyle and it is hard for them once released to escape their past. Prison officials say that children born to criminal parents are also more likely to commit crimes themselves, creating a perpetual cycle that contributes to the growing prison population.","Laura Strange, 25, is incarcerated at Valley State Prison, California .

"Sickening footage has emerged of a teenage girl being viciously beaten by another girl – as fellow students did nothing to help. Video taken on a cell phone at Massabesic High School in Waterboro, Maine, shows the attacker pinning the 16-year-old to the ground and repeatedly punching her in the face. The assault took place while students were changing class - but the footage does not show anybody stepping in to stop the brutal onslaught. Sickening: A 16-year-old girl was viciously beaten by another girl at Massabesic High School in Maine in an attack that was caught on camera . The mother of the terrified victim has described the incident as ‘sickening’ and believes the attack may have been planned. Refusing to reveal her name through fear of drawing more attention to her daughter, she told CBS 13 that the footage was ‘disturbing’ and ‘hard to watch’. She added: ‘My daughter’s only 98 pounds. She’s a tiny little thing. ‘It’s terrifying to see your daughter go through something like that. It’s … it’s sickening.’ Her daughter needed medical treatment after suffering ‘five large bruises’ to her head and injuries to her arms where she was desperately trying to defend herself.

Vicious: Footage shows the attacker pinning the 16-year-old to the ground and repeatedly punching her in the face . She suggested that those behind the attack ‘wanted it recorded’ so they could put the footage on social media meaning students from other schools could see the incident. Bangor Daily News reported that she had been told by school Principal Christian Elkington that the attack was ‘a terrible thing’ and that the school was ‘dealing with it appropriately’. She is said to have received a letter from Superintendent John Davis who apologised and pledged to address the incident quickly. But the victim’s mother says she does not know whether anybody has been expelled. The website reports that the victim has a restraining order against her attacker and that the youngster still fears repercussions.","Video of attack taken on cell phone at Massabesic High School in Maine .

"A modern romantic found the perfect way to propose to his girlfriend with a drone atop a snowy mountain in Wyoming. Capturing the whole occasion on camera, the drone’s operator is featured at the start of the video setting up the device and giving an approving thumbs up. As the drone flies off into the air, the video rewinds to the couple’s incoming flight from Minneapolis’ Saint Paul International Airport. Time lapse footage captures the mountains through the clouds from the aeroplane’s window before the flight lands in Jackson Hole Airport. Upon disembarking the plane, the man, Rich Costello, secretly films his soon-to-be fiancee before another time lapse shot appears to capture the couple's apartment. After a few more artistic shots of ski lifts and snowboarders relaxing on a mountain, the footage returns to the moving drone. The drone's operator sets up the device and gives the camera the thumbs up as it takes off from the ground . Rich Costello tells his girlfriend he needs more pictures of her and instructs her to perform a yoga pose at the top of the mountain . Focussing on the couple, who stand on a raised part of the mountain, the drone hovers as the man gets down on one knee and presents a ring. The camera then switches to that of the man’s POV and the woman can be seen gasping and laughing in surprise of the gesture before confirming her answer with a hug. According to Mr Costello, his fiancee shares his passion for snowboarding and the couple plan a trip to the snowy location every year. Interrupting her yoga stance, Mr Costello greets his girlfriend and begins talking to her on the mountain . The drone captures the moment the man surprises his girlfriend by getting down on one knee and proposing . He said: ‘I had known for a while that I wanted to propose to her at the top of a mountain, and I wanted to make sure that we got a good photo of it.’ Mr Costello considered having someone take a picture of the proposal from a helicopter, but found that this was outside of his budget. Thinking on his feet, the photography enthusiast purchased a drone – a device he began using prior to the trip so as to keep his girlfriend’s suspicions down to a minimum. Mr Costello's POV camera captures the moment he proposes and the look of surprise on his girlfriend's face . Explaining that there are always too many pictures of himself and not enough of his partner, Mr Costello instructed his girlfriend to perform a yoga pose at the top of the mountain. ‘It was the perfect plan. Right as the drone flew over us and she prepared to get into position, I dropped to one knee and proposed,’ he said. The video concludes with the drone circulating the happy couple, picking up the breathtaking landscape of the surrounding Wyoming mountain range, before crashing to the floor. It's a yes!

"The small town of East Horsley in Surrey can today be revealed as Britain's most sought-after rural retreat where the average house sells for more than £1million. Wealthy home-buyers are flocking to the small town located between Guildford and Leatherhead, with 42 homes in the past two years selling for more than £1million, according to new research. The figure represents at 17per cent increase over the past year and cements East Horsley's position as Britain's most popular 'millionaire village'. Scroll down for video . This massive detached home in East Horsley, set on a half acre plot of land, is available for £1,295,000. Among its features are a conservatory, playroom, rear porch and hallway access to the garage with underfloor heating . The ground floor features a sitting room, dining room, playroom and reception room, according to the property listing on Zoopla.co.uk . This property, available for £1,295,000, is described as a 'neo-Georgian' style detached family home on one of Horsley's premier private roads . The 0.4 acre plot also features this stunning feature garden, which is accessed from the main reception room . Exclusive: In total, 42 homes sold for more than £1million in East Horsley (pictured), Surrey during the past two years . Located 28miles from London Waterloo and with its own train station taking commuters directly into the capital within 50minutes, it has become an exceptionally popular destination for commuters forced out of the London property. The average home in East Horsley, which has a private sports club, decent schools and nearby riding schools and golf courses, now sells for £1,006,304, property experts Savills said. Property listings show numerous homes listed for sale for more than £1million, many featuring sprawling lawns, open plan kitchens and huge double garages. Sophie Chick, associate director at Savills, said that the cost of housing in cities and towns means that villages now offer comparatively good value for money. ‘We’ve actually found that since the credit crunch, villages on the whole have underperformed their neighbouring towns and cities,’ she said. ‘This is because there has been a marked preference for living within an urban environment, closer to a work place, resulting in affluent UK cities and towns outperforming their neighbouring villages and rural locations in the housing market. ‘This means villages now represent good value and there is a currently good buying opportunity.’ This East Horsley property, listed online for £1,395,000 by Savills, features a massive back yard which backs onto woodland . Inside, it boasts of oak doors and staircases and claims to be an original Frank Chown build, created in 1923 . Sellers hope this five-bedroom detached house for sale in East Horsley will land them £1,499,950 . According to its listing, inside the home features '4,000sq ft of contemporary living' with underfloor heating throughout . The spacious kitchen is fitted with a range of units and features granite work surfaces with an attached utility room . Other locations topping Savills’ rich villages list include Bowdon, part of the ‘footballer-belt’ of affluent properties circling Greater Manchester, where 27 property deals topped £1 million. Nearby Alderley Edge also features. The village – 12 miles from Manchester – is where David and Victoria Beckham first settled down. Other Manchester United stars including Rio Ferdinand, Michael Carrick and Cristiano Ronaldo have also called it home. The 100 most affluent villages in Britain are scattered across the regions – from Brockenhurst, nestled in the heart of Hampshire’s New Forest, to the Cornish holiday hotspot of St Mawes. Homes in the West Midlands, Somerset and Cheshire also feature in the rankings. But millionaire city dwellers in search of comfortable country living have ensured that villages within the London commuter belt – especially those with a handy railway station – dominate the list. This includes Chorleywood in Hertfordshire, officially Britain’s second most exclusive village, where 34 homes have been sold for more than £1 million since 2013. 1. East Horsley, Surrey (42) 2.

"Saudi Arabia and its neighboring Middle Eastern countries are notorious for censoring 'sexual' album covers by female artists in order to make the artwork more appropriate for a conservative audience. Record companies hoping to sell their artists's albums are ever-more sensitive to the beliefs and cultural traditions of each market they're selling to, and will often tailor album covers in order to avoid offence. In some extreme cases there have been reports of the Saudi government paying religious police members of the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV) to manually alter from covers. Scroll down for video . Who wore it best? Madonna's 2008 album was censored with many agreeing the second verison was actually better . Cover up: Countries including Lebanon increased the dimension of the ball in front of her in order to cover her breasts. They’ve also colored her legs black in order to give the impression that she’s covered up . Going ga-ga: Lady Gaga's behind was fully clothed when the album was released in the Middle East . The altered covers are found on music download sites such as iTunes as well as in regular stores. It has been reported in the past that police officers have unwrapped CD cases, removed the front and back inserts and carefully and painstakingly colored in with marker pen any photos baring exposed female flesh that is deemed objectionable. Some Islamic scholars specify which areas of the body must be covered; while others require all but the eyes to be covered, using garments. Most mainstream scholars say that men, in contrast, should only cover themselves from the navel to the knees . The CPVP is a government agency that employs religious police, called Muttawa, to make sure that citizens adhere strictly to the teachings of Islam, especially those pertaining to dress, socialization, morality and prayer. The commission comprises approximately 10,000 Muttawa and has nearly 500 centers within the country. However, while police officers operating within the Middle East are willing to go to extreme lengths in order to make sure any album artwork is appropriate, it is actually far easier for record companies to simply produce separate versions of well-known covers. On cloud nine: Katy Perry is seen floating on a cloud on her main album cover, but is completely swaddled in the picture for her Middle Eastern Teenage Dream front cover (right) Dreamy: Looking lush on a sunbed, this is the original Katy Perry album cover . Nightmare! Katy Perry's album One of the Boys was heavily doctored by Saudi censors . Many labels now offer two cover options, particularly for their most popular performers, ensuring that the artwork will require no further doctoring and can be sold without causing offence. There have been some memorable redesigns in recent years with Kylie Minogue wearing a wrap to cover up her white swimsuit, on the cover of her 2001 record Fever, Madonna swapping her revealing dominatrix outfit in favor of a one-piece leather body suit for her 2008 album Hard Candy, and Katy Perry being consumed by clouds on 2010 hit Teenage Dream, all in the name of Middle Eastern decency. Almost all of Mariah Carey's albums have been adjusted for audiences in Asia while Christina Aguilera has also been targeted by the censors. In Lady Gaga's 2013 album, the cover was also altered for its Middle Eastern release. The blue orb she holds in front of her was enlarged to cover what was visible of her breasts. It's a wrap! In pictures for the Glitter album, Mariah is shown wearing tops that cover virtually all exposed flesh . Spot the difference: Mariah has been censored on a number of occasions, with many of her album shots proving too raunchy for Middle Eastern audiences . Cover girl: Butterfly by Mariah Carey showed the singer wearing a top covering her shoulders and belly button . Her legs were also colored to make her appear clothed. Of course, America has its own history of moral censorship of photos too. However censors in the U.S. typically don't try to re-clothe people who are deemed to be wearing too little. Instead offending details such as belly buttons and exposed nipples are removed or blurred out. American Apparel is notorious for their ads of scantily clad 'amateur models' of all sizes and the company was known to accept model submissions from 'real women' around the globe. Earlier this week the company made a rebranding change that saw the company choosing to airbrush out some of the models' exposed nipples and body hair making them look more like plastic mannequins.

"An unusually high number of students at Stanford University are suspected of cheating during the most recent term, putting faculty members and administrators of the prestigious institution on alert. University Provost John Etchemendy sent a letter to faculty members highlighting what he called 'troubling allegations' that stem from 'a smattering of concerns from a number of winter courses,' the San Jose Mercury News reported Friday. Etchemendy said the students are cheating themselves and risk severe consequences. All new students are told of the university's honor code and agree to abide by it, he said. Concerns: An unusually high number of students at Stanford University are suspected of cheating during the most recent term (file photo) 'But with the ease of technology and widespread sharing that is now part of a collaborative culture,' he wrote, 'students need to recognize and be reminded that it is dishonest to appropriate the work of others.' University spokeswoman Lisa Lapin declined to discuss details with the newspaper, such as the course or grade level of the students, but she said such concerns are routine. She says that in the 2013-2014 academic year, 83 students violated the honor code. In the most recent term, the newspaper reported that one instructor believes that 20 percent of students in a large introductory course may have cheated. Lapin said that Etchemendy's note underscored the need for faculty members to be clear with their students about expectations at Stanford, which prides itself as being one of the world's leading teaching and research universities. Students accused of cheating have the opportunity to defend themselves against the charge. First-time violators are usually suspended for a quarter and must perform 40 hours of community service, with increasing disciplinary action for subsequent violations. 'We have a lot of classes and a lot of students,' Lapin said. 'It's not unusual to have a handful of concerns raised every term.'

"The Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (LSPCA) has said it is investigating New Orleans' second goat beheading in two months - this one with a samurai-style sword. LSPCA Spokeswoman Alicia Haefele said that on Tuesday, the LSPCA received a 12-second cellphone video showing young men around a kiddie pool where a goat is pulled into the air. She said one man cuts off its head with the sword while the others cheer. Attack: The Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (LSPCA) has said it is investigating New Orleans' second goat beheading in two months - this one with a samurai-style sword . The LSPCA described the video in a Wednesday release, saying 'While the men stand in a circle around the plastic swimming pool, string is tied around the goat’s neck and hanged from an above object. One man then beheads the goat while the other men cheer in the background and record the felony act with cell phones. 'Once beheaded, the goat’s legs continue to move while the body lies in the swimming pool and the head still hanging from the string. A few seconds later, the man who beheaded the goat picks up the body and the video clip ends.' Haefele said this killing appears unrelated to the January 28 beheading of a baby pygmy goat. But she says it makes investigators wonder if the killings are part of a bigger trend. Within hours, the LSPCA increased a reward for information about the case from $3,000 to $13,000. Destinie Hammond, a SPCA Communications Associate, told the New York Daily News 'If it turns out that this goat was killed for the purpose of consuming, that is not against the law; that's legal. Hammond told the newspaper 'The fact that it was filmed is, of course, horrendous, but it was a very quick and clean kill so if it turns out that this was for consumption, unfortunately we can't really do anything about it.' Investigation: The LSPCA has said the organization, along with New Orleans and Tulane police, went to a home on Broadway street (pictured) but 'did not discover any evidence linking to the cellphone video' The LSPCA said in a separate Wednesday release 'A tip was received by the Louisiana SPCA this afternoon stating the body of a goat was in the backyard of a house in the 700 block of Broadway Street.'

"We all have our quirks, but we it comes to snacking Dean Zahariadis takes the perfectly sliced cake. The 31-year-old, from Pyrmont in Sydney, only ever eats his perfectly-portioned snacks with a knife and fork complete with a napkin tucked under his chin to avoid any mess. A self-confessed control freak, it doesn't bother Dean if he gets strange looks for his bizarre snacking rituals which include cutting all his food into bite-size portions and using cutlery for absolutely everything he eats - even the tiniest of items such as nuts and sultanas. Dean is a structured snacker who admits his obsessive behaviour can become quite tiresome and impact on his everyday life. And it seems he's not the only one obsessed with snacking as new statistics show Australians crave snacking more than spending time between the sheets or cuddles with their partners. Dean Zahariadis (right), with his girlfriend Claire Smith (left), must eat all of his food with a knife and fork . Almost two thirds feel the urge to satisfy their stomachs more than their sexual needs with a survey by snack food Wonderful Pistachios revealing that only 49 per cent have the strong desire to be intimate with their loved ones and a mere 39 per cent prefer cuddles over pigging out. Dean, who was diagnosed with a mild case of obsessive compulsive disorder in his first year of university, thinks it's because food is more readily available than sex. But he would still choose being intimate with  girlfriend Claire Smith over his structured snacks. 'I think it might be a case of we just generally crave food more often than intimacy because it's more readily available and we need to more regularly,' he said. Australian Clinical Psychologist and Mind and Body Expert Leanne Hall said  snacking and craving is alluring because it satisfies the pleasure sensors in your brain. 'We tend to use it as a way to make us feel good - whereas intimacy can do the same thing but it depends on the partner doesn't it?' she said. 'Some people say they would rather a block of chocolate over their partner which is a bit concerning.' A manager at Social Brew cafe, Dean must have six saucers perfectly lined up ready to go at at all times . Dean has to cut everything exactly the same size - even if it is for the customers at work . Food is a much quicker and easier craving to fix than the urges that go on in the bedroom. 'Let's face it, the food doesn't expect anything in return does it?' Ms Hall said. 'Whereas snacking just fulfils your need - you don't have to worry about anybody else's needs except your own.' As many as four in five people use snacks as a way to reward themselves or as a form of relaxation, according to a survey of more than 1,000 Australians. Dean admits to feeling very anxious if he can't snack the way he wants to with his particular and precise habits and is only able to relax when everything goes to plan. 'If I've been healthy all week I like to treat myself - very occasionally with a chocolate if I feel like I've accomplished something. 'But my way of indulging is probably different to most because I usually treat myself with a nut bar or muesli bar which still has sugar in it but some might see that as a more healthy option.' However, as much as Dean is controlled with his healthy snacks, his one 'bad habit' is having a can of Coke Zero with dinner every night. 'I find I've become to accustomed to the gas in the soft drink that it actually adds to every meal,' he said. 'If I don't have a bit of the drink left to take that last sip at the end of the meal than I don't feel full - that really drives me insane.' Dean needs all of his food cut up as the same snack size and he always uses a napkin to avoid any mess . Dean admits to becoming exhausted with his fastidious ways especially when at work . The survey results also indicate that Australians are ruled by snacking  behaviour with seven in 10 admitting to eating snacks purely because they are giving into a craving. Dean said his obsessive ways can really impact on his life especially where he works as a manager of the Social Brew cafe in Pyrmont. 'When I’m serving coffee, I line my cups and saucers up like ducks in a row on the counter which has only manifested in the past six months. If anything is out of place, I have to rearrange it immediately,' he said. 'The sweet treat display needs to be immaculately presented and every plate needs to be positioned so it lines up perfectly. 'If I’m going to serve a cake or sandwich to a customer, it needs to be cut into a slice that’s exactly 5cm wide. 'I think that being a perfectionist actually suits my line of work – no one ever complains about having to tidy up after me.' But he does confess to getting tired of doing the same thing '100 times a day'. 'I hate things being moved it drives me insane which can be very exhausting - I'm always thinking ""geez this is so tiring"",' he said. Meanwhile 45 per cent of Australians confess to secretly stashing their favourite treats to hide them from others - and 41 per cent vow they are prepared to travel up to 10km to fulfill their urge for a particular snack. But at the same time, many won't travel too far without their favourite food as 58 per cent  make space for snacks in their suitcases and 48 per cent say they find their trusty treats comforting when away from home. The number one hot spot to feast on your snacks is while you are cosily tucked up bed but not for Dean who can't bear the thought of his bed getting food crumbs on it . As much as Dean is very controlled with his healthy snacks, his one 'bad habit' is having a can of Coke Zero with dinner every night . Dean doesn't like to drive without his portion-sized snacks in the car and avoids flying on planes as much as possible because they make him feel 'woozy'. To prove even further that comfort food is the real deal - the number one hot spot to feast on your snacks is while you are cosily tucked up bed for those who were surveyed. But this is certainly not an ideal snacking scenario for Dean who can't bear the thought of his bed getting dirty. Ms Hall said it is essential to break the habit where you like to snack by turning them into snack-free zones and also creating boundaries where food is only to be consumed in the kitchen or dining room. 'If you usually snack in front of the TV then don't allow food on the couch so you are addressing those triggers that lead to that mindless eating - which is when we overeat because we are usually focusing on a million things at once,' she said. 'If you create those limits then you are less likely to fall in the trap of stashing food in the bedroom or as soon as a movie goes on snacking on popcorn and chips.'","Dean Zahariadis is a structured snacker who always uses a knife and fork .

"An Iranian film company has come under fire for depicting the Prophet Mohammed by showing the back of his head in a new movie. 'Mohammed, Messenger of God' is a film about the Prophet's childhood but doesn't show his face with the other characters telling his story. The project was filmed in Iran with a replica of the Kaaba shrine in Saudi Arabia built in the remote village of Allahyar especially for the epic making it the country's most expensive film. Iranian filmmaker Majid Maijidi leads the crew through a scene while filming 'Mohammed, Messenger of God', a new film about the Prophet Mohammed . Replica buildings of Mecca in Saudi Arabia were created for the film's set in the village of Allahyar, south of Tehran . But despite the film yet to receive its release, it has been widely criticised, as Islamic clerics agree that trying to depict the Prophet Mohammed is forbidden. Already Egypt has called for a ban on the film saying it debases the sanctity of the messengers from God, while Qatar has announced plans to shot its own film about the prophet's life. But the film's director Majid Majidi has insisted the movie will five the right impression of Mohammed's life. He said: 'Many relay their messages to the world through cinema and pictures. 'We are ready to co-operate to produce any movies to introduce Mohammed to the world. 'We are an Islamic country, we know the related culture and we have capabilities for such production.' The film is the most expensive to be made in the country and depicts the Prophet Mohammed by showing the back of his head . The film appears to have gained the support of Iran's current supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Kharmenei, who attended the set in 2012 . Islamic tradition is full of written descriptions of Mohammed and his qualities, describing him as the ideal human being. But many finding depicting the prophet offensive with the the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo targeted by gunman in the Paris terror attacks, killing 12 people, over its caricature of Mohammed. However, the film appears to have gained the support of Ayatollah Ali Kharmenei, Iran's current supreme leader, who attended and inauguration of the film's set in 2012. For his vision the director has also hired Academy Award winning visual effects supervisor and filmmaker Scott E. Anderson, three-time Oscar winning Italian director of photography Vittorio Storaro and music producer Allah-Rakha Rahman, who won two Oscars for his work on Slumdog Millionnaire. Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi, who has insisted the movie will five the right impression of Mohammed's life . Producers plan to ultimately release the film in Arabic, Persian and English, with showings across Iran in the summer. If the film is successful, producers hope to work on two sequels with one focusing on Mohammed's life from this teenagers years and another from his 40s onwards, when he became the prophet of Islam. Mohammed Mahdi Heidarian, head of the private Nourtaban Film Industry company, confirmed that his firm had spent $30million on the film. He and others declined to elaborate on who provided financial backing for it, though there are wealthy investors and religious institutions in Iran that likely would support such efforts.","A film company is to release movie about Prophet Mohammed's childhood .

"A sprawling Hamptons 'castle' belonging to the family of billionaire Hard Rock Cafe mogul Peter Morton was completely destroyed by fire on Wednesday. The blaze broke out at the oceanfront East Hampton Village mansion in the early afternoon, with fire crews spending hours putting out the flames, which were fanned by strong winds. While the cause of the fire remains unclear, crews began knocking what was left of the house down at 5pm, and by Thursday morning there was nothing but the burnt out shell of the former estate. The home, according to Page Six, is owned by Morton and his family, but, fortunately no one was home at the time. The property was last appraised in 2008 for $21.5 million. Scroll down for video . Rubble: The remains of the Hamptons mansion are seen on Thursday morning . Gone: The entire estate was devastated by the fire, which ripped through the  structure at an alarming rate .

The home is owned by the family of Hard Rock Cafe mogul Peter Morton . Leveled: The 10-bedroom Hamptons home owned by Peter Morton (right) was completely destroyed by the fire. Investigators will now look into what caused the blaze. No one except workers and builders were at the property at the time, according to reports . A source told The New York Post column: 'Nobody was hurt in the fire, the only people who were there were the builders, a construction company, who were working on the property.' 'It is the Morton family house, he shares it with his three children. Peter wasn’t at the house when the fire started, he is in LA,' the source added. The house, which has 10 bedrooms, is located at 57 West End Road near Georgica Pond. Morton paid $10 million for the house in 1998, according to reports. Firefighters said the road was too narrow for the tankers to get through and a dump tank was stationed at the corner of Lily Pond Lane and West End Road to help pump water, 27 East reported today. Ambulances were also seen at the scene on standby, prepared for anyone who might have been injured. Attorney Errol Margolin, who represents Morton, told 27East.com that the summer home was 'a total loss.' 'It sounds like it was a horrible accident,' Margolin said.

"Speaking two languages really could give you a split personality, researchers have found. They say that many speakers have entirely different personalities in each of the languages they speak. Previously research has even found those who are bilingual even see colours differently. Researchers say that speaking in another language can change our personality. 'Rather than ask whether speakers of different languages have different minds, he says, 'we ask, Can two different minds exist within one person?' said psycholinguist Panos Athanasopoulos of Lancaster University. 'The extent to which language affects this process has been the focus of a long-standing debate: Do different languages cause their speakers to behave differently?,' the team wrote. 'Here, we show that fluent German-English bilinguals categorize motion events according to the grammatical constraints of the language in which they operate. Athanasopoulos and colleagues were interested in a particular difference in how English and German speakers treat events. English has a grammatical toolkit for situating actions in time: 'I was sailing to Bermuda and I saw Elvis' is different from 'I sailed to Bermuda and I saw Elvis.' German doesn't have this feature. As a result, German speakers tend to specify the beginnings, middles, and ends of events, but English speakers often leave out the endpoints and focus in on the action. Looking at the same scene, for example, German speakers might say, 'A man leaves the house and walks to the store,' whereas an English speaker would just say, 'A man is walking.' This linguistic difference seems to influence how speakers of the two languages view events, according to the research. 'First, as predicted from cross-linguistic differences in motion encoding, participants functioning in a German testing context prefer to match events on the basis of motion completion to a greater extent than participants in an English context. Learning to speak a second language at any point in your life could help keep your brain sharp as you age, a study suggests. The University of Edinburgh detected a pattern of slower mental decline among the bilingual in a group of 835 born in 1936. They were given an intelligence test in 1947 at the age of 11, then retested in their early 70s between 2008 and 2010. A total of 262 participants could communicate in at least one language other than English. Of those, 195 learnt the second language before the age of 18. Those who spoke two or more languages had significantly better cognitive abilities in their 70s than their peers. The strongest effect of bilingualism was seen in general intelligence and reading tests. 'Our study shows that bilingualism, even when acquired in adulthood, may benefit the ageing brain,' study authors said. 'Second, when participants suffer verbal interference in English, their categorization behavior is congruent with that predicted for German and when we switch the language of interference to German, their categorization becomes congruent with that predicted for English. 'These findings show that language effects on cognition are context-bound and transient, revealing unprecedented levels of malleability in human cognition.' Previous research found a similar result. Between 2001 and 2003, linguists Jean-Marc Dewaele and Aneta Pavlenko asked over a thousand bilinguals whether they 'feel like a different person' when they speak different langauges. Nearly two-thirds said they did. Scientists have also found that regularly speaking in a second language makes you literally see the world in a different way. Color perception is an ideal way of testing bilingual concepts because there is a huge variation between where different languages place boundaries on the color spectrum.","Researchers studied particular difference between English and German .

"Detectives investigating claims of a VIP paedophile sex ring have been passed lurid allegations relating to Enoch Powell. The late Tory MP, who was one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of the 20th century, was named in a Church of England review into historic sex abuse. The claims relate to allegations of satanic rituals, often involving the abuse of children. Scroll down for video . Allegation: Detectives investigating claims of a VIP paedophile sex ring have been passed lurid allegations relating to Enoch Powell, above . Powell is one of several high-profile names passed to Scotland Yard by Bishop of Durham Paul Butler, who is leading the review. The Bishop has also handed detectives the name of Leo Abse, the flamboyant Welsh MP who died in 2008 aged 91. Last night the Church of England confirmed that both names had been passed on to detectives from Operation Fernbridge, a Metropolitan Police inquiry into an alleged Westminster VIP paedophile network. The Right Rev Butler was given the politicians’ names by Dominic Walker, former Bishop of Monmouth, who heard the allegations when he was a vicar counselling in the 1980s. Mr Walker told senior clerics that Abse was named by three abuse survivors whom he counselled when he was a vicar in Brighton in the 1980s. He also passed on the names of two former Conservative cabinet ministers, who have not yet been publicly linked to the scandal. Mr Walker was questioned by the Right Rev Butler after the discovery of a book from 1991 in which he described counselling sessions with adult survivors. Powell is one of several high-profile names passed to Scotland Yard by Bishop of Durham Paul Butler, above, who is leading the review . ‘A number of survivors independently gave the name of a particular MP being involved,’ he said, adding. ‘I don’t believe there was any collusion in their stories.’ A Church of England spokesman said: ‘The name Enoch Powell was passed to Operation Fernbridge on the instruction of Bishop Paul Butler.’ In 1994, an investigation by the London School of Economics into 84 alleged cases of ‘satanic abuse’ in the UK between 1987 and 1992 found no convincing corroborative evidence. The claims against Powell and Abse have emerged amid mounting claims of a paedophile network involving Establishment figures, which was allegedly covered up by Special Branch. Police are to be given access to secret files held on MPs in the House of Commons archives to help their search for evidence on suspected abusers, including former Liberal MP Cyril Smith. Enoch Powell’s frontline political career ended in 1968 after he made his ‘rivers of blood’ speech warning about the dangers of uncontrolled immigration. Tory leader Edward Heath sacked him from the shadow cabinet the following day, although Powell remained a Tory MP until 1974. SIMON HEFFER: Monstrous slur against my friend . Four years before he died in 1998, Enoch Powell did me the honour of asking me to write his biography. I spoke to almost everyone alive who knew him. When he died, I had unique access to a vast collection of private papers, including numerous intimate letters. If there is anyone alive other than Enoch’s widow and daughters who knows more about him than I do, I’d like to meet him. I never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about Powell, writes Simon Heffer . I never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about Powell. His probity in personal and financial matters was rock solid. When on Saturday evening a fellow journalist told me of the allegations made by the Church of England, my first instinct was to laugh: but that soon changed into utter outrage when I realised he was serious. The Church has publicly accused Enoch of being involved in ritual satanic abuse on hearsay, without the slightest evidence. They might as well accuse him of having been a war criminal or an armed robber, for there would be as much truth in either allegation. The appalling slurs are just like those made against 91-year-old Lord Bramall, a D-Day veteran and former chief of defence staff, whose homes in London and North Yorkshire were gratuitously raided by police recently on the back of an unspecified allegation of a sexual nature dating back to the 1970s. It is not just that the bishops who have made these accusations are behaving in a remarkably un-Christian fashion by putting this smear into the public domain. But that they do not appear even to have engaged what passes for their brains, or consciences, before behaving in this grotesque and offensive fashion. Their brains should have told them that a man of Enoch’s controversial reputation would never for a moment have got away with the type of behaviour they are alleging he indulged in during the 1980s. The Establishment turned against Enoch in 1968 after the so-called Rivers of Blood speech; it would never have protected him for a second had it detected the slightest whiff of scandal. Their consciences should have told them that to make such an outrageous allegation about an enormously distinguished public figure who cannot defend himself, and which would cause the deepest distress to his family and friends, was the height of mischief and irresponsibility. It is disgraceful and destabilising for clergy to behave in this way, and the Church needs to investigate those responsible for this smear and take action accordingly. These post-Savile accusations bring to mind the hysteria surrounding allegations of satanic abuse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including notorious cases in Rochdale and the Orkneys that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids. When the London School of Economics investigated 84 alleged cases, it found no convincing corroborative evidence of any abuse – yet families had been torn apart on the say-so of those who insisted action be taken. Enoch Powell, pictured making a speech in 1977, has been named in a Church of England review into historic sex abuse . For decades, Enoch Powell has long been a bug-bear of the liberal Establishment. He has been demonised not least because to attack his memory is a quick and effective way for them to score points by setting out their own political correctness. What better way for some mischievous Leftist priest to damage Enoch further than by linking him with the current rash of stories about child abuse? In 1998, just after Enoch died, the BBC broadcast a programme in which they railed at Enoch for his hypocrisy. They said this scourge of mass immigration had visited the West Indies in 1953 to recruit black labour for the NHS. I was told of the story before the programme was broadcast and informed its researcher that Enoch had never been to the West Indies in his life. I was told, effectively, that I was lying, and it was broadcast. A black clergywoman, then resident in London, talked at length of Enoch having recruited her as a nurse. The story was rubbish. Detailed investigation by the BBC complaints department found that the woman had been recruited after a visit to her island by Jack Profumo, not Enoch Powell at all, and the Corporation was forced to make a grovelling on-air apology in peak time. I have long dreamt of the day when ignorant politicians and Establishment figures would stop manipulating Enoch’s memory for their own advantage. But I never thought I would hear of bishops of the Church of England doing it. The allegations are a monstrous lie. That the lie appears to have been retailed by a priest is beyond contempt. There must be an investigation and, for all the distress this outrage has caused, there must be a reckoning.","Late Tory MP was one of the most prominent politicians of the 20th century .

Although his official title is Assistant Bishop – the Bishop's post in Newcastle is currently vacant – Alison insists she will not outrank her husband when she is consecrated in July. 'I don't think the church works like that in terms of rank,' she said. 'It is extraordinary that we have both had the calling to be Bishops of the church. 'In all this time we have never worked together. Our gifts are quite different and we are different sorts of people.' The Rev Canon Alison White described the news as 'absolutely wonderful'. 'It's an amazing surprise to me I have to say,' she said. And writing on the diocese website, she said: 'This is an adventure I had never imagined setting out on.' Adding: 'You may have noticed that I am married to a Bishop. This may seem excessive! You would think that one in a family is more than enough. Believe me, this has crossed our minds.' Rev Canon White said having another Bishop in the family gave her no advantage in getting the Bishop of Hull's job. 'The only word he put in for me was with God,' she said.

The appointment was announced following a long interview process, she said. In January the Rev Libby Lane was consecrated as Bishop of Stockport and became the Church of England's first female bishop. Rev Canon White said the two women would have a chat before she started in the summer. 'Won't that be wonderful when, in the best sense, it isn't newsworthy because we're women, it's newsworthy because of what we're called into.' Her career in the church began when she became a deaconess in 1986 and a priest from 1994. She is currently priest-in-charge of Riding Mill in Northumberland. The new Bishop of Hull was once part of a professional theatre company and is an avid reader and school governor. Her husband was a social worker for nine years before being ordained in 1980. He said: 'I believe that Alison will be an outstanding bishop and we are delighted at this appointment. She combines a deep personal spirituality with clear vision, great energy and a lightness of touch which will serve her very well. She has a great sense of humour and she knows the scale of the task to which God is calling her.'

"Jessica 'Asia' Steinhauser - Asia Carrera - was arrested in St George, Utah . A former porn star who wore a colander on her head for her driver's license photo was arrested in Utah after police say she drove her ten-year-old daughter to school while drunk. Jessica 'Asia' Steinhauser - also known as  Asia Carrera or Asia Lemmon - was found asleep on a couch in the Washington County School District office after driving there with her daughter, according to a probable cause statement. Workers at the office were 'concerned' with her well-being and contacted the authorities around 2pm on March 5, Capt. Mike Giles with the St. George police told Daily Mail Online. After St. George police officers arrived, they detected the odor of alcohol on her breath. When she tried to leave the scene, officers conducted field sobriety tests, according to the Spectrum & Daily News. The mother-of-two failed the tests, so police administered a breathalyzer. It recorded her blood alcohol content level at .254 per cent. Utah law sets the limit at .08 per cent. Steinhauser, who also has a nine-year-old son, was charged with driving under the influence with a child. An officer reported Steinhauser said she brought her daughter to the district office for testing. She was booked into Purgatory Correctional Facility on $10,000 bail and was released after making the required bond payment. Capt. Giles said he'd heard rumors about Steinhauser's old job but he was 'not familiar with her or her past employment' and was unsure if the arresting officers were aware of her work history. He indicated it was likely child protective services had been called. Steinhauser - who is also known as Asia Carrera or Asia Lemmon - worked in the porn industry for 12 years . The porn legend, an atheist, was photographed in her license photo with a pasta strainer on her head . Steinhauser, 41, had a blood alcohol content level of .254 per cent. Utah law sets the limit at .08 per cent . Steinhauser, a native of New York City who attended Rutgers University in New Jersey and worked in the porn industry for 12 years from 1993 to 2005, has appeared in 425 adult films and directed three, according to IAFD. Her films include titles like Let's Play Doctor, Planet of the Babes, Sexual Misconduct, Wild Wild Chest and Superboobs. The porn legend is a self-proclaimed atheist and was the fourth person in the US to be photographed for her license with a pasta strainer on her head. Members of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, sometimes called 'Pastafarians', have decided the colander is their official headgear. Steinhauser is a MENSA member, former NJ spelling champ and also played classical piano at Carnegie Hall . An officer reported Steinhauser said she brought her daughter to the school district office for testing . After taking the photo, she said: 'I'm a really proud, outspoken atheist. 'I am proud of Utah for allowing freedom of all religions in what is considered by many to be a one-religion state.' Steinhauser is a MENSA member, former New Jersey spelling champ and also played classical piano at Carnegie Hall, according to her bio. Her favorite quote is: 'Hi, I'm just here to use the shower. Mine's broken.' She faces up to a year in jail if convicted, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

"Dao Nguyen, 44, who was being investigated for allegedly defrauding members of a California temple out of tens of thousands of dollars was found dead Friday in an apparent suicide . A Buddhist monk who was being investigated for allegedly defrauding members of a California temple out of tens of thousands of dollars was found dead Friday in an apparent suicide. Dao Nguyen, 44, was discovered unresponsive at Tu Nghiem Temple in Santa Ana at 9.15am, according to police. Nguyen's death by hanging comes more than three weeks after police were called to the temple on West Fourth Street in response to an angry crowd of people demanding that he return close to $100,000 he had collected from them. The monk allegedly had told congregants the money would be used towards a trip to Vietnam that never took place. Santa Ana police said Nguyen raised anywhere between $1,100 and $7,700 from 34 people, allegedly pocketing a total of $97,000 for himself. The members of the temple community expected to fly out to Vietnam March 2 and tour the country's Buddhist landmarks. But on March 1, they found out about the scam and converged on the Tu Nghiem Temple in the Little Saigon part of Santa Ana at around 11am, calling on Nguyen to give them their money back, reported the Los Angeles Times. The monk was discovered unresponsive at Tu Nghiem Temple in Little Saigon section of Santa Ana . When confronted with the allegations of fraud, Dao Nguyen claimed that the plane tickets and travel documents, including passports, had been destroyed in a fire that broke out at the temple February 28; but police later determined that that monk never booked any tickets. The 44-year-old Nguyen, who spoke no English, then changed his story, telling investigators that he did receive plane tickets, but they were fake. He claimed that his agent in Vietnam was supposed to make all the necessary travel arrangements for the planned pilgrimage. He then blamed the deception on an unnamed person who delivered them to his apartment at the Santa Ana sanctuary just hours before the fire. The blaze inside the one-story temple, which was founded six years ago, has been ruled suspicious, according to officials. Santa Ana police will be reviewing bank records, emails and phone call logs to determine if other people were involved in the fraud. Nguyen's death left his small congregation divided, with some accusing him of being a swindler while others, like Truc Tam, praising him as a kind-hearted person who was always eager to help those in need.","Dao Nguyen, 44, was found dead Friday inside tiny Tu Nghiem Temple in Santa Ana .

"Pilot Jan Cocheret wrote at the beginning of the year about his fear of being locked out of the cockpit after visiting the aircraft's toilet . A Dutch pilot 'predicted' the Germanwings crash several weeks ago in an article written in a specialist flight magazine posing the question: 'I seriously wonder who's sitting next to me.' Chillingly Jan Cocheret, who flies a Boeing 777 for Emirates airlines warned: 'I hope I never find myself in the situation where I go to the toilet and return to find a cockpit door that won't open.' Mr Cocheret was writing for Dutch flying magazine Piloot en Vliegtuig (Pilot and Plane) where he expressed his fears. His article warned that someone could use the security procedures introduced in the aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities to prevent an aircraft's captain re-entering the flight deck after a rest break. French prosecutors have determined that Andreas Lubitz waited for his captain to leave the flight deck before disabiling key pad controlling access to the cockpit. He then selected an altitude of 96 feet on the aircraft's flight computer before setting it on its collision course with the Alps. Investigators revealed that the aircraft's captain Patrick Sondenheimer can be heard banging on the cockpit door urging his colleague to open up until the jet hits the Alps at more than 400 miles per hour. Audio leading up to the crash revealed that Captain Sondenheimer had complained that he did not have enough time to use the toilet while the aircraft was on the ground in Barcelona. As soon as the aircraft achieved its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, Captain Sondenheimer can be heard leaving the cockpit. As soon as the door closed behind him, Lubitz flicked a switch which disabled the keypad on the cabin side of the door for five minutes and initiated his descent. The door lock override is switched off after five minutes as an additional safety measure in case the flight crew become incapacitated. Lubitz is believed to have flicked the switch a second time during the eight-minute descent. Mr Cocheret later wrote on his Facebook page: 'Unfortuantely, this terrible scenario has become a reality.' Scroll down for video . Andreas Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit before commanding the aircraft to crash into a mountain . Scientists are currently trying to identify the remains of the 150 people killed in the disaster using DNA . Investigators are currently trying to carve a road up to the crash site to help speed up the recovery process . His original article predicted the exact way such an atrocity could be carried out. He said: 'I seriously sometimes wonder who’s sitting next to me in the cockpit. How can I be sure that I can trust him? Perhaps something terrible has just happened in his life and he’s unable to overcome it. 'There indeed does exist a way to get back into the cockpit, but if the person inside disables this option (the security code to get in), one could do nothing but sit with the passengers and wait and see what happens.' German airline Lufthansa has set aside $300 million to deal with potential civil claims against the company following the Germanwings disaster. The French crash investigators BEA said they will look into methods of preventing a similar incident in future. A spokesperson said: '(We will study) systemic weaknesses (that) might possibly have led to this aviation disaster.' German officials have revealed that Lubitz, 27, received psychotherapy before gaining his pilot's licence after expressing suicidal tendencies. Crash investigators are trying to build a road to the site of the crash to help speed up recovery efforts and attempts to find the second black box. Lufthansa has so far refused to say whether they were aware of Lubitz's mental health history although they said he had passed all the required medical tests to work with Germanwings, its low-cost subsidiary.","Pilot Jan Cocheret wrote about his fears about cockpit suicides last month .

"Single thongs across Australia now have the chance to find a 'solemate'. At least that’s what a new online service hopes to provide, and with a tagline of It’s like Tinder for Thongs, the chance is now there for that single and lonely ‘lefty’ or ‘righty’ to find a new life partner. Adelaide man Karl Gautam is the brains behind the new venture that started off as a laugh on Facebook, but has since become a huge fashion sensation. Adelaide's Karl Gautam wants single thongs to find the perfect partner . HavyMatch Facebook page is trying to get the right match for thongs who are now on their own . Thanks to Mr Gautam all you have to do is upload a photograph or write a description of the required thong onto his HavyMatch Facebook page and wait for a match. When a proper match has been made they send it to you for a mailing fee of $7.50. 'I was cleaning out my cupboard and I noticed I had a few single thongs. I didn't want to throw them out as they were in too good a nick,' Mr Gautam told Daily Mail Australia. 'So I went on my Facebook page and asked if anyone had any thongs that could match up with any of them. These single thongs were washed up on an Adelaide river bank. HavyMatch is hoping to stop this and make a difference environmentally . 'One of my mates got back to me with one which was the right size. I told my mates about this and they got on Facebook asking me if I could find them one. It was then I thought that there maybe some legs in this idea.' He set up the HavyMatch Facebook page 11 weeks ago and now has more than 1,100 followers. What started out as a bit of fun suddenly exploded into life and it soon became clear that the Facebook page wasn't the right platform for the endeavour. It soon became clear that there was a market for people looking for replacement thongs . 'For this reason I have some IT people in Melbourne working on a dedicated website that will make it really easy to look for a thong,' he said. 'It'll be set up similarly to those 'classified ad' style websites. The website is hopefully around six weeks away and will be called havymatch.com.au.' The 36-year-old, who works as fitter and turner in South Australia's copper mines, also realised that although he'd started it all off as a bit of a lark there was a serious point to the idea of finding a match for your thong. The sight every holiday-maker hates to see on their return home - the dreaded single thong in the suitcase . 'A friend was walking along beside a river near my house and he collected about 40 single thongs that had been washed up on the bank after heavy rain,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'His point was that if people are swapping thongs they wouldn't be throwing them away like this. It would make a big difference to the environment. 'I realised that there was also a serious side to all this. And that it could make a difference environmentally.' Rather than throwing them away, thongs of all shapes and sizes could still  be of use . It's all the better too as his habit of wearing odd thongs was causing a few problems at home. 'My wife gives me a lot of grief about it. I've a righty that is red and white and a lefty that is black and blue,' he said. Now he can argue that although he may not win any style competitions, at least he's being environmentally friendly. Mr Gautam believes that even wearing odd thongs is better than having just the one .","Karl Gautam reckoned that there could be a market for replacement thongs .

"A pet owner was left heartbroken after a fire caused by her mobile phone charger killed her three pet dogs. Dawn Jackson, 43, kept her two Labradors and whippet-cross in the home she shares with her partner and two friends in Derby. But a fire - believed to have been started from a phone charger - ripped through the property while the dogs' owners were at work last month, killing all three pets. Dawn Jackson has warned others not to leave phone chargers plugged in after a blaze at her home in Derby .

"Parents of sixth graders at a Pennsylvania school were forced to sign permissions slips so that their children could each eat a single Oreo cookie. Mrs Darlene Porter, a science teacher at Welsh Valley Middle School in Lower Merion, sent the note out while planning a lesson for Friday about the Earth's tectonic plates, which she wanted to represent with Double Stuf Oreos. The Twitter account Mainline Housewife posted a picture of a form describing it as 'insanity'. Parents of sixth graders at a school in eastern Pennsylvania received a letter from teacher Darlene Porter asking for a signature allowing their children to eat an Oreo cookie . 'The students may eat the Oreo after the investigation if this is okay with you,' the note, sent home on Monday, reads. 'The students do NOT have to eat the Oreo if they do not wish to do so.' Mrs Porter's form then explains that without expressed parental permission given by Wednesday, the students would not be allowed to have the the cookie. 'It's one teacher who was really trying to do her due diligence, quite honestly,"" Lower Merion School District spokesman Doug Young told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Despite its intentions, the permissions slips were lambasted by Internet users. 'Oh dear Lord. Some poor tree had to give its life for this idiocy,' one commenters said on the parenting blog Free-Range Kids. A spokesman for the Lower Merion School District said that the teacher was 'trying to do her due diligence' but there was no requirement that permission slips be sent home . A student in Ms Porter's class has a food allergy, though there was no requirement for the forms to be sent home to every parent . 'Did the school ask permission to send this permission slip?' another asked. Mainline Housewife said that she did not blame the teacher's zeal. 'I fault our crazy culture,' she said. A student in Ms Porter's class has an allergy that requires notifications about food in the classroom, though there is no requirement that permission slips to all parents need to be sent.

Allergies are not mentioned in Ms Porter's letter. Mr Young did not say how many students chose to eat Oreos on Friday, though the parents of a student who cannot eat gluten sent gluten-free Oreos to school.

"Men in 'immaculate suits' are tricking motorway drivers into believing they are stranded, then taking their money in exchange for fake jewellery. There were a staggering 26 incidents on the M4, M40 and M25 in five days, according to detectives who have urged commuters to be vigilant. The conmen tell innocent motorists who stop to help that they ran out of petrol and their loved one has died - so they need money to get home immediately. In return, the gang members have been offering fake gold rings as 'security' in exchange for the cash to buy petrol. Conmen: There were a staggering 26 incidents on the M4, M40 and M25 (pictured) involving men in 'immaculate suits' who tricked motorists out of cash by convincing them they are stranded . Inspector Colin Clark from Thames Valley Police said: 'In some of these cases the men stopping motorists were well-dressed and wearing suits. 'Some stated that a relative had died or that they had run out of petrol and needed money. 'The offenders were often parked in areas which put themselves and other road users at risk. 'We take all reports seriously and take appropriate action against anyone found to be offending.' The incidents all took place on the M25, the M4 and the M40 motorways across Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: 'People getting conned on motorways is deeply disturbing and this is exactly the sort of thing we at the AA warn drivers to watch out for.

'It could be argued that if people are dumb enough to hand over money then in a way, they deserve to be ripped off, but the fact of the matter is that it is a scam that has been happening in other parts of the world. 'The problem is where they go from here. Our advice for people who come across these conmen is to politely say no, drive a safe distance away and immediately call the police. 'The way to deal with these conmen is to catch them in the act.

"A woman who spent the money she had saved for fertility treatment on a diet instead, says she has 'never been happier'. Natalie Southerden, 31, who lives in Halifax, West Yorkshire, blew £4,000 on a weight loss regime that originally put aside for fertility treatment after failing to become pregnant. In five months she transformed herself from a size 22 to a size 12/14 by losing six and a half stone and now hopes to become pregnant naturally. Scroll down for video . Natalie Southerden, 31, from Halifax, has lost more than six stone and dropped five dress sizes, after spending the £4,000 she saved for fertility treatment on a weight loss scheme (Pictured left: before and right: after the diet) Natalie's decision to lose weight was triggered by a humiliating, five-minute interview with her GP after a year of trying to conceive with husband John, 41, a music teacher who she met eight years ago. She said: 'The GP was horrible. He said he would not send me for any tests -he just took my hand and said ""well you are very overweight, aren’t you?"" 'I felt patronised. I knew I was overweight but I didn’t expect him to refuse to do anything for me at all.' She continued: 'I was told to go away and come back when I had lost three stone.' Natalie felt she had reached a low point in life but now admits that day was the trigger for her amazing transformation. She said: 'I felt so upset and angry, I hate going to the doctors and really had to gear myself up to go there in the first place.' Followers of the Alevere regime eat five meal replacements a day as well as three low calorie meals made with normal food. They also have skin tightening treatments to stop their skin sagging from the rapid weight loss . Natalie was a size 22 and weighed 18 and a half stone, despite being a top martial artist, practising Taekwondo regularly for 14 years, and even winning the English championship in her category. She said: 'We were fit and healthy and I felt I deserved to be tested to rule out any underlying conditions that we were unaware of, and treated with more respect. 'But I also really want to have children, so I decided I would so something about it.' Natalie initially tried a weekly slimming group and lost a stone - but it took her eight long months. She said: 'I worked out that if I carried on at that rate I would be 35 or 36 before I could conceive. 'My husband is ten years older than me so I decided I didn’t have that much time.' So Natalie made the decision to spend the £4,000 the couple had saved in case they needed fertility treatment on a new diet regime - and five months later she is a svelte size 12-14 after losing a total of six and a half stone. Natalie lost 11lb in the first week of her new weight loss regime. 'Within a fortnight I had last a stone. I never felt hungry and managed to keep going through my birthday and Christmas' Natalie signed up to the Alevere Leeds clinic to take part in their diet scheme. In her first week on the diet she lost an incredible eleven pounds and continued to lose more every week. Natalie, who has a degree in chemistry, said, 'I did my research and everything the clinic told me about this diet made sense.' The diet, called Alevere Weight Reduction and Body Contouring Therapy, costs around £200 a week and is designed to help very overweight clients lose weight quickly and safely. Followers eat five meal replacements a day as well as three low calorie meals made with normal food. Breakfast - nothing . Mid morning snack - savoury cracker biscuits . Lunch - Instant pasta with no fruit or veg . Mid afternoon snack - bag of tortilla chips with dips or crisps . Dinner - toad in the hole, usually eaten around 10.30pm . Evening snacks - two slices of toast with butter, which could be repeated several times during the evening . Breakfast - four tablespoons of muesli with natural yoghurt . Mid morning snack - piece of fruit . Lunch - salad with a small can of tuna and some low fat cheese . Mid afternoon snack - piece of fruit . Dinner - home made soup or a lasagne made with turkey mince and aubergine layers in place of pasta . They also have skin tightening treatments to stop their skin sagging from the rapid weight loss, plus the latest ultrasound treatments to destroy fat cells. Natalie said, 'Within a fortnight I had lost a stone. 'I never felt hungry and I managed to keep going through my birthday, my sister’s birthday and Christmas. 'The difference it has made to me is amazing. It is as if I suddenly exist. 'When I was fat people would avoid me, now they hold doors open for me, they want to talk to me.' Natalie believes that she was almost invisible when she was at her heaviest . Before her dramatic weight loss, Natalie says she spent many years feelings invisible. She said: 'I wandered around trying not to be seen, I was confident on the outside but not on the inside. 'I was always the one to make the joke about myself first before anyone else could, but I hated my size inside. Humour was my defence mechanism. 'I have always had issues with food. I love stodgy, savoury things, and I was eating for comfort and eating large portions. I would eat the same as John and he is 6ft 3ins tall while I am only 5ft 6ins. 'I would graze constantly. 'I would eat toast with butter as a snack, and then an hour later I would be making some more. Or I would eat a full bag of tortilla chips with a dip while I was cooking my dinner. 'I have always had a problem with food, but it is a drug you cannot quit.' Natalie was badly bullied at school for being overweight and during one incident a group of boys kicked her down a flight of stairs . She continued: 'I started putting weight on when I was aged six and from then on I was the big girl. When I was thirteen I had to change schools after a group of lads kicked me down some stairs. 'They said they were going to kick the fat out of me and started booting me in the stomach.' But life got better for Natalie at the next school, and she went on to study at The University of Manchester. Clients eat five, protein-based nutritional supplements per day, each containing around a hundred calories. These are sachets of dried nutrients that can be made into various products, including omelette, pizza and chocolate desserts, with 35 flavours to choose from. From the start of the therapy, these are eaten in addition to three meals of normal food per day. Weekly sessions of ultrasound and skin tightening treatments are then used to stop the common problem of loose skin after major weight loss . The diet is in three stages and at each stage, a wider range of natural foods is reintroduced. At the end, to avoid any rebound weight gain, there is a stabilisation programme to follow which takes around one month. By the end of this the client is back on a healthy, normal and balanced diet. The average client is on the therapy for 16 weeks. She said: 'I had lots of people around me, and I cycled everywhere even though I was a size 18-20. 'My life was okay but I never had one single boyfriend.' That all changed when Natalie, who has always been musical and played the violin from the age of six, was introduced to music teacher and musician John eight years ago. 'I wanted to learn the bass guitar and my Taekwondo teacher introduced me to John. We were mates for about eight months while he taught me to play the bass guitar and we even play together in a band now. 'But eventually we realised there was something more between us. 'John has always accepted me just as I am. 'When I said I was going to lose weight he said okay but not to lose it for him because he loved me as I was. 'I was a size 22 when we got married and he said I looked beautiful.' But now Natalie is gradually learning to live with her dramatically altered body. She said: 'My brain hasn’t quite caught up. I keep picking up size 20 tops. My sister has always been slim and she is encouraging me to try new styles. We go shopping together and she picks out things for me I never imagined I would be able to wear.' 'Now we are renovating a lovely home and hoping that I can become pregnant without having to go back to that doctor again - but if I do I can’t wait to see his face when I walk in.'","Natalie Southernden, 31, blew fertility treatment savings on a £4,000 diet .

"The producer of the new James Bond thriller Spectre denies that the script was changed to get incentives in Mexico. Earlier, it was reported that leaked emails indicated that Mexico made suggestions on the nationality of an actress and the villain, the villain's intended victim and some film shots. Implicitly, Mexico's incentives for the film were at stake, it said. Producer Michael G. Wilson said Wednesday: 'There is nothing in the script that we hadn't had before. The villain was always an Italian ... we already shot that in Rome.' Scroll down for video . Producer Michael G. Wilson and Bond girl Stephanie Sigman arrive for a photo call ahead of a press conference to discuss Sigman's role in the  upcoming 007 film Spectre in Mexico City . Asked about Mexico's purported insistence on a Mexican actress in a role known as Estrella, Wilson said, 'We always had a Mexican actress playing this part.' The film has cast Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman in the role. Officials in Mexico City have declined to comment on possible incentives offered on the movie, which is scheduled to begin its Mexico filming Thursday. Relying on emails leaked as part of the recent hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment, website Tax Analysts said that the target of the villain Sciarra should be an international leader rather than Mexico City's mayor and that a 'special police force' should appear in the film instead of Mexican police. The film has cast Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman as a character called Estrella . Actor Daniel Craig as 007 filming an action scene in Solden, Austria, for new bond film Spectre . Wilson confirmed there are incentives. 'Everywhere we go we have incentives,' he said at a news conference. 'Sometimes they're taxes; sometimes they're other kind of incentives. You can get cooperation, you can get things you would usually pay for for free and all that.' But it wasn't just incentives. Wilson confirmed that Mexico's 'Day of the Dead' traditions will be seen in the film, or at least a Bond version - 'where everything is sort of magnified.' Mexicans remember departed relatives and friends on the Day of the Dead at the beginning of November with orange flowers, candy skulls and other death-related decorations. 'The writers thought the day of the death would be an excellent background in the opening sequence, very colorful, very mysterious,' Wilson said. 'You can only do that in Mexico. There is no other place that offers that but Mexico.' Spectre sees Daniel Craig as 007 going up against a sinister organisation. The film is due out in October this year.

"The kosher supermarket in Paris which was targeted by terrorists has reopened two months after four hostages were killed as part of an Islamist plot. Amedy Coulibaly, who pledged allegiance to ISIS, slaughtered customers at the Hyper Cacher shop  in January as part of a coordinated attack on the French capital with the Charlie Hebdo gunmen. There were sombre scenes as the Jewish grocery reopened yesterday morning to 'show that life is stronger than barbarity'. Scroll down for video . Tributes remain: The kosher supermarket in Paris which was targeted by terrorists has reopened two months after four hostages were killed . Open for business: French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve (left of front row) is shown around the store . Shoppers were allowed into the Jewish grocery for the first time yesterday, two months after the siege . Members of the Jewish community gathered outside the Hyper Cacher supermarket before the reopening . With many of the store's staff still on leave because of shock, new manager Laurent Mimoun wore a black kippa as he opened the doors. He said: 'There we are, we are open again. 'We are thinking about all the victims, this has been the driver behind reopening the shop.' French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve was among the government officials present at the reopening, which took place under heavy police surveillance. 'It is important to pay respect to the memory of those who fell under the fire of barbarity,' Mr Cazeneuve said. 'This foodstore reopens bravely to show that life is stronger than everything. [The French government will] 'do everything so that all French people can live freely.'

"A giant redwood tree that was felled 125 years ago to satisfy a drunken bet is to be brought back to life on the Cornish coast. The tree  in Humboldt, California, became known as the Fieldwood Stump after being cut down in 1890 at the behest of a wealthy American living in Britain. For decades since tourists have visited the site, perching on what remains of it for photographs. Scroll down for video . The Fieldwood Stump in Humboldt, California, was felled in 1890, shortly before this photograph is believed to have been taken. Cuttings from the felled tree have since been planted in Cornwall . Cuttings of the tree have been planted at the Eden Project in Cornwall and are now growing in its nursery . But a group of scientists believe they may be able to recreate its former glory after planting cuttings of its wood in the Eden Project in Cornwall. At one time the tree, whose stump is 35ft in diameter, towered as high as a 30-storey building. It was felled in the late 19th Century on the orders of William Walford Astor who is said to have bet drinking mate he could source a 40-seat dining table from a single cross-section of a tree. A huge slice indeed arrived at Cliveden, his stately home in Buckinghamshire, but Lord Astor forbid peers from retelling the story. More than a century after meeting its end the tree will be rejuvenated by scientists in Cornwall as part of an adventurous project to clone American plants in Britain. 'We’re really excited about this, we’re going to plant a hundred trees to the north of the Eden site to form a living library. 'It feels really odd to hold these saplings and know that they might well be around for another 3000 years from now. 'The climate in Cornwall is not dissimilar from Oregon and northern California where these trees grow naturally so Eden offers absolutely perfect conditions for them. The tree is thought to have been felled at the request of Lord Astor after he made a drunken bet insisting that he could source a 40-seat dining table from one slice of cross-section . For decades tourists have visited the stump, posing for photographs in front of what remains of its base . The tree base has a diameter of 35ft and, at one time, is thought to have towered as high as a 30-storey building . Scientists began last year by collecting cuttings of trees around California. The cuttings were replanted in nurseries at the Eden Project in St Austell and have now grown to leg height. Planting cuttings rather than seeds is more likely to produce an exact clone of the original tree, with the shavings containing exactly the same DNA. The method of propagation is one championed by David Milarch, a former biker-gang member who founded the Archangel Ancient Tree Archive in a bid to save more of the planet's plants. Along with his sons Mr Milarch has concentrated on planting more sequoias and redwoods because of their ability to absorb carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas most commonly associated with climate change. 'This is the culmination of hopes, dreams, aspirations and a lot of hard work. These trees are a great green hope for the future. 'Near the end of their lives, coast redwoods put out basal sprouts in a circle around their trunk. 'This ‘fairy ring’ of clones ensures that even when the parent tree dies it’ll live on in a dozen or so sprouts. It will do that indefinitely so these trees will essentially live forever. This is an archive, a living library of genetics that can be utilised not just for our generation, but for hundreds of generations into the future to rebuild and replace what we’ve damaged.' Ten clone saplings have been planted at the Eden Project in Cornwall (file image above) with cuttings taken from the tree . David Milarch, co-founder of the Archangel Ancient Tree Archive, has been cloning redwoods for years .

"Police investigating Jill Dando's murder failed to act on death threats made to her TV colleague just weeks before the Crimewatch star was murdered. BBC host Alice Beer has revealed she was targeted by the same person who threatened to rape and kidnap her and Miss Dando in letters sent to the corporation. The letters were passed on to police but the presenter said that officers never spoke to her about them - even after Miss Dando was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, west London, in April 1999.

"Murdered: The body of Rosemary Broadwell was discovered  six months after she went missing near her home in Alicante . A British pensioner has been arrested in Spain on suspicion of murdering his expat partner after her decomposing body was found. Charlie Bevill-Warcup, 75, was arrested after Rosemary Broadwell's body was discovered on rubbish-strewn waste ground six months after she went missing. The pensioner was arrested by detectives from the paramilitary Civil Guard. He was interviewed by police soon after mum-of-two Rosemary, 76, from Hull, vanished on September 15 last year from her home in Algorfa, a small mountain village near the holiday resort of Alicante. Police suspected from the start that Rosemary's disappearance had not been voluntary after neighbours told them they had heard a row the night before she was reported missing. Authorities searched mountains, lakes and dirt tracks over a vast area in the search for her. Bevill-Warcup had previously told detectives he had dropped her off outside a bank so she could withdraw money - but staff at the bank told police she had never entered the branch. Rosemary's daughter Cheryl Webster, who is currently out in Spain, said today: 'I'm obviously devastated. 'I've been travelling out to Spain every six weeks since my mum disappeared. 'I wasn't expecting this on this visit. I got a call from the police last night to say that a man had been arrested and another call this morning to say my mum's body had been found. 'I haven't had confirmation my mum's partner is the one in custody but I've never liked him. 'My mum was living part-time with him but she was preparing to move out and spend more time at her own place and I had been helping her with the move.' Mrs Broadwell, who was just 4ft 8 inches tall, was well-known in the small town, where she had lived for around ten years. Police are understood to have identified her by a tattoo of a lizard on her foot and another of a dolphin on her right shoulder. A spokesman for the Civil Guard in Alicante said: 'I can confirm the body of a woman thought to be he British expat who went missing last September has been discovered.' Police said they would have to wait for the results of an autopsy to establish the cause of death. Discovery: Police made the grim discovery on rubbish-strewn waste ground near the town of Algorfa, a small mountain village near the popular holiday resort of Alicante . In an emotional Facebook post made last month, Rosemary's granddaughter Liza Webster said: 'I don't even know what to say anymore. 'It's been five months and still nothing on the disappearance of my grandma. I miss her terribly and not knowing is cruel. 'Someone somewhere must know something and it's defies all that I've been taught and known, to be so cruel. 'She's my Grandma, a rock and my ally.

"Jeremy Vine has been funnelling cash through a limited company, Jelly Vine Productions, of which his daughter, Martha, is a shareholder (both pictured) In a tongue-in-cheek guide to ‘tax accounting for the rich’, Jeremy Vine once advised the wealthy to find a ‘tax magician with the power to bend the rules, befuddle the tax inspector and make money invisible’. Now it seems that the BBC Radio 2 star has taken his own advice to heart. Mr Vine appears to have been using his ten-year-old daughter Martha to avoid tax payments. The presenter of the Jeremy Vine Show and the TV quiz Eggheads, has been funnelling cash through a limited company, Jelly Vine Productions, of which she is a shareholder. The controversial move will highlight the BBC’s practice of paying some presenters off its books using money from the millions of pounds it earns in licence fee-payers’ money. In 2012, it emerged that more than 140 BBC stars were funnelling cash through private firms to avoid paying millions in tax. During the resulting furore, Mr Vine ran a spoof, ‘Jeremy’s six-step guide to tax avoidance for the rich’, on his radio show. Jelly Vine Productions had almost £810,000 in cash on its books in 2013 – the last accounts available, and £1million in 2012. If the funds had been paid to Mr Vine through the Pay As You Earn scheme used by most firms, it would have been taxed at 40 or 45 per cent. But by channelling them through a private firm, he can declare them as company profits, subject to corporation tax of 23 or 24 per cent. It is not clear whether these were earnings for Mr Vine’s BBC work or included other fees such as payments for speeches or book royalties. But by arranging his finances in this way, he ensured Jelly Vine Productions could pay dividends to its shareholders. The firm is controlled by Mr Vine, who has 51 per cent of the shares. His wife, Rachel, has 30 per cent and the remaining 19 per cent is owned by Martha, one of their two daughters. Richard Murphy, an accountant at Tax Research, said: ‘He is obviously using the company to reduce his tax bill. It is perfectly legal, and perfectly allowed. Jelly Vine Productions had almost £810,000 in cash on its books in 2013 – the last accounts available . 'What is a little unusual is his daughter. Let’s be honest, she is unlikely to have said, “Daddy, I want to spend my pocket money on shares in the company”.’ Jelly Vine Productions’ accounts do not disclose how much it has paid out or whether it has paid dividends to all three family members, or just Mr Vine himself. Mr Murphy said Mr Vine could have named his daughter as a shareholder for ‘long-term tax-planning’ purposes, reducing the tax she would pay if she inherits part of the business. Alternatively, Mr Vine may have made his wife and daughter shareholders to split the dividend payouts, keeping them just small enough to ensure they are taxed at a lower rate, rather than at 40 or 45 per cent. A spokesman for the presenter said the reason for making his daughter a shareholder was ‘private’ but ‘perfectly legal’, adding: ‘I don’t think it is cynical. What Jeremy is doing is very common. If the Government makes laws that allow people to do things that are advantageous, it is up to the Government to change the laws.’ BBC contracts stipulate that presenters must pay the taxes they owe, and tells HMRC who it has paid each year. A spokesman said it would not comment on Mr Vine’s arrangements, adding: ‘It is the responsibility of self-employed individuals to ensure they are paying the correct amount of tax.’","BBC's Jeremy Vine appears to have used daughter to avoid tax payments .

"Indiana is set to declare a public health emergency to county an alarming increase in the rate of HIV infections. Governor Mike Pence said Wednesday he's mulling a needle exchange and other programs aimed at curbing the rise in infection rates that has been tied to intravenous drug use in southern Indiana. HIV cases have ballooned in the state recently, with 72 cases confirmed and 7 others that preliminary tests say are positive, all coming out of Scott County. Scroll down for video . Drastic measures: Governor Mike Pence said Wednesday he's mulling a needle exchange and other programs aimed at curbing the rise in infection rates that has been tied to intravenous drug use in southern Indiana . Pence says he will be issuing an executive order Thursday morning to tackle the growing issue, and says although he opposes needle exchanges, that option is on the table. A CDC report in 2005 on syringe exchange programs found those types of interventions were cost-effective ways of preventing blood-borne infections like HIV. 'The cost [of preventing one] HIV infection by SEPs has been calculated at $4,000 to $12,000, considerably less than the estimated $190,000 medical costs of treating a person infected with HIV,' the report stated, with dollars calculated in their 1997 values. Needle-exchange programs allow intravenous drug users to bring in used needles in exchange for clean syringes, which is believed to suppress transmission of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. Those exchanges are barred by the state of Indiana, though a bill up for debate in the legislature would allow them under a temporary provision. Dr William Cooke, who runs a clinic in Austin, says his town has borne the brunt of growing intravenous drug use, seeing Hepatitis-C cases be replaced by bigger issues. Mulling it over: Governor Scott Pence appeared in Scottsburg, the county seat, to meet with local officials Wednesday about the crisis, and plans to institute new policies to combat a public health emergency . State response: Indiana State Health Commissioner Dr Jerome Adams said that an awareness campaign has been launched, along with mobile teams sent into the area . 'We've seen an increase in overdoses,' Cooke told NBC. 'We've identified that most of our IV drug users are Hepatitis-C positive. We knew it was a only matter of time until HIV set in.' 'We need help. But that costs money. My clinic serves the poorest people in Indiana, potentially the poorest in the country,' Cooke said. 'We do a sliding scale here. If they can, they may pay us 10 dollars for care. I'm hopeful this declaration provides the funding we have needed.' 'It's overwhelming how much pain and suffering is going on here. We can provide a basic level of primary care. But some people can't even afford 10 dollars.' Pence appeared in Scottsburg, the county seat, to meet with local officials Wednesday about the crisis. 'This is a public health emergency and I'm listening to my health department, I'm listening to the Centers for Disease Control,' Pence said after the meeting. 'I'll make my decision based on the best science and the best way we can stop this virus and stop this outbreak in its tracks,' he added. In the last month, Indiana has gone from 26 confirmed HIV cases, when officials first announced the outbreak, to 72 now. Intravenous drug led to infection in almost all cases, according to state epidemiologist Pam Pontones. Still, the number of HIV cases is estimated to rise in the coming weeks. Indiana officials know of up to 100 people that may be connected to those with confirmed cases and are trying to contact them. Indiana is running an awareness campaign through billboards and social media aimed at warning residents about the outbreak exploding in south Indiana. Dr Jerome Adams, the state health commissioner, said a mobile health unit is being sent with= resources that the state hopes will aid in the outbreak. Pontones said staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who arrived in the area Monday, agreed with state officials that the outbreak 'is an indicator of a larger problem' of drug use driven by poverty. 'With the amount of drug use that's happening and the intravenous needle-sharing that's going on, if someone who's highly infectious becomes part of that sharing network, that infection can transmit very rapidly,' Pontones said. She said the vast majority of the people who've become infected during the outbreak shared a syringe with someone else while injecting a liquid form of the prescription painkiller Opana. Republican Representative Ed Clere of New Albany, who proposed the needle distribution and collection program Wednesday at the Statehouse, said a House panel considered similar legislation last year, but it didn't receive a hearing in the Senate. 'Unfortunately we're back here, not just with needle exchange as a hypothetical theory, but with a real situation where a needle exchange (program) could make a difference,' he said.","Almost all 80 cases confirmed or believed to be positive have come out of Scott County in the south of the state .
The town of Austin has been hard hit, and a local clinic says poor residents are unable to pay for treatment .
Needle exchanges, where intravenous drug users can trade used syringes for clean ones, are believed to be useful in combating the spread of HIV .

"Families face a raft of price hikes from this week on everything from the cost of a bath to prescription medicines. Advice organisations fear consumers could be lulled into a ‘false sense of security’ by the current Consumer Price Index ‘zero’ measure of inflation and fail to budget for the coming rises. Increases are due in council tax, water bills, vehicle exise duty, NHS charges, stamps and even Sky television packages. Families face a raft of price hikes from this week, with increases due in council tax, water bills, vehicle exise duty, NHS charges, stamps and even Sky television packages (picture posed by model) Inflation is currently 0 per cent and is predicted to show a minus figure for March and April. The collapse in the cost of oil and petrol in the past year by around 50 per cent has had a dramatic impact on living standards - with Prime Minister David Cameron saying it has given families an extra £20 per week - while a supermarket price war has delivered savings on food. But many people have reason to dread the rising bills that will be arriving on their doormats and email inboxes over the coming weeks, many of which are being hiked by government departments and agencies. Hannah Maundrell,  editor in chief of advice website money.co.uk, said: ‘Whilst we can’t ignore the fact that some of our living costs are going down, such as food and mortgage rates, others are still going up. ‘It really worries me that so much talk of 0 per cent inflation will make consumers sit on their hands in the false sense of security that prices for everything will remain static. ‘Regardless of the economic terminology, consumers still need to save money wherever they can to accommodate rising costs in some areas of their finances.’ The average council tax bill for a Band D property will go up by £16 a year to £1,484 from tomorrow, yet local authorities are still warning of massive cuts to services. Funding for arts, museums and libraries is on the chopping block, while support for home care for the elderly is also being squeezed. The NHS dental charge payable for a band one course of treatment, something like a filling, will increase by 30p from £18.50 to £18.80 (picture posed by models) For those who live in particularly valuable homes, new property taxes could be a sign of things to come with Labour and the Lib Dems going into the General Election with proposals to hit owners of expensive homes. The Lib Dems want a new annual ‘mansion tax’ on homes worth more than £2million, while Labour has proposed something similar in a policy that has angered some within the party, ranging from Lord Mandelson to MP Diane Abbott. Labour London MPs are angry at the prospect of money being raised from families in the South East through the new property tax to subsidise services, such as the NHS, in Scotland. Water bills will go up by an average of £5 a year to £401 for the average household from tomorrow as privatised firms continue to soak customers while paying millions to their, mostly foreign, shareholders. Also going up tomorrow is car tax, with Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) set to increase by up to £10 for some categories of vehicles, particularly larger cars with big engines and higher carbon emissions. For example, the first year VED rate for a band L car, such as an Audi Q7 or BMW X5, will go up from £860 to £870. In health, people who need regular prescriptions will see the charge rise from £8.08 to £8.20, which is just under two per cent. At the same time, the cost of going to see the dentist for NHS care - if you can find one – is also on the rise. The NHS dental charge payable for a band one course of treatment, something like a filling, will increase by 30p from £18.50 to £18.80. Band 2 treatment goes up by 80p to £51.30 and band 3 by £3.50 to £222.50. Despite the price rises, many dentists claim the NHS fees fail to ensure they are able to make a decent living, with patients being pushed towards more expensive private care as a result. Yesterday, the cost of a simple first class stamp went up by a penny to 64p and second class rose by 1p to 54p. For larger items, the price of a large letter first class stamp up to 100g rose by 2p to 95p and the price of a large letter second class stamp up to 100g increased by 1p to 74p. And this is not the end of the pain. Sky recently announced a series of price rises, apparently to fund its multi-billion pound bill to buy the rights to Premier League football matches. From June, its popular family bundle, which does not even include the media giant’s sport channels, will rise by rise by £3 a month to £36 - £432 a year.","Price hikes are due on council tax, water, NHS charges, stamps and Sky TV .

"Educator: Los Angeles teacher Thelmo Garcia, 37, is accused of placing a plastic over the head of a 10-year-old female student in class last month . A Los Angeles elementary school teacher was arrested this week after police say he placed a plastic bag over the head of a 10-year-old student. Thelmo Garcia, 37, a fourth-grade teacher at Rosewood Elementary School, pleaded not guilty to one count of child abuse Friday, two days after he was taken into custody in connection to the February 5 incident. According to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, the educator placed a bag over the head of a girl in his class 'for several seconds' during school hours. The child reportedly did not pass out after the stunt, according to CBS Los Angeles. Investigators would not say whether Garcia was disciplining the girl, or just joking with her, as he's been known to do with other students. Garcia has been with the Los Angeles Unified School District since 1999 and taught fourth grade at Rosewood since 2010. The 37-year-old man was ordered held on $100,000 bail. If convicted, he could face up to six years in prison. The school has suspended Garcia with pay pending an investigation. Scroll down for video . Place of learning: The alleged incident took place at Rosewood Elementry School, where Garcia has taught fourth grade since 2010 . The 37-year-old pleaded not guilty and was ordered held on $100,000 bail . ‘We take these allegations very seriously,’ Ellen Morgan, of the Los Angeles Unified School District, said in a statement. ‘The district is fully cooperating with the LAPD investigation.’ Some parents and students at the LA school were stunned to learn of the allegations against Garcia, who was described as a caring and playful teacher. According to CBS, Garcia had no history of infractions over the course of his teaching career.","Thelmo Garcia, 37, pleaded not guilty Friday to one count of child abuse .

"Armed with a sharp sense of smell, dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers, and soon there could be sniffer elephants too. Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. Researchers have found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. A stock image is shown . The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. On a game reserve co-owned by Sean Hensman, three elephants passed the smell tests. Sniffing at buckets, they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of TNT by raising a front leg. ‘They work it out very, very quickly,’ he said. Stephen Lee, head scientist at the US Army Research Office, which backed the study financially, said that elephants remember their training longer than dogs. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. This image shows an a warning sign in an area littered with explosives . Last summer, researchers confirmed that African elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom. Scientists from the University of Tokyo said elephants have the largest number of genes dedicated to smell of any mammal. They have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent - twice as many as dogs and five times as many as humans. Previous studies have shown that the animals have well-developed olfactory systems that include large olfactory bulbs and areas in the brain. They seem to be able to distinguish between two Kenyan ethnic groups—the Maasai, who spear elephants to demonstrate strength, and the Kamba, who pose little threat to the animals. The ability of elephants to detect explosives was first noticed in Angola - a country that many elephants had returned to after a 2002 peace deal ended a protracted war. While there was peace, the land remained sown with mine fields. Some elephants seemed to intentionally avoid them, though it might not have been a scent that kept them away - they could instead have associated those areas with danger because elephants had died there in the past. Researchers decided to investigate and in Bela-Bela, a town north of the South African capital of Pretoria, elephants named Shan, Mussina and Chishuru were administered smelling tests. The elephants detected TNT samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets, according to Ashadee Kay Miller, a zoology student at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. They only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive, which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper. In an experiment conducted at a game reserve, elephants (stock image) sniffed at buckets some of which contained TNT. They were rewarded with a treat of marula - a fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of TNT by raising a front leg. The creatures have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom . All other buckets were filled with acetone and filter paper only. In a second set of tests, the elephants scored 100 percent, detecting TNT in 23 out of 23 buckets when ‘distractor odours’ such as tea, bleach, soap and gasoline were placed in the other buckets, she said. However, in the real world, making an elephant walk around a mine field would not only put the animal in danger, but would be impractical too. To overcome this problem, unmanned drones could collect scent samples from mined areas and bring them to a trained elephant, which would smell them and alert handlers to any sign of explosives, Mr Hensman said. The elephants detected TNT samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered its odour in a line of buckets, and could be used to sniff out landmines from a distance. Here, a member of Thailand's First Humanitarian Mine Action Unit uses a mine detecting dog to search for land mines . Another possibility would be to replicate an elephant’s sense of smell and incorporate it into electronic sensors that detect dangerous materials, building on research with dogs and rats, Mr Lee said. He revealed that researchers are thinking of designing a sensor based on an elephant trunk, which puffs out air to stir up an area, and then sucks in air to smell. Florida International University participated in the initial research, and it was done on a ‘shoestring’ budget with volunteers. The findings of the experiment did not surprise George Wittemyer, an assistant professor at Colorado State University, who was not involved in the study. Research last year revealed that elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom, partially because they have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent. ‘Their world is primarily olfactory,’ he Professor Wittemyer said. ‘The sensitivity is recognised as being unparalleled.’ The experiment comes as elephant populations across Africa are threatened. Poachers across the continent have annually killed tens of thousands of elephants for their tusks in recent years because of a surge in demand for ivory in Asia, primarily China. Mine-detecting rats: Giant African pouched rats are being used in Africa to locate landmines and help diagnose tuberculosis thanks to their acute sense of smell. Some of the creatures are trained by the charity Apopo and are used to detect explosives in Tanzania and Mozambique, which has many unexploded mines after decades of civil war. Giant African pouched rats are being used in Africa to locate landmines and help diagnose tuberculosis thanks to their acute sense of smell (pictured) Bomble bees: In 2013, a team of scientists trained bees to sniff out explosives. The idea at the time was to house them in a hand detector, which could be used to sense a chemical in airports, for example. The bees were trained by exposing them to the scent that was detected while dangling a sugary drink in front of them. The insects, which stick out their tongues to get the sweet treat, quickly learned to associate the smell of the explosive or chemical with food. A trial was run at Heathrow Airport. 'Sniffer bees' have also been reared to detect landmines in the Balkans. The bees, which French and Croatian biologists say have an olfactory sense as good as dogs, will search out mines left by soldiers in the 1990s. Nearly 120,000 of the unexploded devices remain in more than 9,400 carefully marked minefields.","Research was conducted in South Africa and involved the US military .

"An angry mother claims her daughter found a broken security tag lying inside her morning cereals. Deena Jackson said six-year-old Beau had cut her finger on the jagged metal tag as she went to open the box of Shredded Wheat at their home. The 34-year-old, who bought the Nestle cereals from Asda in West Bridgford, Nottingham, said it posed a major choking hazard to her daughter who had initially believed it was a free toy. Deena Jackson said her six-year-old daughter Beau had cut her finger on the jagged metal tag as she went to open the box of Shredded Wheat . Both Asda and Nestle have refused to take responsibility for the dangerous blunder. Mrs Jackson, who lives in Gedling, Nottingham, with Beau, eight-year-old D'Arcy and her husband Alex, 45, said: 'Both my daughters thought it was a toy as it's got moving parts and could swivel. 'The end of the tag is really sharp like a pin, but it's got a sharp broken wire at the other end too. 'Kids thinking it's a toy are going to be spinning it round and they could get hurt. 'Neither Asda or Nestle are owning up to it, that's what annoys me.' The full-time mother said she had called Nestle over concerns that such a sharp piece of metal could get past their quality tests. The 34-year-old said it posed a major choking hazard to her daughter who had initially believed it was a free toy . 'I just wondered how on earth it had got in there,' she added. 'I phoned them to express my concerns, but all they seemed to want was the box sent to them, and to reimburse me for the postage and have it forgotten about. 'I refused that initially as I thought it was too dangerous an item to just forget about it and brush it under the carpet. 'It just makes you wonder whether products are being checked thoroughly, especially for things that could be a choking hazard to children.' But Nestle hit back, passing the blame back to Asda. A spokesman said the find was 'a security tag that retailers use on high value products.' He added that all Nestle products had to pass through two sets of metal detectors and a security tag would have triggered 'massive alarm bells'. The security tag, which was broken and sharp like a pin on one side, while the other had a jagged broken wire . 'Our packing technology is highly automated and we have strict procedures in place including metal detection on the sealed products. 'We are confident that it did not leave out site with that tag in there.' Nestle are now planning to launch an investigation liaising with the retailer. However, Asda claimed that the tag had been found in a sealed box and therefore could only have been added in the manufacturing or packing process. A spokesperson for the supermarket, where the cereal was purchased, said: 'We're at a loss to understand how this happened, as all products are packed and sealed at the manufacturers' 'We're happy to assist Nestle with their investigation.'","Deena Jackson's daughter Beau found the sharp broken tag in her cereals .

"This is the first picture of a six-year-old boy whose hand was savagely hacked off by hired assassins who collect albino body parts for witchdoctors to turn into charms and potions for their rich clients. Baraka Cosmas was attacked on Saturday evening by a group of men, who stormed into the home he shared with his parents in western Tanzania. The young boy was held down while the gang chopped off his right hand, before beating him and his mother Prisca Shaaban so badly both have been hospitalised. Scroll down for video . Savage attack: A group of men hacked off six-year-old Baraka Cosmas' right hand on Saturday night . Trade: He is the latest in a long line of albino victims in Tanzania, targeted because their skin is thought to have magical properties which can bring luck and wealth - something people are willing to pay high prices for . Shockingly, Baraka was the third child to be attacked because of the colour of his skin in just over three months. Eighteen-month-old Yohana Bahati was snatched from his home less than a month ago, while four-year-old Pendo Emmanuelle Nandi was taken at the end of December. Yohana's mutilated body was found a few days later, while Pendo has never been seen again. All three cases are linked to a trade in albino body parts, fuelled by the high prices they fetch and a belief in the 'magical' properties of the skin and limbs, said to bring wealth and luck. The men who viciously attacked Baraka at the weekend are likely to have been little more than petty criminals at worst, carrying out the bidding of a witchdoctor. The witchdoctor will have paid a significant amount for the limb - but who paid the witchdoctor is likely to remain unclear. Jonathan Beale, managing director of Standing Voice, a charity working to protect Tanzania's albinos, says until these people are rooted out, government efforts to curb the attacks and killings are likely to have little impact. 'This most recent tragic attack serves to remind us that current responses from the government, police force and justice system are not sufficient and do not target the heart of this crisis,' he told MailOnline. Hidden: Many children are now kept in special schools, away from their families and behind protective walls . Children are being snatched from their beds as gangs of men roam southern Malawi hunting as demand for albino body parts fuels a surge in attacks and murders leaving people in fear of their lives, the U.N. has said. The country, which borders Tanzania in the west, has seen a horrific rise in the numbers attacked or killed since January. Already, there have been six attacks in 2015 - compared to just four over the previous two years. Victims have ranged from a year old, to 68, with children being snatched from their beds as they sleep. And just as in Tanzania, it seems the high value of the limbs is driving the trade. An uncle, among three men facing charges in Malawi for the . kidnapping of an 11-year-old Malawian girl in January, revealed he had been offered $6,500 for her body. It equates to 2,778,425 kwacha - a fortune in a country where the minimum wage is 551 a day. The recent surge in attacks has pushed the U.N. to speak out on the issue. 'These attacks are often stunningly vicious, with children . in particular being targeted,' said Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the U.N.'s High Commissioner for . Human Rights. 'Many people with albinism are living in abject fear.' The U.N. called on regional governments to ensure the . criminals behind the attacks are prosecuted. 'They are maybe not doing enough to stop it,' the U.N.'s . human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said. 'This is an incredibly vulnerable population in these . countries. 'And when you hear these kind of details of gangs of . men roaming around, literally hunting down people with albinism . simply to make money by cutting off their limbs and killing . them, you must question whether enough is being done.' 'Sadly what we see from the government are measures which react to this crisis in a surface level fashion. 'We call for a criminal investigation beyond the hired assailant or witchdoctor, and the gathering of thorough evidence on those involved at higher levels of this absurd trade.' So far, while few kdinappers and witchdoctors have ever been successfully tried for their role in the incidents, not one buyer has ever been prosecuted for their part in the albino trade. However, the government has announced a ban on witchdoctors - and last week, it was announced 32 had been arrested in the Geita region, the same area where Yohana was killed last month. 'The witch doctors were arrested in possession of different items, including potions and oil from an unknown source,' police cheif Joseph Konyo told reporters - but didn't say whether they had been charged. But Mr Beale warned targeting all witchdoctors may mean attention is diverted from the real killers. He said: 'We do hope that the government declaration to ban all witchdoctors in the country does not distort the judicial task at hand by indicting individuals practising traditional rituals who may be entirely innocent, yet by default are to be considered killers. 'Even more dangerous is the idea that this could create a smokescreen of impunity for those who actually fuel the trade by approaching witchdoctors with their demands.' But the Tanzanian government does seem to addressing the problem - described by President Jakaya Kikwete as a 'shame' on the nation. At the same time as the arrests were announced,  a court sentenced four men  to death for their part in the 2008 murder of 22-year-old Zawadi Mangidu. She had died after her legs and right hand were hacked off with an axe and machete after being attacked while eating dinner in her village - also in Geita, north-west Tanzania. Among the condemned was the young woman's husband, Charles Nassoro. Convictions: Four men were sentenced to death last week for their part in the murder of 22-year-old Zawadi Mangidu, which came as the Tanzanian government began a crackdown on the shocking trade . Feul: But sentencing the men to death will not stop wealthy buyers approaching witchdoctors to make the potions - and offering huge amounts of money to collect the limbs of Tanzania's albinos . And Nassaro is far from the only family member to be implicated in the attacks and murders of Tanzania's albinos. In each of the three most recent cases, a close family member has been arrested. Both Baraka and Yohana's fathers were among the accused, while Pendo's uncle has been implicated. These four cases perhaps point to how strong the lure of the money offered is - and, by default, to the wealth of those purchasing the potions and charms. It is further support for Mr Beale's calls for those at the top of the ladder to be targeted. 'What is required are intelligent strategies which target the source of these crimes,' he said. 'The sad reality is that, in one of the poorest countries in the world, for years to come there will always be poor individuals who will commit these atrocities for money. 'As much as we commend the government on its efforts, until the law enforcing authorities look beyond the obvious we are putting plasters on a wound here.'","Baraka Cosmas was attacked at his family home by a gang on Saturday .

"Move over Kim Kardashian - the ideal female body shape is leggy, tall and thin like Taylor Swift, not short and busty with a big bottom like the US reality TV star, claim scientists. A major study involving almost 60,000 volunteers rating almost 1,000 variations of the female figure discovered tall and slender is more attractive than curvy and hourglass-shaped. It is a result which contradicts the views of millions attracted over the decades to the more voluptuous pin ups from Marilyn Monroe to Page Three Girls. Scroll down for video . New research has shown that Taylor Swift has the most desirable body shape for both men and women, whereas curvier bodies like Kim Kardashian's are not as popular . But according to Australian university researchers, modern men - and women too - see the ideal as taller in height and longer in leg rather than bigger in bum and bust. A complex series of visual tests were conducted by researchers from the University of New South Wales in Sydney for the specialist journal Evolution and Human Behaviour. They created computerised images of different female body shapes based on 24 basic factors from bust and bottom size to length of legs and waist circumference. A first 'generation' of 120 of these were rated by volunteers from all over the world responding to a social media campaign asking for help. The 60 body shapes with the lowest ratings were eliminated. Each of the remaining 60 were then taken and a slight variation of each was added to create another 120 shapes. Taylor Swift is known for showing off her long limbs in short dresses whilst performing on stage . Again, they were rated by volunteers and the bottom 60 eliminated and the process was repeated for eight 'generations' - a total of 960 different shapes and sizes of female body. What the researchers found was that in every generation, the 60 lowest rated body shapes were generally the fattest, shortest and roundest of the computerised figures. By the end of the eighth generation, the highest rated female form was tall with a small waist and long, slender legs, a smaller bottom and smaller bust said the researchers. Overall, nearly 60,000 volunteers took part in the ratings of whom 80 per cent were men and from all over the world. The report admitted that an ideal female body shape was still very much a matter of opinion - athletic men like athletic women, for instance, and different cultures had different tastes. The researchers identified 24 female 'body traits' most commonly found on a sample of 273 women from government census-style data. This included the obvious like bust size and shape and even 'volume', length of legs, waist size but also the slope of the shoulders, circumference of lower legs and girth of biceps. It also looked at 'seat prominence' - in others words, a big bottom - and overall height and shape of torso. They created 20 composite female figures incorporating different traits so they all looked very different from each other. But each of these 20 then had five 'daughters' - that is, five versions of each but with very subtle changes to some of the body traits, so a total of 120 figures were created. Volunteers were shown side and front on profiles of these women but the faces were pixilated in order for them to be rated purely on body shape and physical features. The top 60 for ratings were taken to the next stage and each of these had two different versions, one slightly bigger different from the other creating another 120 figures. Again, the top 60 went on, made into two version of each female shape and the 120 rated by another set of volunteers and so on for eight 'generations' each one eliminating the most unpopular figures. As each generation progressed, the favoured shape evolved into a taller, slimmer female figure with long, slender legs and a thin waist. These were then rated by volunteers from all over the world who answered a social media and other adverts to take part. Overall, 59,268 took part of whom 80 per cent were male. Walking through LA Kim showed off her curvier figure, the new research claims to provide some of the most extensive research on female body shapes . But overall it suggests tall and thin is preferred to short and curvy. It said: 'No study of a subject as complex as body shape attractiveness can provide all the answers.' But it said the study 'provides the most comprehensive and detailed insight yet into which traits constitute the actual targets of selection. 'The predominant evolutionary trend, reflecting a likely major dimension of social selection operating on human female bodies, is toward greater slenderness and, particularly, narrower waists.' The selection process in the research 'removed those physiques that appeared most overweight, and throughout the experiment we found evidence for strong directional selection on the waist, which was accompanied by lengthening of the legs and a reduction in seat girth, resulting in taller and more slender physiques.'","Scientists claim Taylor Swift has the most desired body shape .

Police in Canada say the three planned to go on a shooting rampage at Halifax Shopping Center in Nova Scotia - before committing suicide. Souvannarath and Shepherd were also charged with conspiracy to commit arson, possession of weapons for a dangerous purpose and uttering threats via social media. They were both arrested at Halifax Stanfield International Airport after Souvannarath disembarked her flight from Chicago. Both defendants were stony faced and passive during their court appearance and neither spoke. Judge Brian Gibson told the court to reconvene on April 10 and heard that the pair have not applied for bail.

Impassive: Police say they foiled the alleged plot by three suspects to mark Valentine's Day by killing as many people as possible at the Halifax Shopping Center in Nova Scotia - and then committing suicide . Last month, tutors who taught Columbine-obsessed goth, Souvannarath, said she was a disturbed but talented writer. Souvannarath, 23, from Geneva, Illinois was arrested alongside Randall Steven Shepherd, 20, from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. College Professor Charles Aukema said: 'She knew how to put together a sentence and she had a command of detail. Sometimes, it was pretty sick detail.' According to the Chicago Tribune, Prof Aukema had Souvannarath as a student in 2012. Commenting on her writing style, Prof Aukema said: 'It's like a method actor trying to get into the mindset of a killer and then becomes a serial killer. I thought she was quite an introvert. It just seemed like she had no friends whatsoever.' Lindsay Kanittha Souvannarath was charged last month with conspiracy to commit murder. She made a brief court appearance on Friday . Back to jail: Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath leaves at court after a judge informed her and her alleged co-conspirator that their preliminary hearing was next month . No bail: Randall Steven Shepherd leaves court in Halifax on Friday amid tight security after his court appearance on Friday following his arrest on February 13 . Souvannarath admitted the massacre plot after her arrest at Halifax airport. A third suspect is believed to have shot himself after police surrounded his home in the Halifax suburb of Timberlea. It is understood that Souvannarath, Shepherd, and the third man, James Gamble had discussed their plans on the internet. Canadian media said that Gamble, 19, took his own life. Justice Minister Peter MacKay said: 'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devestating. Mass casualties would have been a real possibility. 'This appeared to be a group of murderous misfits that were coming here, or living here, and were planning to wreak havoc and mayhem in our community.' Brian Brennan of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said three long-barrelled rifles had been recovered from Gamble's house. Lindsay Souvannarath, pictured, from Illinois was allegedly planning a massacre with two online Canadian friends . Souvannarath's writing is understood to be very disturbing and features stories about serial killers . Souvannarath posted about her admiration of Hitler, the Columbine killers and other murderers on her Facebook page, Tumblr site and forums, and even hinted at the deadly plan, writing last Wednesday: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down.' Two days after the post, she was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder after police received a tip. Randall Shepherd, 20, of Nova Scotia was arrested on the same charges. A third suspect, James Gamble, 19 killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his home in Nova Scotia, and a fourth - a 17-year-old boy - has been released from custody. Online profiles show the named suspects had been exchanging unnerving messages for years. The dark messages come in stark contrast to Souvannarath's high school yearbook photo shared by the Kane County Chronicle, which shows a pretty teen. She went on to study at Coe College, where she studied English and creative writing before graduating last year. But online, Souvannarath, whose father is from Laos, painted herself as a neo-Nazi and regularly shared photos of Hitler while lauding white separatists, such as former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Randal Steven Shepherd, pictured, went to the airport to collect Souvanarath who flew up from Illinois . 'Free speech is dead,' she apparently wrote in one forum in 2007, when she would have been just 15. 'That's why we need people like David Duke to bring it to life again.' Her Tumblr account is entitled 'c**kswastika', according to the Chronicle Herald. On the page, she displays a large pink swastika and links to James Gamble's Tumblr page, which shows images of Hitler, dead bodies and murders, and videos of the Columbine shooters. Gamble's page also features conversations that include graphic sexual descriptions as well as naked images of himself. 'I'm such a morbid f***ing freak,' he writes in one post. 'I love it.' Her Tumblr page also features images of the Columbine shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, including photos of their dead bodies, . Canadian police said they found three long-barrelled rifles at the home of James Gamble, pictured . James Gamble, pictured, is believed to have shot himself after his house was surrounded by police on Friday . 'Eric and Dylan are dead, but Reb and VoDKa live,' she wrote, apparently referring to Gamble. In one post from February 11, she shared a movie poster showing two ghoulish figures with the words: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down' - perhaps hinting at their alleged plan for February 14. Beneath the poster she added: 'It's almost here. The clock is ticking.' She also shared quotes from murderers and photos of weapons. One picture shows a man holding a gun and wearing a t-shirt that reads: 'Natural selection.' Another post on her blog reads 'Saturday the 14th' in red, dripping letters with the comment: 'Ha Haa' written beneath. Her website is still showing new updates. Police said that she had pre-programmed online messages before she was due to carry out the attacks and ultimately kill herself.","Lindsay Kanittha Souvannarath and Randall Steven Shepherd made very brief appearance in Halifax court on Friday .

"A young mother claims she was told by doctors to Google her life-threatening condition after she spotted it mentioned on a doctor's note. Roxanne Stacey was in hospital after having a cyst removed from her ovary. The 24-year-old believed the operation would end the pain, vomiting and exhaustion she had been experiencing for weeks. But as she prepared to leave hospital, she accidentally picked up a handover note meant for other nurses, thinking it was for her. Reading the note when she got home, the mother-of-one spotted the words 'Wilkes syndrome' written in brackets beside details of her cyst removal. Roxanne Stacey, 24, claims she only discovered she had life-threatening illness because she spotted it on a doctor's note - and was then told to 'go home and Google it' herself . Ms Stacey says doctors told her to research her rare illness Wilkes syndrome online after an X-ray confirmed she had the digestive disorder which causes a person to be unable to keep food down. As a result of the illness, she lost seven stone . She called her mother, who researched the condition online, and was horrified to learn it was rare and life-threatening. In those diagnosed with Wilkes syndrome, a major blood vessel in the digestive system lies on top of the small intestine, instead of behind it. It means patients feel full quicker and struggle to keep any food down. If left untreated, it can prove fatal. Concerned, Miss Stacey took the nurse's note to her GP, who Googled the condition in front of her. She claims, he said: 'There's no way you can have this syndrome, you'd be dead by now.' Miss Stacey, from Greenhithe, in Kent, said: 'I felt reassured but the symptoms persisted and I was losing weight by the day.' She was prescribed medication to ease the pain and went for follow-up visits at Darent Valley Hospital. It was an X-ray, taken in January this year, that confirmed Miss Stacey's diagnosis of Wilkes syndrome. After specialists confirmed the illness,  Miss Stacey claims they told her to research the condition on Google. She said: 'To add insult to injury, I was given the diagnosis and told to research it on Google.' Having been unable to digest food properly as a result of the syndrome, Miss Stacey's weight has plummeted to half what it was. Miss Stacey said she was left so weak she was unable to hold her 16-month-old son Freddie, left . 'I look anorexic,' she said. 'I used to be 14 stone and was healthy, and happy. Now I'm 7st 6lbs and I'm too weak for surgery. 'I'm angry that I was left in pain to get on with it when the diagnosis was known in November. 'I'm too weak to hold my 16-month-old son Freddie. 'My partner Alex is taking unpaid leave from his job to help look after him.' Darent Valley Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, referred Miss Stacey to a specialist last month and she said she is now receiving excellent care. She was admitted to Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, in London, on March 8 so she can regain some strength and weight before having a life-saving operation. A Darent Valley Hospital spokesman said: 'We are concerned to hear about Miss Stacey's experience however we have not received a complaint. 'Without being given the opportunity to look into the circumstances around her care, we are not able to respond to her particular concerns. 'If she would like to contact us, we will investigate and answer any questions she may have.'","Roxanne Stacey had an operation to remove a cyst on her ovary .

"Heavy rains can be drastic  for rural farmers, damaging produce and in some cases even threatening their survival. But one West Australian farmer decided to see the lighter side of a torrent of rainwater that fell on his property on Sunday. Jordan Lynch, who owns a grain farm four kilometres east of Merredin, readied a surfboard, skiis and camera in an opportunistic bid to go 'skurfing' - a hybrid of surfing and water skiing-on the freshly formed lake, reports ABC. Jordan Lynch  took a surfboard, skiis and camera down to the freshly formed lake after heavy rains on Sunday . The farm had received 60mm of rain, causing the creek to overflow, a highly infrequent occurrence. 'I've only seen it flow twice before in my life, in 16 years, so I thought you can't miss an opportunity like that, so I grabbed my surfboard an my ski and gave it a go behind the four wheeler' he said. Mr Lynch said skurfing typically involves the rider being towed by a quad bike, a role he was hoping some friends would fill. But he had some trouble roping his friends in for the dangerous pursuit, and he was left to ask his neighbours to tow him on a four wheel drive. 'We were probably going for a kilometre then it got a bit boggy,' he said. Mr Lynch said he has been skurfing for over a decade, swooping in whenever neighbouring lakes are filled up. 'Baandee Lake is pretty close to here, you can't get to the surf very often in Merredin, so I started skurfing behind the boat,' he said. 'Skurfing' typically involves the surfboard rider being towed by a quad bike, but this time Mr Lynch used a neighbours four wheel drive . The West Australian grain farmer said he has been skurfing for over a decade, swooping in whenever neighbouring lakes are filled up . Another unorthodox water sport making a splash with rural farmers is barefoot water skiing. Last month, the first ever Forbes Barefoot Water Ski Tournament was held in central New South Wales. Forty competitors took part in the contest, some of them travelling from up to 100km away. The tournament is now poised to become an annual event.","Jordan Lynch received 60mm of rain on his property on Sunday .

"Sitting in the afternoon sun, Amanda Knox calmly writes in her journal while her fiancé, Colin Sutherland, watches over her. The couple – who have known each other since their schooldays – look like any other young lovers enjoying a spring afternoon at home in Seattle.However, Knox, 27, is now just hours away from learning if she will become a convicted murderer for the second time when a court in Rome, some 5,000 miles away, delivers its verdict tomorrow. Wearing a casual vest and jeans and with her short hair tied back in a knot, the creative writing graduate must have a number of things going through her mind to jot down as the new judgement over the bloody murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher in 2007 eases closer. Knox served four years in prison after she was originally convicted of the crime alongside ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and Rudy Guede, but a second ruling in 2011 declared her innocent and she returned to her native US. Amanda’s seemingly relaxed demeanour was a far cry from the telling body language of her mother, Edda Mellas, on Tuesday, the day before the new verdict had originally been due to be given. Scroll down for video . Sitting in the afternoon sun in Seattle, Amanda Knox calmly writes in her journal in the backyard of her mother's home . Amanda's fiancé, Colin Sutherland, watches over her . Amanda Knox's mother Edda Mellas looks distraught as she goes grocery shopping while awaiting the high court's decision about Amanda's fate . Speaking at court in Rome on Wednesday, Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova said her 'conviction is not justice – but a distortion of the facts.'  He said Amanda was 'worried, very worried' Amanda's mother, Edda Mellas, has tried to distract herself with the family shopping  But she can barely hide her inner turmoil on behalf of her daughter, who once again faces the prospect of a life sentence behind bars for her alleged role in the death of British exchange student Kercher. Edda had risen at around 05.30 am Wednesday morning at her home in Seattle and around an hour later was joined by ex-husband Curt Knox, 54, who lives nearby. No doubt they were waiting for the final verdict in the case, which has dragged on for eight years and already seen Knox and her co-accused, former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 30, acquitted once. After the 2011 acquittal Knox, 28, returned to her hometown of Seattle, Washington, after having served four years in an Italian prison. She is currently believed to be staying at her mother's house. However, the ruling was overturned in 2013, and Knox was handed a sentence of 28 and a half years in prison. Her current case is an appeal against that sentence which could either be upheld – and see her once again declared guilty – acquit her entirely, or the case could be sent back for another round of appeals. Physical and forensic evidence in the brutal murder of Kercher – who was stabbed and had her throat cut – has been hotly contested throughout the trials, as has both Knox and Sollecito's version of events that night. Knox and her family now face another agonizing day before a new verdict is given. Speaking at court in Rome on Wednesday, Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova said her 'conviction is not justice – but a distortion of the facts'. In his closing statement he asked the court to overturn the guilty verdict, and added: 'We are confronted with a very grave judicial error that must be set right.' Amanda is just hours away from learning her fate . Raffaelle Sollecito changed his story earlier this week claiming he now does not remember whether Knox was with him at the time of Meredith Kercher's murder . Asked about how his client had been in the last few days, he said: 'Worried, very worried.' Sollecito remains in Italy – where his passport has been confiscated to stop him fleeing - and was present for the hearing in court. If Knox is convicted Italian courts will have to ask for her extradition, which will lead to another round of legalities in the US to determine whether or not she will finally be sent to prison again, and where. That decision would ultimately be left in the hands of Secretary of State John Kerry. On Tuesday afternoon Edda, 52, a mathematics teacher in the Highline area of Seattle, had shopped for groceries at a local supermarket before heading to the West Seattle area of the city where she lives with husband Chris, 40, and daughters Ashley, 20, and Delaney, 15. They appeared to have a number of visitors, who were no doubt wishing them luck with the scheduled verdict. However, after it was delayed, the curtains in the house remained closed all day Wednesday. Since her return to Seattle, Knox has tried to get on with a normal life and had resumed studies at the University of Washington and even took on freelance work at a local newspaper, the West Seattle Herald. Knox's new guy: Amanda was pictured out with fiance Colin Sutherland in New York. He is an aspiring rock musician . Amanda's mom will have to wait until tomorrow to learn the Italian court's decision . She even found love, first with classical music student James Terrano and then with New York- based musician Colin Sutherland, whom she announced her engagement to in February of this year. Knox has become increasingly distanced from Sollecito, who changed his story earlier this week, claiming he now does not remember whether Knox was with him at the time of Meredith Kercher's murder. He claimed in documents presented to court on Tuesday he can't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night Kercher was murdered. Markus Wiget, an Italian criminal trial lawyer claimed Sollecito was making the claims in a last ditch attempt to save his own skin. He said: 'You could say he is throwing her to the wolves. It is bad for Amanda' s defense but it might not be good for Raffaele's defense either. The lawyers are probably trying this approach as a very last resort.' One person, Rudy Guede, has already been convicted of murder, but the Italian courts have ruled he did not act alone.","Amanda Knox is seen writing in a journal in the backyard of her mother's home in Seattle .

"A mother was horrified when she opened a bag of Tesco bananas and discovered something deadly lurking inside. The fruit was infested with eggs of the Brazilian Wandering Spider, the world’s most venomous spider, which can kill a human in under an hour. Maria Layton, 43, said the eggs started to hatch after she opened the bag for her daughter Siri, six, so she immediately put the whole lot into a sealed container. Scroll down for video . Cocoon: The Tesco bananas were infested with dozens of deadly Brazilian spiders hatching from eggs . ‘I’m glad it was me rather than Siri that opened the bag,’ she said yesterday. The bite of the Brazilian Wandering Spider can also give a man a painful four-hour erection – its venom is currently being studied for use in erectile dysfunction treatments. The bananas, shipped from Costa Rica, had been bought at a Tesco store in Pontardawe, South Wales, by Mrs Layton’s husband and taken to their home in Bristol. Mrs Layton said: ‘Siri asked for a banana. The first banana had a funny bit on it, so I got another one for her and that was when I found the massive spider cocoon. ‘I remembered seeing a news story about them, so I Googled it. I went through the images and there was an image which looked very similar to mine. The spiders' nest may have been exported with the bananas, which were shipped to the supermarket from Costa Rica . ‘I was so scared – I don’t like spiders at the best of times, but have read about the Brazilian Wandering Spiders and was very frightened about the potential threat. ‘The spider cocoon started to unfurl so I put it in a sealed box and put it in the freezer as I read that is supposed to kill them.’ Shocked by the possible danger to Siri and her three-year-old sister, Phoebe, Mrs Layton contacted Tesco customer services, which told her to take the bananas, deadly spiders and all, back to the store – so that the barcode could be scanned and the store could refund her money. She said: ‘Tesco were a bit useless. I really wanted some helpful advice on how to act. ‘Tesco failed to see the potential threat to me and my family and thought I was only interested in having a pound or so back. I called Food Standards but they said it wasn’t anything to do with them, I called Trading Standards but they were shut. ‘I spent an hour and a half ringing round trying to get some help while I had this potentially killer spider in the house.’ A Tesco spokesman said: ‘Our policy is for the customer to take the product to the store where it can be investigated. We don’t have a service whereby someone can go out to the home. ‘We’ve apologised to Mrs Layton and offered a gesture of goodwill. We’ve asked her to return the product to our store so we can conduct a full investigation.’ It is not the first time the venomous spiders have been found in people's fruit bowls. Last October a family found a lethal Brazilian Wandering Spider among their Waitrose bananas. A Waitrose worker came round to catch the spider, but by then it had escaped, meaning the supermarket had to send in a pest control expert. Meanwhile a mother-of-one from Colchester, Essex, had to incinerate her vacuum cleaner in September after a cocoon on one of her Tesco bananas burst, sending eggs flying on to the floor. Abby Woodgate, 30, was told by pest control workers that anything that came into contact with the eggs would have to be burned to ensure there was no chance of the baby spiders surviving. The Brazilian wandering spider appears in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's most venomous spider. Their Greek name Phoneutria actually means 'murderess' - an indication of their deadly bite. They are known as the wandering spider because they do not build webs, but instead walk the jungle floor at night looking for prey. Brazilian wandering spiders  are nocturnal, and so find places to hide during the day. This is why they are so dangerous, because they hide in houses and cars, where they are easily disturbed by humans. They may be considered the most toxic spider, but they are not the biggest. Their leg-span reaches up to five inches. When the spiders are defending themselves, they lift their body up on their hind legs in a defensive display. Bites killed 14 people until an antidote was found in 1996. The venom causes extreme pain and inflammation, loss of muscle control and breathing problems, resulting in paralysis and eventual asphyxiation. The spider's bite can cause an unwanted erection in men, sometimes lasting for four hours.","Maria Layton, 43, found deadly Brazilian Wandering Spider nest on fruit .

"Tragedy: Canadian mother-of-six Laura Lloyd died last Wednesday after her husband backed a trailer into her while leaving the house for work . Six children are now without their mother, after the 34-year-old woman was run over by her husband as he backed his truck out of the driveway for work.

"The FBI has identified two people who were shot outside the National Security Agency's headquarters on Monday after allegedly stealing an SUV they were driving from a motel. Kevin Lamont Fleming, 20, and his friend Ricky 'Maya' Shawatza Hall, 27, were allegedly picked up in Baltimore by another man on Sunday night before 'partying' at nearby lodgings in Howard County. The unidentified 60-year-old Baltimore driver went to the bathroom on Monday morning and discovered that both his passengers and his Ford Escape SUV had gone, he told police. Hall, the driver who identifies as a woman, allegedly took the SUV onto NSA grounds shortly after and refused police commands to halt. The driver and passenger, who were both dressed as women and have criminal records, were subsequently shot by a guard outside the facility. Scroll down for videos . Ricky 'Maya' Shawatza Hall, (left) 27, of Baltimore, has been identified as the driver and Kevin Fleming, (right) 20, as the passenger of an SUV that charged towards the NSA gates on Monday morning . Hall died at the scene and Fleming  was injured in the shooting along with a guard believed to have been in the rammed police vehicle. Above, a white sheet appears to cover a body outside the the SUV . The Ford Escape is thought to have been stolen from the Terrace Motel in Elkridge, Maryland, where Hall and Fleming went with an unidentified 60-year-old man early Monday morning to 'party' Members of the Baltimore transvestite community said that Hall lived in an abandoned apartment in the city and noted that something had been off about her behavior recently . Hall, identified by the FBI Tuesday, died at the scene, though police have not said how she died. Her lawyer said that Hall was a transgender individual who identified as a woman and had a long criminal record, according to the Wall Street Journal. She had previous convictions for armed robbery, assault, theft and prostitution. The prostitution conviction was from 2007, according to court records. She received a year's probation. She had also been charged with stealing a bottle of methadone from a woman's pocket last year. Baltimore City public defender said 'He’s a young man with a very, very troubled past,' and had an upcoming parole violation hearing in July that could have sent her to prison her several years. Members of Baltimore's transvestite community said that she lived in an abandoned apartment building in Baltimore with other transvestites, according to Wbal-Tv. 'I'm sure that they didn't leave their house knowing that they wouldn't come home that day or that that would be the end, Jamia Leonard, who had known Hall for eight months, said. It was not immediately clear if Hall and Fleming had been living in the same house. Leonard said that something had been off with Hall's behavior recently. ""In the last couple of days, I knew something was wrong. I didn't know exactly what was going on but I could hear him talking out of his head.' 'He would travel from this abandoned house to another high-rise right down the street back and forth, and back and forth.' The 44-year-old officer is pictured here being loaded into an ambulance following the harrowing shootout at one of the nation's most secure military installations . Hall had a previous conviction for prostitution though police could not say if there was any sex at the motel. Above, a brown wig (circled) can be seen outside the stolen Ford SUV that the suspects were driving . Fleming remains in a hospital after being flown there with serious injuries, while an NSA police officer was also wounded and released from the hospital Monday. He was awaiting a probation violation hearing in June in Anne Arundel County. The young man was also suspected of stealing a tip jar worth $100.99 and was sentenced to probation and fined. The reason for his probation violation arrest on March 9 was not immediately clear, according to the Washington Post. He was released on March 25 . Information about what happened at the Terrace Motel, in Elkridge, Maryland, less than 20 minutes from the NSA gates, is not contained in the Howard County police report about the incident. 'We can't confirm there was any sexual activity involved,' a police spokeswoman said of Hall and Fleming's time in the motel. Their 60-year-old driver told police that the trio wanted to 'party' and that they checked into the motel about 7.30am, according to police. The car, which was reported stolen at 8.30am, belonged to the driver's wife. The 60-year-old was a regular at the motel, according to WJZ. An employee of the Terrace Motel would not confirm any details of the case to Daily Mail Online. It is unclear how the men ended up at the government building, which is off of a highway exit clearly marked as a restricted area for NSA employees only. The incident sparked terrorism fears at the heavily secured area on Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, on Monday morning. The men are said to have panicked and refused police commands to stop when they strayed on to the highly secretive government property, police said. The NSA checkpoint where the shooting occurred is directly off the busy Highway 295 between Washington, DC and Baltimore. Authorities believe that Fleming and Hall may have gotten off on the exit accidentally . This diagram shows where the shooting took place - just outside a gate at Fort Meade in Maryland where the NSA is headquartered . A man in the area said that Hall and Fleming were screaming loudly as they rushed toward the NSA gate. They were apparently warned several times to halt. Authorities have speculated that cocaine and a weapon found in the car may have played a role in the vehicle not stopping. When the SUV accelerated, the guard opened fire - killing Hall and gravely wounding Fleming. The vehicle slammed into a police SUV blocking the road, and injured the officer. An FBI spokesman said that no information about motive would be released on Tuesday, according to the Baltimore Sun. Fleming and Hall's dressing as women is not believed to be part of any attempt to disguise themselves. The suspects are thought to have fled down the highway from the Elkridge motel and authorities believe they may have ended up on Fort Meade property by mistake. Cocaine and a weapon found in the stolen SUV, which belonged to the 60-year-old man's wife, may have played a role in the car refusing to stop . The SUV was warned several times to stop before a guard opened fire and the vehicle crashed into the police car . The 44-year-old NSA police officer and Fleming were both transported to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, WTTG-TV reported. Pictures from the scene show what appears to be the crashed Ford Escape and a police SUV outside the gates to the military post. A  body can be seen covered by a white sheet next to the black SUV. What appears to be a curly brown wig is seen beside the car. Fort Meade is home to several highly sensitive government agencies, including the NSA - the spy agency responsible for controversial mass surveillance programs . The US military Cyber Command, which is responsible for military cyber-warfare and defense, is also on the base. The complex hosts more than 11,000 military personnel and 29,000 civilian employees.","NSA guard shot Kevin Fleming, 20, and his friend Ricky Shawatza Hall, 27 who tried to ram through secure entrance of Fort Meade on Monday .

"A couple narrowly escaped death in the East Village explosion when they left their uninsured and now-incinerated  apartment to pick up some cupcakes minutes before the blast. Sara Stringfield and her boyfriend Rob Torti, 36, had a fun romantic day planned to celebrate Sara’s 31st birthday. Never did the lovebirds expect that they'd lose thousands of dollars worth of clothing and electronic devices, irreplaceable sentimental items, zany costumes, and the home they were finally able to share together after dating long distance for almost half a year. Scroll down for video . All loved up: Sara Stringfield, 31, and Rob Torti, 36, pictured at their East Village home where Sara just moved after months of the pair dating long distance . Cupcakes saved her life!: Sara and her boyfriend Rob celebrated Sara's birthday on Thursday and went to get cupcakes at Baked by Melissa just minutes before the giant explosion in the East Village . When Rob met Sara at the festival Burning Man in Black, Rock City Nevada in August of 2014 she set his heart on fire and the two began visiting one another for just a few days at a time in New York City where Rob lived and in Idaho where Sara resided. It wasn't until recently that Sara left her residence in Idaho to live with Rob in the East Village in a home that's now nothing but soot and ash. 'We don't need anything. We have each other,' Sara told Dailymail.com. 'That's all we've got,' added Rob. Thursday morning started out bright with yoga and a big delicious brunch. At around 2:30 p.m. the couple went home to 45 East 7th street to relax until Sara got a phone call from a friend saying that there were cupcakes waiting for her at Baked by Melissa. No more: Sara and Rob lived at 45 East 7th street on the corner of the block and the nearby explosion set fire to their building with no longer stands . Decimated: Rubble and soot is all that remains of Sara and Rob's East Village home after the explosion . Sara and Rob left their apartment on a mission to pick up some sweet treats. That decision may have saved their life. As they walked back home down Lafayette street after indulging in a birthday snack, they heard sirens and saw billows of smoke in the air. The explosion occurred at Sushi Park restaurant at 121 Second Avenue at 3:20 p.m. It soon sent the entire block alight and caused neighboring buildings to burn and collapse. Fiery romance: Rob met Sara at the music festival Burning Man and the two struck up a kinship that developed into a deep romance and had just moved in together after dating long distance . Festival and beyond: When Rob met Sara at Burning Man he knew she was special and continued to contact her following the festival and their interactions grew more frequent and meaningful . Love of costumes: Rob and Sara both enjoy making costumes and wearing them together at events . At least 22 people were injured in the incident, including four critically, two of whom were taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Cornell suffering from burns to their airways. The five first responders - among them four firefighters and an EMS worker - also sustained minor injuries. Two people have been reported missing: 23-year-old Nicholas Figueroa, who was on a date at the sushi restaurant, and Moises Lucon, who was a bus boy there, have not been found. It wasn't before long on Thursday that Sara and Rob learned their house was on fire  when they saw photos on Facebook of the windows in their building engulfed in flames. Zany: The couple lost all of their many costumes they've created and Rob even made a special helmet for Sara's birthday that was also lost in the fire . Lost: Many of Sara and Rob's elaborate creations that took hours to make were lost in the fire . Warriors: Rob and Sara love dressing as warriors and other crazy characters for festivals and events . The couple waited for half the day in uncertainty but felt blessed to receive calls from friends and family offering up their homes as a place to stay for the time being. Inside the burning house was a birthday gift Rob made for Sara, a military helmet designed with both a Mohawk and a heart. Sadly, he never got to give it to her. Rob and Sara share a love of making costumes and spend hours designing and sewing their colourful and eccentric frocks that they wear at events and at Burning Man. All of those items were lost inside the home. They have each other: Sara and Rob may have lost their many costumes but they still have their fun spirit . Before the fire: Sara and Rob, pictured on Thursday on a morning birthday outing, never expected they'd lose literally everything they have . Sara, a lawyer, told DailyMail.com that she lost a valuable necklace given to her by her father made of pyrite, a gift to remind her that, 'all that glitters is not gold.' Sara wore the necklace as a good luck charm when she was studying for her bar exam and it pains her to lose something that gave her so much strength at a defining time in her life. Sara told Dailymail.com that it’s not material things that matter most but that the real 'gold' is friends and family. Frog prince?: The couple are sad to have lost so many things but together they are determined to find a solution and find a new home . She described being overwhelmed when going into a store with Rob to get some basic clothing items like socks and underwear for the next few days. ‘I’m not sure I want more stuff,’ Sara said. ‘I looked at the clothes and thought, “is this something I really need?"" Rob who was in the budding phases of starting his tequila company Zarandea Tequila and spent a lot of his time working from home lost bottle designs, important work documents, and other valuable essentials for starting his brand. For the time being Sara and Rob are staying with one of Rob’s friends from college but that is merely a temporary solution. Rob never got renter’s insurance because he’s only been living at his home for a few months so he may not get anything back from the building in damages. Rob moved into the apartment in November and while he planned on getting insurance, he hadn't gotten around to it yet. Friends set up a Youcaring.com account to raise a goal of $15,000 to help the pair get back on their feet. So far they’ve raised just over $4,000. Those who wish to donate may do so here. Despite losing their home, Rob and Sara say they feel so blessed that they are not alone. The have love from friends, from family, and last but not least they have the flame that burns for one another.","Sara Stringfield, 31, and her boyfriend Rob Torti, 36, left their apartment to get cupcakes for Sara's birthday just minutes before the explosion .

"Huddled together in the corner of one of the world's busiest railway station, these are the abandoned children who were reunited with their mother thanks to a Twitter appeal. The three youngsters, Rahnuma, seven, Raja, five, and four-year-old Sanya were dumped at New Delhi station by their father, who had taken them out for the day. He told the children that their mother would come and collect them before fleeing leaving them cold, scared and hungry. The picture of the three abandoned children Rahnuma, seven, Sanya, four, and Raja, five, who were dumped at New Dehli railway station by their father . The picture was taken by local journalist Abhishek Shukla, who posted it on Twitter, asking people to help them . However, local journalist Abhishek Shukla, 33, spotted the siblings huddling together for warm as they slept on one of the platforms, while he was seeing off his elderly parents on a train. Concerned about their well-being, but not having time to speak to them, he took a picture and posted it to Twitter with the message: 'Can someone help these helpless kids at New Dehli Railway Station near platform 16 entrance.' The tweet soon went viral and local police chief Madhur Verman sent his officers to the scene. When they were eventually found on platform one, they were 'sobbing uncontrollably' and too scared and confused to tell officers how they got to the station, NDTV reported. He said: 'When officers arrived they found the children had gone. Eventually, after an hour, they were found hiding on another platform. Saved: After the tweet went viral, Rahnuma, Sanya, and their brother Raja, were helped by police . Police then went to the train station to rescue the children and track down their mother, who was unaware of what had happened to them . Ms Tabassum, the children's mother, who had not been contacted by her ex husband to say where the youngsters were . 'They were cold, hungry and scared. When we arrived at the mother’s house she was asleep and said she had been working and had not been contacted by her ex husband. 'As far as she was aware the children were staying with him. We are now looking to question the man.' Later Mr Shukla was informed that the children had been reunited with their mother and then tweeted his delight. He wrote: 'Today morning safely handed over to mother Ms Tabassum. They are happy. (sic)' It is estimated that there are over 11 million children in India, who are abandoned and live on the streets. Many of them go to the country's extensive railway stations to flee to cities in the hope of finding a better life. However, when they arrive there, they are often alone and lost and find themselves having to live on the platforms.","Siblings Rahnuma, Raja and Sanya were dumped at New Dehli station .

"The families of thousands of patients given contaminated blood by the NHS have condemned an inquiry into the scandal as a whitewash and a waste of time. Patients were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after receiving blood supplies which had not been properly tested. Campaigners estimate more than 30,000 patients across the UK were affected in the 1970s and 1980s, of whom 2,000 have died. Many had the rare blood disorder haemophilia and were given regular transfusions with a clotting agent known as Factor VIII to stop internal bleeding. Scroll down for video . The Penrose Report was burned by campaigner Glenn Wilkinson after it was published in Edinburgh this afternoon . Audience members, including Sandra Molyneux from Liverpool, reacted angrily to the Victims report's publication today . But this came from batches which had not been screened or treated for HIV and hepatitis C, a virus that infects the liver and can cause serious, sometimes fatal damage. The true scale of hepatitis C contracted via hospital transfusions has taken years to emerge because of the time it can take to start to experience symptoms. Dame Anita Roddick caught it after a hospital blood transfusion following the birth of her daughter Sam in 1971. The Body Shop founder lived with the disease for more than 30 years before discovering she had it, by which time she was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver. She died in 2007 aged 64 of a brain haemorrhage, a rare complication of the disease. The scandal was described as the 'worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS' and yesterday the Prime Minister apologised on behalf of the Government. David Cameron addressed the Commons shortly after the Scottish government published the findings from its own six-year, £6million inquiry into what happened. But victims and bereaved relatives who had gathered at the National Museum in Edinburgh, where the findings were read out, called it a 'whitewash'. They are furious that the inquiry did not blame individual doctors, NHS staff or politicians and said nothing could have been done differently. Bill Wright from Haemophilia Scotland criticised the findings of the six year Penrose Inquiry today . Mr Cameron's apology follows a lengthy campaign by the Mail highlighting the plight of victims and relatives. Addressing MPs during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Mr Cameron said he wanted to recognise the 'pain and suffering experienced by people as a result of this tragedy'. The Prime Minister added: 'It is difficult to imagine the feelings of unfairness that people must feel as a result of being infected by something like hepatitis C or HIV as a result of a totally unrelated treatment within the NHS, and to each and every one of those people, I would like to say sorry on behalf of the Government for something that should not have happened.' In January, the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Haemophilia and Contaminated Blood criticised the help provided to the thousands infected by contaminated blood during the 1970s and 80s. It said between 1970 and 1991, contaminated NHS blood products caused an estimated 32,718 people to be infected with hepatitis C. Between 1978 and 1985, 1,500 people were infected with the HIV virus in a similar way, most of whom were also infected with hepatitis C. The Scottish Government's Penrose Inquiry investigated only the cases of Scottish victims, and the widow of David Rusling, who died of hepatitis C after being infected during a treatment for haemophilia, said it was a waste of time. Lorna Rusling said: 'We have lost the heart and soul of our family. 'It just ruined years of our lives. We wanted the truth, we wanted them to come out and say 'we did things wrong'.' Stephen Wheatley, 53 – a haemophiliac who was infected with hepatitis C – added: 'It doesn't go deep enough, it doesn't give everybody's story. Everybody's case should have been in there. 'There are still so many people who don't know that they have actually got it. Some people maybe don't want to know.' By David Wilkes . It was a remedy that became a killer at the centre of a huge public health scandal. Factor VIII was a clotting agent developed in the 1970s for haemophiliacs. Their condition means their blood fails to clot, and a minor cut can put sufferers at risk of bleeding to death. US companies made Factor VIII from blood from donors including drug addicts and vagrants infected with hepatitis C and HIV who had been paid cash. The unscreened products were imported because Britain did not supply enough 'home-grown' product. A quarter of a century ago, the Daily Mail campaigned to highlight the plight of haemophiliacs infected with contaminated blood products as part of their NHS treatment. The families of thousands of patients given contaminated blood by the NHS have condemned an inquiry into the scandal as a whitewash and a waste of time . The Mail's coverage included telling the story of Allen White, then 36, a haemophiliac who contracted Aids through a blood clotting agent, under the headline: 'A blindness to moral justice has abandoned this dying man. Surely his family deserves better.' Mr White, a married father of two from Yorkshire, had to give up his job as a computer systems designer because of his deteriorating health. The article asked: 'Why doesn't the Government do the honourable thing about what the Haemophilia Society describes as 'the biggest tragedy in NHS history'?' After pressure on the Government to recognise the unique circumstances of the case, 1,200 haemophiliac Aids victims were promised £42million compensation in 1990. Regardless of whether they were taking legal action, those affected and their families got lump sums ranging from £21,000 to £60,500. Mr White said he would accept the offer to give him 'peace of mind' that his family would not be left penniless. But others said it was not enough, and accused the Government of 'buying off the embarrassment' of a court case. Scotland is the only part of the UK to hold an inquiry into the scandal. The Penrose Inquiry, which gave its findings yesterday, said 478 people acquired the hepatitis C virus from blood product therapy in Scotland and 2,500 acquired the virus from blood transfusion in Scotland between 1970 and 1991. Sixty patients acquired HIV from therapy with blood products and 18 from blood transfusion in Scotland. The Mail's coverage included telling the story of Allen White, then 36, a haemophiliac who contracted Aids through a blood clotting agent . The Penrose Inquiry did not have the power to summon witnesses from outside Scotland – and has done little to abate the anger of many victims. Mark Ward, of Peacehaven, East Sussex, who contracted hepatitis C and HIV from contaminated blood he received as a child, said yesterday he had been treated as nothing more than a 'lump of meat to be experimented on'. He told the BBC that the treatment was 'so dirty and filthy, and the places it was being sourced... anything could have been in that blood', adding: 'We were used as objects of research.' Three men who contracted hepatitis C from blood transfusions have started a legal case to challenge the support available to them, and it is likely further legal action will follow.","Thousands of patients contracted HIV and Hepatitis C after transfusions .

"Medical student Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir (above), who has travelled to Syria to treat Jihadi fighters, once praised the Charlie Hebdo murders . A British medical student who travelled to Syria to treat Jihadi fighters in Islamic State hospitals once praised the Charlie Hebdo murders, it emerged last night. Private schoolgirl Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir sent a smiling selfie to her sister as she crossed the border from Turkey on March 13 to reach Islamic State territory. The respected surgeon’s daughter is one of nine British doctors and students in their late teens or early 20s who are now believed to be volunteering in hospitals there. Their families have all flocked to the border in a desperate attempt to bring their children home, saying that they had been ‘cheated, brainwashed’ by IS militants. Yesterday, their parents issued a joint statement claiming that their children had travelled to the border to take part in ‘humanitarian’ work and had ‘excellent moral capabilities’. But posts on what is believed to be Miss Abdelgadir’s Twitter account suggest that her views are less than moral and that she has indeed gone to work with IS. She once retweeted: ‘The pictures that the 2 journalists produced on Islam and prophet Muhammed (saw) was more horrific then their killing.’ On the account, @Lenaalinglingg, she also called for Sharia law, retweeted a statement that homosexuality is a disease and criticised terror arrests, calling them ‘silly’. The private schoolgirl condemned Muslims who joined the ‘not in my name’ campaign which rejects IS and Muslims who wore poppy headscarves to mark Remembrance Day. She also once retweeted: ‘Fighting is not violence. Violence is tyranny, oppression, suppression & injustice. Only thru FIGHTING can we get OUT of VIOLENCE. #peace.’ Yesterday, it emerged that she is an ‘incredibly bright’ schoolgirl who attended Wisbech Grammar School in Cambridgeshire where fees are £12,000 a year. The students’ parents believe that they have gone to Turkey to offer ‘voluntary medical help’ to Syrian refugees on the border. They did, however, acknowledge that their children were missing and, when asked whether they thought their children might have joined IS, one father replied ‘we don’t know’. ‘Our sons and daughters have always been participating in humanitarian and good cause social work,’ the statement from the families said. ‘They have come to Turkey willingly to offer voluntary medical help to those refugees who are in need of medical care on Turkey’s borders.’ The nine medics have been named as Mohammed Wael Fadlallah, Tasneem Suliman, Ismail Hamdoun, Nada Sami Kader, Mohammed Elbadri Ibrahim, Rawan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tamir Ahmed Abusibah, Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir and Sami Ahmed Kadir. Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Pictured from left to right: Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah, Lena Maumoon Abdulqadir and Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah . The four women and five men apparently kept their plans secret from their families and fled to Syria from a medical base in Sudan. Left to right: Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Sami Ahmed Kadir and Ismail Hamadoun . The medical students are believed to now be in the ISIS-held area of Tel Abyad, according to a Turkish politician. From left to right: Nada Sami Kader, Mohamed Osama Badri Mohammed and Tasneem Suleyman . Yesterday, Chris Staley, head of Wisbech Grammar in Cambridgeshire, said Miss Abdelgadir, was ‘furiously bright’, ‘very normal’ and a ‘very focused young lady’. He described her as a popular, typical pupil who had represented the school in sports including hockey, had got 7 A*s and was a member of the student council. ‘She was an incredibly bright and focused young lady who was clearly destined for great things on the medical or scientific side,’ he said. The pupil, from King’s Lynn in Norfolk, spent nine years she spent at the Cambridgeshire school before studying medicine at Khartoum’s private University of Medical Sciences and Technology. Her parents sent her to Sudan to study so that she could reconnect with her Islamic roots. Instead, however, they fear she has been radicalised. On March 12, just before she crossed the border, she sent a smiling photo and the message: ‘Don’t worry, we’ve reached Turkey and are on our way to volunteer helping wounded Syrian people.’ Schoolgirls Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and  Amira Abase, 15, (pictured at Gatwick airport) fled to Turkey before crossing the border into Syria where they are believed to have become ISIS jihadi brides . Her father, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, where the family live, immediately flew to Turkey to find her. He previously said: ‘We have decided not to return home unless we go with them. We sent out children to study [in Sudan] so that they would be surrounded by their culture. ‘But their decision to go to Syria has been a shock for all of us.’ Mehmet Ali Ediboglu, a Turkish opposition politician helping the families, said the medics were believed to be in Tel Abyad, which is under IS control. He told The Observer: ‘The conflict out there is fierce, so medical help must be needed. They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think.’ A spokeswoman for Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘Our thoughts are with Mr Abdel-Gadir and his family at this difficult time.’ The Foreign Office said it was giving consular assistance to the families of seven Britons.","Medical student Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir praised Charlie Hebdo murders .

"Ben Moynihan, 18, was found guilty of attempted murder after stabbing the three women then taunting police with two notes in which he boasted how he loved to smell his victims' flesh . A teenager who wrote notes to police asking them to catch him has been jailed for 21 years - for the attempted murder of three women he stabbed because he was unable to lose his virginity. Ben Moynihan, who is now 18, of Portsmouth, Hampshire, was found guilty by a jury at Winchester Crown Court of the three charges following a week-long trial. The judge, Mr Justice Jay, said Moynihan suffered from an autism spectrum disorder and had a 'gross lack of empathy'. Sentencing Moynihan, whom he described as 'dangerous', the judge told him: 'The offences were planned and premeditated. 'The contents of your computers were as chilling as they were disturbing.' The judge issued an extended licence of five years to be served on completion of the sentence and ordered the defendant to begin his prison term in a young offenders institution. He also ordered a £20 victim surcharge to be paid. The teenager, who was 17 at the time of the attacks, stabbed the three women, aged 20, 45 and 67, with a 4.5-inch kitchen knife, aiming for their hearts, as they walked alone in Portsmouth in June and July last year. To do so, he carried a steak knife on the streets of his home city up to ten times last summer before his arrest on July 13. When he was eventually caught, police body-worn footage revealed him saying: 'You was lucky, I was hunting my fourth victim.' And before carrying his crimes, he researched serial killers including Moors murderer Ian Brady, the Muswell Hill murderer Dennis Nilsen and American Jeffrey Dahmer. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, said Moynihan, who called himself the 'unhappy geezer', left two letters for police confessing to his crimes in which he stated that 'all women need to die' and that he liked to smell the 'flesh he had ripped out'. The letter, left on a police van, said: 'All women needs to die and hopefully next time I can gouge their eyeballs out. 'Every time I stab someone I run home and I like to smell the flesh I ripped out. Come and arrest me for God sake before I hunt for my fourth victim.' In Moynihan's first letter to police (pictured) he labelled himself 'the unhappy geezer' and claimed to roam the streets 'hungry for blood and pain' His second letter was less cryptic - he attached a photo of himself which subsequently led to his arrest . At the bottom of the letter, Moynihan included a photograph of himself. He was arrested when police officers recognised him in the street from the picture and detained him. Another letter had a symbol from the Tomb Raider game on it. It said: 'When women won't talk to you it's heartbreaking, why are they fussy with men nowadays.' It continued: 'I roam these streets, hungry for blood and pain, I be greeted with attack, attack, attack, attack, dead, jolly good!' In a video found on his laptop, Moynihan had filmed himself saying: 'I think every girl is a type of s***, they are fussy with men nowadays, they do not give boys like us a chance. 'I am still a virgin, everyone is losing it before me, that's why you are my chosen target. I just can't live in this flat, I have no future here. So women, tell me how we should do this.' Ms Maylin said he also kept what he called a 'diary of evil' which detailed the attacks, as well as a document listing his dreams, which included descriptions of violence against women and of killing. A police officer stands guard at the scene of one of Moynihan's stabbings in July last year . Ms Maylin added: 'Ben Moynihan had an incomprehensible fascination for killing and he would compare himself to serial killers.' In a victim impact statement, the 20-year-old victim said: 'In the days and weeks immediately after the attack, I felt very scared. I couldn't go out on my own. I just wanted to stay inside.

Mr Bryan said: 'When considering his behaviour he, having learnt that on the first occasion there were no life threatening injuries, at no stage thereafter did he increase the ferocity of his attacks or attempt to attack in some other way. 'He had the intent but it may be that his heart wasn't quite into it. He didn't carry out any of the matters the he set out to do in his video. 'They were horrific to the victims but in fact he didn't go further that one stab as he ran past them which only caused superficial injuries.' Mr Bryan also pointed out Moynihan assisted police with a photograph of himself and approached them to say he was the man they were looking for. Moynihan, wearing a white long sleeved shirt with black suit trousers, showed no emotion as he was lead from the dock by two security guards.","Ben Moynihan, 18, was found guilty of attempted murder of three women .

"Two Vietnamese citizens and a Canadian have been charged over roles in hacking email service providers in the United States in one of the largest reported data breaches in the nation's history, the Department of Justice said on Friday. Viet Quoc Nguyen, 28, is charged with hacking at least eight email service providers between February 2009 and June 2012 and obtaining more than one billion email addresses. The service providers involved were not named. According to the allegations, Nguyen and fellow Vietnamese citizen Giang Hoang Vu, 25, used the data to send so-called spam to tens of millions of people directing them to products they were selling online. Hacked: The data breach compromised almost one billion email addresses across the United States from February 2009 to June 2012 . Both men resided in the Netherlands. Vu, who was extradited to the United States in March of last year, pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiracy to commit computer fraud. Nguyen remains at large. The other defendant, Canadian David-Manuel Santos Da Silva, 33, was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is the co-owner of a company called 21 Celsius Inc, that allegedly struck up a marketing arrangement with Nguyen and Vu to generate revenue and launder the proceeds, according to the Justice Department. The two men made $2 million from sales on those products over two years. “Those individuals who line their pockets with money gained through deceiving others should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable,” said Special Agent in Charge Veronica F. Hyman-Pillot of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. Vu was taken into custody in the Netherlands in 2012 and was extradited to the US at the beginning of March. Arrests: Two men from Vietnam directed spam to Canadian, David-Manuel Santos Da Silva and the three men made more than $2 million . He has pleaded guilty to to conspiracy to commit computer fraud. Da Silva was nabbed by authorities in February at Ft. Lauderdale International Airport trying to leave the country. 'This case reflects the cutting-edge problems posed by today's cybercrime cases, where the hackers didn't target just a single company; they infiltrated most of the country's email distribution firms,' said acting U.S. Attorney John A. Horn. 'And the scope of the intrusion is unnerving, in that the hackers didn't stop after stealing the companies' proprietary data — they then hijacked the companies' own distribution platforms to send out bulk emails and reaped the profits from email traffic directed to specific websites.'",Two Vietnamese citizens and one Canadian man arrested for huge spam email con .
"A man who made millions running a phony breast cancer charity called Boobies Rock! in order to fund his lavish lifestyle may have hit rock bottom. Adam Shyrock, 35, accused of running two fraudulent national breast cancer charities was ordered by a judge to return $1.89 million in gross receipts and pay $4 million in civil penalties. The Colorado Attorney General's Office says District Judge Shelley Gilman handed down her ruling against Boobies Rock! founder Adam Shryock  on Thursday and issued an injunction barring him from ever working on or near a charitable solicitation again. Paying up: Adam Shyrock, 35, accused of running two fraudulent national breast cancer charities was ordered by a judge to return $1.89 million in gross receipts and pay $4 million in civil penalties . Shyrock is also accused of operating a second fraudulent charity called Say No 2 cancer. The Attorney General's office filed a complaint against Shryock and his businesses in 2013, saying they were committing charitable fraud. He was accused of misleading customers around the country into thinking more of their money was going to breast cancer charities. Shryock is currently serving another sentence on contempt of court charges. Shryock only sent a little bit of money to legitimate cancer groups while using company bank accounts to buy himself a BMW, subscribe to an online dating service, and to pay bar tabs and a maid service, Attorney General John Suthers said in a complaint filed in Denver District Court. On his Facebook page, Shryock could be seen posing in front of his luxury car and carousing with friends. Other images show him lounging in his palatial home, which he shared with a pure-bred huskie. Boobies Rock! Inc. and Say No 2 Cancer disabled their websites back in 2013 since a Denver judge issued a temporary restraining order restricting operations and freezed accounts. According to the Colorado complaint, Shryock originally ran Boobies Rock! from San Francisco after incorporating it in California in 2011, but he moved to Castle Rock, Colo., south of Denver in 2012. Lavish lifestyle: Shryock only sent a little bit of money to legitimate cancer groups while using company bank accounts to buy himself a BMW, subscribe to an online dating service, and to pay bar tabs . Lavish lifestyle: The address in Castle Rock, Colorado, listed for Shryock is for a 4-bedroom, 6-bath mansion valued at just under $2million . Lap of luxury: Shryock's well-appointed home boasts a granite fireplace (left), Italian tile and floor-to-ceiling windows (right) overlooking the Rocky Mountains . Origin: Shryock initially ran Boobies! Rock from San Francisco after incorporating it in California in 2011 . The address once listed for Shryock was for a 4-bedroom, 6-bath mansion valued at just under $2m boasting a granite fireplace, Italian tile and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Rocky Mountains. Shryock, a University of Kansas graduate, got engaged in 2013, presenting his bride-to-be with a massive diamond ring. It's unknown if the pair are still together. Shryock launched Say No 2 Cancer in January of 2012, the complaint said. Suthers wrote that the companies would send models to bars or sporting events to sell merchandise, with instructions to mention that Boobies Rock! is a for-profit company only when asked. Oftentimes, people simply made cash donations. The models would tell bar owners and patrons that anywhere from 40 to 90 per cent of the proceeds from their purchases would go directly towards the fight against cancer. A Twitter account for the fraudulent charity still lingers.  'Hiring For Sales Reps! $4,500-$6,000 per month, message us for details!,' says one of their recent posts. Boobies Rock! did give $50,000 to the Pink Fund, based in the Detroit area — but only to avoid lawsuits after Pink Fund found out the company was using its name without its permission, Suthers’ complaint said. Suthers said Boobies Rock! donated $25,000 to another organization, also to avoid a lawsuit. Other donations fell short of the percentage of net revenue that Boobies Rock! represented it would donate, the complaint said. Shyrock is no longer allowed to do any charity work by law. Engaged: Shryock, a University of Kansas graduate, got engaged in 2013, presenting his bride-to-be with a massive diamond ring but it's unknown if the pair are still together . ‘Shryock passed through the absolute bare minimum to a series of legitimate nonprofit charities to keep his scheme alive,’ Suthers said, ac. ‘Moreover, the IRS has no record of awarding tax-exempt status to a company he launched in January 2013, Say No2 Cancer,’ Coloradoan.com reported. On the site Yelp back in 2913, a trio of three reviewers awarded Boobies Rock! only one star out of five, with online user Domingo K. from Illinois slamming the organization as 'sleazy and dishonest.' In a review posted by Kelly H., from Arizona a few years ago, the woman wrote that she had worked for the charity as a promotional manager for two months, during which time it was her job to have the models tell costumers that all the proceeds from merchandise sales go toward breast cancer awareness. 'This is total lie!' Kelly stated. ‘This is a for profit company that gives very little to none of their money to breast cancer. I am doing everything I can to make sure that this scam is made known nation wide [sic]. Do not buy anything from this company!’","Adam Shyrock, 35, was ordered by a judge to return $1.89 million in gross receipts and pay $4 million in civil penalties .

"A Minnesota mother claims a faulty background check which labels her a murderer has ruined her reputation. Lorie Wosmek is suing The McDowell Agency and her local district after she was let go as a school's volunteer and made to feel a social pariah. The mother-of-two said that her life changed for the worse in the fall of 2012 when she agreed to a background check after years helping out  at Remer School District, even coaching one of their football teams. Fired: Lorie Wosmek was not allowed to volunteer at Remer School District because a wrong background check identified her as a murderer . 'Parents acted strange,' said Wosmek to CBS. 'People who said 'hi' to me before wouldn't say 'hi' anymore. Wosmek was suddenly told she could no longer work around children and the district said that they would let her know why she was being dumped in a letter. It arrived with a copy of her background check which showed up a woman with the same name, but wildly different past. 'All I saw on there was homicide,' said Wosmek. I burst into tears. False: This is the background check returned on Lorie Wosmek that ruined her life as a volunteer . Help: Wosmek once worked as a coach in the Remer School District and enjoyed her time as a volunteer . According to the wrong background check, Wosmek was supposed to have committed vehicular homicide. However, Wosmek had never committed or been convicted of this crime and tried to tell the district and the background check company,. She alleges the false check was passed around other school district's in the area for five months - which stopped her getting more work. The district denies this allegation. Denials: The Remer School District has said that it does not recognize any of Lorie Wosmek's claims . Wosmek says despite the error being recognized she has not been welcomed back. Again, the district denies not offering her more work as a volunteer. 'When people hear good news like 'she didn't commit the crime,' they don't tend to spread that around,' said Wosmek to CBS. The McDowell Agency, which is in St. Paul has admitted in court filings that their check was a mistake. A spokesperson told CBS, 'We believe the evidence will support our position that Ms. Wosmek's reputation was not impacted or harmed by anything we did.'","Lorie Wosmek is suing the Remer School District in Minnesota .

"Apple CEO Tim Cook once tried to offer Steve Jobs his liver in a desperate bid to prolong his life, but his predecessor refused, a new book reveals. Jobs had been suffering serious health problems as a result of his pancreatic cancer and by January 2009 - two years before his death - was in urgent need of a liver transplant. On learning this, Cook was so upset he took it upon himself to have his blood tested and found that he happened to have the same rare blood type as his good friend and mentor. Scroll down for video . Apple CEO Tim Cook (left) tried to offer his liver to his ailing mentor and predecessor Steve Jobs (right), a new book claims. Here they are pictured together during a product question and answer session . In Becoming Steve Jobs, a new biography by technology reporter Brent Schlender and Fast Company executive editor Rick Tetzeli, it's revealed that Cook discovered it was possible to transplant a portion of someone's liver to a recipient. Because it is a regenerative organ, the transplanted portion will grow to a functioning size, while the donor's liver would also repair. Bouyed by the findings, Cook visited Jobs at his home in Palo Alto to relay the good news. But Jobs outright refused. 'He cut me off at the legs, almost before the words were out of my mouth,' said Cook in the biography, according to Fast Company. '""No,"" he said. ""I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that"". Somebody that's selfish doesn’t reply like that. 'I mean, here’s a guy, he’s dying, he’s very close to death because of his liver issue and here’s someone healthy offering a way out.' Cook insisted that he was 'perfectly healthy' and stressed that the procedure would not put him at risk. But Jobs 'popped up in bed' and told him: 'No, I'm not doing that.' Cook said Jobs had very rarely ever shouted at him during the 13 years they had known each other, but 'this was one of them.' Even though he was gravely ill, the tech guru worked on Apple on the last very last day of his life, phoning colleagues from the confines of his bed with new ideas. He died at his home on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. The most commonly understood type of liver transplant involves the removal of a diseased liver to be replaced with a healthy liver taken from a deceased donor. However, another type of transplant has emerged in recent decades with developments in technology and medical techniques - the 'living donor liver transplantation.' This involves removing between 50 - 70per cent of the healthy liver from a living donor which is then transplanted into the recipient. Because of the liver's regenerative qualities, both the donor and the recipient can live with minimal complications and can regrow fully functioning livers based on the pieces they share. While there are side effects for donors, such as blood clots, these are relatively easy to deal with. Death for donors is extremely low, although it is a risk they must accept prior to surgery.

"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to make his first foreign trip since taking power three years ago, after accepting an invitation from Russia. He is among 26 world leaders who have agreed to attend celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. North Korea has not officially commented, but its leader's planned visit was today confirmed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Scroll down for video .

Event planning: Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Victory Day celebrations organising committee in the Kremlin today . The announcement comes just a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin reappeared in public after an unusually long 10-day absence that unleashed frenzied speculation about his whereabouts. The highlight of the May 9 celebrations will be a military parade in the Red Square overseen by President Putin. It is an annual event that will be expanded this year to include 15,000 troops, cadets and Cossacks, according to Russia's defense minister. Several Western leaders have snubbed invitations to the military parade because of Russia's role in the Ukraine conflict. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is among those staying away from the parade, but she softened the snub by deciding to visit Moscow the next day for a separate ceremony with Putin. Victory Day: Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting to plan the May celebrations marking the end of World War Two . The foreign minister said Merkel's decision to come to Moscow has helped to wreck the 'anti-Russian campaign'. He said some European leaders were still expected to come, including those from Slovakia, Norway, Greece and several Balkan nations. In addition to Kim, the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Mongolia, South Africa and Vietnam have confirmed their attendance.

'The president of Russia isn't just walking, he's hot-rodding around, driving his guests around behind the wheel,' said Atambayev. 'Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin) just drove me around the territory. That's just so there's no rumours.' Putin's absence occurred amid rumours of illness, a coup, or his Olympic gymnast 'lover' Alina Kabayeva giving birth to a child in Switzerland.

"He is  Australia's most notorious and well recognised criminal, but Ned Kelly may never have even existed if it weren't for his father stealing two pigs more than 170 years ago. Public records published on Findmypast.com on Friday trace Ned Kelly's path from before his father John Kelly  became a criminal in Ireland to years later when he would eventually do the same in Australia. Prison transfer records show John Kelly, also known as Red, was arrested for stealing two pigs back in 1841 and sent to Australia as a convict. Public records published on Findmypast.com on Friday trace Ned Kelly's path from before his father John Kelly became a criminal in Ireland to years later when he would eventually do the same in Australia . It was just a few years before The Great Famine in Ireland, which wiped out approximately 25 percent of the population due to mass starvation, according to Vicki Dawson from Findmypast. 'The area was hit quite hard by the famine between 1845 and 1852. He was transported a few years before it hit, so he may not have even survived if he hadn't stolen the pigs,' Ms Dawson said. 'If he hadn't come here, Ned Kelly may not have been born.' The move would become etched in Australia's history with his son Ned set to become the nation's most iconic criminal. 'His father was given his certificate of freedom and moved to Melbourne where he met Ned's mother,' Ms Dawson said. Ned Kelly's history an one of Australia's most notorious and well recognised criminal has been documented on Findmypast with prison records (pictured) and mugshots . Kelly's notorious criminal history is well known and Findmypast has a range of different records to back it up . Ned Kelly's first mug shot (pictured) has been published alongside transportation, land and criminal records tracking his Irish ancestry back to his great grandparents . He eloped with Ellen Quinn and they settled in the Victorian ranges north of Melbourne where he stole horses to supplement his income. The couple had seven children, including Ned, before he was arrested and jailed again. He died before finishing his sentence in 1866. Ned Kelly's notorious criminal history is well known and Findmypast has a range of different records to back it up, according to Ms Dawson. They have published his first mugshot, prison register and his father's records online in time for St Patrick's Day next week. Prison transfer records show John Kelly, also known as Red, was arrested for stealing two pigs back in 1841 and sent to Australia as a convict . Kelly and his gang, known for their armour protection, were shot in 1880 at Glenrowan, Victoria . 'There's descriptions on scars, eye colour - it's very detailed. Then you can look through transportation records and you can look back at his grandfather's evaluation records,' she said. 'With Ned Kelly we trace him right back to his great grandparents. Land records, census, criminal records - there's a huge amount of records to use to trace back Irish ancestry. Findmypast has 90 million Irish and migration records available online - the largest of any kind in the world, according to Ms Dawson.

"More than 50 people watched Raja Ram (right) beat his daughter in the middle of a road because he heard a false rumour that she was dating . More than 50 people watched a father beat his daughter in the middle of a road because he heard a false rumour that she was dating. Raja Ram grabbed his daughter by the hair before slapping and kicking her continuously near the Domlur flyover, India, around 8.30am yesterday. One of the silent bystanders was the girl's mother. The victim was only rescued after two female workers from a nearby firm wrestled Ram, a sub-inspector for Madurai police, off her and locked her in their car for more than 30 minutes. Niveditha and Archana said they were on their way to breakfast when they saw the 'shocking' attack, the Times of India reported. After the incident Niveditha wrote on Facebook page The Logical Indian: 'On our way to [the] office, me and my friend Archana were shocked to see a girl aged about 25 being beaten black and blue by a strong well built man, with at least 50 people standing on the street and simply watching. 'He was grabbing the girl by her hair, slapping her, kicking her in the groin as she fell down on the road. 'Archana started pushing the man while I tried untangling the girls hair from his fingers' (sic). The two women described how they initially tried to get a young man with a motorcycle to take the girl but Ram stole the keys. They then tried to hire a rickshaw but Ram again got in their way. Eventually the two women locked the young girl in their car and called the police, who arrived half and hour later to find Ram sitting on the bonnet. Niveditha said: 'The parents had heard rumours of their daughter having an affair and was hence ""teaching her a lesson"", refusing to listen to her or believe her denying the affair. 'The father wanted to take her back to Madurai, against the wishes of the daughter and forcibly marry her to someone of their choice.

But no one did.' When they got to the police station the girl decided that she did not want to file a complaint and Ram has been let go. A police spokesman said: 'This is a minor incident and a family matter. Also, no complaint has been filed.' There will be no further investigations. The Facebook post has since been liked by nearly 35,000 people. It comes days after documentary India's Daughter, about a 2012 gang rape on a 23-year-old girl, was banned from being broadcast in India over fear it would fuel public anger.","Raja Ram grabbed his daughter's hair before slapping and kicking her .

'That usually wasn't enough, so I would have chicken nuggets with it as well. I also ate Arby's frequently. Large roast beef sandwich, large curly fries and drink, and a side of mozzarella sticks. I ate fast food every day,' he added. In the spring of 2012, Mr Flemming was playing Draw Something, a Pictionary-inspired app, which randomly matched him with Jackie Eastham, a woman 20 years his senior in London. He began chatting with Ms Eastham, who has myotonic muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes progressive wasting of the muscles. To manage her condition, Ms Eastham follows an extremely healthy lifestyle, and never takes her well-being for granted. A friendship grew, and Mr Flemming began to confide in her about his weight problems, and about his drinking - a secret he had kept even from his parents. He was expecting sympathy, and admits he was thrown by what was actually a brutally-honest response. 'She told me that I was wasting my life and that I should be ashamed that I was throwing it away when there are so many people out there who are fighting to stay alive, herself included,' Mr Flemming wrote. On October 13, 2012, he made the decision to quit drinking cold-turkey, and to drastically change the rest of his life too. Friendship: Jackie Eastham, a London-based woman 20 years his senior (left) who he met online in of 2012,  inspired Mr Flemming (right) to turn his life around, after she told him bluntly that he was wasting his life . Demo: Mr Flemming displays his excess skin (left) and what his arm will look like once the skin has been removed (right) New hobbies: In a bid to get fit, he began by simply walking in place for five minutes, then started running, and now, Mr Flemming in an avid cycler . 'Quitting alcohol was the most difficult step for me,' he tells Daily Mail Online, before advising that anyone else planning to stop drinking should consult a doctor about it first, because quitting cold turkey – like he did – can be incredibly dangerous. 'I wasn't aware of how bad the withdrawals were going to be, so the first few days were like torture,' he recalls. 'I had cold sweats and couldn't sleep. I also found myself fighting extreme boredom at first and it really helped having Jackie to talk to.' Still, Mr Flemming managed to quit without the assistance of rehab or a support group, and has been sober ever since. 'I think AA is a great support for people, but it never really appealed to me,' he remarks, adding that he is an atheist. 'I'm not a spiritual person and I don't really like the idea of surrendering my will to a ""higher power"". 'I like to think that I am in control of myself and it is all up to me.' Leaps and bounds: Mr Flemming, pictured (left) with Ms Eastham and (right) at a race, has something of an 'addiction' to running, and his next goal is to run a full marathon . Overhaul: 'I cut out all processed sugar and red meat,' says Mr Flemming, pictured before his weight loss. 'I limited myself to 1,400 calories per day for a long time' Once Mr Flemming had kicked the bottle, he began to address the rest of his lifestyle. 'I cut out all processed sugar and red meat,' he says. 'I limited myself to 1,400 calories per day for a long time. It was difficult at first, but it taught me to choose foods that were low in calories, but filled me up. I ate chicken breasts and rice quite frequently.' In a bid to get fit, he began by simply walking in place for five minutes. 'I did it little by little,' Mr Flemming states. 'I started walking outside and could barely make it around the block and I added to that little by little. Eventually I walked my first mile.' With Ms Eastham cheering him on by phone, Mr Fleming got to the point where he was walking five miles every morning. 'I dropped 100lbs over three months. It came off really fast. I was over 350lbs still when I started running in little increments at a time,' he says. 'The snowball was now rolling downhill and couldn’t be stopped,' He also began cycling 44 miles to and from work every Friday. Mr Flemming has since developed something of an 'addiction' to running, and his next goal is to run a full marathon. Getting thinner: Mr Flemming remarks, 'I dropped 100lbs over three months. It came off really fast. I was over 350lbs still when I started running in little increments at a time' Just friends? As for his relationship with Ms Eastham, and whether it ever turned romantic, Mr Flemming remains coy and simply says, 'we are very close' Mr Flemming and Ms Eastham began a website and a Facebook group, Team 383, to motivate others to achieve their weight loss goals. 'Brian has become a mentor and motivator to many throughout his journey and plans to continue paying it forward in the future, with the hopes of going back to school to become a therapist specializing in weight loss, depression and anxiety,' the GoFundMe page reads. 'If we manage to exceed Brian's goal, he has graciously offered to donate funds to Muscular Dystrophy charities in honor of his mentor.' As for his relationship with Ms Eastham, and whether it ever turned romantic, Mr Flemming remains coy. 'I always tread lightly around this,' he says with a smile.

"The Prince of Wales has made an impassioned and personal plea to stop plastic being dumped in the oceans. Charles said that he was ‘haunted’ and ‘horrified’ by the issue which needed to be solved for the sake of future generations. ‘Speaking as a grandfather with a new grandchild due to appear in this world in a month’s time, I think we probably owe it to everyone else’s grandchildren to grasp that solution,’ he said.

Saying hello: Camilla and Elena Allbritton (front left) greet each other before heading inside for the reception . The prince was addressing a conference in Washington DC at the start of a tour of the US with the Duchess of Cornwall. ‘One issue that we absolutely cannot ignore is that of the increasing quantity of plastic waste in the marine environment,’ he said. ‘I was horrified to learn that, according to recent research, we collectively allow as much as eight million tonnes of plastic to enter the oceans every year. ‘Today, almost half of all marine mammals now have plastic in their gut and I know I am not the only person haunted by the tragic images of seabirds, particularly albatrosses, that have been found dead, washed up on beaches after mistaking a piece of plastic for a meal.’ Visit: Prince Charles tours the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial with President and CEO of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Project Foundation Harry Johnson (second from right), Reverend Jesse Jackson (third from left), Dr Ed Jackson (left), chief architect of the memorial, and President of the Tommy Hilfiger Corporate Foundation Guy Vickers (right) Pointing out: Charles and Camilla tour the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall during their visit to the US .

Prince Charles remained positive, saying there was a solution to the problem caused by the ‘throw-away society’. He said we had to move quicker to a circular economy – whereby ‘materials are recovered, recycled and reused instead of created, used and then thrown away’. The conference was attended by David Miliband, former foreign secretary and co-chairman of the Global Ocean Commission, which helped stage the event. Since 2008, the Mail has campaigned to get rid of plastic bags, many of which make their way into landfill and oceans. The Banish the Bag campaign secured a major victory in June last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in England. The charge, which will be introduced by October, is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £100million a year for good causes, including a raft of green clean-up groups that tackle litter in green spaces, rivers and beaches. Similar charging schemes in Ireland have led to a fall of around 90 per cent in the distribution of the bags. Environmental campaigners say the carriers, each used for just 20 minutes on average, take up to 1,000 years to degrade. In the meantime, they blight the environment and many are ingested by wildlife, in particular marine mammals and sea birds which can suffer lingering deaths as a result. As well as the serious harm to wildlife, they blight Britain’s coastline, with some 70 bags littering every mile. The Prince and Duchess arrived in Washington DC for a three-day visit to the country on Tuesday night. First they visited monuments to President Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jnr in the heart of the capital city. At King’s memorial they were joined by leading figures from the US civil rights movement, including Jesse Jackson and Congressman John Lewis, who organised the famous Selma march in 1965 which has recently been dramatised in the Oscar-nominated movie Selma. As they climbed the steps to Lincoln’s memorial, Charles told a well-wisher that he was ‘trying to work out at the moment’.","He said we 'owe it to everyone else’s grandchildren to grasp a solution'

"Sophie Brannan, 11, was killed when she was hit by Christopher Hannah in November last year . A heroin addict is facing a long jail sentence after he admitted killing an 11-year-old girl in a hit and run crash while on bail. Christopher Hannah was high on drugs when he ploughed into Sophie Brannan, her friend and her friend’s uncle as they walked home from local shops on November 14 last year. Hannah, 33, lost control of his hired Vauxhall Astra, mounted the pavement and hit the three victims so hard from behind they were thrown over the car. Sophie suffered catastrophic head injuries and died the following day in hospital. Her ten-year-old friend had a badly broken leg and the 36-year-old uncle suffered a serious shoulder injury. Hannah, the son of a bankrupt businessman, fled the scene in Sandbank Street in Glasgow’s Maryhill – but later called a friend to say he had been ‘driving like a madman’ and had hit someone. At the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, the father of three pleaded guilty to culpable homicide and was remanded in custody for sentence next month. The court heard Hannah’s car, which he had hired a month earlier, mounted the pavement and hit the gable end of a nearby building before careering into Sophie and her companions. Prosecutor Allan Nicol said: ‘This caused them to be thrown onto the bonnet, windscreen and roof of the vehicle before falling onto the ground. Another motorist witnessed the carnage and immediately turned back to help poor Sophie.’ Witnesses saw Hannah speed into Maryhill Road, with his badly dented car being ‘driven erratically’ before he crashed into a taxi. The cab driver tailed Hannah, who eventually stopped a short distance away. Mr Nicol said: ‘At that point, the accused was trying to pull the damaged front bumper, then he stopped and walked away before starting to run off. ‘Both the taxi driver and his passengers noticed he was under the influence of some substance.’ Paramedics took Sophie to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, where she was found to have swelling to her brain, several fractures and broken bones. Tributes left at the scene after the crash last year. Hannah fled scene but pleaded guilty at High Court in Glasgow yesterday . She remained in intensive care overnight, but died the following day. The court heard Sophie’s friend suffered a serious leg break which will require long-term physiotherapy. Mr Nicol said: ‘She also suffers episodes of withdrawal and angry outbursts. She is due to attend for psychiatric assessment in order to come to terms with her injuries and the loss of Sophie.’ The girl’s uncle also suffered a number of fractures, but was initially released from hospital two days later. However, he eventually required surgery and is likely to have ‘long-term restriction’ in movement to his right shoulder. The court heard Hannah stayed on the run for two days after Sophie’s death, despite promising his partner he would hand himself in. When police finally arrested him, they found heroin hidden inside his boxer shorts. Sophie suffered catastrophic head injuries and died the following day in hospital. Her ten-year-old friend had a badly broken leg and the 36-year-old uncle suffered a serious shoulder injury . Accident investigators later concluded Hannah was solely to blame for the crash. They said he took ‘a conscious decision’ to drive while impaired and failed to stop because he knew he had taken drugs and was ‘aware of the ramifications’. Hannah also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, attempting to defeat the ends of justice and possessing heroin. He has 14 previous convictions for crimes including possessing an offensive weapon and road traffic charges and was on bail at the time, having been freed from Glasgow’s Justice of the Peace Court two months before the crash. Hannah’s advocate Thomas Ross said: ‘He has asked to state publicly his apologies for those affected by this terrible tragedy.’","Christopher Hannah, 33, was high on drugs when he hit Sophie Brannan .

"An eight-year-old schoolboy who dressed as a character from Fifty Shades of Grey for World Book Day was laughed at by teachers, while a second school child was told he couldn't take part for wearing the same costume. Cole Froom pulled on one of his father's suits and arrived at Lakes Primary School in Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire, dressed as Christian Grey - where staff found his costume 'funny'. However, in Manchester, Liam Scholes was 'excluded' from lessons after teachers at Sale High School branded his outfit, inspired by actor Jamie Dornan, was inappropriate. The 11-year-old pupil was dressed in a shiny grey suit, equipped with cable ties and a face mask. Scroll down for video . Cole Froom, eight, (left) in his version of character Christian Grey from Fifty Shades of Grey. Jamie Dornan, (right), played the character in the recent blockbuster hit . But Cole's 28-year-old mother, Joanne Dickinson, was surprised when she heard Liam Scholes had been disciplined for the outfit, after her son's teacher reacted by laughing. She said: 'I took him into the classroom and his teacher asked who he was and he said Christian Grey and the teacher just started laughing. 'Some of the kids had never heard of him so not many knew who he was dressed as but those who did thought it was funny'. Miss Dickinson, who has an older daughter, Caitlyn, 10, and a 12-month-old baby called Harrison, said the Year 4 pupil came up with the outfit idea himself. 'He was asking on Wednesday about what he could go as for World Book Day. I'd done some researching and couldn't come up with anything. 'Then he suggested going as Christian Grey himself. He'd seen that I had the book and heard me go on about seeing the film. 'He hasn't read the book or seen the film but there are adverts on in the day and he's asked about it. But he thinks it's about a rich man that owns a big house and a helicopter.' Cole (left) pictured with his mother, Joanne Dickinson (centre), sister Caitlyn, 10, (right) and 12-month-old baby brother Harrison (in Miss Dickinson's arms) Cole asked his father, Stuart Froom, who is separated from Miss Dickinson, if he could borrow one of his suits. After some persuasion the 35-year-old carer allowed him to wear his black shirt, grey tie and grey trousers. 'His dad popped in between his work hours with the outfit, but did say he didn't think it was a good idea, but we went ahead with it anyway. 'Most of the parents at the school thought it was funny. One or two have made little digs saying he shouldn't know what that is - but he doesn't know what it is.' Father Stuart Froom (centre) let Cole (right) borrow one of his shirts and ties to go as Christian Grey for World Book Day on Thursday. Sister Caitlyn, who is in Year 6, didn't get to dress up for the event . Caitlin, 10, (left) with Cole (right) and their baby brother Harrison (centre). When Cole arrived at school his teacher, dressed as Harry Potter, found the outfit funny . The full-time mother said she 'couldn't understand' why staff at Sale High School had taken such drastic action over the costume. She said: 'I thought it went a bit far. I was half-expecting one of my son's teachers to pull me up on it today but they didn't.' Children around the country were encouraged to go to school dressed as literary characters on Thursday as part of the global event. The Fifty Shades Of Grey novels by E L James series have sold more than 100million copies and tell the story of the relationship between a college student and a wealthy businessman. They are notorious for their explicit scenes featuring sex acts and bondage, which some campaigners claim promotes domestic abuse. Liam Scholes (pictured) was told off by teachers after turning up to school dressed as Christian Grey - complete with cable ties and a sleeping mask . Liam, pictured, was told he couldn't appear in his class photo wearing the outfit from the controversial movie . Cole's experience was completely different to Liam Scholes from Sale High School in Manchester who also arrived in class dressed as Christian Grey from the novel. Teachers objected when the youngster appeared with cable ties and an eye mask which were both props from the controversial book. Staff then rang Liam's mother Nicola, who herself is a primary school teacher, to tell her that the outfit was inappropriate. She said: 'We thought it was funny. We were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as Christian Grey. 'At first we laughed it off but the we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea. 'He went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties. The cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them. We didn't think there would be a problem. 'I got a phone call home from the school saying the outfit was inappropriate and that he had been excluded from taking part or being in any of the photographs.' Among the more traditional Oliver Twists, Burglar Bills and Where's Wallys, schools around Britain welcomed some more unusual 'literary' characters yesterday. Jamie Peek, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, surprised his friends at Woods Loke primary by turning up as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. His mother, Caroline, said: 'He's mad about cars and a massive Top Gear fan so he told me he wanted to go as Jeremy Clarkson.' Jamie Peek from Lowestoft, Suffolk went to World Book Day as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson . Mrs Peek added: 'It was a bit of a strange costume to pull together but I got a wig from eBay and trimmed it to look right. Most of the clothes are his own. He even impersonated Jeremy Clarkson's grumpy faced Twitter profile picture for the class photo. 'He's got a number of Top Gear annuals and books. I think it's good for his reading.' Parents around the country were divided over whether superheroes more famous for films than books, such as Ironman and Spiderman, count as literary characters. But the biggest debate on Twitter centred around the army of girls dressed up as Princess Elsa and Princess Anna from Disney's Frozen seen turning up at schools. Benjamin Johncock tweeted: 'A little girl is dressed up as Elsa from Frozen. I want to shout at her, THAT’S NOT A BOOK' Hundreds of girls around the UK arrived dressed as Princess Elsa from Frozen, though some parents questioned whether the Disney characters is truly literary . Claire Anderson added: 'My daughter is VERY unimpressed by the 23(!!) girls dressed up in Frozen costumes for #WorldBookDay at school' A website user called saraurora added: 'The boy dressed as an oompa-loompa in a sea of Elsa's and superheroes is my idol' Others insisted Frozen now has plenty of follow-up books based on the film and is an adapted version the classic Snow Queen tale. Atticus Beaterband replied: 'Frozen is a riff on the Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen so technically it maybe could sneak in under the bar?'","Cole Froom, a Year 4 pupil, arrived at school dressed as Christian Grey .

"Prince Charles might not be known for his love of ten pin bowling but at least his attempt didn't end up in the gutter. Instead, the Prince of Wales managed to knock over four pins - much to the delight of veterans and a watching Duchess of Cornwall - although he wasn't pleased with the result. Charles was at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington D.C to meet veterans on the morning of his third day in the US. Scroll down for video . Preparing to strike: Prince Charles prepares to make his move during his bowling match . And release: Charles swings his arm back and releases the ball, watched by Army veterans . The American equivalent of the UK's Royal Chelsea Hospital, it houses men who have spent their careers working in all three services. The six-lane bowling alley gives the veterans who live at the home in Washington a recreational work out and keeps them active. With the Prince of Wales for the visit was Camilla who looked wonderful in a pale gold coat and who looked on admiringly as Charles tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself. Chief Petty Officer Patricia Kirchner, who manages the alley, told that Charles, as he walked over to the lanes, said: 'I've got a couple of bowling balls picked out, just try one.' With the Duchess of Cornwall at his side Charles, who had turned down the offer of some bowling shoes, confessed 'I haven't done this for a long time'. But he gingerly picked up a bowling ball and sent it down the fifth lane more in hope than expectation. And its off! Charles releases the ball and waits to find out how he's done . Not good enough! Charles managed to knock down four pins but didn't seem pleased with the result . His execution looked good but the bowl ran wide and clipped three pins that toppled over and he turned to Camilla and said: 'At least I got one'. Bill Bowen, an 80-year-old retired staff sergeant from the US Air Force, said: 'He did pretty good,' adding, 'I told him I was the worst bowler in this alley and he said ""no, I am"".' The couple had begun their day by visiting President Abraham Lincoln's cottage and were met by Erin Carlson Mast who is in charge of maintaining the property. Looking around: The royal couple are shown the veterans' art room . Having a chat: Charles and Camilla appeared to be enjoying their tour and chatted to veterans . Hello there: Charles bends down to a veteran using one of the machines in the gym . Mrs Mast also had presents to dispense: a book entitled Lincoln's Sanctuary for Charles and another called What Do You Do With An Idea for his grandson, Prince George. Afterwards, the royal couple were ushered to the Armed Forces Retirement Home and were whisked into the Scott Building which houses many of the residents. Along with a visit to the bowling alley, the royal couple were also shown the library, which boasts stunning views of the Washington Monument, and the wellness facilities for the pensioners who live there. Enjoying himself: Charles, seen here chatting to veterans, has received a rapturous reception in the US . Having a look: Charles and Camilla pose outside President Abraham Lincoln's Washington D.C cottage . On their way: The royal couple leave Lincoln's Cottage en route to their second engagement . Stunning: It was at the cottage that Lincoln dreamed up the 13th amendment which bans slavery . The centre, which sits in the same grounds as Lincoln's Cottage, is one of two in the US, with the other located in Gulfport, Mississippi, and was established in the late 19th century. Not far away is the cottage itself, which is particularly notable because it was there that Abraham Lincoln lived for a quarter of his presidency. He also used the cottage during the American Civil War and dreamed up the 13th amendment, which outlaws slavery, while living there. Charles and Camilla are on the third day of a four-day state trip that has been described as 'your grandfather's royal visit' by the local Washington Post.

Prince Popular: Charles is surrounded by students during a visit to the Carlos Rosario School . In a piece headlined, 'Camilla and Charles don’t get the WillKat [William and Kate] treatment, but it’s still royal', the paper went on to contrast the 'high-volume excitement worthy of boy-band' that greeted the Duke  of Cambridge with the quieter one offered to his father. But while Charles and Camilla aren't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation, the visit is seen as 'crucial' - for Charles at least. That echoes comments made by British Ambassador to the US Sir Peter Westmacott who described the tour as being a fillip for Anglo-American relations. Later, the royal couple will be whisked to the White House where they will meet President Obama in the Oval Office for the second time since he took office. President Obama is the sixth American president to entertain Charles, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last.

"A polite sign posted outside a toilet at a shopping centre has raised the question – at what age should children go to public restrooms alone? The notice, which reads ‘please boys over 6 years of age use men’s restroom’, was taped to the wall of a women’s toilet at an Oklahoma outlet mall, in America. The Oklahoma City Moms Blog posted the image on Facebook, sparking debate worldwide. ‘If you were shopping at a local mall and saw this picture, what would your reaction be?,’ the photo’s caption read. The post comes after calls for more gender-neutral family bathrooms where dads and mums can both take their children. Scroll down for video . This sign, which reads 'please boys over 6 years of age use men's restroom', was taped to the wall of a women's toilet and went viral after it was posted on Facebook . Earlier this week Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher raised the issue on his Facebook page when he complained: ‘There are NEVER diaper changing stations in men’s public restrooms.’ The new dad added: ‘The first public men's room that I go into that has one gets a free shout out on my FB page! ‪#‎BeTheChange.’ Parenting expert Jo Ryan from support service Babybliss told Daily Mail Australia the age of when a child should go into a public toilet alone is a ‘tough question’. ‘It depends on the child really,’ she said. ‘I think six is too young. I’m not sure if I’d want them to go in a public toilet on their own,’ Ryan explained. ‘Some boys want to do that at that age, you have to judge the child and whether it is a safe environment. Toilets are always an unknown. In Australia, many shopping centres have family bathrooms for parents to take their kids . ‘For me, I don‘t think I would let them go in on their own, I would want to take them with me. It’s usually when they are a bit older -around 7 or 8 – that they want to go in alone,’ Ryan said. ‘What if the child has got a disability or a mental age of two or needs assistance?,’ she asked. Ryan also pointed out that in Australia most public toilets in modern shopping centres have a family room that can be used by mums and dads. ‘I actually took my goddaughter into a family toilet yesterday at Bondi Junction, Westfield, in Sydney, she’s three. Earlier this week Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher raised the issue of gender neutral bathrooms on his Facebook page . Ashton Kutcher, seen here with his partner Mila Kunis, sparked the debate about a lack of baby changing rooms in men's toilets . At what age would you allow your child to go into a public toilet on their own? At what age would you allow your child to go into a public toilet on their own? Now share your opinion . ‘I thought “is it only for women?” but the sign says ‘parents’ and there was a man and a women sign, so I would think most men are allowed to go into them,’ Ryan reasoned. ‘I think in this country in the big shopping centres they do cater for men, we don’t have changing rooms in our public toilets whereas the obviously do in America. ‘We have actual parenting rooms where you can change nappies, there are toys and my goddaughter didn’t want to leave.’ Ryan did note that in some places such as restaurants there are not even any changing facilities. Sydney dad Mark Elias, whose son Jacob is almost two years old, told Daily Mail Australia he would let his child go to a public bathroom at ‘11 to 12 years’. ‘But it depends on the kid and the maturity level and the place you are at,’ he added. 'This day and age it's better to cautious.' Meanwhile, Claudia Bowman, a mother of three and member of the Kings Cross Parents and Carers Association, in Sydney, said: 'I think it's clear this sign is inappropriate. I can't imagine it complies with any hospitality standards code.' 'Parents I know make decisions based on the needs of their child as an individual. Maturity of a child has nothing to do with their birth age. Some six year old children have the maturity of a four year old,' Ms Bowman explained. 'Part of being a parent is making the best decision for your child's welfare regardless of the pressure and expectations others impose. 'Personally I'll be doing as I see best for each of my three children regardless of this sign,' she added. At what age would you stop accompanying your child into a public bathroom?","The sign was taped to the wall of a toilet at a mall in America .

The sub is then topped up with cheddar cheese slices, chili cheese sauce and fiery jalapenos. Let's not forget, the 'X-tra' is extra indeed; the sandwich is supposedly 17.5cm in length, which is 4.8cm longer than the chain's largest burger. AVAILABILITY: Germany and Austria. CALORIE CONTENT: 808 calories. 3. Burger King's fondue burger is composed of cheddar, mozzarella, Parmesan, Emmental, Gouda and even a splash of white wine . The fondue sauce comes by itself, or with the Beef Fondue Burger (right) or the Chicken Fondue Burger (left) 3. Forget ketchup or mayonnaise, Burger King's Fondue Burger is definitely one of the more bizarre burger concoctions, combining an American favourite with the French delicacy. The sauce supposedly includes cheddar, mozzarella, Parmesan, Emmental, Gouda and even a splash of white wine. It's available by itself or with the Burger King beef or chicken burger. AVAILABILITY: Japan . CALORIE CONTENT: 782 calories. 4. McDonald's McGrillschnagg includes a layer of bacon with grilled pork sausage curled on top, topped with cheese,  all resting on top of a rösti - the Swiss version of hash browns. 4.

KFC'S Zinger Double Down King is comprised of a beef patty, bacon, cheese sauce and barbecue sauce sandwiched between two slabs of fried chicken . 'No bun, all meat': The advertising slogan of KFC's Zinger Double Down King says it all, as the sandwich forgoes any sort of bread bun . 5. A variation on KFC's aforementioned Double Down Dog is its South Korean burger cousin, the Zinger Double Down King. In a similar manner to the 'Dog', the bun is omitted in place of two fried chicken patties.

"Timing is all. Just as Chancellor George Osborne ratcheted up company car tax for thousands of motorists, German giant BMW unveiled its new 'budget buster' — its first mainstream plug-in petrol-electric hybrid SUV. The 'green' BMW X5 xDrive40e  can be recharged at home, can run on electric power only and switches constantly between petrol and electric power while on the move. It'll help keep company car tax far lower than for a conventionally fuelled version. The two-litre petrol engine and the 113bhp electric drive together generate 313bhp of pulling power. The new 'green' BMW X5 xDrive40e (pictured) can be charged at home, can run on electric power only and switches constantly between petrol and electric power while on the move . It has a top speed of 131 mph, will sprint to 62mph in 6.8 seconds and will be launched at next month's New York Motor Show. Average fuel consumption of up to 85 mpg and CO2 emissions — on which company car tax and road tax are based — are a low 77g/km. BMW says: 'Short, everyday journeys in urban areas can easily be completed with zero exhaust emissions, while actual fuel consumption is reduced substantially when driving for distances of up to approximately 15 miles in urban traffic. 'Driving in this way equates to an equivalent 94.2mpg.' However, the Budget measures also mean most company car drivers will be thousands of pounds worse off. There will be a 3 percentage point hike in the tax in 2019-20. It means a higherrate taxpayer with a £28,000 Nissan Qashqai 1.6-litre company car will be £1,008 worse off after just five years with a total annual benefit-in-kind tax bill of £3,360. City accountant Deloitte says the hikes are unfair on company car drivers locked into three or four-year deals who 'in good faith' chose a frugal model, only to find it re-classified just a couple of years later as 'a gas-guzzler', and taxed accordingly. They are the chilling words most likely to strike horror into the heart of any long-suffering person whose car-nut partner has time on their hands: 'I quite fancy doing a car restoration project.' The presenters behind Discovery Channel TV show Wheeler Deelers have picked out their top five restorations in a new manual (pictured) So if you can't face the reality, why not present your other half with a new book about the subject to keep them distracted? The presenters behind the Discovery Channel's hit TV show Wheeler Dealers, Mike Brewer and Edd China, have picked their top five restorations. It marks the release of the new Wheeler Dealers Car Restoration Manual (pictured below — Haynes, £22.99) and the new series starting on Monday. The manual goes behind the scenes to reflect on ten of the most popular restorations from the first 12 years of the show. The cars featured are: Austin Mini, Jaguar E-Type, Lamborghini Urraco S, Land Rover Discovery, Mazda MX-5, Peugeot 205 GTi, Porsche 911 Targa, Subaru Impreza WR X, Amphicar, and the Willys MB Jeep. Of the Mini restoration, Mike Brewer says: 'The Mini is definitely one of my all-time favourite classics, and is just such good fun to drive. If you want a small classic that'll be easy to work on, this is the car for you; and there's a great owners' scene, so you'll never be stuck for help or advice.' ? Cars made here are becoming even more British as the amount of parts deployed that are made in the UK has risen by a fifth. Domestic parts makers sold 19 per cent more components to UK-based manufacturers last year than in 2013, say new figures from the Automotive Council. But the 'Britishness' of cars manufactured here is still far less than 40 years ago. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says around a third of the components in a UK-built car are sourced domestically, compared to more than 90 per cent in the mid-Seventies. Think of Jeep and you think of America. But maybe not for much longer. For the new Jeep Renegade scores a few considerable firsts, not least being built in Italy. Jeep's debut in the small SUV market features a nine-speed gearbox, along with a 7in full-colour multi-view display. It is also the first car from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to be jointly developed by Italian and American engineers. The new Jeep Renegade was built in Italy and features a nine-speed gearbox, along with a 7in full-colour multi-view display . As such it is also the first Jeep to be built in Europe, but sold in the U.S. It also features a 'My Sky' sunroof that gives occupants a true open-air driving experience. Jeep, now along with Chrysler owned by Fiat, says that although built in Italy, the Renegade had to be instantly recognisable as a Jeep. It'll be sold in 100 markets globally. Designers were challenged to come up with a look that would symbolise Jeep's U.S. heritage while appealing to youthful, adventurous buyers. The result is rugged yet chic, and preserves classic styling cues such as the seven-slot grille, round headlamps and straight-line wheel arches. Its two petrol engines are the 110hp 1.6-litre E-torQ unit, and a 1.4-litre MultiAir II turbo, which comes with power outputs of 140 and 170hp.","This model keeps company car tax lower than conventionally fuelled cars .

"Television personality Shaw Taylor, best known for hosting pioneering crime-solving programme Police 5, has died. The 90-year-old made a name for himself presenting the ITV show for 30 years, urging viewers to stay on the lookout for crime with his catchphrase 'keep 'em peeled'. His partner, Shirley Ferrari, was at his side when he died at their home in Totland, Isle of Wight, yesterday. He is also survived by his son, Richard, born to late wife Ianette, known as Jane. Scroll down for video . TV personality: Shaw Taylor made a name for himself presenting Police 5 for 30 years (seen sitting down in a 1976 episode). Last year, then aged 89, he returned to the screens (right) when Channel 5 revived the show . His partner, Shirley Ferrari, was at his side when he died at their home in Totland, Isle of Wight, yesterday. He is also survived by his son, Richard, born to late wife Ianette, known as Jane (pictured with Mr Taylor) Mr Taylor served in the RAF during the Second World War before training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. Following a brief stint as a stage actor, Mr Taylor became a radio and television presenter, acting as quizmaster on shows including This Is Your Chance, Tell The Truth and Ditto. Award: Mr Shaw, flanked by police officers, outside Buckingham Palace with his MBE in 1985 . In the early Sixties he had a spell presenting a music show, Friday Spectacular, on Radio Luxembourg with Muriel Young. But it was as the face of Police 5 - a forerunner to shows such as Crimewatch - that Shaw established himself as a household name. In each five-minute episode, the first of which was aired in 1962, Shaw would present details of real crimes and appeal to members of the public to help solve them. The programme often yielded successful results. In 1986 he urged the public to help recover priceless medallions stolen from a 'distinguished lady' - who viewers were told was not the Queen - at Kew Palace, according to the Guardian. On another occasion, a burglar was arrested after the items he stole from a photographic college in Birmingham were shown on the programme. And in a 1985 episode of the show, the presenter was seen hunting through items at a Teddington Police Station as he tried to find property that had been stolen from his flat. He later presented a spin-off show called Junior Police 5, which was also known as JP5. The TV presenter was awarded an MBE in 1985. The presenter announced his semi-retirement in 1992 after the franchise was won by Meridian Broadcasting and retired to the Isle of Wight. Last year, then aged 89, Mr Taylor returned to British screens when Channel 5 revived the show with new presenters. He appeared on each programme for a short segment, reuniting with victims of theft with their property.

"The financial crash has left the poor even poorer than they were before the recession – while the rich have got richer, a new report has revealed. Despite the economic collapse in 2008, the average financial wealth of the richest 20 per cent has soared by almost two-thirds between 2005 and 2012/13. The poorest families meanwhile have seen a collapse in their savings and higher debts than before the downturn, a report by the Social Market Foundation think-tank found. Despite the economic collapse in 2008, the average financial wealth of the richest 20 per cent has soared by almost two-thirds between 2005 and 2012/13 . The report said those aged 25 to 36 and those on the lowest incomes are 'ill-prepared for future financial shocks or rises in interest rates', limiting the capacity of consumer spending to fuel growth in the UK economy. It cast doubt on claims that the UK population as a whole had reined in spending in order to pay off debts and build up savings in response to the crash. In fact, it found that most of the saving took place among the top 20 per cent of earners, who built up savings in the aftermath of the crisis to the point that their average financial wealth increased by 64 per cent between 2005 and 2012/13. The proportion of high-income individuals with debts fell from 43 per cent to 31 per cent over the same period. By contrast, the 20 per cent on the lowest incomes were unable to pay off debts and start saving. Over the same period, the value of debt held by poorer households rose by 67 per cent - equivalent to around 28 per cent of their income - and use of overdrafts rose, while savings shrank to an average of less than six days' worth of income. The amount being saved by families has steadily fallen since the Coalition took over, as people dip into their savings . The intergenerational gap in incomes and wealth widened over the same period, as the amount of savings held by 26-35 year-olds fell by 36 per cent. While the proportion of this age-group in debt fell, the average amount owed by those with debts increased by 45 per cent. Just 45 per cent of 26 to 35-year-olds owned a home in 2012/13, sharply down from the 74 per cent seen in 2005. The report's co-author, SMF chief economist Nida Broughton, said: 'Our findings show that the wealth gap between rich and poor and young and old increased further during the downturn. 'The economic uncertainty following the crisis prompted many to pay down their debts and build up their savings. But the young and those on low incomes missed out. 'Greater support is needed to help these individuals prepare for the future; yet this will be a challenging feat. It is likely that the process of repairing their personal finances will only begin once sustained wage growth materialises.'","Financial wealth of the richest 20 per cent has soared by almost two-thirds .

"A baby who only has half a heart has defied the odds after suffering a stroke and battling through four open heart surgeries. Jack Stevens was born with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) which means the left side of his heart did not form properly. Jack, from Hartlepool, County Durham, has spent half of his life in hospital after having four open heart surgeries and five other operations. He has also suffered a stroke and  had to be resuscitated three times. Jack Stevens, now 15 months, was born with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) which means the left side of his heart did not form properly.

Jack had to be given up to 12 different medications up to four times a day, but now only needs three different medications via a syringe. He is pictured here (left and right) at one years old . At just one-week-old, Jack underwent three stages of the Norwood procedure - a surgery performed on the heart to improve blood flow. He was eventually allowed home for the first time in April last year but returned back to Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, three months later after suffering a stroke. He then endured a string of gruelling operations and is finally at home with father Chris, and mother, Ashton Hodge, 27, a charity worker. He is now on the brink of taking his first steps and speaking for the first time. Mr Stevens, an engineer, said: 'It's a lifelong condition so he will need a transplant at some point in his life but surgeons don't know when yet. 'He'll never be able to do any real physical activity. 'Jack had to be given up to 12 different medications up to four times a day but he only needs three different medications via a syringe at the moment.

'We're both so proud of him - he's a very inspirational boy.' Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a condition where the left lower pumping chamber of the heart does not develop properly so is much smaller than usual. The mitral valve between the left ventricle and the upper left filling chamber is often closed or very small. In addition, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body is also smaller than usual. This means that the heart is unable to pump blood around the body effectively. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a form of congenital heart disease - a term used to describe a problem with the heart's structure and function due to abnormal development before birth. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a condition in which the left lower pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) does not develop properly. In children with the condition, the valve between the left ventricle and the upper left filling chamber (left atrium) if often closed or small. The main blood vessel that carried blood from the heart to the rest of the body is also smaller than usual. This means the heart is unable to pump blood effectively around the body. Most babies with the condition appear healthy immediately after birth but quickly become breathless if not treated. Most are diagnosed before birth. It is not possible to cure the condition but most children can have a reasonable quality of life if they have successful surgery to manage it. Only about 60 per cent of patients survive all three of the required operations. For those who do, life expectancy is in the teens.

"Warren Buffett enthusiasts have been offered the dream prize of a stay in the investment guru's childhood home - so long as they invest in his company and have a healthy appreciation of Omaha. The three-bedroom house, where the billionaire finance whizz lived from the age of six, has been put on Airbnb ahead of a May 2 investors' meeting in the Nebraska city where he grew up. It was from that home, which his family left in 1966 and no longer owns, that Buffett, now 84, earned his first cents selling Coke and chewing gum door-to-door, and also started investing in stocks. Big prize: Warren Buffett superfans will be able to stay in his old house if they win an Airbnb competition. The investment guru is pictured left in March 2015, and right in the 1930s . Where the heart is: The Buffett family moved to this house in 1936. His mother continued living there until 1966 . The online listing, which boasts that the home still has several Buffett-era features, explains that Airbnb will offer a free stay, for up to three nights, to a lucky winner. To be eligible, entrants must be shareholders in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding company, and answer four questions. As well as listing their best Airbnb experience and travel 'bucket list', hopefuls must explain what excites them most about the Berkshire Hathaway annual meet-up - and then wax lyrical about Omaha in general. The competition is part of an Airbnb publicity push in the city, which regularly runs out of hotel space when some 40,000 Buffett acolytes descend each year to hear from the investment guru himself. Times change: This is the room where a young Buffett slept through his youth - though it now features twin beds and has likely seen some other changes since the billionaire-to-be last spent the night there . Eyes on the prize: Only Berkshire Hathaway shareholders are eligible to enter the competition, and must answer questions including one on their excitement to be in Omaha . The phenomenon also sees hotels hike their rates, with some locations insisting visitors book rooms for at least three nights, despite the event only lasting a day. Strategies like this roused the ire of Buffett, who personally recommended Airbnb to his shareholders as a way to get round it. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the self-confessed 'mother bear' said he plugged the home-sharing site, in which he has no financial stake, to protect his shareholders from exploitation. The prize home, on North 53rd Street, is around 15 minutes from the CenturyLink Center where the meeting will be held. Many parts of the house are still as they were during the Buffett family's 30-year stay, including the shelves in the library and a chandelier which Warren's parents installed in the dining room. Original feature: The dining room chandelier, above, was installed by Buffett's parents more than 50 years ago . Original: The shelves in the library, pictured, were those used by Buffett's father in what was then his study . Mod cons: The home has two bathrooms and three bedrooms, as well as a track record producing billionaires . However, other rooms have changed dramatically from 1930s Central Plains fashions, with modern kitchen appliances and a basement dedicated to Mexican folk art. This year's annual meeting is expected to draw its biggest crowd yet because this is the 50th anniversary of when Buffett took over Berkshire Hathaway. Over the past five decades, Buffett has transformed the struggling New England textile maker into a conglomerate that owns more than 80 subsidiaries, including utility, furniture and jewelry firms. The company also has major investments in such companies as Coca-Cola Co., IBM and American Express. According to CNN Money, Buffett's return across over his 50-year tenure is 1,826,163 per cent, an average annual return of 21.6 per cent. Cooking up a business plan: Some rooms, such as this, have likely seen very extensive renovation .

"Debra Winch, 44, receives up to 60 spam text messages every day after she was turned down for a payday loan . Highly sensitive financial details from loan applications are being sold to scammers and cold-calling firms, the Mail can reveal. Details of how much money applicants asked for, why the cash was needed and why the application was rejected are all being stored on lists and traded. Vulnerable people desperate for cash are then bombarded up to 60 times a day by cold callers and targeted by scammers who have apparently obtained access to the data. The loan records of more than 3,000 applicants were passed to undercover Mail reporters by one data firm. When the Mail contacted people on the spreadsheet, they said their lives had been made a misery since they applied for the loans. Some said they have been targeted by scammers because their bank details had been made widely available. Policeman’s wife Debra Winch, 44, receives up to 60 spam text messages every day after she had an application for a £600 payday loan declined. The mother of three has since been conned out of £360 by two companies which knew her bank account details and removed the money without her knowledge. Afterwards, one of the scammers spoke to her on the phone and said ‘Catch me if you can’ before hanging up. Mrs Winch said: ‘Having a policeman husband and a son who works in security, I try to be careful giving my information, so am upset my information has got into the hands of the wrong people. ‘I haven’t signed any forms and wouldn’t because I don’t know who I’m dealing with. I feel completely violated. It is amazing how much they know about you.’ The loan records were passed to the Mail’s undercover reporters by Birmingham-based firm Targeted Response Direct. Scroll down for video . The data – including the applicants’ names, addresses, work details, how much they had tried to borrow, what they wanted the loan for and why it was turned down – was sent to the reporters as a free sample via email in two spreadsheets, neither of which was password protected. David Billington, a director of Targeted Response Direct, said people kept these records because there was ‘money in it’. When asked where the information came from, he named four payday loan broker websites: www.little-loans.com, www.supaloans.co.uk, www.gocheaploans.co.uk and www.supafinance.co.uk. David Billington (left) director of Targeted Response Direct (pictured with colleague Nick Moore) claimed people kept these records because there was 'money in it' Last night, the City watchdog said such exploitation was unacceptable and vowed to crack down on the firms involved. And the owner of three of the loan sites involved said it had stopped trading in customers’ data after being contacted by the Mail. Christopher Woolard, the Financial Conduct Authority’s director of strategy and competition, said: ‘This exploitation of consumers – many of whom are vulnerable – is unacceptable. Credit brokers cannot pass on consumers’ data without their knowledge, or charge a fee for broking without their consent. ‘Cracking down on this sort of practice is one of our top priorities. We are currently investigating a number of firms.’ Government adviser and pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann said: ‘Prison sentences and significant fines should be imposed on those who so carelessly profit from sales of such data. ‘This is a major threat to the British public. It is clear that data protection is failing and supposed protections are simply not working.’ Stephen Eckersley, head of emforcement at the Information Commissioner’s Office, said: ‘Our research has shown people consider their financial data to be the most sensitive information they own. We are also aware that many people who apply for payday loans are often in vulnerable financial positions. ‘The ICO works constantly to target rogue businesses and individuals that seek to profit from the unscrupulous trade in personal data. We will be looking at this information brought to us by the Daily Mail, consider whether there have been any breaches of the Data Protection Act and what action should be taken.’ Mr Billington, who is seen in pictures online posing in pubs and with people dressed as cartoon characters, told an undercover reporter that people so in debt they cannot get a payday loan were a great business opportunity. ‘If you can find somebody and get them into an IVA or a debt management plan, then there’s money in it,’ he said, adding that after two or three years there was ‘always the opportunity to sell them other products’. The owner of three of the loan sites involved said it had stopped trading in customers’ data after being contacted by the Mail following the revelations over cold-calling . He said he had previously made good money selling on the names of people who were about to lose their homes. The names had come from a court employee and were then sold t on for up to £5 each as ‘leads’ to firms looking to target those in financial difficulty, he said. ‘It was a great data set,’ Mr Billington added. ‘It was people who were basically being forced out… who were facing repossession.’ Payday loan firms vowed to stop passing on data on their customers after being contacted by the Mail. Mediablanket Ltd, which owns supaloans.co.uk, supafinance.co.uk and gocheaploans.co.uk, admitted it has passed on data to other companies looking to target people needing money, in exchange for a percentage of revenue from any resulting sales. Director Anthony Bradley said: ‘I tried to call Targeted and they are not answering the phone. I’ve got no idea who they are, none whatsoever. I’ve never dealt with them direct in my life. ‘I have no idea where they have got our data from, which is a concern. From today, we stopped our data going everywhere.’ The boss of Digitonomy Ltd, which owns little-loans.com, denied selling customers’ data, before putting the phone down when questioned further. Gary Solomon, 41, said: ‘I can’t make any comment, I’m afraid. We don’t sell any data on and that’s the end of the conversation.’ Targeted Response Direct Ltd denied any wrongdoing, saying everyone on the spreadsheet had given consent for their details to be passed on.","Debra Winch, 44, pestered by spam texts after having payday loan declined .

"A secret Nazi bolthole for fleeing war criminals has been found in a remote jungle area of Argentina.

Scroll down for video . The hideaway has been uncovered in a remote jungle in the Misiones region of northern Argentina .

Halfway through the Second World War, the Nazis had a secret project of building shelters for top leaders in the event of defeat . The group of stone structures still hold piles of German coins from the late 1930s . South America has had a long and unusual relationship with the Nazis who escaped there in droves after the Second World War. Nazis fled to Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and Bolivia. Argentina was earmarked as a prime haven for the Third Reich's elite - such as Auschwitz medic Dr Josef Mengele and Holocaust organiser Adolf Eichmann - to get to when Nazism collapsed in 1945. Locals believe that a house in the forest belonged to Hitler's right-hand man Martin Bormann, but Mr Schavelzon dismissed this as 'an urban myth'. Instead, archaeologists suspect that the ruins of three buildings in the Teyu Cuare park in the north of the country were part of a Nazi hideout built by supporters while the war in Europe still raged, the Clarin newspaper reported. The cluster of three buildings are obscured from view by thick undergrowth and are only accessible with a machete. Meissen porcelain found in the buildings is being sent back to Buenos Aires for further examination . The crockery still bears the 'Made in Germany' stamp. At least 180 Nazi war criminals were known to have fled to Argentina . Coins bearing Nazi insignia and dated from 1938 were found amid the rubble . 'Apparently, halfway through the Second World War, the Nazis had a secret project of building shelters for top leaders in the event of defeat  inaccessible sites, in the middle of deserts, in the mountains, on a cliff or in the middle of the jungle like this,' said archaeologist Mr Schavelzon. The researchers believe, however, that, the Nazis never ended up using the hideout. By the time they landed, with Europe in ruins, they had smuggled out enough gold and money to live comfortable lives under the radar in cities or on ranches out on the sprawling pampas. Locals believe that a house in the forest belonged to Hitler's right-hand man Martin Bormann, but Daniel Schavelzon, from the University of Buenos Aires, dismissed this as 'an urban myth' German coins from the years 1938 to 1941 and Meissen porcelain are being sent back to Buenos Aires for further examination. 'There seems to be no other explanation, other than that these structures were meant to serve as a hide out for Nazis, because it would have been expensive to build them in such an inaccessible place,' said Schavelzon. Eichmann, who was responsible for getting millions of Jewish victims on board trains to take them to extermination camps in Nazi occupied Poland, was found living in a Buenos Aires suburb and kidnapped by Israeli Mossad commandos in 1961. Put on trial in Israel for war crimes, he was hanged in May the following year. In 2012 secret files revealed that 9,000 Nazi war criminals fled to South America after the Second World War, it has been revealed for the first time. After receiving tip-offs, German prosecutors were granted access to secret files in Brazil and Chile that confirmed the true number of Third Reich immigrants. According to the documents, an estimated 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including Croatians, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided the Nazi murder machine. Most, perhaps as many as 5,000, went to Argentina; between 1,500 and 2,000 are thought to have made it to Brazil; around 500 to 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay. These numbers do not include several hundred more who fled to the safety of right-wing regimes in the Middle East. Previous estimates as to how many Nazis fled to South America have varied wildly from 5,000 to 300,000.

Adolf Eichmann hid under the alias of Ricardo Klement in Argentina as early as 1952 . Adolf Eichmann hid under the alias of Ricardo Klement in Argentina as early as 1952. He raised his family and worked in a car plant. During the war, Eichmann was the right-hand-man to SS chief Heinrich Himmler in the Third Reich - who was responsible for the trains that carried millions to their deaths at extermination camps in Nazi occupied Poland. Eichmann was hanged in Israel in 1962. Josef Mengele was known for his horrific genetic experiments in concentration camps including the dissection of live babies and injecting dye into the eyes of prisoners. He hid out in Argentina until his death in 1979. Several others escaped to Chile. Walter Rauff a high-ranking SS officer who invented the 'Death Trucks' - with which 500,000 prisoners were murdered with lethal gas at Auschwitz - arrived in South America in 1950. He spent a short amount of time in jail and died in Santiago in 1984. Paul Schaeffer began his career in the Hitler Youth before rising through the ranks and arrived in Chile in 1960. He was a known paedophile but was not locked up by Chilean authorities until 1996. He died in 2010.","Site found in Teyu Cuare provincial park, in Misiones, northern Argentina .

"A 20st teenager who was addicted to playing video games has lost half of his body weight in three years to pursue his dream of joining the marines. Jai Harms, 17, from Waterlooville, Hants shed an incredible 10st by ditching a diet of fast food and his games consoles to train five hours a day. His weight had ballooned to a staggering 20st 7lb by his 14th birthday when he feasted on a diet of bacon rolls, snacks and Chinese takeaways every night. At 14 Jai Harms weighed over 20st but just three years later the teenager has lost half of his body weight . Now three years on Jai's waistline has dropped from 46in to 28in and the determined teen is now nine months into a course at the Military Preparation College in Portsmouth, spending half the day on physical training. Jai says that before he decided to turn his life around he had very little respect for his own body existing of greasy takeaways. 'It was pretty bad - I would eat what I want, when I wanted. 'I would make regular trips to McDonald's and order McFlurrys and milkshakes with my meals and my lunch was normally four bacon rolls. 'My dad used to work for a Chinese restaurant too as he delivered food and at the end of the every day we used to get free meals.' As well as a bad diet Jai would be immobile for hours of the day devoting his time to video gaming. Jai slimmed down in order to fulfill his dream of joining the marines and now trains everyday . Before he began his weight loss Jai would spend 12 hours a day playing games on his Xbox . 'When I was in school I barely moved. I would just sit around and play on my Xbox for 12 hours a day, probably more, from the moment I woke up until I went to bed. 'I would play car racing games and FIFA football but I don't even look at the Xbox now.' Jai was bullied over his weight at school but decided to turn his life around on New Year's Eve 2011 when he told his mum Andrea, 48, he wanted to take up boxing. Three months later she and his father Neil, 51, gave him permission to start and Jai started training at his local club once a week. When Jai stepped on a set of scales he discovered his weight had reached an unhealthy 20-and-a-half stone. Jai decided to ditch the computer games when he wanted to take up boxing and is now a champion for his age . Before joining the military college Jai lived off four bacon rolls for his lunch and a Chinese takeaway every night, but now the 17-year-old survives off a high protein diet . Shocked into action Jai soon started running three times a week in addition to his boxing and started to lose between one and two kilos a week. When he enrolled at the Military Preparation College (MPCT) the weight kept dropping off and he has now even been crowned as the Hampshire and Isle of Wight boxing champion for his age group. Jai said: 'I always wanted to look like Floyd Mayweather the boxer - he's my biggest inspiration in life. 'I also watched a lot of TV programmes about people wanting to lose weight, like A Year To Save My Life, and thought ""if they can do it, then I can do it"". He added that he couldn't have got to where he is today without the help of his loving parents. 'My parents are really supportive and are constantly pushing me - mum has made me healthy lunches and dad has been there training me from the start.' Jai now feasts mainly on pasta and chicken and three protein shakes a day in between his busy schedule of five hours worth of military training and gym work a day. He can now run an impressive 1.5 miles in just eight minutes thanks to his marine training. During a 27-week course at the Military Preparation College, a student will typically run 170 miles, do 9,500 press ups, 9,500 burpees, 9,500 squats and 9,500 sit ups . Jai says that as well as his parents support he has found an equally supportive team at the Military College. 'Everyone is so supportive at the Military Preparation College, so I knew there was no need for me to worry about joining. 'Of course it is challenging at times but we're all one big family and everyone helps each other get to where they want to be. Jai is now using his skills to help others to get fit at the military college . 'In the space of a few months after joining I was at where I wanted to be. Not only has my physical strength and fitness increased massively, but my mental strength, too.' Aside from improving his fitness Jai is also working on his academic skills. 'I am now much more confident, organised and am improving on my maths and English too. 'My friends and family are so proud and they don't stop telling me how well I've done, especially my dad, my military instructors and my boxing coaches.' Jai is also hoping to use what he has learnt to help others in the same position that he was once in. 'All the students here are amazing. 'One lad at the college reminds me a lot of my former self. I work with him in the gym and physical training to help him get where he wants to be.' The next steps for Jai now are completing his MPCT course, and applying to the Royal Marine commando unit. The Military Preparation College is free to attend and open to any 16 to 19-year-olds who want to get fit, boost their self-confidence and prepare themselves for life, including in the armed forces. During a 27-week course, a student will typically run 170 miles, do 9,500 press ups, 9,500 burpees, 9,500 squats and 9,500 sit ups. There are 16 free colleges around the UK, with new students joining on a weekly basis. Nathan Gibbons, Head of Physical Literacy at MPCT, says that he has been extremely impressed with Jai's progress. 'It's amazing to see how Jai has turned his life by getting fit, healthy and motivated. 'He's now one of the fittest learners we have at MPCT Portsmouth and a real inspiration to everyone at the College. 'He is living proof that with the right amount of hard work, determination and support, young people can achieve incredible things.'","At 14 Jai Harms was addicted to his Xbox and weighed in at over 20st .

"Japanese scientists have successfully transmitted energy wirelessly in a breakthrough that could pave the way for space-based solar power systems. Mitsubishi researchers used microwaves to deliver 1.8 kilowatts of power - enough to run an electric kettle - through the air with pinpoint accuracy to a receiver 170ft (55 metres) away. While the distance was relatively small, the technology could someday pave the way for mankind to tap the vast amount of solar energy available in space and use it here on Earth. Japanese scientists say they have successfully transmitted energy wirelessly in a breakthrough for future solar space power systems. While the distance was relatively small, the technology could someday pave the way for mankind to tap the vast amount of solar energy available in space and use it here on Earth . 'This was the first time anyone has managed to send a high output of nearly two kilowatts of electric power via microwaves to a small target, using a delicate directivity control device,' said a spokesman for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) said. The test, which took place at Kobe Shipyard & Machinery Works in Nagoya, Japan, will help Jaxa devise its long-awaited space solar power system. Solar power generation in space has many advantages over its Earth-based cousin, notably the permanent availability of energy, regardless of weather or time of day. While man-made satellites, such as the International Space Station, have long since been able to use the solar energy that washes over them from the sun, getting that power down to Earth where people can use it has been the thing of science fiction. The test, which took place at Kobe Shipyard & Machinery Works in Nagoya, Japan, will help Jaxa devise its long-awaited space solar power system. Mitsubishi used microwaves to deliver 1.8 kilowatts of power - enough to run an electric kettle - through the air with pinpoint accuracy to a receiver (right) 170ft (55 metres) away . In a separate project, a Japanese firm last year revealed plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on Earth . But the Japanese research offers the possibility that humans will one day be able to farm an inexhaustible source of energy in space. The idea, said the Jaxa spokesman, would be for microwave-transmitting solar satellites - which would have sunlight-gathering panels and antennae - to be set up about 22,300 miles (36,000km) from the Earth. 'But it could take decades before we see practical application of the technology - maybe in the 2040s or later,' he said. 'There are a number of challenges to overcome, such as how to send huge structures into space, how to construct them and how to maintain them.' The idea of space-based solar power generation emerged among US researchers in the 1960s and Japan's SSPS programme, chiefly financed by the industry ministry, started in 2009, he said. Space-based solar power – once the stuff of science-fiction – could be available sooner than expected if Japan has its way . Solar power has had a difficult start on Earth thanks to inefficient panels and high costs. But in space, scientists believe it could transform the way we generate energy. Now, the space-based solar power – once the stuff of science-fiction – could be available sooner than expected if Japan has its way. Within 25 years, the country plans to make space-based solar power a reality, according to a proposal from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa). In a recent IEEE article by Susumu Sasaki, a professor emeritus at Jaxa, outlined the agency's plans create a 1.8 mile long (3 km) man-made island in the harbour of Tokyo Bay. The island would be studded with 5 billion antennas working together to convert microwave energy into electricity. The microwaves would be beamed down from a number of giant solar collectors in orbit 22,400 miles (36,000 km) above the Earth. Resource-poor Japan has to import huge amounts of fossil fuel. It has become substantially more dependent on these imports as its nuclear power industry shut down in the aftermath of the disaster at Fukushima in 2011. In a separate project, a Japanese firm last year revealed plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on Earth. Shimizu Corporation's Luna Ring project would stretch almost 6,790 miles (11,000km) around the moon's equator and a field of solar panels would form a belt. Energy captured by these panels would then be sent to Earth using microwaves and laser lights could be beamed directly to countries where it is needed. According to the plans, the project would produce around 13,000 terrawatts of continuous solar energy. At present, the world's population consumes about 15 terawatts of power each year. The company claims the plans would not only provide an 'almost inexhaustible' energy supply, it would stop the rise of global warming caused by carbon dioxide from current energy sources.

"Hearing: Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, was told that Shamsul Islam molested a string of girls on public transport in London . A sex attacker molested four teenage girls then claimed he did not know what he was doing because he was fasting for Ramadan, a court heard today. Shamsul Islam, 33, sidled up to girls as young as 15 on empty buses and trains across east London then sexually assaulted them. When one of his victims confronted him he said 'I'm sorry, I'm fasting, I don't know what I'm doing,' Snaresbrook Crown Court was told. Islam, from Barking, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault, and was sentenced to three years in prison - after which he will be deported to his home country of Pakistan. Judge Sheelagh Canavan branded him 'a danger to society'. Sentencing him to three years' imprisonment, Judge Canavan described him as a ‘serial, sexual pervert' and called for him to be removed from the country as soon as possible. She said: ‘Your devotion to your religion is only convenient to you when it gives you an excuse for your sexual misconduct. ‘You are not a national of this country, and the sooner you are removed from the country the better. The first attack took place on a C2C train going from Essex into central London, the court heard. Prosecutor Karl Masi said: 'The defendant got onto the train and sat down beside [the first victim] - even though there were plenty of empty double seats on the carriage. 'The victim noticed Mr Islam was rubbing his elbow up against her. She tried moving away but the defendant kept moving closer to her. He would look away whenever she tried to look at him. 'At one point, after the defendant had got up and sat back down again, the victim felt him touching her stomach and looked down to find his hand under her top. 'When she challenged him the defendant got up and moved.' The second assault, on a 15-year-old girl, happened on a bus in mid-afternoon a few days later, the court was told. The teenager boarded the bus and immediately felt uncomfortable because Islam had been staring at her at the bus stop. 'There were other double seats available yet the defendant chose to sit next to her,' Mr Masi said. 'He was staring at her before moving his arm and touching her right leg with his hand. He then tried to get his hand under her top and on top of her leggings.' The third attack, which happened on another bus the same day, left the 16-year-old victim 'paralysed with fear'. Islam sat next to her, before using his fingers to caress the girl's stomach and moved his hand down to her shorts. Attack: One of the assaults took place on a C2C train from Essex to London (file photo) A few weeks later he boarded a different bus where he sat next to a girl and grabbed her breast. When the girl confronted her attacker he replied: 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm fasting, I don't know what I am doing.' Mr Masi said that all the victims were upset by the assaults and were left in floods of tears. The first victim said she now 'questions how others look at her' in an impact statement read to the court, while another said she becomes physically sick when using public transport. Islam was arrested on September 17 after police used his Oyster card to track him down. Judge Canavan said: ‘I don’t underestimate the impact this has had on the psychological wellbeing of the victims.' Speaking about the first incident, the judge said: 'I have no doubt that you knew she knew you were touching her and indeed the thrill for you in part was the fright that you were causing to that woman. I have no doubt that that fed into your sexual satisfaction. ‘When subsequently interviewed you said that you couldn’t remember the incident. You attempted to blame Ramadan as causing you to forget. As became plain during the course of the interview that was a lie - you did know what you had done.’ She said that the second victim, aged just 15, was 'very uncomfortable', adding: ‘I have no doubt you targeted her too and I have no doubt that part of the sexual thrill of your offending was the helplessness of the woman who was the subject of your sexual assault. ‘I say ""woman"", but she was in fact a child. She got off the bus and burst into tears and rang her mother. But that was clearly not sexually satisfying enough for you because within 90 minutes you were assaulting another woman.’ In relation to the fourth attack, Judge Canavan said: 'You said you were sorry, and that you did not know what you were doing because you were fasting. 'It’s my fervent wish that you will be immediately deported from the UK.'","Shamsul Islam, 33, attacked one girl on a train and three others on buses .

"Do you ever have trouble telling right from left? For example you're taking a driving lesson and the instructor asks you to take a left turn and you pause, struggling to think of which way is left. If so, you're not on your own – a significant proportion of our population has difficulty in telling right from left. Many people, even adults, say that they confuse right and left. Dr Gerard Gormley, of Queen's University Belfast, says almost a fifth of college professors and more than a quarter of college students have difficulty quickly identifying right from left . For example, 19.5 per cent of college professors and 26.2 per cent of college students said that they occasionally, frequently or all of the time had difficulty when they had to quickly identify right from left. Discriminating between left and right is a complex neuro-psychological process involving several higher brain functions. These include the ability to integrate touch, sound and sight information, language function and memory. For some it is second nature but for others a considerable challenge. One further problem facing the health profession is that when a doctor or nurse faces a patient, their right-side is on the patient's left-side. So correctly distinguishing right from left in a patient also involves mentally rotating images. Wrong turns to avoidable errors . It's hardly the end of the world if you take the wrong direction on a journey, but there are many situations where confusing right from left can have devastating consequences. Some of the most tragic errors in medicine have been when surgery was performed on the wrong side of a patient: removing the wrong kidney or amputating the wrong leg. While there are systems, checks and balances in place to anticipate and minimise these kinds of mistakes, when they do occur, human error is often at the root of the cause. It's not the end of the world if a person takes the wrong direction on a journey, but doctors confusing right from left have taken out the wrong kidney in the past . Don't ever confuse sides . Error is an inherent characteristic of human behaviour – sometimes we just get things wrong – but left-right ones may be more than a one-off accident. Evidence would suggest that right-left confusion is more common in women. The literature would appear to suggest that men demonstrate a greater degree of visuo-spatial function, the ability to visualise objects and spaces, which allows people to do things such as navigate  around a city. The 'distraction effect' Distinguishing right from left also never occurs in isolation. Hospitals and other health settings are busy and complex places to work in. Doctors are often subject to distractions while working; receiving telephone calls, cardiac monitors bleeping, taking questions from colleagues, patients and their relatives – the clinical environment can be very challenging. In research we published in Medical Education, we explored the impact of such interruptions on medical students' ability to correctly discriminate right from left. While objectively measuring 234 medical students' ability to distinguish right from left, we subjected them to the typical ambient noise of a ward environment and interrupted them with clinical questions. Previous research found when medical students were distracted by the noise of a ward and clinical questions, their ability to make right-left judgments was thrown off . Our findings were startling. Even the background noise of a ward environment was enough to throw some medical students off when making right-left judgements. Asking them a series of questions while they were trying to distinguish right from left had an even greater impact. The 'distraction effect' was greater for older and female students. An individual's ability to self-determine how well they could distinguish right from left was also often imprecise. So many students thought they were good at distinguishing right from left when, objectively measured, they weren't. Dr Gormley says tests should be carried out so people affected are aware of the problem . Coping techniques . Those who have difficulty in telling right from left often develop their own techniques – for example placing their left thumb at right angles to their index finger to make an 'L' representation for their 'left' side. It appears however that these techniques remain fallible and fail to combat this issue in all cases. In healthcare, training – starting at an undergraduate level – needs to make students mindful of the challenges of making right-left decisions and the impact that distractions can have on such critical decisions. We need to develop strategies to reduce such error-provoking situations and to raise student and teacher awareness of the fact that some individuals are more prone to right-left confusion. As the people at risk often don't think they have a problem, testing of the ability to discriminate against right-left discrimination – for example through online psychometric tests – could be offered to students to measure their ability. Those who are revealed to be challenged in making right-left decisions, would at least have this deficiency flagged up and could apply extra vigilance in certain situations. Minimising distractions is also particularly important. During the critical phases of a flight, pilots must refrain from all non-essential conversation to avoid unnecessary distractions. Such cockpit rules, and other strategies lend themselves well to healthcare.","Gerard Gormley is Academic General Practitioner at Queen's University .

"Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps was facing growing calls to resign this morning after being forced to admit he did work as a get-rich-quick salesman under a false name after entering Parliament. Mr Shapps said he had 'screwed up' by insisting 'over firmly' that he had never had a second job after becoming an MP. It comes after a recording emerged from 2006, a year after he was elected to Parliament, capturing the MP selling self-help guide Stinking Rich 3 and claiming his products could make listeners a 'ton of cash'. Despite the revelation, David Cameron this morning insisted he had  full confidence in the Conservative party chairman. Scroll down for video . Recording: Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps (pictured) has been forced to admit that he did work as a web marketer under a pseudonym after entering Parliament . Mr Shapps used to run the HowToCorp website featuring get-rich-quick advice from 'successful businessmen' Sebastian Fox and Michael Green - a name the Tory used as a business alias. According to The Guardian, in the recording, Mr Shapps - under the Green pseudonym - told a fellow entrepreneur that the guide 'is not a cheap product', but 'a great internet marketing product'. Asked about second jobs on LBC last month, Mr Shapps said: 'To be absolutely clear I don't have a second job and I have never had a second job whilst being an MP. End of story.' But now the Conservatives say that although the chairman had talked of his writing career having ended when he became an MP 'in fact it ended shortly afterwards'. Mr Shapps insisted it was an 'old story' and his business dealings had all been properly declared. But Labour said the Prime Minister needed to launch an investigation to 'establish all the facts'. John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, said Mr Shapps should quit his role as party chairman. Web marketer: Mr Shapps used to run the HowToCorp website (above) featuring get-rich-quick advice from 'successful businessmen' Sebastian Fox and Michael Green - a name the Tory used as a business alia . Mr Mann said: 'He's a major embarrassment to David Cameron and the Conservative Party, and he needs to resign. 'It means he has no ­credibility whatsoever and raises serious questions.' Labour's Karl Turner, the shadow solicitor general, added: 'It beggars belief that the chairman of the Conservative Party went on live radio just three weeks ago and stated three times that he was not doing business as Michael Green while he was an MP, when new reports and audio tonight show quite clearly that he did. 'It seems that Mr Shapps's repeated denials, which were not in the heat of the moment but also included a calculated decision to instruct solicitors, were contrary to the facts. He also appears to have threatened legal action on the basis of this. Tweet: Mr Shapps insisted it was an 'old story' and his business dealings had all been properly declared . 'David Cameron must now order an immediate inquiry into Mr Shapps's conduct and establish all the facts in the interest of the public.' Mr Shapps tweeted: 'Old story: all properly declared at the time and all many years ago. Labour just hate business.' A Conservative party spokesman said: 'Like many authors and journalists, Grant wrote with a pen name. 'This was completely transparent: his full name and biographical details were permanently published on the company's main website. 'Given that this was a decade ago, and was mentioned during the cut and thrust of an interview, he referenced that his writing career had ended when he became an MP: in fact it ended shortly afterwards.'","Recording emerges of Grant Shapps allegedly selling self-help guide .

"Sacrifice: Jogendra Sen was the only non-white man in his regiment . They were all young, proud, and ready to serve king and country. But among the eager group of young men who had signed up to fight in the First World War together, one face stood out from the rest. Jogendra Sen rushed to join the queue of recruits to the Leeds ‘Pals’ Battalion when it was raised in September 1914 – and became the only non-white member of the 15th West Yorkshire Regiment. Yet were it not for a chance discovery almost a century later, his life – and death – might have been lost to history. A pair of broken and bloodstained spectacles in an Indian museum have shed light on the sacrifice of a volunteer who battled prejudice and racism to serve the country he made his home. They were the same glasses that ‘Jon’, as he was called by his English comrades, had worn in a photograph taken at a training camp in Yorkshire. Cruelly, the Bengal-born student’s race had barred him from fulfilling his dream of being an officer in the British Army, even though he was highly educated and had earned a degree in electrical engineering from Leeds University. But it also won him a place in history. Because less than 20 months after that training camp photograph, Jogendra Sen was killed in action near the Somme on May 22, 1916. Academics believe that the 28-year-old private had become the first Bengali to die fighting for Britain in the war. Although many more would later serve on the Western Front in the Indian Army, at the beginning of the war, most Bengalis were banned from joining up in their own country because of racial prejudice. The catalyst that allowed the tale of Pte Sen’s spectacles to emerge publicly was Dr Santanu Das, a reader in English at King’s College London, who noticed them and some of his other belongings in a museum on a visit to Sen's home town of Chandernagore, some 22 miles north of Kolkata in West Bengal, India. One of the chaps: Private Sen, centre, and his comrades pose for a photograph at a training camp in 1914 . Poignant: Jogendra Sen's glasses and other belongings were discovered in a museum in India . A book of friendship quotes given to Private Jogendra Sen by 'Cis', believed to be Mary Cicely Newton . When the academic mentioned his discovery during a talk at Leeds University, a local researcher recalled seeing Sen’s name on its war memorial. From this, Leeds researchers painstakingly pieced together one man’s war. Sen had worked as an engineer while continuing with his studies. A photograph of a woman found in his personal effects, inscribed ‘Yours with love, Cis’, was found to be of Mary Cicely Newton, who had links with the Mill Hill Chapel in Leeds where, it transpired, Sen sang in the choir. But although Sen was deeply involved in his local community, he faced discrimination even as he offered his life for the war effort. In an interview in 1988, his fellow soldier Arthur Dalby recalled: ‘He was the best-educated man in the battalion and he spoke about seven languages, but he was never allowed to be even a lance corporal because in those days they would never let a coloured fellow be over a white man, not in England.’ Private Jogendra Sen (pictured wearing glasses) with his comrades on deck during the voyage across the Mediterranean from Egypt to Marseille, en route to the Western Front in March, 1916 . Jogendra Sen is pictured far right with members of D Company. The photo is thought to have been taken at Colsterdale Camp in North Yorkshire shortly after they signed up in 1914 . Dr Das commented: ‘I was absolutely stunned when I saw the pair of glasses. ‘It’s one of the most poignant artefacts I’ve seen – a material token of the fragility of life at the front. 'More than a million Indian soldiers and non-combatants served in different theatres of the First World War, but what is so unusual about Jogendra Sen is that he was not part of the Indian army but of the Leeds Pals Battalion. ‘I sometimes wonder what his experiences would have been as the only non-white person in the battalion at that time.’ A photograph of a woman found in his personal effects, inscribed ‘Yours with love, Cis’, was found to be of Mary Cicely Newton, who had links with the Mill Hill Chapel in Leeds where Sen sang in the choir . Private Jogendra Sen (fourth from the right in the third row back) with Number 16 Platoon (D Company) of the 16th West Yorkshire Regiment in about 1915 . It cannot have been easy – but what has become clear is that Sen won the hearts and respect of his white comrades. Shortly after his death, his commander wrote: ‘His loss is felt very much throughout the whole of the company. ‘He always showed himself to be a keen and upright soldier, and myself and the officers of this company thought a great deal of him.’ •  A BBC Inside Out film tracing Jogendra Sen’s story is broadcast tonight on BBC One (Yorkshire and Lincolnshire only) at 7.30pm and is also available on BBC iPlayer.","Jogendra Sen was only non-white member of 15th West Yorkshire regiment .

"It didn’t take long for us to get used to Googling things, instead of looking them up in books. But the process of typing words into a search box could be replaced by using the cameras on our smartphones to find the information we’re looking for. Blippar, the world’s largest image recognition and augmented reality platform, has re-launched its app to change the way we search for things and interact with the world around us. Scroll down for video . Blippar, the world’s largest image recognition and augmented reality platform has re-launched its app, which aims to change the way we search and interact with the physical world. Users can 'blipp objects, such as CDS and adverts to access information about them online and could soon blipp any object, such as apples (shown) Users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to ‘look’ at any object and use the image to search for it online in the long-term. But to begin with, they will be able to use it on English-language album covers, fiction books, DVD covers and movie posters. When a user ‘blipps’ one of these items or images, they will be presented with a range of information about it. For example, if they blipp an album cover, they may be presented with access to videos of the band, a source to buy tickets to an upcoming concert, details on what people are saying about them on Twitter or photos of the band itself. Users have to launch the app on their phone. The new version will be out in April. They will see a view using the phone's camera, which will show any products that are 'blippable'. When an object is detected, users will see augmented reality content, which could take the form of a video, reviews or related information. The first blippable objects on the new app will be CDs, DVDs and film posters, but more will be added. However, the app’s plans are more ambitious. Blippar aims to make the entire physical world visually searchable via mobile devices and wearables. In the future, it aims to make everything blippable, from an apple or chocolate bar, to a dog on the street or even the Eiffel Tower. Web-based search as it exists today has dominated the digital experience, both online and mobile. From inputting keywords to digging through pages of links to access information, this search behaviour is limited by vocabulary and literacy. Blippar’s image recognition service aims to go beyond language to allow consumers to pull timely, relevant information directly from the environment around them. ‘The human imagination, curiosity and the quest for knowledge are all often limited by our capacity to define and assign language to describe and seek answers from the world around us’ said Blippar Founder and CEO Ambarish Mitra. Users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to ‘look’ at any object and use the image to search for it, and related information online. The New York and London-based company has already rolled out inority report-style advertising. A still from the film is shown . ‘Today marks the beginning of a new era of search, where curious users will be able to visually search the world through the lens of the Blippar app. ‘The technology holds massive potential for enriching real world experiences and delivering genuine value to our users. ‘The visual search is not replacing text-based search, it’s an alternate behaviour which satisfies people’s spontaneous needs of instant object focused curiosity, therefore introducing the light web.’ The company claims that Blippar’s platform allows users to access information faster than using traditional online search methods. It will also use artificial intelligence to refine and personalise the visual search results for each user. The updated app will be available to download for iOS and Android in April 2015. Last year, Blippar unveiled the first image recognition and tracking app for Google Glass wearers that shows videos, webpages, and more, simply by looking at a picture. It was the first time the technology could be used automatically, and seamlessly, just by looking at an advert. 'Blippar has already worked with thousands of the world’s largest brands and publishers to create engaging branded experiences that are triggered by objects, magazine pages, advertisements and more, “blipped” by millions of users around the world,'  Mr Mitra said. There are many visual search apps competing to win users from Google. Snap Fashion, for example, lets users take a photo of an item of clothing and finds others in exactly the same colour, which they can then buy at the click of a button.","Free Blippar app will be refreshed in April to allow users to use their smartphone cameras to access information online .

"Billions of pounds of British aid money is languishing unspent in the bank, MPs warn today. In a highly critical report, the Commons international development committee says ministers wrote out huge cheques to a series of major aid agencies like the World Bank as they scrambled to meet David Cameron’s controversial target to spend billions more on aid. But although the money has been promised, and counts towards meeting the UK’s aid target, much of it will not be spent for years. Disaster: Villagers clean up their destroyed homes after it was hit by Cyclone Pam on Tanna Island in Vanuatu last week . Today’s report estimates that at least £2.1 billion of ‘aid’ money is currently sitting in the bank unspent. It warns that ministers have become ‘increasingly reliant’ on multilateral organisations like the World Bank as they try to get billions more pounds of aid money out of the door. This type of spending was increased by 43 per cent over the previous year as the department rushed to hit Mr Cameron’s target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on aid. Targets: David Cameron has a target of spending 0.7% of Britain's income on aid . In a further criticism of the aid target, MPs say it distorts spending towards the end of the year – meaning that victims of natural disasters in the autumn are much more likely to get aid from Britain than those who are hit by catastrophe in the spring. The Department for International Development (Dfid) gave £6.3 billion to so-called multilateral aid agencies in 2013 – roughly 63 per cent of its budget. Today’s report says MPs are ‘concerned by Dfid’s extensive use of multilateral organisations to achieve this growth (in spending). Due to the way this is accounted for, some of this money will not be spent for a number of years.’ A Dfid spokesman last night defended the department’s spending. The spokesman said: ‘We fund multilaterals when they are the best partners to work with us to deliver our objectives, whether that be in a humanitarian crisis, natural disaster or on a specific topic such as migration and refugees. ‘We are living in a world that is facing unprecedented humanitarian pressures. The UK is proud to be a world leader in responding to emergencies.’","Report estimates £2.1billion of aid sitting in the bank .

"The US Army has sent a list of social media guidelines to military families after the names, photos and addresses of soldiers fighting ISIS were leaked by the terrorist group . A list posted online by a group called the 'Islamic State Hacking Division' earlier this month gave personal information for 100 US military members and called upon its lone wolf 'brothers residing in America' to kill them. Much of the information published was believed to be publicly available online, and the Army has warned its personnel that 'social media will continue to be leveraged as a tool by those who wish to threaten and/or target members or the military.' Scroll down for video . A group called the Islamic State Hacking Division posted information about 100 US military members online. The Army has responded by telling soldiers to take precautions such as getting security systems . In the posting, the ISIS hacking division asked its followers to kill military members 'wherever you find them.' Army personnel were told not to meet up with people they meet online and to use peepholes in doors . Several military members whose information was linked in the attack said that they were not afraid of the extremists who had targeted them . ISHD said it wants 'lone wolf' attackers to go after the military members and 'kill them wherever you find them'. The Army message said that the leak targeted members 'in retaliation for airstrikes in Iraq and Syria,' according to the Washington Times. It said that 'images posted over time may form a complete mosaic of you and your family' and warned soldiers against letting friends tag their locations on sites such as Facebook. Soldiers were also told that they should not meet up with people they have met online and to always use peepholes before opening any doors. The Army reportedly listed more than a dozen safety steps and said that members should limit the amount they talk about their service and use solid-core doors, heavy locks and home window security systems. The US Marine Corps said it was visiting all affected staff, and urged caution online in the aftermath of the leak. 'It is recommended Marines and family members check their online/social footprint, ensuring privacy settings are adjusted to limit the amount of available personal information,' US Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel John Caldwell said in a statement. US Central Command issued a statement on its Facebook page saying that 'We are operating in a 'new norm' in which cyber threats are real and constant.' The Navy released a set of general guidelines telling sailors not to detail ship movements or 'friend' strangers on social media. The group claimed it hacked several military servers, databases and emails to obtain the information on the list, though much of the information could be found publicly online . 'Any CENTCOM teammate or family member could be targeted. To that end, we all should maintain a heightened sense of vigilance whether dealing with work or home computer usage, specifically as it relates to Social Media.' One serviceman who was identified in the leak said that 'We have a footprint -- the best we can do is to make that foot print not so deep in the sand'. However, other several service members spoke out on and said that ISIS's intimidation tactic was 'not going to work'. One of three service members who spoke anonymously to ABC News said that it was not surprising that the extremists wanted to kill members of the US military. 'I wouldn't say I'm scared,' one said. 'It's just part of this 'new war' against an enemy with a different, more developed capability than what we've faced in the past. 'We have to make the adjustments in order to continue to win the battles.' ISIS claimed it hacked several military servers, databases and emails to obtain the information. However, a defense official said that the list did not appear to be from a breach, and that the names and addresses were publicly available online. 'We really weren't surprised because all the people I saw on that list are on a webpage some place anyways, all that information was already public,' and identified soldier said. Posting read: 'Kill them in their own lands, behead them in their own homes, stab them to death as they walk' The ISHD posting read: 'With the huge amount of data we have from various different servers and databases, we have decided to leak 100 addresses so that our brothers in America can deal with you. 'And now we have made it easy for you by giving you addresses, all you need to do is take the final step, so what are you waiting for? 'Kill them in their own lands, behead them in their own homes, stab them to death as they walk their streets thinking that they are safe.' One anonymous serviceman said that the list's publication was 'regrettable'. The Defense Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are looking into the matter, the New York Times reported. An official told the paper most of the information on the list could be found in public records, residential address search sites and on social media. The US Marine Corps (pictured, October 2014) announced that it was visiting all affected personnel and urged its soldiers to be careful about their online footprint . ISIS (pictured) has claimed responsibility for previous online-based attacks on the US military, notably hacking Central Command's Twitter account in January . Many of the personnel on the list were mentioned in news articles about air strikes on ISIS. However some of them were part of units that had no connection to the Middle Eastern bombing campaign. The faces of the women who appeared on the list were blurred out. ISIS has claimed responsibility for hacking attacks in the United States in the past, including against Central Command, which oversees the air war against the terrorist group. In January, the hacked Centcom Twitter feed posted what appeared to be an office phone directory of officers that was slightly out of date, forcing the military temporarily to take down the command's Twitter feed. The words 'CyberCaliphate' and 'I love you ISIS' replaced Central Command's usual logo on Twitter and YouTube before the pages were suspended.","The list was published on internet by the 'Islamic State Hacking Division'

"A recording-breaking adventurer from North Wales has claimed the title of National Adventurer of the Year following his epic journey across landlocked Mongolia. Ash Dykes, 24, who is nicknamed the 'lonely snow leopard', last year impressively spent 78 days alone, crossing 1,500 miles of the unforgiving Gobi Desert and the vast Mongolian steppe. The prestigious awards are a celebration of the most impressive international adventure, and Ash beat 39 other competitors to take the title of Wales' top adventurer. Ash Dykes, 24, has been crowned National Adventurer of the Year for walking solo across Mongolia . Ash dragged a 120kg home-made trailer behind him during his record-breaking cross-country journey . Mongolia is the most sparsely populated country on earth, with just over three million inhabitants . Famous English explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, who was the first person to reach both poles, commended the Welshman, saying his feat was 'an example of great determination.' Fittingly the award was presented by a Mongolian dignitary, at the Grand Central Hotel in Glasgow, and the prize given was a traditional Mongol bowl and framed certificate. 'I thought it was really appropriate as I had walked across his country,' Ash said. Mongolia is the most sparsely populated country on earth, with just over three million inhabitants in its vast land-locked 604,000 square miles. After 78 days of travelling alone Ash became the first known person to walk across Mongolia . Ash, 24, battled raging sandstorms and crippling heat as he crossed the barren land . Battling sandstorms, heat exhaustion and loneliness, Ash completed the incredible mission on foot and unsupported, which helped him secure the top award. He said: 'I feel humbled to have received the most votes. I would like to say how proud I feel and I didn't expect such support from the public.' His 'snow leopard' nicknamed was given by amazed locals who learned of his solo crossing and likened him to the resilient solitary creatures who roam the Mongolian wilderness. The young adventurer received his award from a Mongolian dignitary and was given a traditional Mongol bowl . Ash is currently in the middle of a UK tour called 'Ash Dykes - Breaking Mongolia: The Lonely Snow Leopard' For the duration of his mission from the western Russian border, to the easterly Chinese border, Ash dragged a 265lb home-made trailer containing food packs, water butts and camping equipment. His perseverance even saw him travel 34 miles in one day, walking for 14 hours straight at an altitude of more than 8,000ft. Since Ash left home at 19, he has embarked on more adventures than most people do in a lifetime. Ash Dykes' longest day of walking saw him on his feet for 14 hours as he covered 34 miles . Ash said he was humbled to receive the most votes and was surprised by the public support he received . Ash's carrier, (left), contained dehydrated food ration packs, a 25 litre water butt and camping equipment . From surviving in the Alps to living among a Burmese hill tribe, his experiences have led to him becoming a motivational speaker - visiting 10 Downing Street and filming his own documentary along the way - and he even has a book deal. Ash is also currently in the middle of a 10-date UK tour called 'Ash Dykes - Breaking Mongolia: The Lonely Snow Leopard', which began in March and continues into April. 'I am in preparation for my next world first adventure now. It is something no one has done before and I will be revealing it very soon,' he said.

"Spring officially started three weeks ago, but the chilly wintry weather is still very apparent - with hail and even snow expected to hit Britain this week. The top UK temperature expected today is 11C (52F) in York, while London should see 10C (50F) - after many places basked in sunshine yesterday. Yesterday's high in Britain was 14.8C (58.6F) at Helen's Bay in County Down, Northern Ireland, but parts of East Sussex only managed 5.9C (42.6F).

Busiest time of the year: Sheep farmers have spent the past week bringing new life into the world as the lambing season gets underway . And overnight frosts are predicted for the rest of the week, although a fine sunny morning began the day in the South today. However forecasters have predicted a band cloud and rain will move southwards from across Wales and northern England. Scattered heavy showers will turn wintry across hills, which may turn into thunder and hail. Met Office forecaster Kate Brown said: ‘The cold nights are set to continue with temperatures at 1C or 2C (33F or 35F). 'It will start to get warmer by Thursday or Friday night, up to 4C (39F). ‘The cold weather means gardeners should probably keep their plants in the greenhouses for a little longer to avoid being damaged by frost.’ She added that a weak band of rain will be replaced by sunshine across the UK today, followed by some heavy showers, thunder and hail. There is also a chance of snow on higher ground, with heavy showers leading to up to 0.2in (0.5cm) of rain falling in some places. The Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales have 21 flood alerts and five more serious flood warnings in place today. Forecast: Rain is predicted in several areas across the country, but by Wednesday the sun will begin to emerge again from behind the clouds .

Country-wide view: This satellite image from MetDesk's Home and Dry App shows how yesterday was a lovely spring morning for some parts . And while there will be a brief break from the rain on Wednesday, with sunshine expected, a band of rain and cloud will move eastwards that night. The Met Office said the first week of the Easter holidays, which start on Friday, will see highs of 10C and a mix of clear spells and showers or rain. On the first day of the holidays - Saturday, March 28 - brighter showery conditions are expected, before a more settled day arrives on Sunday. Then, forecasters warn of a ‘period of more changeable westerlies the following week and through the Easter weekend’. They say wet weather is likely to push across the UK, interspersed by brighter, but also showery, periods - with the best weather in the South East. Britain’s warmest day of the year so far was March 8, when temperatures hit 17.5C (63.5F) at Murlough in County Down, Northern Ireland. Meteorological spring began on March 1, while the astronomical spring began last Friday. Six people had to be rescued by coastguard and lifeboat teams in three different incidents on Saturday after extreme spring tides. Four teenagers were rescued from chest-high water after becoming trapped by the incoming tide, while two people got stuck up to their knees in mud. Some 50 coastguard volunteers, lifeboat crew, police, fire and ambulance officers were involved in the rescues in Dorset between 5pm and 7pm. Spring tides - when the difference between low and high tide is greatest - happen twice a month when the earth, sun and moon align. But this was even bigger than usual because of the recent supermoon - when the moon is as close to the earth as it can be - and the Spring Equinox. The four foreign teenagers called the emergency services because they were lost and becoming cut off by a rising tide near Old Harry Rocks. The group had started walking at about 2.30pm and were able to walk quite far along the shore due to the extremely low tide. But when the tide came back in quickly, trapping them, they called the coastguard. They were connected to an Arabic interpreter so the coastguard could establish where the group were while RNLI teams carried out a search. By the time they were found the rapidly incoming tide was up to their chests. Also, a female dog walker was also rescued after she became stuck in mud up to her knees at Whitecliff in Poole at 5pm. And shortly after a second team was launched to help a bait digger stuck at Jerry's Point in Studland. The Swanage coastguard team could not get near the trapped man due to the thick mud. Poole RNLI had used inflatable rafts to bring him to shore. Ian Brown from Swanage Coastguard said: ‘In my 24 years I've never seen the tide come back quite as quick as it did yesterday [Saturday].’","Top UK temperature forecast today is 11C  in York while County Down was yesterday's warmest at 13C .

Candice, from Houghton Regis, Hertfordshire, said: 'I changed my whole outlook on life. Candice reluctantly went under the knife to remove more than 20 lumps . 'Instead of living for parties and weekends and working and doing the same stuff I did day in, day out, I changed my whole view. 'I decided to live for me and love life for what it is. It sounds so away with the fairies, but it is the only way to live - and it worked. 'I got rid of everything toxic in my life and became so grateful for life. 'I had got rid of the massive tumours by arresting and starving them with the pure science of food. 'Like pineapple, kiwi and papaya - I found out that the bromelain eats away at a particular protein layer of the cancer. 'There is a protein in animal products that feed the cancers and when I was eating big hefty meals my body couldn't heal because all of my energy was going into digesting the meal. 'If I was eating one bit of fruit at a time, which eats away at the layer of the cancer, I was killing it and within six months my cancer was gone. 'There are now no tumours left in me. I'm so grateful for the cancer now in hindsight because it turned me into the person that I was meant to be.' Candice found a lump above her left collarbone in 2011 and an ultrasound revealed around 20 papillary thyroid carcinomas. Doctors said if the parcel courier didn't have the lumps removed she would lose her voice and possibly die within a year, so she endured a four-and-a-half hour operation. Candice now runs a website encouraging others to take control of their health. She also had radioactive treatment to 'mop up' any cancer that was left and two months later doctors performed a scan to check. But she was horrified when it revealed the cancer had spread to her liver and the back of her neck - with pre-cancerous cells also in her lung - and she had a maximum of five years to live. Doctors told her to come back in six months for chemotherapy to reduce the incurable cancer but Candice refused. She had lost both her best friend Jamie Brownsmead, 31, and cousin Frankie Gerathy, 13, to cancer in 2009, and blames body-weakening chemo for their demise. British Candice, who was living in Karratha, Western Australia, at the time, recalled: 'I was a blubbering mess. 'I thought, 'what have I done to get myself in this situation?' That was the darkest point I have ever been when I was in hospital. Candice pictured with her friend's children making one of the fruit smoothies which she claims has cured her cancer . Candice continued: '[The doctor] said come to come back in nine months because they had done too much to me there, and we can give you chemo. 'Instantly alarm bells went off in my head. My best friend and my cousin died because of chemo and there was no way I was doing that. 'I got strong from that point. I stopped going into myself and crying. 'I decided I had five years left, or six months to get rid of this crap, and show them that I can do it on my own. 'I started eating so much fruit - sometimes weeks on a fruit only diet.' Candice researched on the internet and switched to an almost entirely fruit and vegetable diet. She gorged on fruits like pineapple which are high in bromelain which some nutritionists claim 'eats away' at cancer, and ditched heavy meals which zapped energy away from 'healing'. Candice binned chemical-filled beauty products and cleaning sprays, quit smoking and took up yoga in order to get rid of the disease . She binned chemical-filled beauty products and cleaning sprays, quit smoking and took up yoga, as well splitting up with her husband of two years. As well as joining a positive-thinking dance group which performs in public places, she took up meditation and gave up her un-fulfilling job as a courier. She explained: 'Stress, chemicals and animal products all feed cancer, so I just got rid of them. 'My husband was not supportive and it wasn't working, we we split up too. 'I had got rid of the massive tumours by arresting and starving it with the pure science of food and a positive attitude.' Medics have now confirmed Candice is completely free of tumours . When she returned to her doctor six months after her dire diagnosis tests confirmed she had almost completely killed her cancer. A test for thyroglobulin - a protein produced by cancerous cells - revealed she had reduced her levels from 13 to 0.7 nanograms per millilitre. Recent tests showed her cancer was at a 0.2 level - just 0.1 above they expected healthy level, and in the normal range for healthy people. Candice, who runs a modelling agency said: 'I'm living life on my terms now. I'm not upset, I'm not waking up sad, I'm waking up choosing what I want to do with my life.' Mark Simon, director at the Nutritional Oncology Research Institute in California, has helped Candice, and has seen her test results. He said: 'At this point in time, we can say that there is NED - 'no evidence of disease' in Candice. 'Her tumor markers which reflect the number of cancerous cells has been well within the normal range for over two years, so we can confidently say that her stage four thyroid cancer is under effective management.' He continued: 'Candice possesses a level of faith, self-love and purpose that I am sure is a factor in her remarkable healing journey. 'I can tell you that most thyroid cancer patients with similar circumstances to Candice who follow the conventional path do not survive or experience a very poor quality of life. 'Cancer is an infection of aberrant cells and treating cancer is like dealing with a Bacterial infection. 'We attempt to maintain an environment not conducive towards tumour growth and proliferation. 'Diet plays a major role along with regular exercise, positive attitude and even spirituality. 'Fruits like pineapple contain a mixture of proteolytic enzymes such as bromelain known to have anti-cancer activity. 'Science does not provide all the answers and we most remain open to forces beyond our comprehension and understanding.' Candice ate up to three pineapples a day to try and get rid of cancer . When asked about whether pineapples and other fruit could have helped to beat Candice's cancer, oncologist Professor Karol Sikora said: 'The truth is we just don't know. 'It's much more likely that the cancer is going through a quiescent phase. 'Doctors say that there is a year to live or a specific amount of time but they really don't know definite times. 'There may be some truth that pineapples would help to beat cancer and we do in fact use some plant extracts in chemotherapy drugs, including yew trees and periwinkles. 'But there is no evidence to say that this would be the case.' Helen Thompson, senior information nurse at Cancer Research UK says there is no evidence that fruit like pineapples can cure cancer. She said: 'There's no scientific evidence that eating pineapples, or large amounts of fruit, can cure cancer. 'A cancer diagnosis can sometimes prompt people to make lifestyle changes like taking exercise and eating healthily. 'While studies show that having a healthy diet can reduce the risk of developing cancer, there's no strong evidence to show that diet can cure cancer. 'Leading a healthy lifestyle, including eating a balanced diet can make people feel better and may reduce the likelihood of other medical conditions. 'Anyone with cancer who is considering a particular diet or alternative therapy should discuss it with their doctor.'","Candice-Marie Fox, 31, found out she had thyroid cancer three years ago .

"A teenager's first drive alone can be tough for any parent. The crash rate per mile driven for 16- to 19-year-olds is nearly three times the rate for drivers aged 20 and over. Now, Chevrolet has come up with a solution that will allow parents to spy on their children's driving remotely, as well as prevent them from speeding. Scroll down for video . the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu will debut a system, called Teen Driver, that provides parents with a tool to help encourage safe driving habits for their teeangers . - Distance driven . - Maximum speed travelled . - Over-speed warnings issued . - Stability control events . - Antilock brake events . - Forward Collision Alerts, if equipped . - Forward Collision Braking events, if equipped . Dubbed 'Teen Driver', the system will be included on the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu. Features include automatic muting the radio or paired devices when seatbelts are unfastened. It also gives audible and visual warnings when the vehicle is traveling faster than a speed set by parents. 'We developed this system so parents could use it as a teaching tool with their kids – they can discuss and reinforce safe driving habits,' said General Motors safety engineer MaryAnn Beebe. 'As a mother of two, I know anything that has the potential of keeping one's family safer is of great value to parents.' Parents can view maximum speed reached, distance driven and number of times active safety features were used. To use Teen Driver, a parent needs to enable the feature by creating a PIN in the Settings menu of their available MyLink system, which then allows them to register their teen's key fob. Pictured is the system be tested in a early Chevrolet Malibu.  The 2016 Malibu debuts at the New York Auto Show in early April and is expected to go on sale at the end of 2015 with prices starting at around $24,000 . The feature can mute the audio of the radio or any device paired with the vehicle when front seat occupants aren’t wearing their safety belts, and it gives audible and visual warnings when the vehicle is traveling over preset speeds . When active, the radio system's maximum volume can also be set to a lower level. If the vehicle is equipped with active safety features like Forward Collision Alert, they are automatically turned on. Parents can also manually turn those safety features off when Teen Driver is used. This means that things like traction control and blind zone warning are  disabled so that new drivers learn good habits rather than relying on technology.

"A family dog was nearly blinded, its owner has said, by an allergic reaction after it was groomed at a Pets at Home mega-store. Terry Maughan, 20, from Norton paid £36 for his 20-month-old West Highland terrier Snowbell to have the treatment. But when he took his beloved pooch home he was shocked to see the dog struggling to breathe and unable to open her eyes. Terry Maughan (left) with his younger brother Christopher Maughan (right) with Snowbell . Builder Terry rushed Snowbell to the vets where they discovered she had suffered an allergic reaction to the shampoo. 'We all thought she was going to die,' Mr Maughan said. 'She could have had a heart attack, it was beating so fast. Her eyes were red and she wouldn't open them and she was drooling a lot. 'Snowbell was walking into things so we thought she could have also gone blind. Everyone was so worried about her, she is part of the family and my brothers and sisters were in tears. 'I think it's disgraceful what happened. You don't expect anything like this to happen to your dog when you put it in the hands of licensed and trained professionals. 'She's improving now thanks to a course of eye drops they vet gave to her but it's a very slow process. 'I fear she will have eyesight problems in the future because of this and may go blind. 'My father went to the Pets at Home store to tell them to stop using chemicals because our dog almost died. When Terry took his dog to the vets its eyes were red and aggravated, it was drooling excessively and had a rapid  heart rate and temperature. The symptoms appeared to have been caused by a grooming seesion . 'It took them three days to respond to our complaint and they never even asked us how . Snowbell was or said sorry for what happened. I think it's disgraceful and appalling.' Snowbell fell ill an hour after having a shampoo, wash and haircut at the Groom Rooms salon based at Pets at Home in Festival Park, Stoke-on-Trent. The family were landed with a £102 vet's bill. Pets at Home have launched an investigation into the grooming products that were used on Snowbell . 'Snowbell was reluctant to open her eyelids, which appeared swollen with yellow purulent discharge coming from both eyes,' Vet Susan Cuthbert at Charter Veterinary Surgery in Newcastle-under-Lyme, said. She explained that parts of both of the dog's eyes were red and inflamed and the dog was drooling far more than usual. 'It could have been worse had they not brought her in on Sunday. She looked in a bad state and distressed and I'm glad they brought Snowbell to see me. I don't know for certain what caused it, but it could have been a reaction to something,' Ms Cuthbert said. Pets at Home have launched an investigation into the products they use on dogs. A spokesman said: 'Our Groom Room colleagues are all highly trained and use only specifically formulated products which have a history of use in pet grooming. 'When washing dogs, great care is taken to avoid shampoo coming into contact with a dog's eyes. 'This was certainly the case with Snowbell so we were very surprised to learn of her reaction. 'The products used with Snowbell are common to all 179 Groom Rooms around the country and we have seen no other cases of dogs being affected in this way.' It was not the first time a customer of the grooming service in Stoke-on-Trent had taken their dog home to find it was dangerously unwell, the Stoke Sentinel reported. Nicki Jones, owner of another West Highland Terrier, says her pet went through a similar experience last year after going to the Pets at Home store. She had to pay £470 in vets bills for four visits and two eye surgeries after she was told by her vet that her dog could go blind.

"A German church pastor in Andreas Lubitz’s hometown insisted yesterday that the community stands by the killer co-pilot, as well as his family. Pastor Michael Dietrich, from the Lutheran church in Montabaur, spoke out following the fatal crash  that claimed the lives of 150 people. Among the dead in the French Alps disaster was 27-year-old Lubitz, who investigators say deliberately flew the plane into a mountain last Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Priest: Michael Dietrich, of the Lutheran church in co-pilot Andeas Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, said the community stands by his family . Arrivals: Mr Dietrich (right) welcomes people at the church entrance in Montabaur, Germany, before a service to commemorate the victims . Community spirit: People leave the church  in Montabaur, following the service to commemorate the crash victims and support their families . Elsewhere, Pope Francis yesterday remembered the dead as he opened solemn Holy Week services in front of some 70,000 faithful at the Vatican. Mr Dietrich said: ‘For us, it makes it particularly difficult that the only victim from Montabaur is suspected to have caused this tragedy.’ He added: ‘The co-pilot, the family belong to our community, and we stand by this, and we embrace them and will not hide this.’ The pastor added that there is no direct contact with the family at the moment, but that he believes they are receiving good assistance. French prosecutors have not yet questioned the family ‘out of decency and respect for their pain’, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said. Mr Dietrich said he knew Lubitz as a teenager, when he undertook religious education 13 years ago, and his mother, a part-time organist. Solemn procession: Pope Francis marks a Palm Sunday Mass in St Peter's Square at the Vatican yesterday, five days after the plane crash . Mass: Pope Francis yesterday remembered those killed in the crash as he opened solemn Holy Week services in front of some 70,000 faithful . Remembered: At the end of Palm Sunday Mass outside St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, Francis prayed for those who died in the tragedy . He added: ‘When I worked with her or talked to her, it was very good and very harmonious. We had good conversations. I know her and her family. 'This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family. 'From what I've heard, there were no obvious signs that there is anything in the background that could lead to this.’ Meanwhile Francis prayed for those who died in the tragedy, at the end of Palm Sunday Mass outside St Peter's Basilica yesterday. The 78-year-old pontiff cited in particular the 16 German students returning on Flight 4U9525 from an exchange trip to Spain. In addition, another pastor in Montabaur, Father Johannes Seemann, added that the community was grieving with the Lubitz family, reported Bild. Together: People attend a special Mass to honour the victims of the crash, at the cathedral Notre Dame de Bourg, in Digne-les-Bains, France . Co-pilot: The disaster killed 150 people, including Andreas Lubitz (above) who investigators say deliberately crashed the jet into the mountain . On guard: Police near the house where Lubitz lived in Montabaur - a community that is struggling to come to terms with the past week's events . Two wardens at his service asked God: ‘Have you forgotten the people who were sitting on the plane from Barcelona? Why did not you protect them?’ In Le Vernet, a town near the crash site, families and friends of those killed were still coming to terms with what had happened. ‘Members of the family shed tears as they went to see the site,’ said Ippei Yamanaka, co-worker of Japanese passenger Junichi Sato who died in the crash. ‘It was particularly moving to see Mr Sato's father asking the leader of the Kempeitai (a Japanese military rescue team), with many tears in his eyes, for them to continue the search operation and for it to finish earlier even by just one day. ‘His wife says she still she cannot believe what has happened, saying that it almost feels like her husband is away on his business trip and that it still feels like he is going to return soon.’ Among the tributes left near the crash site in France included one saying: ‘I thank you for everything. You have given me a wonderful life, full of beautiful things.’","Disaster killed 150 people including co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who 'deliberately crashed plane into the mountain'

"Artificial Intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'. But despite this, the race is on to create robots that can interact naturally with humans and mimic some of our unique characteristics. Now, a robot modelled on a four-year-old child, has been developed with a ‘sense of self’. Scroll down for video . A humanoid called iCub (pictured) has been developed with a ‘sense of self’ and is motivated by goals as we;l as being able to express six emotions on its face and even dance . The humanoid called iCub, which has been under development for 10 years, is motivated by goals and can express six emotions on its face, including raising its eyebrows and generating a light-up smile. It was originally created by the Italian Institute of Technology as part of the eFAA Project and over the years, it’s been refined to be able to crawl, walk and dance to music, manipulate objects in its hands, speak and express emotions. It's latest iteration is more human-like than ever. A video posted by New Scientist shows it playing a game of paddle war – a simple game where two players each hold a paddle - or in this case a cylinder - and try to score goals using a digital ball, while stopping their rival from scoring. A video shows iCub playing a game of paddle war (pictured) – a  game where two players each hold a paddle and try to score goals using a digital ball, while stopping their rival from scoring - but the robot is a sore loser! The robot’s goals and emotions change constantly, based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately to whether it is winning or losing. When iCub concedes a goal, it frowns and furrows its light-up eyebrows, sometimes swearing like an ill-tempered human. When it scores a goal, it smiles and says phrases like ‘got it,’ although there is not much change in intonation whether a phrase is negative or positive. The robot’s goals and emotions change constantly, based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately. A stock image is shown . The robot laughs, or says ‘ha ha’ when the ball ricochets off the side of the screen, but is seemingly a bad loser. ‘That isn’t fair, I should be stronger at video games!’ it says, after losing the game. The video also shows how the robot can respond to being touched, a little bit like a slightly creepy human. When a human strokes its arms it affects iCub’s reactions and emotions and the robot says on one occasion in the video: ‘I like when you touch me this way'. ‘Enjoying’ the human contact, the machine smiles and says: 'please, caress me again'. Tweaks to its software also mean that the robot is starting to understand language and can follow instructions that require reasoning, such as identifying two objects and moving them to a position, as instructed. Scientists are so keen to develop human-like robots to advance the field of artificial intelligence, which they hope could one day be used in medicine, and even eradicate disease and poverty, for example. A group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity, and doesn't destroy it. The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. The document , drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research. A group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking (pictured), have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity, and doesn't destroy it . 'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming. 'Our AI systems must do what we want them to do,' the letter says. 'Many economists and computer scientists agree that there is valuable research to be done on how to maximise the economic benefits of AI while mitigating adverse effects, which could include increased inequality and unemployment.' The letter followed comments made by Professor Hawking, who warned that AI could someday overtake humans. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC : 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' Musk has previously described AI as our 'biggest existential threat'.","The humanoid, called iCub has been under development for a decade .

"It is one of nature’s great ocean explorers, a giant creature that swims 13,000 miles in a year and can live to the age of 100. But rather than roaming the seven seas, this 34-stone leatherback sea turtle is undergoing treatment in a US aquarium after it swallowed a floating plastic bag. The leatherback, nicknamed Yawkey, was found dangerously ill on a remote beach in South Carolina. Scroll down for video . The rare leatherback sea turtle, nicknamed Yawkey (pictured), was found stranded on a remote beach . The huge turtle, weighing an estimated 500 pounds, is now being treated at South Carolina Aquarium . Rescuers believe Yawkey may have accidentally eaten plastic having mistaken it for his favourite food jellyfish . Rescuers tend to Yawkey at the aquarium where he is being treated with fluids and antibiotics . Yawkey floats in the small tank set up for him at the South Carolina Aquarium in Charleston . Experts said it became stranded after it mistook a billowing plastic bag for the jellyfish it feeds on – a common problem which kills countless sea turtles every year. Eating plastic could cause a build-up of gas in the digestive tract, making the turtle buoyant and washing it to shore. The incident is a stark illustration of the damage humans are doing to the environment by dumping millions of tons of plastic rubbish into our oceans. Recent studies estimate 8million tons of bags, bottles, toys and other rubbish ends up in the seas each year – affecting up to 400 different marine species, many of them endangered. The Daily Mail has been campaigning since 2008 for tougher action to reduce plastic bag waste. A major victory in the Banish the Bags campaign came in June last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in England. The charge, which will be introduced by October, is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £100million a year for good causes. The aquarium hopes to release Yawkey soon because leatherbacks do not cope well in captivity . Wildlife experts rescued the rare leatherback from a beach on Saturday. Kelly Thorvalson, a turtle expert at the South Carolina Aquarium Sea Turtle Hospital in Charleston, said it took five people to haul the giant beast from the beach. They rode in a 4x4 truck through mud and marshland to get to the leatherback, before using a winch to get it on to the vehicle. There were few signs of external injury to the beast, leading conservationists to conclude it had probably swallowed a plastic bag. ‘Leatherbacks feed primarily on jellyfish so it is very possible that plastics – such as bags that look like jellyfish – could be causing a gastro-intestinal issue,’ Mrs Thorvalson added. Leatherbacks, the biggest of all the sea turtles, swim in six of the seven oceans, roaming up to 13,000 miles a year in their search for food and nesting sites. The leatherback turtle’s dark blue shell is leathery to the touch – giving it its name. The animal is officially endangered, with global populations of nesting females having dropped from 115,000 in 1980 to as few as 34,000 in recent years. Yawkey has responded well to antibiotics and other treatment, and the aquarium hopes to release it in the next few days.","Rare leatherback sea turtle was found stranded on a South Carolina beach .

"A true eco-warrior has put her own spin on the bridal tradition of wearing something old and something new by growing her own wedding dress out of old tree mulch and fungus - and now she wants other brides to do the same. Erin Smith, a former artist in residence at Microsoft Research who lives in New York City, used a $40 bag of agricultural waste from Ecovative Design to grow mycelium, a mass of fibers from microscopic mushrooms, to create the 'fabric' for her dress, with the intention of wearing her unique, yet cardboard-like design to her nuptials in Vermont last August. 'I like the [idea] that maybe you change into something else for dancing, and you could literally tear the dress apart and put it in your garden, and it would literally keep growing with you,' she told the Huffington Post. It's alive! Erin Smith, from New York City, grew this cardboard-like bridal gown out of tree mulch and fungus . Environmentally friendly: The artist can be seen giving a presentation about the dress she had grown . She added: 'There’s something kind of of lovely about that.' In order to mold the mushroom material into the shape of a gown, she wrapped the sheets of mycelium around a dress form where they continued to grow. Erin said that her mom 'rolled her eyes' when she found out that her daughter was planning to wear a homegrown dress to say 'I do', but she wasn't particularly surprised. Despite her best intentions however, the artist ended up walking down the aisle in a thrift store dress because her dress wasn't entirely finished growing. But Erin insisted that she is still interested in the concept of growing wedding dresses and noted that she would like to one day create a thinner and more malleable mycelium for making clothing, including bridal gowns. Innovative: Erin used a $40 bag of agricultural waste to grow mycelium, a mass of fibers from microscopic mushrooms, to create the 'fabric' for her dress. She then wrapped the sheets around a dress form for shape . Circle of life: Erin said she liked the idea that a bride could tear the dress apart and put in her garden as compost . Clothing of the future: The dress is an example of taking a one time use object and turning it into something that is biodegradable immediately after use . 'I think the ability for us to grow our own clothing could have great positive potential,' she told The Guardian. According to Erin, growing clothing would eliminate carbon emissions and allow people to make garments with precise dimensions and specifications.' 'The concept behind a grown wedding dress was to take a one-time-use object and rethink its construction in order to have an appropriate material lifespan,' she said. Erin noted that the average cost of a wedding gown in the US is about $1,200 and made out of nearly 12 yards of fabric. 'The wedding dress is a perfect example of a one-time-use, energy intensive and entirely non-sustainable model that is representative of so many of the choices that we make daily,' she said.","Erin Smith used a $40 bag of agricultural waste to create sheets of 'fabric', which she wrapped around a dress form as they continued to grow .
