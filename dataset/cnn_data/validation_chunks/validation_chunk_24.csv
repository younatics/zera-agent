"Jose Mourinho has warned his hugely success youth team players that there is little room in his squad for nurturing home-grown talents. The Chelsea Under 18s are the reigning FA Youth Cup champions and they reached their fourth consecutive final on Wednesday night by defeating Tottenham 5-4 on aggregate. The success story does not stop there as the Under 19 side have also reached the semi-final of the UEFA Youth League where they will play Roma across two legs in April. However, ahead of Sunday's visit to play Hull, Mourinho has warned the burgeoning stars that the pressure at Stamford Bridge is to collect trophies, not produce players. Chelsea moved into their fourth straight FA Youth Cup final after beating Tottenham on aggregate . 'If they're good enough and they're ready then yes,' Mourinho said when asked if having a core of home-grown talent was a target. 'It's important, but this club is a very demanding club. It's a club where it's not easy to play football. The level people demand is high, the pressure is big. 'It's not the same to play in a club where people just accept a so-so performance, or people accept a so-so result. Or accept that you finish 5th, 6th, 7th or 8th. 'This is not the best habitat for a young player to be developed. For a player to play in the Chelsea first team the player must be ready. There is no space with this level of demand, responsibility and pressure. There is no space to play a player who is not ready.' Striker Dominic Solanke struck twice on Wednesday night to help the Under-18 side reach the cup final once again and also netted a brace in last season's final second-leg when his side lifted the trophy ahead of Fulham. Jose Mourinho says that the youth players must be ready to play before being promoted to the first team . But even after making his Champions League debut in a dead rubber group-stage match earlier this season, the wealth of imported talent means he is unlikely to get another first-team chance any time soon. 'I played Solanke winning 5-0 against Maribor, in a competition where we qualified easily in the group phase,' Mourinho said. 'I cannot play Solanke against Southampton with 30 minutes left at 1-1, I can't.' Solanke and the rest of Chelsea's finalists did get some additional reward for their heroics on Wednesday night after club captain John Terry was in the dressing room after the 5-2 win congratulating the young charges and offering advice. The Blues' skipper is destined to one day take over as manager of the west London club, but Mourinho insists it will not be any time soon while the centre-back is still one of the best defenders in the Premier League. 'He's going to sign a new contract as a player,' Mourinho said. 'In a couple of weeks or a month we will have a notice for the press conference. Dominic Solanke, pictured scoring against Tottenham, played in a Champions League match against Maribor . 'For the next year at least I see him as a player and I don't think it's right for me to speak about him after that.' Victory against Steve Bruce's side on Sunday will take the Premier League leaders one match closer to clinching yet another title. Eden Hazard has been in scintillating form for Chelsea and while his manager does not want to draw any additional attention to his player, he does warn the decision makers of his criteria for any Player of the Season accolades. 'In my old-fashioned way of looking at individual awards, for me individual awards only for the winners,' he added. 'I'm never happy when somebody wins individual awards but doesn't win the big prize, the collective one. If I was the guy to give awards, I'd wait until the end of the season and it would always go to a champion.'","Jose Mourinho says there isn't room for nurturing talent in the first team .

"After Barcelona took a giant step towards winning the La Liga title with a 2-1 win in El Clasico on Sunday night the squad looked ready to celebrate in style - except Lionel Messi that is. While team-mates including Neymar Jnr, Dani Alves, and Adriano got suited and booted in their garish designer suits, the Argentina forward opted for a more conservative look. On the pitch Messi has the ability  to set the place alight but his ensemble on Sunday night left him looking distinctly average in comparison to his South American team-mates.

Goalscoring hero Luis Suarez poses for a pic with fellow frontmen Messi and Neymar after the victory . Barca's attacking trio pose for another dressing room snap after beating rivals Real Madrid . The 27-year-old plumped for a plain black jumper and the sort of grey trousers you might have worn as part of a school uniform. In fact, Messi wouldn't have looked out of place delivering a lesson to a group of geography students. That said, even the snappiest of dressers might be made to feel like a wallflower standing next to the flamboyant Neymar and Alves. The Brazilian duo caused quite a stir on social media with their choice of attire. Alves went for a silver jacket and gold shoes combo . While a night of celebrations might have been in order for some of the squad, Gerard Pique, who turned in a superb defensive performance at the Nou Camp, looked set for a quiet night in with the missus. After his impressive performance, Pique left the stadium with his pop star girlfriend Shakira . Suarez scored the winner for Barcelona in their 2-1 win over Real Madrid at the Nou Camp . Barcelona celebrated after moving four points clear of their rivals in La Liga with 10 games remaining . The Spain international was pictured leaving the stadium hand-in-hand with long-term pop star girlfriend Shakira. Pique earned rave reviews as Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema were kept relatively quiet during what could prove a season-defining victory. And Shakira appeared as impressed by her man's performance as anyone tweeting: 'Gerard Pique is THE Defender! Shak.' Jeremy Mathieu and Luis Suarez scored for the hosts either side of a Cristiano Ronaldo striker as Barcelona opened up a four-point lead over rivals Real Madrid.","Barcelona beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Nou Camp in El Clasico on Sunday .

"This is the moment a playful young seal tries its best to hitch a ride with a couple of kayaks - but keeps sliding off. The grey seal pup was filmed as it made several attempts to climb aboard the canoes in Poole Bay, Dorset. At first the adorable seal tries his best to jump on both the kayaks, but he keeps sliding off, back into the water. Hitching a ride: Ron the friendly seal attempts to climb onto a kayak in Poole Bay, Dorset . Attempt one: The young pup makes it onto one of the kayaks, and momentarily keeps his balance . He then manages to get onto the left kayak, but just as it looks like he has found himself a comfortable spot - he falls in again. The pup, known locally as Ron the Seal,  finally succeeds by draping himself across both of the kayaks. Kayaker Andrew Linstead shot the video of the young seal's repeated attempts to climb aboard his raft as he paddled in Poole Bay. This is the third time Mr Linstead has had an encounter with Ron the Seal in four months. Last November, while Mr Linstead was practicing rolling his kayak in the water, he noticed the seal watching him and then joining in, rolling every time he did. Fail: Unfortunately for Ron the Seal, he cannot manage to stay on the kayak, and falls back in the water . On it again: Ron the seal proves he is not a quitter and is soon at it again, trying to climb the kayaks . A month later, the pair met again, as Ron jumped on the back of his kayak and hitched a ride around for several hours. The latest encounter, filmed by Mr Linstead, lasted for four hours with Ron climbing on and off Mr Linstead's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught. Mr Linstead, from London, said: 'I've had quite a few encounters with Ron now, we are becoming good friends! 'The first time I saw him was when I was practising rolling my kayak. Ron seemed to roll whenever I rolled my kayak. 'Afterwards I put a message on a Facebook local community page asking if anyone knew anything about the seal and I got lots of responses. The locals have called it Ron, as in Ronseal. 'I think when Ron now sees me he feels comfortable. 'This time I was out on my own and I saw another kayaker. I asked him if he could brace or roll his kayak in case Ron got on his boat and tipped up over. Resting spot: Kayaker Andrew Linstead shot the video of the young seal's repeated attempts to climb aboard his raft as he paddled in Poole Bay . New buddies: Their encounter lasted for four hours with Ron climbing on and off Mr Linstead's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught . Another ride: This is the third time Ron and Mr Linstead, from London, has met in four months . 'He said he couldn't so he came alongside me and held on to my kayak. 'I don't think he believed me that Ron would come over but he did. 'Ron tried to climb on but he kept slipping off. It went on for hours, I took my last shot of him about four hours later. 'I've spoken to other kayakers in the area and they say they have never seen anything like that.' Julie Hatcher, from Dorset Wildlife Trust, said: 'This is a young grey seal. Seals tend to be a bit wary of people, we don't know why this one isn't. It might just be a personality thing. 'They are solitary animals when they are at sea. They come together for breeding but generally are solitary in the water. 'Young ones tend to be more friendly and playful. I have dived with seals and the young ones will come near you, they can be quite curious and like playing hide and seek, but the adults don't tend to.' The waters of the UK are home to more than 180,000 grey seals, which is more than a third of the world's population.","Young grey seal filmed as he attempts to hitch a ride with two kayaks .

"David Gill will become the most powerful administrator in English football when he is elected onto the FIFA ExCo at the UEFA Congress in Vienna. He is a certainty to be the landslide choice of the 54 UEFA voting territories to succeed Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce, despite rival FA of Wales president Trefor Lloyd-Hughes claiming the FA have reneged on a signed agreement that it was the Welsh turn. Gill's FIFA seat as the British vice-president will give him unprecedented football influence added to his other roles on the UEFA ExCo, FA vice-chairman, Premier League representative on the FA and Manchester United director. David Gill is widely expected to succeed Jim Boyce as FIFA's British vice-president on Tuesday . Gill has been backed by FA Chairman Greg Dyke to ensure ethics and transparency in the organisation . And FA chairman Greg Dyke, one of those along with UEFA chief Michel Platini who persuaded Gill to change his mind about working for a Sepp Blatter-led FIFA, wants urbane accountant Gill to be 'awkward' and stir up trouble in Zurich by asking hard questions of the FIFA president during his likely fifth term of office. Dyke said: 'David will do the job properly. FIFA needs to have someone from the awkward squad asking tough questions. There is a feeling there have been too many acolytes and not enough people ensuring decisions are taken in a transparent, ethical and business-like manner.' England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster will head for a poolside bar with a beer or just lie in a darkened room when he goes on holiday to Tenerife this week to reflect on the agonising near miss in the Six Nations and plan for the World Cup. 'It's just a bit of space to get my head straight before I dive back into everything,' he said. Lancaster always travels to the same destination on Tenerife for his private thinking time after major tournaments, which his wife Nina describes as going into his 'cave'. Daughter Sophie reacted to Lancaster dining alone in a restaurant in Tenerife by calling him 'weirdo' in a text message. Lancaster wouldn't give his exact holiday location when asked, saying: 'I'm not going to tell you where it is in case you start following me around.' But his chances of escaping attention from British hordes in the Canary Islands are slim. England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster will take a holiday retreat to Tenerife following the Six Nations . England fell one try short of a first Six Nations title since 2011 after their 55-35 victory over France . Twickenham charging £41 for wheelchair access to England matches, as revealed by Sports Agenda, has caused so much upset following long established free entry, the issue is going to be looked at by the international ticket committee as well as the RFU board and council. RFU staff are said to have implemented the new cost without first going through the ticketing committee. BBC and BT rugby pundit Matt Dawson chose to tweet a picture of Twickenham personnel rehearsing podium preparation for a Six Nations presentation to 'champions' England before the French match. The image, which provoked the arrogant England stereotype, was soon deleted. When Saracens announced the departure last Friday evening of Ed Griffiths, stand-out chief executive in English rugby for the past seven years, it looked a classic case of media-savvy Griffiths burying bad news on the eve of the Six Nations. However, it has emerged that highly-talented Griffiths is not leaving of his own accord. His exit is understood to be more to do with a breakdown of relationships with other powerbrokers at the club than alleged salary cap breaches. Griffiths was reported to be leaving at the end of the season but has ceased day-to-day work. Broadcaster John Inverdale should be relieved his c-word slip of the tongue — 'rose-****** glasses' — while presenting Radio 5 Live's Cheltenham coverage hasn't cost him his prime role anchoring ITV's broadcast of the Rugby World Cup, an event more anticipated after such an epic finale to the Six Nations. John Inverdale, pictured here working for the BBC, was recorded swearing on air during Cheltenham . The European Club Association, having agreed a much improved financial deal with FIFA for club payments when releasing players for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, have demonstrated they want their status to rise accordingly. They have hired sport strategist Jon Tibbs's PR company JTA, who also work for Manchester United, to represent them.","David Gill looks set to succeed Jim Boyce FIFA's British vice-president .

"Arsenal legend Martin Keown believes Per Mertesacker's omission from Arsenal's starting line-up for Sunday's win over Everton 'could be a defining moment in changing the club's back four'. January signing Gabriel Paulista was preferred to the German in defence, with Gunners boss Arsene Wenger telling BT Sport that the change was made in order to give Mertesacker a rest. Sportsmail's Keown, speaking as a pundit on BT Sport, reacted to the news of Mertesacker's absence for the crucial game at the Emirates saying: 'I don't you can point the finger at one player after the Monaco game.

"Tony Abbott has again showed the nation that he has a big mouth, but this time he chose to put it around a large, fresh onion - with the skin still intact.

"Clarke Carlisle pictured outside of court on Monday . Clarke Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence that occurred two days before the former footballer tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a lorry. The 35-year-old, still bearing the facial scars from his December 22 suicide attempt in a crash which left him in a coma until mid-January, spoke clearly as he stood in the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London. The former Professional Footballers' Association chairman, who played for Leeds United, Burnley and Queens Park Rangers, admitted failing to provide a sample on December 20. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence on the same date, when police officers spotted a Mercedes travelling in an 'erratic' manner, prosecutor Zahid Hussain said. Deputy District Judge Margaret Dodds told Carlisle that he would 'inevitably' be disqualified when he next appears at the same court for sentencing on May 14. She also ordered that reports be made in the case after being told of Carlisle's medical situation. He had been spotted by police 'swerving' his Mercedes and nearly hitting a lorry on Pentonville Road, north London, on December 20 at about 7am. Mr Hussain said the car was seen 'swerving in the lane, to the pavement on the nearside, almost mounting the pavement' and that the tyres were 'grinding on the curb'. When the officers stopped and spoke to Carlisle, 'alcohol was smelled on his breath', Mr Hussain added. Carlisle discussed his failed suicide attempt in February with Absolute Radio's Jon Champion in what was his first radio appearance since leaving hospital. He said he was 'disgusted' with himself and told family members he 'did not want to be here' when they visited him in Leeds General Infirmary. 'I was only in LGI for three days and throughout those three days my family were coming to see me,' he said. 'Every time I came and felt unconditional love. It was just another point of self loathing. I was disgusted with myself and I said I have to be honest with you 'I still do not want to be here'. Former Leeds United footballer Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence on December 20 . It happened two days before he tried to kill himself in a crash on December 22 with his scar still visible .

Because these are the people who are coming to love me and care for me. And I'm telling them that in spite of that I want to be dead.' Carlisle revealed he would have been sectioned if he rejected the chance of attending a psychiatric hospital. The lorry driver who struck Carlisle said he may never be able to get behind the wheel again. Darren Pease feared both he and Carlisle would die after glass shattered following the crash, leaving them with cuts to their faces and the driver temporarily blinded. He told the Daily Mirror: 'That feeling is indescribable - to think you are going to die. 'I don't think I'll ever be able to get behind the wheel of a lorry again. I can't see any way back for me at this point. I can't drive a car properly, never mind a wagon. 'All I could think was that I had killed someone. How am I going to live with this? What am I going to tell everybody? 'What do you say? It's unreal, the shock meant I couldn't stand or walk, I was in a wheelchair.'

"Being able to understand and communicate with your pet is something that many people wish they could do. But for the owner of a seven-year-old American pit bull terrier from Canada, the idea is less a wish and more a reality. The  clever dog, named Czr (pronounced Caesar), is something of an internet phenomenon and has accumulated more than 32,000 likes on its Facebook page for its ability to 'speak'. According to Czr’s Facebook page, the dog has been taught to communicate with classic learning theory . Its ability to say 'yes' and 'no' as well as nod and shake its head is what sets it apart from others like it. And its owner has captured a typical conversation  with the dog, who stands before her  in what appears to be a hallway. She asks her pet: ‘Do you want something?’ Immediately the dog looks at her, shakes its head and utters 'no'. Czr the American pit bull terrier listens attentively to its owner's questions and answers accordingly . She then asks the dog whether it is bored and he again replies, but this time with a nod and the word 'yes'.

"Notts County have sacked manager Shaun Derry following their poor recent run of results.

Assistant manager Greg Abbott has also departed the club. Notts County have sacked manager Shaun Derry following their poor recent run of results . How the bottom of League One is shaping up . County CEO Aileen Trew said: 'This is without doubt one of the hardest decisions that we have had to make as a board because we know how much this club means to Shaun and Greg and we know how much hard work they had both put in during their time here. 'However, we have to make the decisions that we feel are in the best interests of the club and our perilous position in the table meant that we felt we needed to make a change.

"Barcelona's 2-1 win over Real Madrid in Sunday's 'El Clasico' may have put them four points clear at the top of La Liga but they will be kicking themselves for not taking a host of second-half chances and grabbing the head-to-head advantage. If Real manage to draw level on points with their great rivals over the remaining 10 games - and they have what looks on paper like a slightly easier run-in - they will snatch the title because they beat Barca 3-1 in Madrid in October. Head-to-head record is used before goal difference to separate teams with equal points and Real famously pipped Barca to the title in 2006-07 despite having scored 12 fewer goals and conceded seven more. Barcelona and Luis Suarez could miss out on the La Liga title to Real Madrid with their head-to-head record . 1) Head to head points . 2) Head to head goal difference . 3) Head to head goals scored . 4) Goal difference . 5) Goals scored . Any disappointment Barca coach Luis Enrique and the players may be feeling on Monday morning will be outweighed by their joy at seeing off Real at the Nou Camp, thanks to a superb Luis Suarez goal 11 minutes after half time. Watched by almost 100,000 fans packed into the giant stadium and millions more around the world, Jeremy Mathieu had put Barca ahead in the 19 minute before Cristiano Ronaldo levelled for Real in minute 31. 'For the moment it is the most important goal I have scored for Barca and it has an extra significance considering who we were playing,' a jubilant Suarez, who debuted for the club in October's 'Clasico' after a four-month ban for biting, told reporters. Suarez (9) slots home his spectacular winner to put Barcelona four points clear at the top of La Liga . Cristiano Ronaldo (right) silenced the Barcelona crowd after equalising for Real Madrid in the first half . 'There is a long way to go and we know that winning the league is going to be very tough,' added the Uruguay striker. 'Just like in all the leagues, you never know what can happen if you relax just a little.' Real coach Carlo Ancelotti and his players, meanwhile, will be wondering how they let slip a match they seemed to be well in control of after Ronaldo's leveller. The Portugal captain was almost completely anonymous in the second half and Real's Wales winger Gareth Bale also made little impact. 'In the end we suffered because of a slight lack of cool heads in our efforts to equalise,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We played too many long balls without a clear idea,' added the Italian. 'It was a good hour, and 30 minutes that weren't so good.' The Uruguayan is mobbed by his team-mates following his goal but they could still miss out on the title . Gareth Bale (centre) struggled during the game and has come under a lot of criticism in recent months .","If both sides are level on points at the end of the season, Real Madrid would win the title due to their head-to-head record this campaign .

"One of at least four airmen captured by Al Qaeda militants after their Syrian Air Force helicopter crash-landed has appeared in a new propaganda video that calls for the release of a radical cleric. The pilot, who was captured near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province, is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi Abdullah al-Muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle. Al-Muhaysini, who has long been affiliated with Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria, suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the Syrian regime releases notorious jihadi Abu Mus'ab as-Suri, who is wanted in Spain for suspected links to the 1985 El Descanso and 2004 Madrid bombings. Scroll down for video . Fear: The captured pilot is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi Abdullah al-Muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle . Threatened: The pilot, who was captured near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province yesterday, appeared in the video released by Al Qaeda-linked militants from Jabhat al-Nusra this morning . The video shows the airman looking dazed as he sits on the floor of a darkened room with the notorious black and white banner of Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra behind him. Clearly suffering injuries as a result of the helicopter crash, the pilot still has bloodied bandages wrapped around his head. The footage is decidedly amateur, is clearly filmed on either a mobile phone or a cheap recording device - making it look nothing like the slick, professionally edited videos put out by Nusra's rival jihadi group Islamic State. Nevertheless, the sight of Al-Muhaysini standing over the pilot and ranting about his possible murder while wielding a large knife has the same chilling impact as any ISIS release. Al-Muhaysini's primary demand is that the Syrian regime release Abu Mus'ab as-Suri - a notorious Al Qaeda linked militant who was arrested in Pakistan in 2005 and later rendered to his homeland. Aleppo-born As-Suri - who holds Spanish citizenship remains a wanted man in Spain on suspicion of taking part in the Islamic Jihad Organization's 1985 bombing at Madrid's El Descanso restaurant, which left 18 dead. He is also wanted as a possible witness to the Al Qaeda-inspired  coordinated bombings on the Madrid's train system, which killed 191 people and left more than 2,000 injured in March 2004. 'Technical malfunction': People gather around a helicopter reportedly belonging to Syrian regime forces that crashed in Jabal al-Zawiya yesterday . Gathered around: Islamist rebels captured four crew members when the helicopter crashed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . The airman was one of six people on board the Syrian Air Force helicopter when it crashed  in a rebel-held area of north-western Syria, near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province yesterday. It experienced a technical malfunction and made an emergency crash-landing according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Syria's state news agency confirmed that a helicopter had crashed after a mechanical problem and said the authorities were looking for the crew. The SOHR stated that opposition fighters, including from the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, had taken four crew members prisoner. Another airman survived the crash but was reportedly killed by his captors, and the fate of a suspected sixth airman is unknown, the Observatory said. SOHR head Rami Abdel Rahman said: ‘A regime helicopter was forced to land in the region of Jabal al-Zawiya in the north-west, which is a bastion of (Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate) Al-Nusra Front. ‘Four of the crew were captured and a fifth man was killed by armed men in a neighbouring village.’ Down: The airman was one of six people on board the Syrian Air Force helicopter when it crashed in a rebel-held area of north-western Syria, near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province yesterday. A girl flashes a victory sign as she poses near the crashed helicopter near Jabal al-Zawiya  yesterday . Pictures provided by the Observatory showed groups of men gathering around a damaged helicopter lying on its side on a rocky hilltop. Mr Rahman said two of the servicemen were being held by Nusra Front, while the other two were captured by an unknown Islamist group. An amateur video posted online showed rebels inspecting the wreckage of the helicopter, which had rolled on to its side on a rocky hill. The aircraft's blue undercarriage was partially torn and the nose badly damaged. Photographs posted by activists online showed the same crash site and at least two airmen in rebel custody. The United Nations claims the Syrian air force uses helicopters extensively to drop barrel bombs in indiscriminate attacks on residential areas. The improvised munitions are giant canisters packed with hundreds of pounds of explosives and scrap metal. However, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad denied in a BBC interview last February that his forces used barrel bombs.","Airman was seen in video released by Al Qaeda affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra .

"An Illinois teenager who broke both legs after he slipped off a canyon ledge and fell 90 feet could face criminal charges, police said. 18-year-old Christopher J. Stewart was in Starved Rock State Park near Utica with a young woman and two 'highly intoxicated' men, according to Illinois Conservation Police Sgt Robert Frazier. The NewsTribune reports that the Aurora teenager hopped a wooden railing and left a walkway before jumping down to the rim of Wildcat Canyon. Injured: Christopher J Stewart (left) slipped and fell 90 feet off Wildcat Canyon and needed to be airlifted to a hospital in Peoria . Once on the canyon's edge, he tried to knock pieces of ice off from the top of the waterfall before slipping and falling 90 feet into the canyon, Frazier said. Utica firefighters responding to the incident carried Stewart out of the canyon on a board before Ottawa River Rescue ferried him across the river to a waiting ambulance. The ambulance then brought the teenager to a Life Flight helicopter to be transported him to a hospital in Peoria. As of Saturday morning, the teenager was reportedly in critical condition though a photo shared by a friend on Facebook show Stewart alert and sitting upright in a neck brace. Remote wilderness: Rescuers had to transport Stewart by boat to a helicopter on a board to transport him to the hospital . Deep freeze: The waterfall had frozen over, and Stewart went to the top of the frozen falls, before falling 90 feet . Aftermath: In addition to broken legs, Stewart had multiple fractures (pictured) to his arm along with other injuries that required transportation to a hospital in Peoria . Dangerous drop: Stewart had reportedly jumped a fence and was trying to break ice off the waterfall before he fell, as investigators say a charge of entering a restricted area is pending . Frazier says in addition to the two men, who were both intoxicated and over the age of 21, 19-year-old Kara Watkins from Aurora was charged with marijuana possession of less than 2.5 grams. Stewart faces a pending charge for entering a restricted area. Conservation police say they are investigating additional charges against the individuals pending the results of toxicology reports.","Christopher J Stewart of Aurora was with a young woman and two 'highly intoxicated' men at Starved Rock State Park near Utica .

"He is prone to misfiring and, according to football fans, has rarely been out of first gear in recent months. But that has not stopped Premier League striker Steven Fletcher looking very pleased with himself as he took delivery of a £260,000 supercar. For long-suffering Sunderland supporters the photograph of the £40,000-a-week Scottish international and his 217mph Lamborghini Aventador was a blatant own goal – and they were not slow to put the boot in. Scroll down for video . Aventador: Steven Fletcher, who has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland, suffered a Twitter backlash after the photograph of him with the supercar on the driveway of his home went viral . Couple: Fletcher (right) moved to a £670,000 five-bedroom home in County Durham with his beauty queen partner Rachel Monaghan (left), 24, in October 2013, and they live there with their daughter Darcy-Mae, one . Seven goals in two seasons: Fletcher (left) vies for the ball with Aston Villa's Jores Okore (right) during his Sunderland side's 4-0 Premier League defeat at the Stadium of Light on March 14 . They said the car was undeserved given Fletcher’s poor performances, especially as the picture was taken days before Sunderland suffered a 4-0 thrashing. The club is 17th in the Premier League after winning just four of 30 league games this season, scoring only 23 goals in the process – the league’s second lowest. And Fletcher – who cost £12million – has rarely troubled the scoreboard. Dozens of fans shared a mock message on Twitter reading: ‘Steven Fletcher: two seasons, seven goals, one new Lamborghini Aventador.’ Janet Rowan, from the Sunderland Supporters’ Association, said: ‘We know footballers have these big flash cars. I just think the timing was really appalling and I can really understand the way that people have felt about this. Showing his moves: Fletcher (centre) was among Sunderland players who took to the catwalk for the Foundation of Light's annual charity fashion show at the Stadium of Light in November 2013 . Comparisons: Birmingham fan Michael Jabbari quoted a message from parody account BBC Sporf in a tweet, which said: 'Steven Fletcher: two seasons, seven goals, one new Lamborghini Aventador' Unimpressed: In response to the photo, Sunderland fan JamesTheMackem posted on Twitter that it was 'the most undeserved Lambo for a football player, ever' ‘To see someone taking possession of a car of that value, when most of the fans who go to the game are on a pittance, it was probably the straw that broke the camel’s back.’ The footballer’s agent said it was the firm that sold the car that had posted the picture online. Scott Fisher said: ‘It wasn’t Steven that put the picture up. The company who were doing advertising on it done it. I don’t know what the problem is and what people are getting excited about.’ The background of the picture shows another luxury car – a Bentley – in the drive of the 27-year-old’s £670,000 home in Durham. Another online critic, Jamesthemackem, wrote: Steven Fletcher has a Lamborghini, the most undeserved Lambo for a football player, ever.’ Jack Liddell posted on Twitter: ‘Tell me how Steven Fletcher (a striker) can score seven goals in two seasons yet have earned a Lamborghini Aventador and a Bentley Continental.’ Fletcher has commanded more than £20million in transfer fees and is known to have a liking for luxury vehicles. He moved to the five-bedroom home in County Durham with his beauty-queen partner Rachel Monaghan, 24, in October 2013. Around then he reportedly bought a £50,000 Mercedes 4x4 for the former Miss Scotland finalist. They have a daughter called Darcy-Mae, aged one. Fletcher has struggled for form at Sunderland. He only managed three goals last season and four so far this campaign.","Steven Fletcher has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland .

"Newcastle will be forced to use Daryl Janmaat as an emergency centre-back in their next three matches despite the Holland international admitting – ‘I’ve never played there in my life’. The Magpies have left themselves desperately short of defensive cover and, with Steven Taylor and Paul Dummett sidelined because of injury until the summer and skipper Fabricio Coloccini suspended, only Mike Williamson remains as a recognised central defender. Newcastle - who sold defenders Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa and Davide Santon in the January window -  failed in their bid to overturn Coloccini’s red card from Sunday’s 3-0 defeat at Everton. Daryl Janmaat is set for a spell at centre back following the FA's decision to reject Fabricio Coloccini's appeal . The Argentine was dismissed following a lunge on Aaron Lennon and will now serve a three-game ban. That rules him out of the Tyne-Wear derby at Sunderland on Easter Sunday, as well as testing fixtures with Arsenal and Liverpool. It means right-back Janmaat is set to partner Williamson, but the 25-year-old said: ‘If the team needs me there, I am confident I can do well there, even though I have not played as a central defender in the whole of my career. The Newcastle captain (left) was sent off for a dangerous tackle on Aaron Lennon on Sunday . ‘I will play in the middle of the defence if I am asked to do so, although it is not really my position. ‘It is not really as though I have ambitions to stay there, but we all know what the situation is at the moment and if I have to play there, I will. ‘The second half at Everton was the first time I have played there so it is not something I know all that well.’ The Dutch international has been one of Newcastle's most consistent performers so far this season .","Daryl Janmaat set to play at centre back in place of Fabricio Coloccini .

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of football including Aaron Ramsey's return and John Stones being a rock at the back for Everton. 1. John Stones reminded Everton how badly they had missed him during their awful exit from the Europa League in midweek. The 20-year-old, left out by Roberto Martinez in Dynamo Kiev who picked Antolin Alcarez instead, returned to the starting line-up with a strong defensive display at QPR. Stones and Phil Jagielka made 41 clearances between them to limit Rangers to just one shot on target. Everton have lost just three of the 12 games the pair have played as centre backs since Stones recovered from injury. John Stones was impressive for Everton in their win over QPR on Sunday . 2. England boss Roy Hodgson seems to rate Andros Townsend far higher than Mauricio Pochettino does. The winger got dragged off by his Spurs boss after just 58 minutes of the 4-3 win over Leicester – meaning he’s been hooked early in all the last eight matches he has started for his club. Of 32 appearances in a Tottenham shirt this season he’s only completed 90 minutes on seven occasions. Despite that Hodgson picked him in November – although he was forced to withdraw through injury – and has him in the squad for this week’s fixtures against Lithuania and Italy. Andros Townsed was substituted in the 38th minute against Leicester by Mauricio Pochettino . 3. If Burnley do finish the season being relegated back to the Championship it won’t be through lack of effort. The EA Sports performance data shows they collectively ran two miles more than Southampton’s side as they fought to avoid the 2-0 defeat at St Mary’s – 73.8 miles compared to Saints’ 71.8. It’s nothing new – Sean Dyche’s side have outworked their opponents in every single one of their 30 Premier League fixtures so far. Jason Shackell and the rest of the Burnley side outworked Southampton in their defeat on Saturday . 4. Swansea’s ability to find bargain signings continues to be the envy of many other clubs – and the £3million they paid Southampton for Jack Cork looks the latest astute investment. The 25-year-old son of former Wimbledon star Alan has slotted straight into Garry Monk’s midfield with seven 90 minute appearances in a row and was excellent at Aston Villa. He covered more ground (7.1miles), played more passes (72), fought in more duels (21) and won more tackles (5) than any other player on the pitch. Jack Cork has slotted in well to Swansea's midfield since his move from Southampton in January . 5. Dick Advocaat needs to help Connor Wickham rediscover the form that rescued the club a year ago as a priority for this season’s fight against relegation. The new Black Cats boss picked the 21-year-old at West Ham for his first 90 minute appearance since January 1st. Wickham, who scored five goals in the final six games last term, had just one shot on target and one wayward at Upton Park – and has scored only three League games all season. Connor Wickham needs to rediscover his form of last season to help Sunderland avoid the drop . 6. Aaron Ramsey’s return to fitness has come at the perfect time for Arsenal as they try to chase down Manchester City for the runners-up spot. The Welsh international midfielder took full advantage of the space given him by Newcastle as the Gunners went into a two goal lead. Ramsey, whose late appearance off the bench almost helped rescue Arsenal’s Champions League fortunes in Monaco, played more accurate passes in the attacking half of the field than any of his team mates. Aaron Ramsey's return to form for Arsenal has come at just the right time as they push for a top four place . 7. Manchester United look a more effective side when they pass the ball rather than lump it up to Marouane Fellaini. Louis van Gaal’s side played 568 passes in the 2-1 win at Anfield, some 162 more than Liverpool. It was also only 27 less than their best away total of the season so far, when they ran rings round relegation candidates QPR at Loftus Road in January. Manchester United have looked a better side since they started passing the ball more . 8. Paul Trollope has set about restoring his reputation as one of the game’s bright young coaches since Cardiff appointed him as number two to Russell Slade. The 42-year-old, whose CV included taking Bristol Rovers into League One as a manager then helping Chris Hughton keep Norwich in the Premier League, had spent nearly a year out of the game before getting the chance in South Wales. Cardiff had just one win in 11 games before he arrived – but the 2-0 success against Birmingham makes it four wins and 15 points in all from nine games since then. Paul Trollope is doing a good job as coach at Cardiff working with Russell Slade . 9. Juventus and former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is being talked about in fees of up to £100million – but Crawley boss Dean Saunders picked up his brother Mathias from the Turin giants on a free transfer. The 6ft 3ins striker has proved an inspired signing, even if he is yet to get his first goal. His physical presence has helped make space for Izale McLeod to get seven in ten games since Pogba, 24, made his debut at the start of February, with Crawley collecting 16 points in the process. Paul Pogba is being talked about as a £100m player - but his brother Mathias signed for Crawley for free . 10. Shaun Derry has suffered a major setback to what looked like a promising career as a manager at Notts County after he was sacked on Monday. The former QPR ace lifted the club to third in the League One table in October – but since then has overseen a slump that has seen them crash to just one place off the relegation zone following a 4-1 thrashing at MK Dons. Derry was unable to keep a settled side – County  have used 46 players in League games this season.

"Police hunting for the killer of a stay-at-home mum have released chilling CCTV footage of her last moments when she casually bought drinks at a supermarket just two days before she was found brutally murdered. Traci O'Sullivan, 41, was found dead by her ex-partner and their five-year-old son at her North Frankston home in Melbourne on Saturday, February 7. Detectives believe Ms O'Sullivan knew her attacker and they may have suffered serious cuts to their hands caused by holding a weapon used to murder her. Scroll down for video . Police have released CCTV footage of the last time Traci O'Sullivan was seen in public before she was found brutally murdered in her North Frankston home on February 7 . Family say they last saw the 41-year-old at her mother's house on February 5. Newly released CCTV footage from the day she was last seen shows a barefoot Ms O'Sullivan buying drinks at an IGA store in Frankston North about 4.20pm before she headed to her home just 700 metres away. Police hope the images of the woman in a pink singlet and denim shorts would prove to be a trigger for those who saw her in the lead up to her death. Detective Senior Sergeant Stuart Bailey said investigators believed Ms O'Sullivan most likely knew her attacker as she was known to be security conscious. Detectives believe Traci O'Sullivan knew her attacker and they may have suffered serious cuts to their hands caused by holding a weapon used to murder her . 'There were no signs of forced entry to the property which makes us believe that Traci has willingly let her killer into her home,' he said. 'Given the nature of Traci's injuries we believe that the person responsible may have suffered cuts to their palms or hands which may have required medical attention. 'If you believe you know of someone with unexplained injuries like this around the time of Traci's death, we would like to speak to you. This includes anyone within the medical field who may have treated someone with injuries like this.' Ms O'Sullivan suffered multiple injuries sometime in the two days before her body was discovered. Police would not reveal details about the type of weapon or cause of death, saying only that she suffered from a severe physical attack.

"Despite a late rally from Ryan LaFlare in the fifth round, Demian Maia looked completely dominant on his way to a unanimous victory in the main event in Rio on Saturday night. The Brazilian jiu jitsu black belt got the American wrestler to the ground in each round and underlined his dominance by establishing the mount position in all but the final round. Threatening to finish with an arm triangle in the second and again in the fourth round, LaFlare's ability to stay in the competition nearly won him the fight as he managed to turn the tables on the Brazilian in the final act. The American welterweight came out all guns blazing in the fifth and caught a visibly tiring Maia with some big shots to the body that forced the Brazilian to pull guard in attempt to stop LaFlare's assault in the striking department. Such was Maia's reluctance to trade with LaFlare that referee John McCarthy took a point from the veteran as he flopped to his back in the last seconds of the contest. Demian Maia of Brazil is announced the winner after defeating Ryan LaFlare of the USA . Taking the point away had little or no impact on the judges' scorecards in what was otherwise a one-sided affair. Speaking after the bout, Maia claimed that the fans had been his inspiration during his 'tough' camp, having only returned after battling a recent bone infection. 'First of all I have to thank everybody who stayed up late and came out here to watch the fight,' Maia told the crowd through a translator in the Ginásio do Maracanãzinho. 'I was out for three months, I had a serious infection so I had a very tough camp and I came in and fought a guy who was undefeated, a very tough fighter. The public, the fans, they were my motivation.' Asked who he would like to face next, Maia wasn't specific when it came to names but declared interest in another main event or co-main event slot in the future.

The Brazilian jiu jitsu black belt celebrates his win having got the American wrestler to the ground each round . He said: 'I'd like to have another good fight, maybe a co-main event or another main event. I was just really happy to come out here and fight in the birthplace of jiujitsu. Helio Gracie, Carlos Gracie and a lot of to jiu jitsu guys have fought here, so it's an honour to fight here.' Meanwhile in the co-main event, Erick Silva banked his sixth UFC first round finish after an exciting fire fight with UFC veteran Josh Koscheck. With both fighters throwing caution to the wind during the bout, Silva managed to get Koscheck's attention with a straight left hand just shy of the three-minute mark. As Koscheck attempted to close the distance, Silva cleverly wrapped up a guillotine choke, which he adapted as the AKA fighter pummelled him against the fence. Jumping guard with the choke locked in, Silva forced the tap from the UFC veteran who has now lost five fights in a row.

"Manny Pacquiao works up a sweat on a Los Angeles basketball court as the pint-sized Filipino's preparations for his May 2 megafight with Floyd Mayweather ramp up. In spite of his 5ft 6in frame Pacquiao is passionate about basketball and is even an occasional player-coach for the KIA Sorento team in the Philippine Basketball Association's league. So a reporter probably should have known better than to bet Pacquiao he couldn't nail a three-pointer on a crowded court in his United States base. Manny Pacquiao shoots hoops in Los Angeles as he prepares to take on Floyd Mayweather on May 2 . Reporter Elie Seckbach (green and white tracksuit) lost a 100 push-up bet that Pac-Man wouldn't nail a three . The video journalist, Elie Seckbach, said he'd do 100 push-ups if the 36-year-old sunk a maximum from the corner of the court and was good to his word. Pacquiao's shooting form up to that point was sketchy at best, with air balls as common as the sound of swish from the net, although he does sink a backwards shot from the free throw line. On winning the bet, the pound-for-pound legend even stands over the reporter at one point to ensure his push-ups are up to the superfit boxer's standards.

"A kangaroo who may have been a little too keen for a drink and got its head stuck in a watering can has been saved by two quick-thinking men. The kangaroo was spotted in a paddock near a golf course at Coffin Bay in South Australia on Saturday morning, the Advertiser reports. Ian Berry, who had just finished a round of golf, went to check on the kangaroo as two men who had spotted it earlier returned to the paddock with a rope and tin cutters. The kangaroo was spotted with its head stuck in a watering can in a paddock near a golf course at Coffin Bay in South Australia on Saturday morning . 'They used rope first... one had rope tied around the can and the other had the roo's tail and they tried pulling but it didn't work,' Mr Berry told the newspaper. 'At this point it  was pretty tired because it had been trying to kick the can off... (the men) were able to get close enough to cut the can off.' Mr Berry managed to snap several remarkable photos of the two men, Rob Smith and Steve Dew, pulling the animal's tail and attaching ropes to the watering can to free the roo. The roo is believed to have found some water in the can and accidentally got his head stuck as he had a drink . Rob Smith and Steve Dew came to the paddock armed with some tin cutters and a long rope to help free the distressed kangaroo . After several attempts, the distressed kangaroo was freed and hopped away quickly. 'It wouldn't have survived too long if Rob and Steve hadn't gotten the can off,' Mr Berry said. He suspects the kangaroo found some water in the can and put its head in for a drink. 'He is one lucky kangaroo... he hopped off, no doubt with a sore neck, but happy to be alive.' Coffin Bay residents thanked the two men on the city's Facebook page. 'A big thank you to Rob Smith and Steve Dew who saved this large male kangaroo from certain death after being able to get close enough to cut the watering can so as to be able to pull the kangaroo's head out of the can,' they wrote.

Freiburg crept out of the drop zone with a 2-0 win over Augsburg, courtesy of strikes from Jonathan Schmid and Nils Petersen in the final 20 minutes. Christian Streich's side clinched only their fifth win of the season, enough to take them above both Hamburg and Paderborn and out of the bottom three. That was partly because Paderborn could only manage a goalless draw at home against Hoffenheim, while Matthias Lehmann's late penalty earned a 1-1 draw for Werder Bremen after Davie Selke had put Cologne in front.","Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired home a brace during win over Hannover .

"Manchester United have been heavily criticised by former Liverpool star Jan Molby, as the playmaker adds fuel to fire ahead of the crucial clash in the race for the Champions League places. The ex-Danish international is very much a favourite at his former employers and was keen to play up Liverpool's chances of pipping United to fourth. Molby gave a scathing review on Louis van Gaal's side and has described their position in the Champions League places as a 'miracle.' Jan Molby labelled Manchester United as 'clueless' and thinks it's a 'miracle' where they are in the table . He told the Daily Star: 'I've seen a lot of United's matches this season and I find it quite amazing they are in the top four. The best way of describing them is clueless. 'I look at United and see weaknesses. If we move the ball at pace and put them under pressure from the start then we will cause them a lot of problems. 'Considering the talent they have available, they just haven't performed. Louis van Gaal and Wayne Rooney won't be pleased with Molby's comments ahead of the clash . 'But having an excellent keeper and not conceding many goals has enabled them to paper over the cracks and win games narrowly. 'The fact they are fourth is a minor miracle. Their performances just haven't merited a top-four place. 'They aren't in the best four teams in the Premier League and Liverpool are in much better shape.'

"Islamic State terrorists could launch a chlorine gas attack on Britain - a weapon used to kill thousands of British troops in the First World War trenches, an expert said today. Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon believes that every British ISIS fighter will have been given chemical weapons training in the hope they will come back to launch an attack. The retired head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army believes the Tube or sporting events could be the target. Scotland Yard said that last year five Britons a week were heading to Syria and an estimated 500 of them may have returned to Britain. Fears: Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, left and right in 2007, recently retired head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army, is worried that ISIS might launch a chlorine attack in Britain . Colonel de Bretton-Gordon, who is now managing director of Avon Protection, believes that ISIS terrorists returning to the UK are 'highly likely' to use the gas, because it is easier to get hold of than weapons like guns and explosives. He has spoken out to warn the public what to do if there is an attack on UK soil and believes that it would be 'very survivable and a lot less dangerous than bombs and bullets'. He told MailOnline: 'I am convinced that IS fighters are all being given training in chemical weapons and the British ones, who are likely to be more educated, will all be targeted in the hope they may return home. 'They will have a reasonable idea on how to use chlorine and other toxic chemicals as a terror weapon. 'This could happen on a train or tube or even at a big football match. Acquiring weapons and ammunition is very difficult in the UK but you can get up to 90 tonnes of chlorine without any licence. 'The authorities must keep a close eye on those fighters returning to the UK, especially if they have a background in chemistry, and in particular anybody buying toxic chemicals'. Chlorine was used 100 years ago during the 2nd Battle of Ypres in April 1915, where the gas was vapourised into a cloud. It is classified as a 'choking agent', burning the lungs when inhaled in large quantities. But it is nowhere near as dangerous as nerve gases like sarin. Mr de Bretton-Gordon says that chlorine is being used on an 'industrial scale' in Syria and Iraq but that taking simple steps would help people survive an attack. Chlorine is readily available in Britain, used in swimming pools and decontamination in industry. 'My working with UK charity Syria Relief has focused in Syria on giving civilians the basic know-how to avoid chlorine. The same advice applies to Britain,' he said . 'Chlorine is not very toxic and the green and yellow clouds are easy to see and avoid. It is very non-persistent only lasting for a few minutes. It was used in the First World War but dropped because it did not work very well. 'It is key that ISIS don’t get the advantage of an unexpected chemical attack in the UK. If you can hold your breath for 30 seconds and run in the opposite direction you will be okay. If outside you should aim to climb or reach higher ground. 'Also urinating on a cloth and holding it to your mouth will help because urine kills chlorine. 'I train people in Syria to be aware of which way the wind is blowing because chlorine can travel quickly on the wind, but it also means you can avoid it. 'If the attack was on the Tube, chlorine is heavier than air, so it would quickly drop to the tracks. It is the panic that would create the carnage, so it is important people are prepared for it. 'Chlorine attacks are very survivable and a lot less dangerous than bombs and bullets, if you use simple procedures. ‘Fear of toxic chemicals and chemical weapons is the killer not the toxicity of the agents. ‘It is 20 years since the sarin attack on the Tokyo underground, but it took three years and $10m dollars to create 1kg of sarin and I think it is highly unlikely that ISIS or anyone else has the capability to do that in Britain'. Evidence: A gas canister lies at the site of a bomb attack on a road between Mosul, Iraq, and the Syrian border in northern Iraq, believed to have been used by ISIS . Target: Experts fear that the Tube or other packed areas may be subject to attacks by ISIS militants in the UK . Crude roadside bombs filled with toxic chlorine gas are now being used by Islamic State terrorists, it has been claimed. Iraqi officials say government forces have defused dozens of the devices in the course of their war with the fanatics and have produced video footage which backs up their claim. Mr de Bretton-Gordon said: 'Islamic State are all over these chemical weapons. The big prize is Mosul, its capital in Iraq. Lose it and they lose the country and have to retreat to Syria. 'I believe they will do anything to hold Mosul, and this will include chemical weapons use'. One bomb disposal expert said that the use of the chemical is a sign of desperation as the Iraqi Army makes advances against IS in Saddam Hussein's home town of Tikrit. Haider Taher told the BBC: 'They're resorting to this new method, putting chlorine in these home-made roadside bombs, which is toxic to those that inhale it.' He described how his team detonated a bomb in Tikrit that, unbeknown to them, contained chlorine. They immediately began feeling the effects of the chemical, experiencing 'painful choking' and blocked throats. Jennifer Cole, Senior Research Fellow at defence think-tank Royal United Services Institute, told MailOnline that although chlorine can be lethal, it does appear that it's being used to spread fear by IS. She said: 'Chlorine is easily available from a number of industrial sources and is very hazardous – causing breathing difficulties in particular and in extreme cases prolonged exposure can kill. 'Used in roadside bombs such as this, in the open air, it disperses reasonably quickly and so appears to be intended to cause panic rather than serious harm.' Terror: Chlorine was first used in the First World War and because it is heavier than air the clouds of killer gas would drop into trenches and wipe out troops . Chlorine was used by the British in the First World War, but it proved to be unreliable. In one attack in 1915 the gas blew back into British trenches after canisters of the chemical were fired from heavy guns at the Germans. In Tikrit, Iraqi soldiers and militiamen have reportedly retaken areas and key sites in the north, south and west, including a police headquarters and a hospital. Some 23,000 personnel are believed to be involved in the operation, the biggest offensive against IS mounted by the government since the jihadist group captured large parts of the country last June. The U.N. Security Council recently approved a United States-drafted resolution that condemns the use of toxic chemicals such as chlorine in Syria, while threatening militarily enforced action in the case of further violations. Chlorine, a chemical used in industry and water purification process, was first introduced as a chemical weapon at Ypres in World War I with disastrous effects because gas masks were not easily available at the time. In 1915, at Ypres, Belgium, Germany opened thousands of canisters of chlorine upwind of Allied troops, condemning many to an agonising death. Jack Dorgan, of the Northumberland Fusiliers, was hurt in a 1915 gas attack and said: 'Our eyes were streaming with water and with pain. Luckily again for me I was one of those who could still see. But we had no protection, no gas masks or anything of that kind'. British private Harry Cox said: They gassed us. And how I got out of it, I went up a tree. All the others they all went down in the shallow in the trenches of course there they all laid out all sprawled out and suffering agonies. Actually the battalion was wiped out – there was only five really fit men left'. By 1918 chemical weapons had proliferated on both sides – including phosgene, cyanide and mustard gas. Horrified by the effects, 15 countries signed the Geneva Protocol. More severely affected individuals may suffer acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and one in 100 will die. In October, Iraqi officials said Islamic State (IS) militants used chlorine gas during fighting with security forces and Shiite militiamen in September north of Baghdad. In the attacks, about 40 troops and Shiite militiamen were slightly affected by the chlorine and showed symptoms consistent with chlorine poisoning, such as difficulty in breathing and coughing,. The troops were treated in hospital and quickly recovered.","Expert fear IS terrorists will target the Tube or sporting events in Britain .

"Steven Gerrard was sensationally sent off within 38 seconds of coming on the pitch at Anfield, after stamping on Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera. The Liverpool legend was left out of the starting line-up by Brendan Rodgers but came on at the start of the second half to rally the troops. However Gerrard found himself in deep trouble after clattering through Juan Mata before stamping on Herrera following a heavy challenge. Referee Martin Atkinson had no choice but to send off the perplexed Liverpool skipper after just 38 seconds of entering the fray. Steven Gerrard is shown the red card by referee Martin Atkinson after just 38 seconds of the second half . Gerrard can't believe it after being sent off for a reckless stamp on United's Ander Herrera at Anfield . As Gerrard emerged from the tunnel, former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher told Sky Sports: ‘He had to go on. Some of the Liverpool players froze out there in the first-half. Liverpool need some football arrogance on the pitch today.’ Ahead of kick-off Carragher admitted he was not surprised by Brendan Rodgers' decision to name Steven Gerrard on the bench for Liverpool's crunch clash against Manchester United. Gerrard, who faced rivals United for the last time in a Liverpool shirt, had to make do with a place on the bench as Rodgers decided to go for a central midfield duo of Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen. Juan Mata (top) was on the receiving end of Gerrard's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch . Here is the stamp from Gerrard on Herrera after both players had competed for the ball . Gerrard clearly puts all his downwards force into Herrera's right leg after the pair collided . Gerrard flings back the captain's armband towards his team-mates having been sent off at Anfield . A evidently devastated Steven Gerrard leaves the pitch after just 38 seconds having been sent off . And Carragher felt it was the right decision. Speaking on Sky Sports ahead of the Anfield battle, the former Liverpool defender said: 'No I'm not surprised. 'He’s only played 20 minutes against Swansea recently because he’s been injured. 'Is Steven Gerrard a better player than Joe Allen? Yes. But for Brendan Rodgers we’ve got to remember than Gerrard is leaving in the summer and Allen will be here next season. So although Rodgers is aiming for the top four that certainly comes into it. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was named on the bench for his side's match against Man United . Brendan Rodgers made the right call in naming Gerrard on bench before kick-off, according to Carragher . 'Steven Gerrard can come on after an hour and really lift the crowd when the legs are tired and use any extra space.' Carragher's fellow pundits Thierry Henry and Gary Neville also agreed with Rodgers' decision. Neville said: 'It’s probably the starting line-up Manchester United expected. 'The question was more about whether Rodgers would return with the Manchester City formation with [Raheem] Sterling at the top but that would sacrifice Daniel Sturridge who brings them goals and is their best finisher, so he’s stuck.' Gerrard has scored the most goals in the history of Liverpool's matches against Manchester United . While Henry added: 'Gerrard would tell you if he’s not fit and the team is playing very well. 'Look he has the quality to come on and change the game. I wouldn’t say he should start but it would be an amazing story if he got the winner.' Rodgers insisted before the match that Gerrard understood the decision regarding his omission. ‘Steven’s got a great history in this fixture but also across his career,' explained the Liverpool boss. 'He’s still a top class player but he understands the team is playing well. I had a word with him earlier in the week and told him my plan to stick with the team and he’s been brilliant working with the players. He’s definitely ready if he’s called upon.' The 34-year-old has played 34 times against Manchester United during his prestigious career at Anfield .","Steven Gerrard was named on bench for his side's match against United .

"Steven Gerrard's sending-off against Manchester United on Sunday was the eighth red card of his career, with seven coming for Liverpool and one for England. The Liverpool captain's dismissal, which came just 38 seconds after he came on from the bench at Anfield, was part of a disappointing afternoon for The Reds that saw them lose momentum in the race for a top-four finish in the Premier League. Here are Gerrard's eight red cards... Steven Gerrard's red card against Manchester United on Sunday was the midfielder's eighth of his career . September 1999 v Everton (Premier League) A 19-year-old Gerrard came off the bench midway through the second half and saw red in the 90th minute for a waist-high challenge on Kevin Campbell as the Toffees won 1-0 at Anfield. Gerrard was sent off for the first time as a teenager against Merseyside rivals Everton back in 1999 . April 2001 v Leeds (Premier League) Gerrard pulled a goal back for the Reds in this 2-1 home defeat before getting his marching orders in the 71st minute for up-ending David Batty. In 2001, Gerrard was shown a red card for a challenge on Leeds United midfielder David Batty . September 2001 v Aston Villa (Premier League) Having scored in the 46th minute, Gerrard was shown a straight red card 18 minutes from time for an awful studs-up tackle on George Boateng as his side slipped to a 3-1 home loss. A straight red card was shown to Gerrard in 2001 for a studs-up challenge on Aston Villa's George Boateng . May 2003 v Chelsea (Premier League) Gerrard was shown a second yellow card for a late foul on Graeme Le Saux in this 2-1 loss at Chelsea which saw the Blues qualify for the Champions League at the expense of Liverpool. In 2003, Gerrard was given his marching orders for a late challenge on Chelsea midfielder Graeme Le Saux . March 2006 v Everton (Premier League) Gerrard was sent off for two yellow cards after only 18 minutes, the first for kicking the ball away and the second for a foul on Kevin Kilbane. The Reds still went on to win the Anfield clash 3-1. Gerrard received a second booking for a late challenge on Everton midfielder Kevin Kilbane in 2006 . Despite Gerrard's dismissal, Liverpool still went on to win the match against Everton 3-1 . January 2011 v Manchester United (FA Cup) Liverpool lost the tie 1-0 at Old Trafford, with Gerrard seeing red after 32 minutes for diving into a tackle on Michael Carrick. Gerrard's lunge on fellow England midfielder Michael Carrick earned Gerrard a straight red at Old Trafford . September 2012 v Ukraine (World Cup qualifying) Gerrard picked up his only red card for England in a 1-1 draw with Ukraine at Wembley, receiving a second booking in the 88th minute for sliding in on Denys Garmash . Gerrard was sent off once for England during a World Cup qualifying match against Ukraine at Wembley . March 2015 v Manchester United (Premier League) Gerrard was sent off 43 seconds after his introduction as a half-time substitute at Anfield for a stamp on Ander Herrera, with United going on to win the match 2-1.

"Not the sweetest strike you’ll see. Not the sweetest strike of the game, in fact. But Loic Remy’s tentative prod which squirmed past goalkeeper Allan McGregor and trickled into the net was like a shot of nectar for Chelsea. Jose Mourinho may one day reflect on this late contribution from a striker he has rarely used as the moment when self-doubt was allayed and the Barclays Premier League title was secured. Having been 2-0 up inside nine minutes at Hull, courtesy of Eden Hazard and Diego Costa, Chelsea had to prove they could banish this habit of throwing away the lead. But their not-so-reliable-anymore defence wobbled and creaked. Loic Remy strokes home the winner at the KC Stadium to give Chelsea a 3-2 victory against Hull CIty on Sunday afternoon .

Ahmed Elmohamady and Adel Hernandez levelled before half-time and Thibaut Courtois performed a breathtaking triple-save from three Hull players, mid-way through the second half, which Steve Bruce thought was the key moment. It was still 2-2 as the clock ticked towards 77 minutes and Cesc Fabregas rolled a pass to Willian on the Chelsea right. Willian found Remy and the substitute, only on for a few seconds after replacing the injured Costa, jabbed it towards McGregor, who was clearly expecting something else entirely because he was wrong-footed, unable to recover, and the ball slithered over the line. A thrilling game was settled by a scruffy goal and Chelsea’s cushion at the top of the table was plumped. ‘I’m pretty confident,’ said Mourinho. ‘We got what we deserved. We have a six-point lead, one match in hand and eight matches to go for our opponents. They can make 24 points. I believe in my players.’ Jose Mourinho looks disgruntled on the bench after watching his Premier Leaders throw away a two-goal lead in the first half .

The Egyptian wing-back runs back to the halfway line and is congratulated by his team-mates after his strike . Eden Hazard put Chelsea in front with a fine strike from outside the box within two minutes on Sunday afternoon . Hazard jumps for joy after his fine strike put Jose Mourinho's side into the lead in Hull . They had made such a brilliant start at the KC Stadium, where Hazard lashed in a beauty after only 78 seconds. Collecting a lay-off from Costa, he drove diagonally across the pitch before firing the ball back across goal with his left foot. From outside the penalty area, it sailed beyond McGregor’s dive. Even early on Chelsea’s frailties were in evidence. Hernandez was through and ought to have equalised. Played onside by Ivanovic, he collected a flick from Dame N’Doye, but could not beat Courtois who blocked with his body. When Costa made it 2-0, the contest seemed to be settled. Again, it was a splendid goal, lashed past poor McGregor from an angle. For the £32million Chelsea striker, it was his 20th of the season. The goal-rate has slowed since the turn of the year, and his temper simmered, as ever. There was a confrontation with Alex Bruce, when Costa accused the Hull manager’s son of swiping his legs away, and a flashpoint when Jake Livermore claimed to have been elbowed in his face. Referee Michael Oliver did not see the ‘elbow’, as he had not seen Costa’s stamp on Emre Can during the Capital One Cup semi-final. The pair have history going back to Costa’s first game in English football when the same referee booked him for a dive at Burnley. Hull reacted after a tactical switch from manager Bruce, who started with three at the back and moved to a 4-2-3-1 formation after going two down. The change did not stop left back Andy Robertson charging forward to create the first with a low cross, bundled in by Elmohamady. Within two minutes, the home team were level and panic descended on Chelsea at the back as they struggled to cope with a mixture of high balls and intense pressing. Courtois made a poor decision to take a touch on a back-pass from Ivanovic. The goalkeeper twisted past Gaston Ramirez, who was closing in, but his touch was too heavy, the ball rolled to Hernandez for a simple finish. Diego Costa doubled the visitor's advantage with a fine curing effort past Hull goalkeeper Allan McGregor into the corner .

Eventual goalscorer Loic Remy came on for Costa in the second half as Chelsea pressed for a winner . After the break, Chelsea were brighter. Mourinho tweaked his midfield shape, sent on Oscar and controlled possession but Hull defended well and limited the visitors to long-range efforts. Courtois then produced his incredible triple save to thwart Elmohamday, Livermore and Ramirez, each flying stop better than the one before, and perhaps it energised his team to search for the winner. Even when Costa headed down the tunnel with the medics, Chelsea kept probing. Remy restored the lead and this time they did not surrender it. It was Remy’s sixth goal since an £8.5million move from Queens Park Rangers. ‘He probably deserves more than I gave him,’ said Mourinho. ‘There are not many times when a coach can feel he owes something to a player but with Remy that’s the case. Every time he plays he gives us a lot and he has never complained.’ Mourinho puffs his cheeks during a disappointing first period for the Premier League leaders on Sunday .

"Adam Lallana looks sets to become the latest player to withdraw from the England squad after suffering a groin injury and is likely to miss the international fixtures against Lithuania and Italy. The Liverpool star was replaced at half-time by Steve Gerrard - who then returned to the changing rooms just 38 seconds later - and his injury-hit season looks to continue with his latest problem. Lallana is seen as a key player for England and his loss will be a major blow for Roy Hodgson ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania. Adam Lallana (right) has withdrawn from the England squad after suffering a groin injury for Liverpool . Lallana was taken off at half-time and replaced by Steven Gerrard who was sent off after 38 seconds . Fraser Forster and Luke Shaw had already withdrawn from the squad with Rob Green, Jack Butland and Danny Rose taking their place. It's unknown who Hodgson will call-up as a replacement or he may choose not if he feels his squad his strong enough to deal with Lallana's absence. England will be looking to keep up their 100 percent record in their European Championships Qualifying group when they welcome Lithuania to Wembley on Friday, with Harry Kane in line to earn his first cap for his country. The following game should be a more testing against Italy, who got the better of England at the World Cup, and Hodgson may use that game to blood some of his newer players. England manager Roy Hodgson could bring in a replacement or may choose to stick with his current squad .","Adam Lallana set to withdraw from the England squad with a groin injury .

"Steven Gerrard issued a public apology to his Liverpool teammates and the club’s supporters on Sunday after he was sent off in the defeat to Manchester United at Anfield just 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute. Gerrard, who was facing United for the last time before leaving Liverpool for LA Galaxy, was shown a straight red card by referee Martin Atkinson when he reacted to a challenge from Ander Herrera with a senseless stamp on the Spaniard. United went on to win 2-1 thanks to two goals from Juan Mata as they moved five points clear of their arch-rivals in the race for a Champions League place. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard spoke to Sky Sports after the match to apologise to team-mates and fans . ‘I’ve let down my teammates and the supporters,’ admitted Gerrard, who now faces a three-match ban. ‘I take full responsibility. I need to accept it, the decision was right. ‘I've been in the game long enough when you do something like that. I don’t know what caused it, probably just a reaction to the initial tackle. ‘I shouldn’t say more about it really, I’ve just come out here to apologise to the dressing-room and supporters.’ Sportsmail expert Jamie Carragher claimed that Gerrard may have been wound up by having to sit on the bench for such a big game before replacing Adam Lallana. Juan Mata (top) was on the receiving end of Gerrard's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers refused to castigate the veteran midfielder, and agreed that Liverpool’s insipid first-half performance might have contributed to Gerrard’s red mist. ‘I won’t criticise him because he’s been brilliant in my time here,’ said Rodgers. ‘Sometimes these things happen. ‘My thinking was always to go with the starting team. I had that clear in my mind and spoke with Steven earlier in the week about that. ‘Of course he’s a big-game player, a big impact player. He wanted to come in and it was just unfortunate that he got sent off. Here is the stamp from Gerrard on Herrera after both players had competed for the ball . ‘He was probably a little frustrated watching us in the first half, we didn’t make a tackle. ‘He’s a highly competitive player and he made a great challenge when he first came on – it was probably our first challenge of the game, with all due respect. He wanted to help the team so much. ‘At least he was man enough to come out and make that apology. ‘With Steven it was purely wanting to make the impact. Listen, he’s made his apologies for it. Of course in a big game you suffer when you play with 10 men against 11. ‘It happened, and great respect to the players that were on there that we kept fighting. Games like that, especially when it goes to 2-0 against 10 men, you can get overrun and end up losing more goals.’ Steven Gerrard is shown the red card by referee Martin Atkinson after just 40 seconds of the second-half . Martin Skrtel could also come under scrutiny from the FA if the referee confirms that he did not see an incident at the end in which the Liverpool defender appeared to stamp on United goalkeeper David de Gea. The two players became an embroiled in an ugly confrontation that continued after the final whistle, but Rodgers insisted there was no malice on Skrtel’s part. He added: ‘The ball has been played through and it looks like it when it is slowed down, he has caught him with intent. I didn’t see it like that. ‘He is trying to get the ball. You see his foot up, that is a symbol when a player is just trying to get his toe on the ball because if he does that and the keeper brings him down, it is probably a penalty.’ Liverpool’s first defeat in 14 Premier League games since losing 3-0 at Old Trafford in December puts a big dent in their hopes of beating United to a top-four place. Martin Skrtel (centre) was lucky not to be cautioned for this stamp on United keeper David de Gea . ‘It’s a big challenge,’ admitted Rodgers. ‘But when I looked at the 10 games that were remaining, it was always going to be difficult to win all 10. We built in a loss and some draws. ‘We hoped to win this game against a rival but it is still very much possible. We need to recover and use this as a springboard as we did when we last played them.’ Louis van Gaal described the victory as ‘one of the most important moments in my career’ but refused to write off Liverpool’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League. ‘We beat Liverpool again,’ said Van Gaal. ‘They were in fantastic shape and we beat them with the old weapons – with the pressure on the ball in the first half. ‘Now we are five points ahead of Liverpool, and six ahead of Tottenham and Southampton. To win in this moment is very important – one of the most important moments in my career. ‘But there are still eight matches to go. That’s 24 points. Liverpool can still be champions. When you are a top manager, our player or club – and Liverpool are – you have to deal with defeats. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has a difficult afternoon with Steven Gerrard being sent off . ‘We have also dealt with defeats. We lost at home to Arsenal and then we had to play against Tottenham and Liverpool, and you have to manage that. Liverpool can do that also because they have a great manager, great club, great fans.’ United dominated the first half and Mata fired them into a two-goal lead inside an hour. Daniel Sturridge pulled a goal back for the 10 men as Liverpool rallied after Gerrard’s sending-off, but Van Gaal’s side could even afford to see Wayne Rooney have a stoppage-time penalty saved by Simon Mignolet. ‘We played them off the pitch in the first half and scored a fantastic goal and gave nothing away,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It was the best first 45 minutes (of his time in charge of United) because in the second half we were not so good and that’s a little bit amazing because we played 11 against 10. It should be easier than the first half but it was not. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal (right) congratulates Marouane Fellaini (left) after the 2-1 victory . ‘I came in the dressing-room and gave all my compliments because I was so happy, but then in the second half everything changed because of the red card. Then we weren’t laying like a team anymore. We were running with the ball and losing it unnecessarily. When we didn’t have the ball we didn’t press the opponent. That was different in the first half. ‘Nevertheless, we didn’t give many chances away. David de Gea has saved us a lot of times this season but I couldn’t remember one save in this match.’ Manchester United forward Juan Mata salutes the travelling fans having scored a fine brace at Anfield . Mata has struggled to hold down a first-team place in recent weeks but produced arguably his best performance for United, crowned by a spectacular volley for the second goal. ‘Yes, I think it’s my best game in a United shirt,’ said the Spaniard. ‘It’s a massive game, probably the biggest in English football, so to score two goals is great for me. ‘The second goal has to be up there with my best. After Steven Gerrard was sent off we needed a second goal because they pushed us to the end. ‘It was important for me. The last few months I’ve not had the best moment. It is the manager who decides but I’m happy today.’ Manchester United players celebrate their vital 2-1 win at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday .","Liverpool's Steven Gerrard sent off after just 38 seconds on the pitch .

"Eventually he snapped, trudging off the field after 75 minutes and wondering when his next game in a Chelsea shirt will be. This has been brewing for a while, simmering in the background at a time when Jose Mourinho needs his first choice striker out on the pitch in the final, decisive nine games of the season. Diego Costa, this hot-head in a Chelsea shirt, has tweaked his hamstring again and Mourinho will expect his prized forward to barter his way out of Spain's two games during the international break. This time the complaint felt legit, particularly as the score was delicately balanced at 2-2 at the KC Stadium when Costa signalled for help. Chelsea striker Diego Costa was forced off with a hamstring injury during the Blues' 3-2 win over Hull City . Costa (left) talks to manager Jose Mourinho (right) before he is substituted at KC Stadium on Sunday . His replacement, Loic Remy, answered the SOS by scoring Chelsea's winner with his first touch. It was a shame to see Costa disappear down the tunnel, particularly after he had joined Harry Kane at the top of the scoring charts in the Barclays Premier League with a rasping effort to put Chelsea 2-0 ahead. Instead Spain, who have a Euro 2016 qualifier against Ukraine to play on Friday, and a friendly with Holland the following Tuesday will dictate when the forward plays again. Mourinho has an uneasy relationship with Spain coach Vicente del Bosque and with that in mind, his adopted country are likely to demand that he is assessed by their own doctors. 'When the team needs a goal with 15 minutes to go and the striker has a lot of experience with hamstring injuries and says it's over, it's over. 'We know his hamstring is not strong. Now he has 15 days without football, but we never cry about our injured players. 'He has had this problem since he tried to play in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid. He has this fragility.' There has been talk of an operation at the end of the season, some serious discussions between Chelsea's medical staff about a permanent solution. 'Dr Biosca (Chelsea's medical director) is against knives, against surgery,' admitted Mourinho. 'He's all in favour of conservative work and collective work between the medical department and fitness staff. This is the direction, we believe.' Costa had scored Chelsea's second goal as they stormed into a 2-0 lead within 10 minutes on Sunday . It has been another eventful game for Costa, full of sly digs and elbows again as he responded to the prods in the back from Steve Bruce's players. Everyone tries to work him over these days. There was a flashpoint, of course there was, because that is the way Costa plays the game. He snarls, he snaps, he scores. Here at the KC Stadium, after Hull had pegged back Chelsea amid raucous scenes in the stands, he threw half an elbow in the direction of Jake Livermore. It was not seen by Michael Oliver, the referee who also failed to spot Costa raking his studs down Emre Can during the volatile Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge. On this occasion he is expected to escape. Hull were able to draw level before half-time and when Costa was subbed off the scores were locked at 2-2 . The real punishment was for Hull, beaten by the boot of Remy just a couple of minutes after he had replaced Costa as a substitute. He is a useful back-up, full of energy and enthusiasm despite his lack of minutes. Mourinho had every reason to be grateful to him. 'Every time he plays here is there and he probably deserves more than I give him,' admitted a mightily relieved Mourinho. 'There are not many times when a coach owes something to a player, but with Remy that's the case. Every time he plays he gives us a lot.' After scoring the winner here for Chelsea, he has earned a break. Loic Remy scored the winning goal for Chelsea and his contributions could prove vital in Costa's absence .","Diego Costa scored Chelsea's second goal against Hull City on Sunday .

"Olivier Giroud strutted out of St James' Park and was the last player to board Arsenal's team bus, having been first to pretty much everything else for his team during a hard-earned win on Tyneside. It brought two more goals for the Frenchman against Newcastle. That's 17 in 26 games this season and 10 in his last 12, one of the best strike rates in Europe. While Harry Kane is cherished by supporters down the road at Tottenham, some Arsenal fans have yet to embrace Giroud fully. The statistics speak for themselves, however. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud has been dubbed 'world class' by his manager Arsene Wenger . The Frenchman scored two goals for Arsenal as the Gunners ran out 2-1 winners against Newcastle United . Wenger believes that Giroud has developed significantly since joining Arsenal back in 2012 . Olivier Giroud now has eight goals in six games against Newcastle, including scoring with all five headers on target against them in the Premier League. And even though Giroud is 29 in September, Arsene Wenger believes the best is yet to come from a 6ft 4in striker who developed late and was still playing lower league football in France as recently as 2010. Asked if Giroud is world-class, Wenger said: 'I think so and he is scoring the goals to prove it. But I believe there is still room for improvement. 'Technically, he is a much better player than he was. His touch, his link play, his finishing, they have all improved. If you saw footage of him when he first arrived and now, it is obvious he is a better player. 'He is a fighter as well and a player with good mental strength. At 22 or 23 he played in Division Three in France, and now he is at Arsenal.' Giroud is refusing to write off Arsenal's chances of a late push for the Premier League title this season . Giroud's goals gave Arsenal a sixth straight league win and kept them on the fringe of the title race. But you wonder how much closer they would be had he not spent three months on the sidelines after breaking his leg at Everton in August. Wenger's side won only three of nine league games in his absence. While retaining the FA Cup would appear to represent their best chance of a trophy this season, the former Montpellier man has not given up the title chase just yet. 'We need to win every game and that's what we want to do — step by step,' said Giroud. 'You never know if City or Chelsea will miss one of these steps. We've got to be here with great belief and faith.' Giroud's brace against Newcastle has brought his tally for the season up to 17 goals in 26 games . Arsenal still had to hold on in the face of a fierce second-half fightback from Newcastle that revived memories of a famous 4-4 draw in 2011. It was not enough to prevent a third defeat in a row for the home side, placing even more importance on the forthcoming Tyne-Wear derby with Sunderland. Having admitted in the build-up to this game that he expects a clear-out of players in the summer, caretaker boss John Carver is already looking forward to some of the big signings coming through the door. 'Without naming any names, I've seen some of the players they are talking about and I'm quite excited about them,' said Carver. 'It's major work that has to be done, we know that. I know the type of players the fans like and they're the ones on the list, absolutely.' Newcastle head coach John Carver insists that the club will strengthen their squad with top players .","Olivier Giroud scored twice in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Newcastle .

"Luis Suarez paid back another huge chunk of his transfer fee at the Nou Camp with the goal that won the Clasico — and quite possibly the Spanish league title for Barcelona. Running on to a long pass forward by Dani Alves, Suarez took the ball brilliantly in his stride and, with both Sergio Ramos and Pepe closing in, he found Iker Casillas’ far corner with well-struck shot. 'It's the most important goal I have scored for the club so far,' he said. 'And of course it means even more because of who it was against.

The win puts Barcelona four points clear with only 10 games left and after last year’s disappointment with Liverpool, Suarez could now be in line for a league winners’ medal in Spain. But he added: 'There is still a long way to go and we know it will be difficult. We have to make the most of the advantage we now have. But we know we can't relax especially against a rival as strong as Madrid.' Jubilant Barca coach Luis Enrique praised Suarez saying: ‘He finished the goal like very few players can. He is a striker who can score goals like this, but he is also technical enough to play the football we play and physical enough to compliment the other players in the side. We signed him for nights like this.’ The game looked to be slipping away from Barcelona after they were made to suffer in the first half. Luis Enrique admitted: ‘The goal calmed us down a lot in the second half. It’s a big a win against our eternal rival but we have a lot of difficult games to go before the league is won. 'The win means more because this is a very good Madrid side.’ Until Suarez struck the night had belonged to Cristiano Ronaldo, who responded to a week of global adulation for Lionel Messi by equalising in the first half to silence the Camp Nou after Jeremy Mathieu opened the scoring. Ronaldo’s every touch was booed — even from his first run down the left inside 60 seconds. It only took Messi 10 minutes to mark up his first nutmeg, sending the ball through Toni Kroos’ legs, but it was Real with a pumped-up Ronaldo who made much of the early running and he hit the bar from Karim Benzema’s cross. At the other end, Pepe and Suarez clashed and Barcelona were awarded a free-kick. Messi took it and, powering in ahead of Ramos, Mathieu headed past Casillas for his first Barcelona goal. The hosts should have doubled their lead but Neymar made a mess of a Suarez assist and they paid the price as Real Madrid scored with their next attack. Luka Modric played the ball to Karim Benzema, the Frenchman’s flick found Ronaldo in space and he swept the ball past Claudio Bravo. Suarez was booked for leaving his foot in on Pepe, who had already gone in late on the Uruguayan.

Five minutes into the second half Benzema almost put Real ahead after a fine move but was somehow denied by Bravo. Suarez had been quiet since his booking in the first half but, when Alves played him through with a brilliant first touch, he controlled the ball inside the area and rifled into the far corner.

Neymar should have scored it twice but both times shot wide, with Suarez better placed on the first occasion. Suarez could also have scored again wriggling away from Dani Carvajal only to pull his shot wide. Real Madrid kept going forward and as with the very first chance of the second period Benzema was denied by Bravo. Jordi Alba then steamed through on to a Messi pass only for the ball to be cleared for a corner. From the kick Suarez sent a shot high over Casillas’ bar. It now seemed as if Barcelona were chasing the late goal and the Spain keeper again saved from Messi.

But the game was more 'crash bang wallop' than containing any of the bad blood of previous meetings. Suarez thrives in games this frenetic and in that sense it was no surprise his contribution was decisive. He may even have decided the title race. Real Madrid coach Ancelotti said: ‘The league is more difficult now. We have to keep going and play as we did in the first half for 90 minutes. I don’t think we made any mistakes when you have Suarez against you then he can do that. He finds the space and when the right pass comes he can finish.

"It’s the hope that kills you. Just ask Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey. There was a period at Loftus Road when you envisaged nothing other than victory for the relegation-threatened home side. Instead, they got nothing, just a 10th defeat in 11 matches. Without a dramatic turnaround in fortunes QPR are heading back to the Championship.

He said: ‘We’re not in need of a miracle, but we need a miraculous run of form and I think we are capable of doing that. ‘We deserved more but we should have maximised that performance with at least a point or three. The players are disappointed because the performance was very good. We are showing everyone there’s plenty of fight in us. There have been teams in slightly worse situations who have survived.’ Much will depend on QPR’s next two fixtures: they face West Brom on Saturday week before heading to Aston Villa three days later. The pressure is mounting and Ramsey knows it. ‘What do we need from the games against West Brom and Aston Villa? Six points. There’s no point in saying we need a point, we need wins.’ Opposing managers Roberto Martinez of Everton (left) and Chris Ramsey of QPR (right) have a quick chat before kick-off on Sunday . The Everton players congratulate Coleman (right) after his opener at Loftus Road put Everton 1-0 up at half-time . Ramsey’s mood was in stark contrast to Roberto Martinez, who described this victory as his most satisfying since taking over in the summer of 2013. It has been a rough week for the Everton boss. The 5-2 Europa League hammering against Dynamo Kiev on Thursday added to the criticism levelled at him and graffiti on the walls of Goodison Park calling for the Spaniard to be sacked did not help his mood. This win did, though. He said: ‘This wasn’t a day to be technical, this was a day to be strong as a group of players. ‘The graffiti? We are a very passionate club. When you don’t get the results you want, you will get unrest. As a manager I accept that but I focus on what I need to do to get a winning team. I always respect the views from the outside.’ The win, which puts Everton on the brink of safety, did come at a cost, however. Forward’s Arouna Kone and Romelu Lukaku will both be assessed this morning after sustaining respective knee and hamstring injuries. After a bright opening from the hosts, Everton took an 18th-minute lead against the run of play. It was a cracker, too, Seamus Coleman stroking a right-footed angled shot from 16 yards past Robert Green. The goal encapsulated QPR’s season.

"Wayne Rooney and his Manchester United team-mates were celebrating on Sunday night after they beat Liverpool to move five points clear of their rivals in the race for Champions League football. Juan Mata scored both goals, and captain Rooney took to Twitter to congratulate his team-mate on his 'great goals'.

'Very happy tonight,' Rooney said on Twitter. 'Fans were amazing. @juanmata8 great goals. Should of [sic] let him take penalty. And the United fan in the kop. Brilliant.' The 29-year-old's comment about a United fan in the Kop refers to pictures appearing to show a rogue away supporter spotted holding a Manchester United scarf aloft among Liverpool's most staunch fans. An image appearing to show the man sticking his tongue out during the home fans' rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' circulated widely on Twitter. However, it later emerged that Rooney, like many others, was actually the victim of a Photoshop hoax. A Manchester United fan photoshopped into the Kop at Anfield; Rooney even tweeted about him after the game . Mata scored twice, a goal in each half of the match, to ensure Manchester United left Anfield with three points . Rooney missed a penalty, and admitted he should have let Mata take it to secure his hat-trick . During the game, Rooney's decision to step up and take the penalty himself proved to be the wrong one as he saw his effort saved by Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet. Mata had already grabbed a brace and a third goal would have completed a magical afternoon for the Spaniard, whose goals eventually proved enough to secure the win. After a goal in each half for the away side, Liverpool halved the deficit when Daniel Sturridge pegged a goal back. United managed to hold on for the win though, leaving Rooney and his colleagues celebrating their position three points closer to next season's Champions League.","Manchester United beat Liverpool 2-1 to move five points clear in 4th place .

"Broad-shouldered and proud, he beams out from a crowd of more somber faces, a smile on his face and a number 55 emblazoned on his chest - and a powerful head of hair. Marion Knight, known as Suge even then, is just 17 in this typical high school photo dated 1982, showing a junior year football star posing alongside the Varsity team at Lynwood High School in Los Angeles. While his compatriots wear glum expressions, he smiles from behind a thick head of hair, showing no hint of the power, money and violence that was to become the hallmark of his later life. Scroll down for video of the alleged hit-and-run . Back in high school: Marion 'Suge' Knight, center, smiles as a 17-year-old football star in the Varsity team at Lynwood High School in Los Angeles . Jersey to jumpsuit: Knight is pictured above on Friday at a Los Angeles court building, where he stands accused of murdering a man he ran down in his pickup truck . 32 years later, Knight, now bald-headed, stands accused of murdering a man in a hit-and-run in his pickup truck, which was caught on video tape. Proud: Knight smiles in the football photo, while many teammates did not. He allegedly went on to a life of intimidation and violence . He claims it is self-defense. But as he took to the stand, prosecutors reeled off a history of alleged violence and intimidating spanning decades, through which he is accused of reeling in hundreds of thousands of dollars. It convinced the judge to set the rap mogul's bail at a staggering $25million - the announcement of which led Knight to collapse in the middle of the court-room. Knight stands accused of intentionally running down two men with a pickup truck at a Los Angeles area burger stand January 29 following an argument on the set of a commercial for the film Straight Outta Compton. Terry Carter, 55, was killed after being struck by a Ford F-150, while Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, survived his injuries. The 49-year-old co-founder of Death Row Records has pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen set bail for Knight at a whopping $25million after Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes noted that Knight was on bail in a robbery case at the time of the hit-and-run crash. Knight's attorney argued that his bail should be set at $2million, telling the judge that had his name not been Suge Knight, prosecutors 'wouldn't have filed the case.' Medical emergency: Knight collapsed in court Friday shortly after a judge set his bail at $25million after a lengthy list of allegations against him was filed by prosecutors . In seeking the multi-million-dollar bail, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office filed an extensive motion of 295 pages of legal papers and supporting material portraying Knight as a career criminal and repeated violator of probation and parole dating back to 1987. The documents also alleged that Knight is part of an ‘ongoing extortion scheme’ in which new rappers arriving in Los Angeles and Las Vegas are ‘required to pay a “tax""’ to Knight. Knight has pleaded innocent and his lawyers have denied that he intentionally tried to kill Carter and Sloan. Matthew Fletcher also says Knight is blind in his left eye and may not have seen clearly during the incident. Knight has previous convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and could face 25 years to life in prison under California's so-called three-strikes law if he is convicted at trial. 'Victims': Terry carter (left) and Cle 'Bone' Sloan (right) and Terry Carter (right) were the victims of the alleged hit-and-run.

"She is the Queen of Soul and they are bigger hitters in the world of politics. But despite being an unlikely trio, both Eric Holder and the Reverend Al Sharpton got together to help celebrate the 73rd birthday of Aretha Franklin on Sunday night. The outgoing attorney general and the civil rights activist joined guests from the world of music for the annual party at New York's Ritz Carlton hotel. Scroll down for video . Aretha Franklin is joined by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and the Rev Al Sharpton at her 73rd birthday party in New York City . Both Mr Holder and the Rev Sharpton are close friends of the singer. Mr Holder was with his wife Sharon Malone, while Rev Sharpton was accompanied by date Aisha McShaw . The singer, who doesn't actually turn 73 until Wednesday, has become known for holding star-studded parties to mark her birthday. At last night's celebration, Miss Franklin, who wore a sparkling silver dress blew out the candles on her cake and was even treated to a chorus of 'Happy Birthday' sang by Labelle singer Sarah Dash. Miss Franklin has been a long time friend of both Mr Holder and Reverend Sharpton. Earlier this year, she sang at a ceremony to announce Mr Holder would be stepping down from his position of Attorney General. The singer wore a silver sparkling dress with a coat as she walked the red carpet on the way to her party . She sang 'America The Beautiful' as an homage to Mr Holder, who was visibly moved by the gesture. It was reported that as she approached the podium to sing, President Barack Obama rushed to her side and handed her a stepping stool with the words, 'Hold on, Queen.' It is thought that she has become good friends with Mr Holder and his wife Sharon. Aretha Franklin blows out the candles on her birthday cake with the help of Mr Holder news correspondent Tamron Hall and music executive Clive Davis . Meanwhile Miss Franklin was last seen partying with the Rev Sharpton at his 60th birthday party last October, where she described him as a 'man among men'. At one point during the party, New York mayor Bill de Blasio was addressing the Reverend. But he was soon cut off by Mr Sharpton as Miss Franklin entered the room, with him saying: 'I don’t usually interrupt the mayor, but the Queen is in the room.'","The singer held her 73rd birthday party at New York's Ritz Carlton hotel .

"Host commentator . That's it from Sportsmail's live El Clasico Q&A. Thanks for following and thank you for some brilliant questions. Until next time! Pete Jenson: A lot depends on who makes a move and on how much they are willing to pay. If a club bid £90million for Bale or £65m for Ronaldo (bearing in mind he is 30), I think Real Madrid would consider it. Ronaldo because it would make economic sense and Bale because it would not be unpopular with Real supporters. They definitely won’t sell both! And quite possible both will stay but it will be an interesting summer, especially if they win nothing and supporters are demanding an overhaul of the squad. Pete Jenson: The better players were in playing the Clasico and yet the best goal of the six that were scored came at Anfield from Juan Mata. I enjoyed both games. There were away fans in the Liverpool vs Manchester United game – that is something that is always missing from a Clasico. Pete Jenson: Fair assessment, yes. Ronaldo was as motivated as I’ve seen him recently. Perhaps a week of talk about Messi being the greatest ever had contributed to that. He also helped set the tone of the first half with the at run at Alves as soon as he got the ball. He took his goal well and was one of those Madrid players who didn’t deserve to be on the losing side. Messi had a strange night. He seemed to be staying out on Marcelo’s wing because that is where there is usually plenty of space. But Madrid pressed so well he didn’t see a great deal of the ball. He certainly didn’t run the game as he did against Manchester City. But I agree once Modric and Kroos had faded in the second half he began to impose himself. Pete Jenson: It was the 42nd Clasico he’d played some part in – no Barcelona player has played in more. What he always contributed was calm. By Spanish football standards Barça vs Madrid games are usually very frenetic and yet he always seemed to have an extra second of time and a extra yard of space. He’ll come back to this fixture as Barcelona manager one day, you can count on it. Pete Jenson: The most shameful thing about it is that we have seen incidents in recent years of players collapsing on the pitch and sometimes even dying. So to feign serious injury is pretty unforgivable. I don’t mind the roll-over-ten-times merchants so much because it has a certain comic value, but the hand over the face when actually you’ve just been hit in the shoulder is very tiresome. Pete Jenson: He was poor in the first half and it was his miss just before Ronaldo equalised that made the game such a contest. He improved in the second half but I think sometimes the more frenetic and physical the game the more he tends to just get bumped around the pitch. You have to give him some credit for that double-breasted red leather blazer he was wearing after the game though. I don’t think he’s very happy for several reasons. Firstly he is not really sure why scoring the winning goals in the Copa del Rey final and the Champions League final last season does not seem to have earned him any respect from the club’s supporters – he gets whistled in at the Bernabeu if he puts one pass out of place and so-called ‘fans’ have tried to kick out at his car when he drives away from the training ground (it happened again in the early hours of this morning). He is also not too sure why when he was such a success as an out-and-out forward last season he is being asked to do a more defensive job this year. CLICK HERE to read the full story as angry Madrid fan attacks Bale's car . Pete Jenson: He wants to come back to England, no doubt about it. Arsenal would give him all the job security he has missed out on at first Chelsea and now Madrid. Paul Clement would I’m sure go with him back to his home city and Arsenal – who seem terrified that if they move Wenger on they will stop qualifying for the Champions League – would have a coach who has won the competition three times. It all sounds perfect, I don’t know why the wheels have not already been set in motion! Pete Jenson: In one sense he doesn’t have to adapt that much because this Barca does not play like the old Pep Guardiola, Barca. We saw that last night with their goals coming from a long ball and a set play. He has also come through the Ajax school, and Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool don’t exactly play like Harry Basset’s Wimbledon so a fast passing game is not exactly alien to him. It’s more about striking that fine balance between being selfish when the goal is gaping, and not ignoring his pal Messi when he is in a better position than him. Pete Jenson: Immense. Pique has developed a reputation over the last couple of years for being more focussed on his poker hand or his online games business than his football but he has blown away those theories this season. The greatest compliment paid to him last night was that he played like Carles Puyol. He will always be very different from his old central defensive partner but in terms of concentration and throwing himself in front of the ball when he had too it was a real leader’s performance. Pete Jenson: No one stays in the job very long. They had 25 managers in the 25 years that Sir Alex Ferguson was at Old Trafford and old habits die hard. It’s incredible to think that Ancelotti hasn’t been immortalised by adoring supporters after winning ‘La Decima’ but he hasn’t and unless they win the league or the Champions League this season there will be a change. Zidane will almost definitely manage Real Madrid one day. It could happen this summer but that will be down to him deciding if he is ready as much as anyone else putting him in charge. Pete Jenson: Bale is at his best when he is given free reign going forward. Last night in the first half he was asked to play wide right in a four-man midfield as opposed to up-top in the three of a 4-3-3. He put a decent shift in but if he’s working back he can’t also be on Jordi Alba’s shoulder waiting to pull away. This is why I still think from a purely football perspective he could still be tempted by a move to a club where he would be the star striker with fewer defensive responsibilities. He also faded last night because the team did – Modric and Kroos both ran out of juice in the second half and the team suffered. Pete Jenson: It’s been a long time since I can remember seeing him dive. I think the Premier League cured him of that. And he is also alongside Messi now, and Messi very rarely dives. But he does lay it on a bit thick sometimes when he goes down I agree. Look at it from his perspective though, he is up against Ramos and Pepe, both are clattering him at every opportunity for 90 minutes; and Pepe enjoys the dramatics too. So if a little exaggeration gets him one extra favourable decision from the referee then he sees it as fair game. Pete Jenson: It was tough for him at first because he could no longer be as single-minded as he was at Liverpool. In the Premier League he knew that when the ball came to him his responsibility was to just to take the quickest route to goal. At Barcelona he’s got Neymar on one side, Messi on the other and he tried too hard at first to be unselfish. But Barcelona need him to be selfish sometimes and last night when Alves played the ball forward there was only one thing on his mind. I’m not sure he’ll score as many goals as he did at Liverpool in one season – but he will score more important ones.

"Public transport was free in Paris today and half of the city's cars were forced off the road in a bid to fight pollution. In a radical move which will be studied in other European capitals like London, French Socialists said everything had to be done to make air cleaner. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, said: 'I am delighted the state has agreed to put in place a partial driving ban on Monday, which I have been requesting for several days.' Scroll down for video . Public transport was free in Paris today and half of the city's cars were forced off the road in a bid to fight pollution . Only vehicles with number plates ending in an odd number were allowed, with exemptions for taxis, electric cars and ambulances. Authorities were planning to ban cars with even numbers on Tuesday, but the scheme was halted following improving forecasts. Foreign visitors to Paris, including thousands of Britons on holiday, were also permitted to use their cars. But police patrols were seen booking locals who flouted the ban, forcing them to return home. Meanwhile, Metro trains and buses were full to overflowing as thousands abandoned their vehicles. 'There are horrific crushes on the trains,' said Jean Babin, a 43-year-old commuter from the suburb of Juvisy, who usually travels to the city in his Renault. 'Free transport is a great idea in principle but it can potentially cause a number of problems of its own, and you do wonder who is going to pay for it all'.

"Mo'ne Davis reached out on Monday to a college president to ask him to reinstate a sophomore baseball player who called her a sexual slur. The 13-year-old and her coach emailed Bloomsburg University President David L. Soltz to ask that first baseman Joey Casselberry be allowed to play for the Huskies again. Casselberry had posted on Twitter: 'Disney is making a movie about Mo'ne Davis? WHAT A JOKE. That s*** got rocked by Nevada.' Director of the college's sports information, Tom McGuire, told Daily Mail Online in a statement: 'Mo’ne Davis has reached out to Bloomsburg University asking that Joey Casselberry’s dismissal from the team be reconsidered.

Mr McGuire added: 'Bloomsburg University stands firm on our decision; however, his consequences will be reviewed as is common in disciplinary actions like this.' Casselberry deleted the Twitter account, @BigCass24, but his name was taken off the team's roster this weekend, SI.com reported, after last playing for the team on March 17. Casselberry had reportedly apologized following the waves of criticism he attracted, according to TMZ. In tweets on Saturday night, BU Huskies posted: 'Bloomsburg Univ is deeply saddened by what was written about #MoneDavis by one of our student-athletes. His words do not represent us.'

The 13-year-old has been a natural in the spotlight following her Little League success. She told admirers that if they thought she was good at baseball, they should see her play hoops. Only in eighth grade, Davis already plays for her school's high school varsity basketball team and is also a regular on the soccer pitch. Davis aspires to play for the University of Connecticut and reach the WNBA. She plays midfielder on her soccer team and hopes to play three sports in high school, though she's not sure about baseball. 'I know the boys will be much stronger so that depends,' she said.

"Louis van Gaal has endured a difficult start to life in the Premier League, but that hasn't stopped the Manchester United boss from steering his side to crucial victories against the club's closest rivals.

"Torquay United players earn £375 per week on average, according to manager  Chris Hargreaves, meaning it would take them almost 16 years to match what Wayne Rooney makes in seven days. The Conference club's average figure is £104 below the UK's average weekly earnings of £479 and is in stark contrast to the Manchester United captain, who is among the best paid in the Barclays Premier League on a reported £300,000 per week. 'I'm giving a reason why sometimes we might not be up there with the big boys,' Hargreaves told BBC Radio Devon. 'The average wage on Saturday was £375.

"Standing with a Manchester United scarf in the middle of the Kop while thousands of Liverpool fans blast out 'You'll Never Walk Alone' might strike most people as a crazy stunt to pull. So when a picture emerged of one brave soul appearing to do just that during Sunday's top-four clash, many Twitter users got very excited. The image went viral, with even Wayne Rooney tweeting about it after United's 2-1 win at Anfield. A Manchester United fan photoshopped into the Kop at Anfield; Rooney even tweeted about him after the game . The original picture of the Manchester United fan was taken on a pre-season tour in Bangkok in 2013 . The Liverpool fans shown in the image were actually watching their team against Birmingham in 2011 . Rooney wrote: 'Very happy tonight. Fans were amazing. Juan Mata great goals. Should of let him take penalty. And the United fan in the kop. Brilliant' Unfortunately, it turns out that the image was a fake, with everyone, including the Manchester United captain, taken in by the clever use of Photoshop. A few hours later Sportsmail can reveal the original picture of the United fan, taken a long way from the Kop, which was super-imposed into the Anfield crowd. The actual image was taken in Bangkok in 2013, when United played there on a pre-season tour, and shows a fan at the airport waiting for the United team to arrive. Meanwhile, the image it was dropped into was not from Anfield on Sunday, but actually from a game against Birmingham in 2011.

"This star is fading, just that little bit too soon. After Steven Gerrard announced in January his decision to leave Liverpool for LA Galaxy in the summer, many were anticipating one last hurrah in a red shirt, given so many had come before. ‘I want to make sure that I have no regrets when my playing career is eventually over,’ he said back then, less than three months ago. Eighty days, in fact. Plunging his studs into Ander Herrera’s ankle in a vital match against bitter rivals Manchester United, one of the most tantalising games on the fixture list, was surely not what he had in mind. Especially as defeat has left them five points adrift of United in fourth. Steven Gerrard is shown a straight red card against Manchester United after being on the pitch for 38seconds . Gerrard makes the long walk back to the dressing room after being sent off against Manchester United . When a 19-year-old Gerrard picked up the ball 40 yards from goal, waltzed past two Sheffield Wednesday players before finding the bottom left corner with a right-footed drive for his first ever Liverpool strike, his team-mates mobbed him. The boy who had joined the club aged eight had become a man. A star was born. That strike had provided a two-goal cushion when a makeshift Liverpool side - hit by injuries - was struggling against bottom-of-the-table Wednesday in 1999. A bright, twinkling career was beckoning; one in which his passion, guile and leadership would shine fiercely throughout. He would lead the team by example many, many more times. To not even be considered as a regular starter, to reduce his own swan-song by three games due to a moment of madness, is not how he would have imagined it ending 16 years later. Steven Gerrard celebrates at the end of the game after scoring against Sheffield Wednesday in 1999 . Or that he was not at the heart of their 13-game unbeaten run in the Premier League which was driving the team towards a Champions League spot. That he would start just five of those and then be so largely to blame for their capitulation in the 14th. The infamous slip last season against Chelsea, which many credit for ending Liverpool’s title chances, could have been buried beneath all the trophies and silverware. But too many crucial mistakes and they begin to stand out more prominently. It is not the first time Gerrard has been sent off against Manchester United - he saw red in 2011 . Gerrard has been sent off six times in his Liverpool career - seen here against Leeds, Everton and Chelsea . This is not the goodbye he would’ve wanted, or the one he deserves after being the catalyst of a team hanging to the coattails of the league’s best for over a decade to a Champions League, two FA Cups, three League Cups and the UEFA Cup. His greatness will never be forgotten, but neither will these high-profile errors at the end if they keep occurring. Gerrard has picked up six Premier League red cards now, often a byproduct of leaders when their passion spills over. Only seven players have received more, including Roy Keane with seven and Patrick Vieira with eight. But the big occasions are when these types of explosive players are supposed to be able to keep it under control. Gerrard has been Liverpool's inspirational leader for over a decade . Gerrard will be best remembered for leading Liverpool to a number of trophies - including the FA Cup and Champions League . There is still the hope of an FA Cup final at Wembley to celebrate his 35th birthday on Saturday, May 30. But due to his ban he will not even be in the side to help them reach it in their FA Cup replay against Blackburn. Nor for their next, crucial, Premier League match against Champions League rivals Arsenal or the game versus Newcastle. As it stands there are six games remaining of Liverpool’s season and Gerrard’s Merseyside career. If they progress to the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa in his absence, that will be seven, and eight if they make it to the final. Given all that has gone before, how much he will be desperate to go out on a high before he crosses the Atlantic. But will Brendan Rodgers trust him again? Or has this star been snuffed out too soon?","Steven Gerrard was sent off against Man United after just 38 seconds .

"A Tory MP has landed an £800-an-hour job at the same firm he had lavished praise on while working a transport minister, according to a Labour MP. Stephen Hammond took the role with Inmarsat, which makes communications systems for aviation and shipping, just months after he was sacked as Secretary of State for Transport. Former City banker Hammond had said he was 'hugely impressed' by the company during his two years as a minister- where he attended official events alongside Inmarsat bosses. Stephen Hammond took the role with communications company Inmarsat just months after he lost his position as minister for transport . Labour MP Karl Turner told the Daily Mirror that the situation was 'grubby' and accused Mr Hammond of 'feathering his nest' with the staggering fees. 'This is a perfect example of why the rules around MPs' second jobs need to change,' he added. But Mr Hammond, who lost his position as transport secretary in the reshuffle, said he had done everything 'by the book' in regards to his new position which had been approved by the Commons authorities and the Department for Transport. The Commons register of members' interests states that Mr Hammond has been paid £20,000 for just 25 hours' work advising Inmarsat plc with his contract due to run out at the end of March. Mr Hammond will be paid as much as £800-an-hour at the firm he had lavished praise on while working a transport minister, according to a Labour MP . The MP for Wimbledon in south west London, had said he was impressed by Inmarsat on a visit to the company's headquarters in 2013. He later gave a speech at an Inmarsat dinner where he said he was 'committed' to a government partnership with the firm. Labour leader Ed Miliband had called for a ban on MPs having lucrative second jobs to 'restore the reputation' of the Commons in the wake of the cash for access scandal. It came after revelations of former foreign secretaries Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Jack Straw being filmed by undercover reporters boasting about how they could be hired for £5,000-a-day. Sir Malcolm announced he was suspended from the Tory party and forced quit as an MP after bragging that he could see any foreign ambassador in London and has 'useful access' to every British ambassador in the world. Mr Straw was suspended by the Labour party after being filmed boasting about having laws changed 'under the radar'. Commons Speaker John Bercow had warned last month: 'People should not be in Parliament to add to their personal fortune.' But Mr Cameron has defended the right of MPs to do second jobs - insisting that extra work can be fitted in alongside constituency duties, and it was voted down. Mr Hammond has come under criticism before and even faced a Parliamentary inquiry in 2012 after failing to declare his shareholding in a firm that receives tax breaks and the very next year it emerged he had used an offshore firm to buy his luxury second home in Portugal worth half a million pounds. He was also revealed to be one of the most frequent users of the government's chauffeur-driven cars- using them 138 times a year despite living just six miles away from Westminster. And in 2013 it came to light that Mr Hammond had demanded a £40,000 pay rise for MPs. Stephen Hammond took the role just months after he was sacked as Secretary of State for Transport in the last re-shuffle . He had responded to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) review into MPs' pay with a call for their salaries to be increased to over £100,000 - a 60 per cent increase. Mr Hammond said he felt MPs should be paid the same as GPs, with an average salary of more than £105,000. But his comments attracted huge criticism as he suggested the massive pay rise for ministers during the financial crisis and at a time when many salaries were still frozen.","Stephen Hammond took the advisor role with Inmarsat for  £800-an-hour .

"Juan Mata finished off a sumptuous move in some style as Manchester United beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield on Sunday. The Spanish midfielder latched onto Angel di Maria's lofted pass, and twisted his body to volley a spectacular effort past despairing goalkeeper Simon Mignolet. We're not calling it an 'overhead kick', but his finish was sublime. So, what other scissor kicks have we seen over the years? Juan Mata fires home a spectacular effort for Manchester United against Liverpool on Sunday . The Spaniard's goal was the second of his double and secured a 2-1 victory for Louis van Gaal's side . Paolo di Canio (WEST HAM vs Wimbledon, 1999) As casual as it was genius. When Trevor Sinclair lifted the ball into the box, he would not have imagined the enigmatic Italian forward would have executed the volley to find the corner. Di Canio's scissor kick flew past Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan, and deservedly won West Ham's player of the season award. His goal of the season gong for 1999/00 in the Premier League was no surprise, either. Paolo di Canio watches on after guiding home a wonderful scissor kick for West Ham against Wimbledon . The Italian forward's strike was named goal of the season in the 1999/00 Premier League campaign . Gus Poyet (CHELSEA vs Sunderland, 1999) Di Canio's effort wasn't the only scissor kick of that particular Premier League season. On the first day of the campaign, the Uruguayan midfielder sprinted to meet Gianfranco Zola's lofted pass and spectacularly volleyed home. His goal was one of four at Stamford Bridge against the hapless Sunderland. And that wasn't the last time Black Cats fans would lose their cool with Poyet. Guti (REAL MADRID vs Villarreal, 2001) Guti's scissor kick was one that we hadn't seen before, and haven't seen since. Standing upright, similar to Di Canio and Poyet, the Real Madrid star side foots his volley into the top corner. The Bernabeu faithful have seen several special players this century, but not many goals as unique as this (3minutes, 10 seconds). Mark Hughes (WALES vs Spain. 1985) Wales 3-0 Spain. A day that will long live in the memories of Welsh supporters, thrashing the Euro 1984 runners-up in Wrexham. And not only was it an historic day for the team, Hughes' goal in his hometown will never be forgotten. The ball spins back to the now-Stoke manager who acrobatically fires it home from shoulder-height, thundering into the top corner. Mark Hughes' spectacular strike helped Wales to a emphatic 3-0 victory against Spain in 1985 . Dennis Bergkamp (INTER MILAN vs Rapid Bucharest, 1993) Arsenal fans will have seen many special Bergkamp strikes in England over the years, but this effort in Italy may have gone under the radar. In the last 32 of the UEFA Cup, the 24-year-old Dutch striker showed incredible technique from the edge of the box to divert this wayward pass into the bottom corner. Luis Suarez (BARCELONA vs Levante 2015) The former Liverpool striker has now forged his legacy at Barcelona with the winner in El Clasico on Sunday night, but as recently as last month, Suarez was struggling to hit top form at the Nou Camp. This effort after Lionel Messi's dinked cross in a 5-0 victory helped things though, and he has scored seven goals since. Luis Suarez bends back to fire home a scissor kick during Barcelona's 5-0 victory against Levante last month . Sebastian Coates (LIVERPOOL vs QPR, 2012) Coates has endeared himself to Liverpool fans defensively, and is now struggling on loan at Sunderland. So this acrobatic attempt against QPR certainly came out of the blue. His first goal for the club, the centre half jogged up for a corner and his volley flew past Paddy Kenny in goal. However, his flaws at the back were later highlighted as the hosts at Loftus Road came back to win 3-2. Sebastian Coates netted his first goal for Liverpool against QPR in 2012 - a stunning volley past Paddy Kenny . Yann Kermogant (BOURNEMOUTH vs Ipswich, 2014) Down to the Championship now, and with runaway leaders Bournemouth. Four months ago, the Cherries took just 111 seconds to net first against Ipswich. French target man Kermogant lashed home a magnificent scissor kick, sending the Goldstands Stadium faithful wild. Peter Crouch (LIVERPOOL vs Galatasaray, 2006) The scissor kicks of all scissor kicks. Crouch's semi-overhead effort defied belief. It was his 10th goal in eight starts for club and country, as Liverpool hung on to a 3-2 victory against the Turkish side in the Champions League. Steve Finnan will take credit with the assist... Peter Crouch uses his large frame to execute a perfect scissor kick against Galatasaray in 2006 . The Liverpool striker and team-mates could barely believe it after his stunning goal at Anfield . Manuel Negrete (MEXICO vs Bulgaria, 1986) It doesn't get much better than scoring at the World Cup finals. After taking two touches to bring the ball down, Manuel Negrete fed Javier Aguirre and then met the quick return pass with a mesmeric left-foot volley which had the host nation in raptures.","Juan Mata scored two goals as Manchester United beat Liverpool 2-1 .

Roberto Martinez (left) praised the on-loan Tottenham winger for his 'magnificent' performance . 'Since day one he has come in and showed an incredible appetite,' Martinez told talkSPORT. 'I thought against Newcastle he played very well and from that point I didn't want him to lose that feeling so I asked him to travel to Kiev. He couldn't play but he was around the group and I thought we benefited from that. 'He looked like a player that has been at Everton for years [against QPR]. He took responsibility, he knew he had fresh legs, and the way he performed was magnificent. 'It wasn't just what he did in front of goal, but the way he worked in defence was a real help. It was a really strong performance.' The winger was frozen out at White Hart Lane but seems to have had a new lease of life in Merseyside and with safety from relegation not quite secured, Martinez will be hoping Lennon can continue to play a vital role in prolonging their Premier League status. The winger slots home the crucial goal to move the Toffees closer to safety with the win at Loftus Road .

"Craig Dawson will serve a one-match ban after Gareth McAuley's mistaken red card was transferred to his West Brom team-mate. The Football Association has confirmed the defender will be banned instead of McAuley. Referee Neil Swarbrick sent McAuley off by mistake after Dawson had fouled Wilfried Bony in the Baggies' 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Saturday. Wilfried Bony (right) goes down under a challenge from Gareth McAuley inside the opening two minutes . Swarbrick apologised, via a statement from the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, and the case of mistaken identity has been accepted by an Independent Regulatory Commission. An FA statement confirmed: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today [Monday 23 March 2015], a claim of mistaken identity in relation to West Bromwich Albion's Gareth McAuley was successful. 'The player was dismissed during the game against Manchester City on Saturday [21 March 2015] for denying an obvious goal scoring opportunity. 'The standard punishment of a one-match suspension has been transferred to Craig Dawson and will be served with immediate effect.' Craig Dawson was the man who should have been sent off for an earlier collision with the City striker . Dawson will miss Albion's clash with QPR at The Hawthorns on April 4. The incident marked the second time in a matter of weeks that the wrong player has been sent off in a Premier League game, after Roger East dismissed Sunderland's Wes Brown against Manchester United for an offence committed by fellow United old boy John O'Shea. PGMOL general manager Mike Riley has called for the introduction of video replays to assist officials in such cases. Riley told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'The referee has got to make his decision based on what he thinks he's seen. His instincts often lead him to trust his judgement. 'It's one of the areas that would lend itself to technology. The West Brom players protest with referee Neil Swarbrick after he sent off the wrong player . 'The game has stopped and there's time before we restart the game to have a look at something. That would provide the concrete evidence that would get the decision right. 'We've been open-minded to things like the goal decision system which has made a great difference and a great benefit to referees in the Premier League. 'We need to see what other technology can be used to get refereeing decisions more accurate. He added: 'We need to test it in live football. Until we do that, we won't know the impact on the game. 'Technology can be helpful but we don't want to destroy the fabric of the game, the fast-flowing spectacle we all love.'

Both Willian and Luis started for Jose Mourinho's side on Sunday, as the west London club gave away a two goal lead before a Loic Remy strike sealed a crucial three points ahead of the international break. Oscar replaced fellow Brazilian Ramires early on in the second half, putting an end to a bad week for the latter after missing out on a place in Dunga's squad for Brazil's friendly matches against France and Chile. Dunga took command of the Brazil team for the second time in July, just days after Brazil were dumped out their own World Cup 7-1 by Germany and has won all six of his matches in charge so far.

"Blackpool chairman has been charged by the FA . Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston is facing a ban from football activities after being charged by the Football Association for text messages in which he called a supporter 'a retard'. The unpopular chief has until next Monday to respond to the charge and is set to be locked out of his own club if ultimately found guilty. Oyston - who has been the constant target of fan protests over the course of the Seasiders’ worst season for decades - is also looking at a hefty fine and mandatory four-hour FA education course. The shocking text messages, seen by Sportsmail, emerged just before Christmas when he sent a series of vitriolic volleys to fan Stephen Smith, who he told to 'enjoy the rest of your special needs day out'. Oyston later apologised for his part in the exchange, however the FA announced on Monday that the messages allegedly constituted five breaches of its rules and now has until 6pm on March 30 to respond to the charge. In a another rant from Oyston, who has had abuse hurled at him as well this season, read: 'Stop texting f******, you shouldn't have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium. 'You are banned because I think you are a p****. 'Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you.' Oyston has also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool, a Premier League side four years ago, spiral down to the Conference, with another text reading: 'I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission'. Blackpool's fans protest against Oyston during the game against Charlton . A statement on the FA's website read: 'Blackpool FC Chairman Karl Oyston has been charged by the FA in relation to comments made in a text message exchange. 'It is alleged that the misconduct constituted five breaches of FA rules, and that during the text message exchange, Mr Oyston used abusive and/or insulting words towards a supporter of Blackpool FC. 'It is further alleged that each of these five breaches of FA Rule E3(1) is an 'Aggravated Breach' as defined in Rule E3(2), as each included a reference to disability. 'Mr Oyston has until 6pm on March 30, 2015 to respond to the charge.' The content of the messages first emerged just before Christmas and Oyston came under fire from fans of his own club as well as anti-discrimination group Kick It Out, while the local paper the Blackpool Gazette scrapped his weekly column with immediate effect. Blackpool fans have made their dislike for Oyston clear this season with songs and banners . The Seasiders chairman issued an apology via the club's official website in which he explained he was responding to threats and abuse to his own family. 'I would like to unreservedly apologise for any offence or distress caused by my text responses reported in the media recently,' he said. 'I regret stooping to the level of those threatening and abusing my family. 'My mobile number was placed on a social media website recently and it led to a barrage of abuse about my mother, father, wife, children and myself. 'In hindsight the aim of this was clear, and I foolishly opted to challenge some of the abuse, harassment and threats. 'Given my position, I should have acted with more responsibility and reported the abusive text messages, phone calls and answer phone messages to the police, rather than get embroiled in such an exchange.' Blackpool fans have held a number of protests about Oyston . However, Smith said at the time that he had not accepted Oyston's apology. Smith also claimed Oyston's position at the helm of Blackpool had become 'untenable'. 'The apology is weak,' he said. 'He has said that he is responding to messages that threatened and abused his family. I did not threaten or abuse any member of his family. His position as chairman is untenable. He has no choice but to resign.' Oyston has endured a frosty relationship with Blackpool supporters who have been disillusioned by events on and off the field during a tumultuous year at Bloomfield Road. Last Saturday hundreds of fans protested against the Tangerines' ownership and opted to go and watch non-league AFC Blackpool instead, boycotting the fixture between Lee Clark's men and Leeds. Blackpool are 17 points away from safety in the Sky Bet Championship and their relegation could be confirmed in their next game against Bolton.","Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston sent abusive text messages to some fans .

"Diego Costa appears increasingly likely to be released by Spain after he was spared a trip to Madrid and had medical tests in London. Costa suffered yet another hamstring injury during Chelsea’s 3-2 win at Hull on Sunday, and was checked over by the Spanish FA on Monday. Spain boss Vicente del Bosque made plans for his absence by calling Juanmi, a 21-year-old striker from Malaga, into the squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Ukraine on Friday and next week’s friendly against Holland. Chelsea striker Diego Costa was forced off with a hamstring injury during the Blues' 3-2 win over Hull City . Costa (left) talks to manager Jose Mourinho before he is substituted at KC Stadium on Sunday . It will leave Costa free to focus on regaining full fitness for his club’s next game, against Stoke City on Sunday week. Jose Mourinho said club doctor Paco Biosca was against the idea of an operation but Costa may yet consider corrective surgery at the end of the season in an attempt to solve the hamstring problem which has nagged him for a year. Loic Remy, who came on for Costa at Hull and scored the winner, is not in the France squad and will have two weeks to convince Mourinho he deserves more game time. Didier Drogba did not travel to Hull but also expects to be available if Costa is not ready to face Stoke. ‘I know that Diego is the number one,’ said Remy. ‘But when the manager needs me, I give my best for him.’ Costa had scored Chelsea's second goal as they stormed into a 2-0 lead within 10 minutes on Sunday . Hull were able to draw level before half-time and when Costa was subbed off the scores were locked at 2-2 .","Spain play Ukraine in a Euro 2016 qualifier before a  friendly against Holland .

"Juan Mata has a habit of delivering when you least expect it. While at Stamford Bridge the little Spaniard with the big heart turned up at the office of a Chelsea supporter to deliver him his new club shirt, and had to persuade the receptionist to let him in. Earlier this year, at a Primary School in the impoverished Wythenshawe area of Manchester, he stunned schoolchildren by arriving unannounced armed with dozens of toys. Juan Mata celebrates after scoring a double against Liverpool at Anfield, when Manchester United needed him . Mata's second goal in particular was superb, and showed why United spent so much money on him . The little Spaniard put United ahead in the first half with a tidy finish following an Ander Herrera pass . But United fans have had to wait until now, 14 months after David Moyes paid Chelsea £37m for his services, for him to deliver on the pitch. Why has it taken so long? There is mitigation. Mata's joyous arrival coincided with the miserable final throes of Moyes regime. When the ship is sinking it is hard to dance the tango in the ballroom. Then came Louis van Gaal and a rigid pragmatism the playmaker presumably thought he had escaped when he said farewell to Jose Mourinho. A free spirit, Mata has not been the only one at Old Trafford to take time to digest the platter the Dutchman demands. Van Gaal was quick to take praise following what feels like a seismic 2-1 win in Liverpool, proudly stating that he had now found a position for a man who will never be anything other than a number 10 in a number eight shirt. Mata is beginning to repay the faith shown by Manchester United's fans, who have stuck by him . Louis van Gaal claimed a tactical masterstroke, but he was really only playing Mata in his obvious position . When he arrived at David Moyes' United, Mata was trying to bring momentum to a losing team . The playmaker was allowed to leave Chelsea because Jose Mourinho didn't rate his defensive contributions . But a look at Van Gaal's record would suggest that, given time, he gets it right. Now the same can be said of Mata, although 14 goals in his last 32 appearances would suggest not much was wrong with the 26-year-old in the first place. The statistics show that his talents have ever been in doubt. Since his arrival at Chelsea in 2011, no midfielder has a better joint total of goals and assists in the Premier League. Mata has 65 (31 goals and 34 assists), ahead of compatriot David Silva who has 61 (26 and 35) for United's cross-town rivals despite having played a season more in England. Majestic in the 3-0 romp over Spurs, Mata was at it again at Anfield. His first was provided by another new arrival with a point to prove. Ander Herrera, much to the annoyance of many of the Stretford End faithful, has been absent for long periods of the season. Mata has been excellent in recent weeks, dominating against Tottenham before scoring twice on Sunday . The Spaniard watches his wonderful volley fly into the top corner, as he announced his arrival at Anfield . The man from the Basque country has basked in the limelight of the first team and his defence-splitting pass for Mata illustrated what United have been missing. Mata, showing a surprising turn of pace, finished clinically into the bottom corner - but the moment United fans will forever remember came when he contorted his tiny frame to rifle a Mark Hughes-esque scissor-volley from Angel Di Maria's pass past a helpless Simon Mignolet. Forget the helicopter landing at Carrington, Mata had finally arrived. In the away end there was delirium. Scoring any kind of goal against the old enemy can provoke that kind of response from the most sober of United fan. In the commentary box there wee gasps. Thierry Henry, a man who knows all about the sublime, hailed the strike as ridiculous. Many will not have seen it coming but plenty of those who did needed no reminder of his talents. In a Wetherspoon's close to the KC Stadium, where Chelsea were playing Hull City, there were groans from visiting supporters watching on television as Mata volleyed in United's second. Those supping cut-price ale in the Admiral of the Humber will no doubt know all about the importance of good deals but many watching events unfold from the other end of the M62 voiced their opinion that Jose Mourinho was wrong to let the playmaker go, despite the hefty fee the dainty man delivered. Since arriving in England, Mata has more goals and assists combined than any other Premier League player . Manchester City star David Silva is behind Mata statistically, despite having been in the league a year longer . Chelsea fans were upset to lose their creative spark, and could now do with some of his quality in midfield . Some think that Mata's old club, despite running away with the Premier League, lack creativity in his absence and can only dream of a world in which he creates chances for Diego Costa. They bemoan their Portugese manager's insistence of only selecting prototypes, those who will race back and do their part in the Mourinho masterplan to stifle the opposition. Their loss, it would finally appear, looks set to be United's gain.","Juan Mata excellent in last two games against Tottenham and Liverpool .

"It is a brave statement written from the heart, by a young woman fighting for her life. 'I am happy, I am alive and I was built to survive'. The words are part of a heartbreaking video created by young mother Abi  Rounds, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at just 22. After just two days to digest the news with her closest family members - including her mother, father and boyfriend - she decided to reveal her diagnosis to other loved ones via an emotional video on her Facebook page. The clip has now been watched almost 9,000 times all over the world and Miss Rounds said the messages of support have helped her face a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. Scroll down for video .

The video comprises a series of clips such as the above, explaining to her loved ones what has happened . Her brave words have been watched by thousands of people after the video went viral . The now 23-year-old, who has watched her own mother and aunt fight the disease, said: 'When they told me I had cancer It was terrifying.  I I felt sick and the worst went through my head. 'As soon as I came home from hospital, I got my two-year-old daughter from my sister who was looking after her, and got my cousin and sister to come to my house and I told them the news. 'But from there on I thought that's it, I'm going to do this - nothing is going to stop me now. 'From that moment I've got on well, I'm really positive and the support has been overwhelming. 'People around me knew there was something wrong and it was getting to the point where I was having to repeat myself - it was too much. 'I thought maybe if I do a video I can get my message across,' said Miss Rounds, from Leominster, Herefordshire, . 'It was probably one of the hardest things I have ever done, but looking back it is one of the best things too. 'The support has been absolutely amazing and has really got me through the tough times. 'It has been incredible getting messages from strangers telling me to keep strong. Miss Rounds was just 11 when her mother Julie, 46, was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a single mastectomy. Two years ago her aunt had the same treatment for a tumour. Her own cancer was diagnosed last December. Miss Rounds has now shaved off her blonde hair and is undergoing chemotherapy following surgery . Miss Rounds - along with various family members - has also raised more than £2,000 for Breast Cancer UK by shaving their heads . Miss Rounds had been watching TV when she felt an itch on her right breast and found two lumps. After a GP appointment she was referred to Hereford County Hospital where doctors went against convention to perform a biopsy because of her family history. Just a week later medics asked her to come back - with family members for support - and delivered the news she had two cancerous lumps, grade two and three. 'It was a shock to be told - I didn't expect it at all,' said Miss Rounds. 'I thought it was nothing to worry about because I was so young, fit and healthy, so I didn't think it could be cancer. 'They don't normally do a biopsy until you are 25, but because of my family history I had one. 'They rang me and told me to make an appointment and they said did I have someone to come with me, and I had a feeling.' In the video - which has been viewed nearly 9,000 times, said: 'The reason I am posting this is because I have had so many lovely kind messages off so many people. Miss Rounds (with her daughter) was just 11 when her mother Julie, 46, was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a single mastectomy . In the video, she says: 'I never thought I would be sitting in the same position as my mum, at the age of 22, getting told I have breast cancer. It is scary, and it is a shock, and you just don't think it will ever happen to you' 'I just thought instead of me repeating myself to everyone, this would be the  easiest way for me to say it, and you will all find out sooner or later. 'I never thought I would be sitting in the same position as my mum, at the age of 22, getting told I have breast cancer. 'It is scary, and it is a shock, and you just don't think it will ever happen to you. 'But with the support of my amazing family, fantastic friends, and my daughter, I will do that and I will kick cancer's butt!' After a family Christmas with partner Jamie, 23, and daughter Ruby May, two, she had a double mastectomy in a four hour operation on January 13. However further tests have revealed the cancer has spread to her lymph nodes, so she is now undergoing chemotherapy.

"Harry Kane deservedly tops this week's EA Sports' Performance Index after another pulsating weekend of Premier League football. Following his first call-up to the senior England squad, the 21-year-old striker capped a memorable week by netting his first Premier League hat-trick to help Spurs to a 4-3 victory against Leicester City. Kane is now the Premier League's joint-top scorer alongside Diego Costa and continues to lead the line brilliantly for Mauricio Pochettino's side while earning a Game Index score of 71, which is 11 points higher than Olivier Giroud in second place. Harry Kane went home with the match ball after scoring his first ever Premier League hat-trick . Kane slots past Kasper Schmeichel during Tottenham's 4-3 victory against Leicester City on Saturday . The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League. It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices? 1. Winning performance . 2. Player's performance per match . 3. Appearances . 4. Goals scored . 5. Assists . 6. Clean sheets . Arsenal's French frontman earns the runner-up spot following another impressive brace which helped the Gunners put John Carver's Newcastle to the sword on Saturday. Giroud gave Newcastle defender Mike Williamson a torrid first 45 minutes in which he scored twice and completed 81.6 per cent of his passes for Arsene Wenger's side. Manchester United's midfielder Juan Mata completes the top three with a Game Index total of 56.3 after a stunning double against Liverpool as the Old Trafford club earned a hard-fought 2-1 victory at Anfield.

"Dozens of military personnel were injured when an RAF transport plane on its way to Afghanistan nose-dived 4,400ft after the captain's camera became lodged alongside the aircraft's joystick. The  Voyager jet was around five hours into its journey from Brize Norton to Camp Bastion when the Nikon camera, used by the captain to take photographs on board, got stuck between the arm rest and the side-stick controller when his seat moved forward. In 27 seconds of chaos, the plane lost 4,400ft in altitude, throwing  passengers and crew without seatbelts towards the ceiling, injuring 33 of those on board, while one traumatised passenger was hospitalised with stress, according to the report into the incident. This reconstruction shows how an RAF captain's camera became wedged alongside a Voyager aircraft's joystick before it plunged 4,400ft in mid air, injurying dozens of military personnel on board . The Voyager jet, similar to the one pictured, had been six hours into its journey from Brize Norton to Camp Bastion when the Nikon camera, used to take photographs on board, got stuck in the flight controls . The new Voyager jet had been six hours into its journey from Brize Norton to Camp Bastion when the captain's Nikon camer, used to take photographs on board, got stuck in the flight controls . The aircraft, a militarised version of the  Airbus A330-200 passenger jet, was diverted to an airbase in Turkey after the incident on February 9 last year, and the state-of-the-art fleet grounded for 11 days while the cause of the dive was investigated by the Military Aviation Authority. The final report into the incident, released last week, has now revealed that RAF captain had been alone in the cockpit and was taking pictures of the flight deck from his seat with the digital SLR camera in the three minutes before the plane dramatically plummeted. The camera had been between his arm rest and the side-stick unit which controls the aircraft's altitude, and became wedged in when his seat moved forward. The report author describes the incident as a 'near-miss' and said there was a 'realistic potential for the loss of the aircraft and 198 of our people'. There were nine crew members and 189 servicemen and women on board the flight , who had been served their meal and were enjoying the in-flight entertainment when when the plane suddenly lost altitude while cruising at 33,000ft over the Black Sea on its way to the main British base in Afghanistan. The digital SLR camera, used by the captain in the three minutes before the plunge, had become wedged between his arm rest and the side-stick unit which control's the aircraft's altitude, when his seat moved forward, as this reconstruction shows . At its fastest, it dropped at a rate of 15,800 feet per minute with the resulting g force enough to lift passengers out of their seats, as their belongings and other items such as pots of hot tea were hurled across the cabin. 'A large number of passengers and crew had been thrown towards the ceiling,' the report states. 'A significant volume of loose articles, including bags, personal effects, teapots, paper cups and bins were flying around the cabin while some passengers were shouting.' According to the report, at the time of the plunge, the co-pilot had been out of the cockpit and was among those thrown towards the roof. 'Immediately prior to the pitch-down, the co-pilot felt a sensation similar to turbulence. The Purser also reported a similar sensation, describing it as a ""jolt"", it states. 'As the aircraft pitched down, the co-pilot was lifted to the cabin roof and, while experiencing weightlessness, re-entered the flight deck through the open door. 'He described a confusing scene with audio alarms sounding and a violent shaking of the aircraft. 'The captain shouted repeatedly that he could not disengage the autopilot. With his feet on the flight deck roof, the co-pilot reached down and attempted to disengage the autopilot by pulling back on his side-stick; an action which appeared to have no effect.' The two pilots were quickly able to level the plane, and the captain decided to land the air craft as soon as possible so diverted the flight to the US Air Force's Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey. Of those on board, 25 passengers and seven crew members were injured, and were cared for by medical personnel travelling as passengers, as well as by medics at Incirlik. This dotted line shows the dent in the camera, caused when it became wedged next to the side-stick . The dent in the camera was found to be consistent with having been caused by the flange of the side-stick . The report states that one passenger had an 'acute stress rection' and was administered oxygen by a doctor before being taken to  hospital upon landing. A cabin crew member was also hyperventilating but was cared for by a colleague. Passengers without NATO travel orders then had to stump up £10 in cash for a visa allowing them to pass through immigration, with the servicemen and women having to club together to buy the visas as the British Embassy was unable to transfer the money. Mental health experts were sent out to Incirlik to help ensure that the passengers felt able to get back on a plane so they could be taken back to the UK, and assess whether they were fit to be deployed to Afghanistan. But by the time they were flown back to Britain, two days after the terrifying plunge, 'several passengers were exhibiting signs of distress, with some requiring counselling from the mental health nurses or medication from the Brize Norton medical staff.' Ten passengers were told they were no longer required to deploy to Afghanistan, while a further 12 did not have to for medical or pastoral reasons. Damage to the aircraft included 50 broken in-flight entertainment sockets, seven dented ceiling panels, five broken florescent light tubes and five damaged hand rails, but there was no reported damage to the flight deck, and no reported damage to the external structure of the aircraft. The cost of the incident has not yet been calculated, although an early estimate put it in the region of £0.5million. The report found that the pilot had taken 77 photographs during the flight and had used it as recently as three minutes and 20 seconds before the incident. The plane had set off from Brize Norton in Oxfordshire (pictured) on the morning of February 9 last year . The flight had been bound for Camp Bastion in Afghanistan (pictured), which was the UK's major base in the country until late last year . It states that although using the camera during the flight was not prohibited, its use 'represented a lack of compliance with the policy regarding non-relevant duties'. However, it also says that during the cruise stage of the flight the pilot's workload would have been low, and that taking photographs would have been a way for the captain to maintain his alertness. It recommends that ways of minimising pilot boredom during less busy periods of the flight should be examined. Changes to the design of the cabin to prevent a similar incident were not required, but the report recommends that strengthening rules regarding wearing seatbelts could mitigate 'future in-flight upsets'. The report concludes: 'The loss of the aircraft was not an unrealistic possibility. While at its heart this incident was caused by the simple and unthinking act of placing a loose article close to the aircraft controls, there are broader lessons to learn here. 'Modern technology may be capable of reducing crew workload to historic lows and aircraft can now protect themselves as never before, but the requirement for crews to understand and interact with the aircraft and its systems when things deviate from the norm remains and challenging as ever.' An RAF spokesman said: ‘The safety of our passengers and crew is of paramount importance to us. 'The incident was caused by a camera becoming lodged between the arm rest and side-stick causing the aircraft to lose height, the RAF is in the process of implementing the recommendations made by the Service Inquiry including instructions to ensure no objects are placed between pilots’ arm rests and the side stick’. A spokesman for AirTanker, which is responsible for the supply of Voyager to the RAF and the service which underpins it, told MailOnline: 'As an operational issue for the RAF, it would be inappropriate for AirTanker to comment. 'However, we note the findings of the Service Inquiry Report, which confirm that no technical fault was found with the aircraft.' The RAF started using the Voyager's last year after agreeing to bring in 14 of the planes for military use under a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract that is costing more than £10bn. They were intended to replace the RAF's VC-10 and Tristar planes both as a transport plane, and as an air-to-air refuelling tanker. The Ministry of Defence bought a fleet of 14 Voyagers last year under a £10.5bn private finance initiative deal with Oxfordshire-based AirTanker. The aircraft – a military version of the Airbus A330-200 civilian jet – can fly at a top speed of 567mph.The Voyager can transport 400 soldiers. Twice the size of a Lancaster bomber, with a 197ft 10in wingspan and is 193ft in length, the planes can hold 100,000 litres of fuel and are the biggest the RAF has ever had. In theory, they can refuel jets in mid-air at 125 times the speed of forecourt garage pumps – at 5,000 litres a minute.

"Rafael Nadal lost his quarter-final clash with Milos Raonic in Indian Wells but believes his performance showed he is getting back to his best. The defeat meant Nadal missed the chance of joining Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray in the semi-finals for the first time since the 2012 Australian Open. But, after Raonic saved three match points to spring the shock, the Spaniard admitted: ‘I’m leaving Indian Wells with the feeling that I had a big chance to do more and with the feeling that I was ready to compete again well. Rafael Nadal believes he's closing in on being back to his best after a promising Indian Wells display . ‘I think a match like this obviously is much better if you win but, even losing, I’m 90 per cent sure that will help me.’ The three-time Indian Wells winner added: ‘It’s true that I didn’t compete at that level of intensity mentally in tennis for a long time. ‘I was able to be very focused, playing with positive energy for three hours, so that’s great news for me, because that’s the way I competed during all of my career.’ Milos Raonic upset the Spaniard and saved three match points in the process of winning the clash . Canadian Raonic looked like he might be heading out after losing the first set inside 36 minutes, but he rallied to save three match points in an epic second-set tie-break, forcing a deciding set. The sixth seed, who fired 19 aces and also saved six break points, finally ended Nadal’s perfect record against Canadians by earning a break in the third and clinching a 4-6, 7-6, 7-5 victory. After his first win over Nadal, Raonic said: ‘At the moments when I was playing those match points, it didn’t really feel like match points. Nadal has had an injury hit 18 months but now looks to come back stronger and hopes to win more titles . ‘It was just like another point that I was trying to get through, sort of going through the paces at that moment of what I need to do, not really signifying it as a match point. ‘It’s really great what I was able to do today and I’m very happy with it but I don’t let myself get caught up because this isn’t where it ends. There is a lot more to achieve.’ It does not get any easier for Raonic, with Federer his semi-final opponent. The Swiss master reached the last four with a routine 6-4, 6-0 victory over Tomas Berdych. The impressive Canadian progresses to the semi-finals as his reputation continues to grow . He had 21 winners, equalling the number of unforced errors by Berdych, won 13 of 14 points at the net, never faced a break point on his serve and broke Berdych four times in the match, including three times in the second set. A clearly delighted Federer said: ‘It’s not just another win but another win against a top 10 player — against Berdych, who has played me tough in recent years. I was really able to utilise the court much more, play more angles, play with variation, spin and slice. I did that very well. ‘Because I was serving well and moving well, so maybe there is not going to be that many chances for him on the return.’","Rafael Nadal was knocked out at Indian Wells by Canadian Milos Raonic .

"The Premier League will have to wait at least three seasons before video technology can be possibly be introduced. It is the Dutch FA (KNVB) who are leading the way in trials of a system to aid referees. However, their bid to introduce the technology in cup matches from next season was rejected by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) last month. Referees chief Mike Riley has called for the arrival of video technology into the Premier League . Given the increasing number of controversies in the Premier League, referees’ chief Mike Riley has called for its arrival in the English top-flight. But the IFAB have delayed any decision for 12 months at least, meaning the earliest we could see video assistance for referees will be the 2017/18 season. The Dutch are certainly confident their process could work. It involves a fifth official located in a video room with access to instant replays. During Eredivisie games they have been trialling how long it would take that official to make a correct judgment on key incidents only, such as red cards, penalties and fouls before goals. They have found that an average of two to three crucial decisions per game can each be resolved within five to 20 seconds, with the official having a direct audio link to the referee. Should the IFAB give the go-ahead for trials of this system – or another one – in competitive matches during the 2016/17 campaign, they would then want to see it used in a FIFA age-grade tournament before giving permission for video technology to be implemented in the Premier League and elsewhere around the world. With Goal-line technology in use, and calls for videos to help with penalties and red cards too have risen too . Meanwhile, the notion of a ‘challenge system’ for managers has been rejected for fear of it being used for tactical gain. FA chairman Greg Dyke will offer his full backing to any attempts to expand the use of video technology and will even volunteer English football to operate trials. ‘In 20 years we’ll look back and say: “Wasn’t it quaint that we didn’t use video technology?”’ said Dyke. ‘When we discussed it at IFAB, even the ones who were most against it accept it’s going to happen. ‘If we’re going to do it sometime, why don’t we do it now? We are 100 per cent behind it. I suspect we would like to do an experiment, but you’d have to get that throu .

"Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the fraternity at the center of the racist University of Oklahoma video, has its roots in the pre-Civil War Deep South. 'We came up from Dixie land,' says a ditty from an old songbook, boasting about SAE's success. Now, nearly 160 years after its founding at the University of Alabama, another song - this one chanted by members of the frat's University of Oklahoma chapter and containing racial slurs and lynching references - hearkens back to the bad old times in the land of cotton and puts a new spotlight on the group's activities over the years. SAE officials insist the chant is neither a sanctioned song nor is it taught to fraternity members. This is believed to be a portrait of the original founding members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity in 1856 at the University of Alabama . Chappell Cook (bottom row, second from right) objected to the fraternity expanding North because he believed 'agitation' over slavery would make it impossible for 'harmony' Though the fraternity has its own fraught racial history. Members originally planned to keep the fraternity on in the South. When the question of 'Northern Expansion' was brought up, one charter member - later a Confederate army surgeon - said he didn't think heading north was wise because 'the constant agitation of the slavery question' would make getting along impossible. It is claimed that the fraternity did not invite a black member until 1966 - and it took one activist brother seven ballots and a threat to ban every other new pledge before the other brothers assented. In more recent years, fraternity chapters across the country have gotten into trouble over racial incidents - including a hip hop-themed 'Cripmas party' at Clemson University and an entire chapter being suspended at Washington University at St. Louis in 2013 over allegations of racial insensitivity. If there are any other chapters that use the song, 'we need to address that with those chapters and stop it immediately to stamp out this type of behavior,' said Sigma Alpha Epsilon spokesman Brandon Weghorst. The lyrics 'are so hateful and spiteful that it's embarrassing to think that Sigma Alpha Epsilon members would even know the chant or how it goes, if they've heard it.' The fraternity was also investigating reports of other SAE incidents that may have been tainted with racism, Weghorst said. Outed: Levi Pettit was identified by his family on Tuesday night. They apologized for his 'disgusting' behavior. Right, Pettit - an accomplished golfer at his former school Highland Park - is pictured putting in a 2013 photo . Parker Rice, a University of Oklahoma freshman from Dallas, has been identified as the conductor leading the 'there will never be a n***** in SEA' chant on Saturday . SAE began on the Tuscaloosa campus on March 9, 1856, a few months after Noble Leslie DeVotie outlined his vision to a close circle of friends during a stroll along the banks of the Black Warrior River. The initial members visualized 'a bond which would hold them together for all time,' William C. Levere wrote in a 1916 history of the fraternity. 'So it came about that in the late hours of a stormy night, the friends met in the old southern mansion and by the flicker of dripping candles organized Sigma Alpha Epsilon.' More chapters were soon launched in Tennessee, North Carolina and even Washington, D.C., at what is now George Washington University. But the founders weren't interested in a national presence. According to Levere, it was their intention 'to confine the fraternity to the southern states.' When a North Carolina chapter member raised the topic of a 'Northern Extension,' charter member Thomas Chappell Cook - who later served as a surgeon in the Confederate army - responded that 'the constant agitation of the slavery question was a barrier to northern chapters, as it would preclude the possibility of harmony.' The Civil War soon put an end to the internal debate. The fraternity's charter was surrendered in 1861 because of the fighting. The Washington City Rho chapter was the only one to emerge from the war intact. SAE would not return to its birthplace until 1886, after the Reconstruction-era ban on 'secret societies' was relaxed and the school's trustees, in the words of Levere, repealed 'its obnoxious anti-fraternity laws.' In the meantime, the fraternity had granted its first Northern charter in 1883 to, of all schools, Pennsylvania College — the abolitionist institution now known as Gettysburg College. The editors of the New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture call SAE 'the first Greek-letter society founded in Dixie to take permanent root ...' Even in those early years, the fraternity sought to prove that it's more than just a provincial organization. The international headquarters of Sigma Alpha Epsilon is seen in Evanston, Illinois. The organization re-located to Illinois after being founded in pre-Civil War Alabama . SAE was proud to claim President William McKinley as a member at Ohio's Mount Union College — even though it was an honorary initiation that came long after McKinley's college days. In December 1930, the fraternity dedicated its international headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Evanston. But, like other fraternities North and South, SAE had not yet embraced racial diversity. In his 2013 book, 'The People's Advocate,' attorney Daniel P. Sheehan claims credit for championing the bid of Tommy Williamson, who he wrote was 'the first black man to ever receive a nomination for membership in SAE in the entire history of that old, traditional southern fraternity.' According to Sheehan, he was social chairman of SAE's Harvard chapter in 1966. He and Williamson, a defensive lineman on the Crimson football team, both lived at Kirkland House, and Williamson's was the first name he called when it was time to vote for new members. On the first ballot, Sheehan said, Williamson received three 'blackballs,' or negative votes. Sheehan then announced he would blackball every other nominee until whoever had blocked Williamson 'fessed up and gave us their reasons,' he wrote. It took six more ballots for a member to admit that he was voting against Williamson because he'd heard that the Piedmont, California, native 'dated white women.' Sheehan said Williamson's nomination was approved on the seventh ballot. But when Sheehan told him how the vote had gone down, he wrote, Williamson declined the invitation. Reached by telephone Tuesday, Williamson, who practices employment law in Washington, D.C., told The Associated Press that he wasn't really all that interested in joining a fraternity, especially if some members didn't want him. This is the University of Alabama SAE house. The fraternity was founded on this campus - though forced to shut down after the Civil War . 'I didn't want to be the sort of obsessive token negro that, wherever you could be the first black person to do something, you would do that just because you thought white people thought that would help move their organization ahead,' he said. In a phone interview Tuesday, Sheehan, who practices constitutional law and teaches at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said of the Oklahoma video: 'That's pretty stunning, actually. I'm glad they shut that chapter down.' Brandon Weghorst, an SAE spokesman, was unable to say whether Williamson was indeed the first black man formally invited to join a chapter. 'Only within the last couple of years has the organization started to track the ethnicity of people who join the organization,' he said. SAE has had its share of controversy in more recent years. In 1988, the founding chapter was suspended again — this time for violations of the university's drug codes. The suspension was lifted two years later, only to be levied again in 1992 when the chapter failed to meet the goals outlined for reinstatement. Most of the actions taken against SAE in the past have been for infractions of a non-racial nature. But the University of Oklahoma video is not an isolated incident. Last year, SAE reached what it called 'a historic milestone' — becoming the first large national fraternity to eliminate the pledge process.

"Mesut Ozil will be carpeted by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger after being spotted in a Berlin nightclub just hours after missing the club’s game at Newcastle because he had a cold. The German international, the club’s £42.5million record signing, was left out of the match-day squad because he felt under the weather. And Wenger gave him permission to fly back to his homeland early to prepare for tomorrow’s friendly against Australia. But instead of nursing his illness he was pictured in a club on Saturday night. Mesut Ozil missed Arsenal's game against Newcastle before being reportedly spotted at a nightclub . Ozil joins Sami Khedira for a Germany training session in Frankfurt on Monday . His decision to go out partying leaves question marks over his omission from the squad to face John Carver's side on Saturday. And manager  Wenger will remind the club's record signing of his responsibilities in a face-to-face meeting when he returns from international duty following Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier in Georgia. Ozil would probably have travelled to Germany after the clash at St James’ Park anyway, but his actions after being allowed time off will leave Arsenal’s management unimpressed. Wenger rarely lets players who tarnish the club's reputation get away without, at the very least, a stern talking to. Germany coach Joachim Low (centre) watches training ahead of their games against Australia and Gerogia . Ozil appeared in high spirits during training but is likely to have to answer to Arsene Wenger on his return . Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was fined after being caught smoking in the dressing room following the New Year's Day loss at Southampton. Likewise, Wenger has warned midfielder Jack Wilshere over his conduct after he was twice photographed with a cigarette. After a mediocre start to his Arsenal career since joining from Real Madrid in 2013, Ozil is slowly starting to find his form. Despite being caught out over the weekend, Ozil is still likely to start against Liverpool after the international break.

"When it comes to judging players, there are not too many more qualified than Kaka. The 2007 Ballon d'Or winner and FIFA World Player of the Year, beating Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to the accolade that season, has selected the best eleven players he has played alongside or against for Sportsmail. It is a diverse mix of astonishing ability and experience from the different eras his career has spanned to date, from his humble beginnings at Sao Paulo in 2000 to joining MLS side Orlando City in 2014. Playing for AC Milan twice and Real Madrid in between has meant there are few of the planet's superstars of the past 15 years that he has not played for or against. In a team packed with stars, there is no place for Lionel Messi in his side. Here, in his own words, Kaka takes you through his best XI. Kaka (left), pictured in action against Houston Dynamo, has revealed his best XI exclusively to Sportsmail . Kaka has played for European giants AC Milan (left) and Real Madrid (right) during his distinguished career . Kaka, pictured celebrating a goal against Croatia at the 2006 World Cup, has also won 89 caps for Brazil . EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Oscar and Ozil tell me I should come to the Premier League but I'm so happy in Orlando . KAKA'S TOP FIVE GOALS: From a solo strike against Man United to a deflected free-kick for new side Orlando City . GOALKEEPER . Dida . I played with Iker Casillas for four years at Real Madrid, but for me Dida is the best goalkeeper. We played together and won together at AC Milan and for the Brazil national team. He is an unbelievable keeper. Goalkeeper Dida, pictured making a save at the 2006 World Cup, played with Kaka for Brazil and AC Milan . DEFENCE . Cafu . Every time I have to say something about players that I've learnt a lot from, I talk about Cafu. He won the World Cup twice and the Champions League, but still he worked every day to win. His motivation was always victory in the next game. Cafu, pictured kissing the 2002 World Cup in Japan, played for Brazil for 16 years before retiring in 2008 . Paolo Maldini . He is similar to Cafu. He won five Champions Leagues, he won Serie A seven times, he won so much, but he was always the first to arrive and the last to go home from training. He was the perfect example to a player. AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini (left) led the Serie A club to both domestic and European glory across 24 years . Alessandro Nesta . The Italian players, they see the game in a different way to other nations. They grow up learning about tactics so when they play professionally they can see where to position themselves and how to move and what the opponents will do. It made Nesta such a strong defender and he was so quick, too. Alessandro Nesta (left) tussles with Liverpool's Dirk Kuyt during the 2007 Champions League final in Athens . Roberto Carlos . What an amazing player he was. So exciting at left back. I enjoyed playing with him. He was quick, strong and could hit some unbelievable free kicks and shots at goal. Roberto Carlos (left) became one of the world's finest full backs with Real Madrid and Brazil . MIDFIELD . Andres Iniesta . He makes the toughest things on a football pitch look easy. That's the biggest compliment I can pay him. How he plays, everything seems so simple. This is what I like about him. Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta brings the ball forward during Sunday's clash with Real Madrid . Zinedine Zidane . I never played with Zidane, just against him. It was wonderful how he played, how he moved around the field. It was like he was gliding. What he could do with a football, it was sometimes impossible to imagine. Zinedine Zidane (centre), pictured in action in 2005, is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time . Andrea Pirlo . I loved to play with Pirlo. I think he's one of the greats. He sees the action before anyone else does on the pitch. My position was to play behind the lines, and he found me every time he could find me. Andrea Pirlo, pictured playing for Juventus this season, starred alongside Kaka at AC Milan . ATTACK . Cristiano Ronaldo . I will have the three Ronaldo's up front, starting with Cristiano. I learnt a lot from him, which helped in my career, when we played for Real Madrid. He is the best player on the planet at the moment, a special player. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates scoring for Real Madrid in Sunday night's El Clasico at the Nou Camp . Ronaldo . For me, the Brazilian Ronaldo is one of the best strikers in the history of the game. He is different to anyone. I would have to say he was the best player I played together with. His speed, his dribbling, his finishing, his movement. I love him. Kaka counts Ronaldo, pictured in action at the 2006 World Cup, as the best player he has ever played with . Ronaldinho . I played against Lionel Messi, but Ronaldinho makes my final slot. He is a genius. He can do things with the ball you don't understand. During training you see a lot of things you don't see in the game. In training he was free from the emotional part, the responsibility of matches. In training he was free to do what he wanted. Kaka has described his former Brazil and AC Milan team-mate Ronaldinho as a 'genius' with the ball .","Kaka has picked his best XI of players he has played with and against .

"A Texas lawyer has come forward claiming he is responsible for plastering stickers that read 'Exclusively For White People' onto business storefronts last week. Adam Reposa, 40, a criminal defense attorney explained why he put up the stickers in a video posted on Thursday, titled Why I did it. A shirtless Reposa is seen saying it would be obvious that even though people know the real problem, which is that 'people without money are getting pretty f***ed, they are getting pushed out and pretty quick this area of town is turning into whites only'. Scroll down for video . Adam Reposa, 40, a criminal defense attorney explained why he put up the stickers in a video posted on Thursday, titled Why I did it (above Reposa in his video) These stickers appeared last week between Tuesday and Wednesday on the storefronts of at least six Austin, Texas businesses . While it appears Reposa is claiming gentrification as his defense, Austin NAACP president said the issues in the community run deeper and Reposa's actions add to the problems, according to KVUE. Nelson Linder said: 'It's repugnant and also alarming, and also indicative of a mentality that doesn't understand race relations. 'So if you're trying to help race relations, you just did the worst thing you could possibly do.' A shirtless Reposa is seen saying it would be obvious that even though people know the real problem, which is that 'people without money are getting pretty f***ed, they are getting pushed out and pretty quick this area of town is turning into whites only' He said: 'Everyone is going to jump on ""that's racist, that's racist"", man this town and the way s*** works is racist . On Wednesday, a picture of the sticker on a local business surfaced on Facebook causing outrage after at least six businesses were left with the seals. Each one read in its entirety: 'Exclusively For White People. Maximum of five colored customers. Colored BOH (back of the house) staff accepted. Sponsored by the City of Austin Contemporary Partition and Restoration Program.' Reposa said he is not worried about offending people or stirring up racial tension. 'I've seen nothing but the emotional attachment that human beings place on events in history,' he said. 'It's regrettable and unfortunate and as soon as we can step beyond that precious of mawkish emotionality and just look at the real facts like human beings, is the moment that we have the chance for real progress.' In the video, Reposa said that everyone attacked the stickers saying 'it's racist' but did not consider the 'condition of the way things are'. While it appears Reposa is claiming gentrification as his defense, Austin NAACP president said the issues in the community run deeper and Reposa's actions add to the problems . Reposa said he is not worried about offending people or stirring up racial tension .

'But I knew I could bait all of y'all into being as stupid as you are and allowing the issue to be framed of the in the most simple way. ""Oh he said an offensive term, let's not worry about the actually condition of the way things are, let's worry about an offensive term"". 'And that's how they got it, they got it sewed up and they got this poor girl coming out here saying ""it hurt my feelings"", man who cares about your feelings man. Seriously? 'Are y'all gonna get pulled around like that y'alls' entire lives, or y'all just gonna stop givin a f***? I don't give a f*** and look at me. 'I use the technology every day to create possibilities. Apply the technology in your life and stop worrying about getting snitched on because it don't make a f*** what I did because I'm gonna do it again, I don't give a f***.' The 'technology' that Reposa references in the video is linked to a Facebook page that reads: 'Taking human beings out of a false sense of belief and into the darkness by removing any meaning attached to any event in life.' Reposa also wrote a sarcastic post on his personal page saying that he was not aware highlighting institutional racism was 'so repugnant'. It was reported that he said the full story would be revealed in a press conference on Friday . On the page he explains that the result of the 'The Technology' is that people 'who give a f*** passionately express their beliefs'. He also wrote a sarcastic post on his personal page saying that he was not aware highlighting institutional racism was 'so repugnant'. He wrote: 'My f***ing bad y'all.

However, Austin Mayor Steve Adler spoke out making it clear his city had absolutely nothing to do with the stickers. Video from KEYE-TV . The stickers said they were sponsored by Austin's 'Contemporary Partition and Restoration Program' along with an official-looking city seal, which led the mayor to condemn the confusing prank. Austin Mayor Steve (right) Adler spoke out making it clear his city had absolutely nothing to do with the stickers . 'This is an appalling and offensive display of ignorance in our city. Austin condemns this type of hurtful behavior. Our city is a place where respect for all people is a part of our spirit and soul. We will keep it that way,' Adler said in a statement. 'Some jokes are not funny,' Texas House of Representatives member Dawnna Duke wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday along with a photo of a sticker affixed to clothing store Rare Trends. 'If this is a joke at all, it is tasteless...I will be damned if this will occur in my House District … in this historical black community or any community.' Regardless of its intent, Sugar Mama's employees labeled it a hate crime. 'Today we were the victim of what I consider to be a hate crime against our family and staff at our Eastside location,' reads a post on the bakery's Instagram feed from last week. 'Our business was built on family and love and we will let that shine on.' Reposa told the Huffington Post on Sunday that the full story  would be released in a press conference on Friday.

"Daniel Sturridge has pulled out of the England squad as his injury curse struck yet again and problems threatened to mount for manager Roy Hodgson. Sturridge reported for duty at St George's Park on Monday but did not train and had a scan in the evening which revealed a thigh problem which he sustained against Manchester United on Sunday. The 25-year-old striker returned home on Monday night, the second Liverpool player to withdraw from international duty on the day, Adam Lallana was also forced out with a groin injury and was replaced by uncapped Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason. Daniel Sturridge has been ruled out of England's double header with Lithuania and Italy . The Liverpool striker picked up a hip injury in Sunday's defeat by Manchester United . Goalkeepers . Jack Butland, Robert Green, Joe Hart . Defenders . Danny Rose, Chris Smalling, Kyle Walker, Nathaniel Clyne, Phil Jones, Kieran Gibbs, Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka, Gary Cahill. Midfielders . Michael Carrick, Theo Walcott, Ross Barkley, Fabian Delph, Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Raheem Sterling, Ryan Mason, Andros Townsend . Forwards . Danny Welbeck, Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane . They will miss a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday and a friendly against Italy in Turin on Tuesday. A FA statement said: 'Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has left the England squad and returned home to his club on Monday evening. 'This follows a scan on an injury that he sustained during Liverpool's game against Manchester United on Sunday. 'The England medical team took the decision on Monday evening having assessed Daniel following the squad's arrival at St. George's Park on Monday afternoon.' For Sturridge it is the latest in a sequence of fitness issues this season. He was Hodgson's first-choice centre-forward at the World Cup last summer but missed five months of this season after pulling a thigh muscle during an England training session in September. There was a blaze of controversy about whether he should have been resting or training on that particular day, followed by complications in his recovery process, none of which helped the relationship between club and country. Sturridge then suffered with calf muscle injuries and was just getting back to his sharpest form when he hobbled out of Anfield with a stiff hip after scoring Liverpool's goal in a 2-1 defeat against Manchester United. He will have missed seven England games since his last international appearance against Norway in September. Sturridge has not played for England since the autumn because of injury . Harry Kane could be in line to make his debut for England against Lithuania . August 2012 - Toe injury . February 2013- Thigh injury . September 2013 - Thigh injury . September 2014 - Thigh injury . October 2014 - Thigh injury . Sturridge and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, however, will be wary of taking risks after a campaign already ruined by injuries and with the Anfield club locked in a fight for a top-four finish. Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck are available for Hodgson but Sturridge's exit boost Kane's chances of making his senior debut against Lithuania on Friday. There may also be the chance of a call-up for QPR's Charlie Austin, or promotion from the Under 21s for Burnley's Danny Ings. Kane, 21, is in the midst of a remarkable season and took his goal tally to 29 with a hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday, but a club-v-country issue is brewing around him because England want him for the European U21 Championships, in June, while Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino thinks he needs a month of complete rest at the end of the season. England are set to train at Tottenham on Thursday and Pochettino plans to be on site. Raheem Sterling arrived at St George's Park nursing a toe injury which may limit his involvement over the two England games – he is one of the players who may be released after the Lithuania qualifier. Fabian Delph was also missing from the camp on Monday. Aston Villa midfielder Delph was ill and stayed at home but hopes to join the squad later this week. Luke Shaw and Fraser Forster were in Hodgson's original squad but pulled out with injuries, prompting call-ups for Danny Rose and Robert Green. Another important Liverpool player, goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, is doubtful for Belgium after picking an ankle injury in a collision with Rooney on Sunday.","Daniel Sturridge returned home on Monday night because of hip injury .

But it seems the first major hurdle facing the British comedian is whether some Americans even recognize him. A spoof video released by CBS ahead of his first appearance on The Late Late Show on Monday depicts the funnyman trying to get back into the studios - but a security guard refuses. The employee asks for Corden for an identification badge, but Corden is forced to explain he has just got back from lunch, while patting down his pockets. 'I can't let you in without a badge,' the guard adds. A frustrated Corden then starts arguing with the man, saying he is the host of the chat show and points to a huge poster of his face on the side of the building. The guard looks around, but he says: 'I don't see the resemblance'. 'What do you mean there is no resemblance?' Corden replies. 'It looks exactly the same as me. Do you know why? Because it is me' The employee then realizes who he is talking to, but insists Corden still needs a badge to get in. Reaching boiling point, Corden tries to muscle his way past the guard, but he gives up, throws his hands up in the air and says: 'I'm calling the building.'

"With just over a month to go until the mega fight between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather, legendary trainer Nacho Beristain believes that 'Pac-Man' has a chance of winning - and gives him a 45 per cent chance. Juan Manuel Marquez's trainer is a fan of the hard-hitting Filipino and likes his intelligence, hand speed and ability to throw combinations.

'On paper who looks the best is Mayweather,' Beristain added. 'The knockout by Juan Manuel of Manny [in 2012]. But Pacquiao has many things in its favour – the speed, and being a smart fighter.

"Even if all it amounts to is a handful of visits to England's training camp to spend a few hours observing the players and offering some pointers, the prospect of Jonny Wilkinson being involved with the national team is an enticing one. Nothing is certain at this stage, but it is not out of the question that the iconic fly-half will agree to give his input as Stuart Lancaster's squad prepare for the World Cup. If the 35-year-old hero of the 2003 triumph does take on a role of sorts — and that would appear to be a big if — it wouldn't be as a coach and it might not even amount to a consultancy, certainly not on a regular basis. Jonny Wilkinson could lend his expertise to England's 2015 rugby World Cup preperations . Wilkinson, who was a fly-half, kicked the winning drop goal to lead England to World Cup glory in 2003 . Wilkinson has been getting involved with rugby coaching and could aid England's World Cup preparations . England coach Stuart Lancaster would not ignore the opportunity to use Wilkinson's know-how . But most England supporters would settle for Wilkinson popping into the HQ in Surrey on his way to the supermarket, if there was any chance of some of that stardust and winner's mentality rubbing off on the class of 2015. It is all about the aura. Here is a man who was once the nation's sporting darling, while in rugby circles he is treated with a mixture of respect and awe. In the south of France, where he worked wonders for Toulon in the closing years of his career, he is adored. When false rumours surfaced at the start of the year that he was destined for a knighthood, they were assumed to be correct. Such an honour would have surprised no one. The current generation of England players grew up admiring his epic deeds. The fly-halves in particular — George Ford, Owen Farrell and Danny Cipriani — could learn so much from the maestro. Stuart Lancaster has an established coaching group and there are no plans to expand it, for now. At present, Mike Catt works with the kickers in camp, while another RFU coach, Jon Callard, has also spent time with them, though less so recently. Ford has private sessions with Wilkinson's kicking mentor, the renowned Dave Alred, who has not had a role in the national set-up since the last World Cup. But any chance to tap into the know-how of one of the country's all-time greats, with his legendary work ethic and meticulous approach, would not be casually ignored by Lancaster. Wilkinson has spoken of his interest in the option of working as a specialist coach or tutor, and has done so part-time with Toulon this season. Wilkinson (centre) is revered in Toulon, where he spent the final years of his career as a player . Lancaster already has one 2003 World Cup winner in his coaching ranks in Mike Catt (centre) Wilkinson's input could help England's current fly-halfs such as George Ford . Danny Cipriani (left) and Owen Farrell are England's other alternatives at fly-half . For all his personal accomplishments, he is wise enough to accept that playing pedigree does not necessarily translate into coaching credentials. Talking last autumn, after being invited into England's camp, he said: 'If there is anything I can add, then we can have a little chat, but more importantly I need to learn my trade. I was a player, but just because I knew how to play doesn't mean I've earned the right to tell other people how to do it. 'I'm coaching one week every month in Toulon, learning my way around it. I'm coaching individual skills, mentoring some of the young guys on how to cope with the emotional and mental side of things. I'm really enjoying it, but the biggest mistake you can make is thinking just because you played the game, you already know it.' As a recent retiree who keeps himself supremely fit, Wilkinson could comfortably take on an active role, demonstrating the points he makes. In fact, it would not be a leap of the mind to imagine him matching England's current kickers shot for shot in extended practice sessions. While there is scope to improve the kicking game, both at goal and tactical, Wilkinson is a big admirer of the men currently country's vying for his old shirt. Wilkinson (left) acknowledges that success as a player offers no guarantees to becoming a skilled coach . Lancaster (left) and his England side narrowly missed out on Six Nations glory on Saturday . Wilkinson speaks highly of the abilities of England's current fly-halfs, especially Ford and Farrell . 'George Ford is a fabulous player who produces some amazing touches and is an absolute natural in the way he reads the game,' he said. 'He works hard, wants to improve and as a young guy he is happy to take on responsibility and shows he can deal with it. That makes him a great person to have in that position. 'Owen Farrell is immensely mentally tough and deserves a hell of a lot more credit than he has been getting for what he has done in the last few years. As a young guy, he has said, 'Here is pressure, I will deal with it. Not only that, I will kick your goals for you and stand up in defence and bring this team together'. That is brilliant.' That talented pair would speak highly of their acclaimed predecessor too. It could be a perfect fit. England have the biggest representation on a 12-strong list for the RBS 6 Nations player of the tournament. Jonathan Joseph, George Ford, Ben Youngs and Billy Vunipola feature alongside Ireland's Paul O'Connell, Robbie Henshaw and Conor Murray, Welshmen Alun Wyn Jones and Dan Biggar, Scots Stuart Hogg and Jonny Gray, and Italy captain Sergio Parisse.","Jonny Wilkinson could help England's 2015 World Cup preparations .

"No audience with Louis van Gaal is complete without a mention of the Dutchman’s ‘philo-sophy’. He talked about it on his first day at Old Trafford and was still talking about it in the build-up to Manchester United’s win over Liverpool on Sunday. ‘It takes time,’ he said. ‘In Germany (at Bayern Munich), it took until December. And now (with United) until March.’ There were signs all over the pitch at Anfield that his players are finally getting the message. It was without doubt their best performance under Van Gaal: ‘One of the most important moments in my career,’ he later acknowledged. Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata stole the show at Anfield as he netted a brace against Liverpool . Mata (left) and fellow countryman Ander Herrera (right) impressed against United's arch-rivals . David de Gea uploaded a dressing room photograph of Manchester United's post-match celebrations . United are currently fourth in the Premier League . The 63-year-old is ruthless in his pursuit of what he wants. No-one is exempt, and it was significant that Juan Mata and Ander Herrera, two of United’s best performers in the 2-1 win over their bitter rivals, have been made to sit on the sidelines for lengthy spells this season. Two-goal hero Mata only returned against Tottenham in the previous game after a two-month absence from Van Gaal’s starting line-up in the Premier League. His position at Anfield, described by Van Gaal as a ‘false right winger’, demonstrated once again how the manager places his team’s needs above an individual’s preference. And Herrera spoke candidly on Monday about how upsetting Van Gaal contributed to him making just six league starts in his first six months at Old Trafford following a £29million move from Bilbao. ‘I keep my distance with Van Gaal, but he’s a good guy with a strong character,’ said Herrera, who was not seen for more than a month after being hooked at half-time against West Brom in October. Manchester United's first team stars finally appear to be buying in Louis van Gaal's philosophy . Mata was given a free role against Liverpool  in December (left) but performed admirably as a 'false winger' at Anfield on Sunday (right) ‘He likes discipline and does not believe in egos in the dressing room. Everybody is equal under his rule. He talks about what he wants from me. At the start he used to tell me off because I always looked for the ball. I always wanted to have it, and no, I must wait. ‘He loves possession and he doesn’t like being at risk of losing the ball. He wants long stretches of possession. He believes spaces are created that way because the team has the quality to find them.’ There have been many times in Van Gaal’s first season in England when his philosophy has not been altogether clear; when the constant chopping and changing of formation and shuffling of a rather expensive pack of players has left fans scratching their heads. Nor are United close to being the finished article. An eight-point deficit on Chelsea is evidence of that, and they are still far from certain to achieve their target of Champions League qualification despite Sunday’s win opening up a five-point advantage over Liverpool. But something seems to have clicked in the wins against Spurs and Liverpool, just when the FA Cup defeat by Arsenal looked to have raised major concerns over the club’s direction under Van Gaal. Players who privately have questioned his methods look more comfortable, although Liverpool’s alarmingly lacklustre display at Anfield helped in that respect. Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has been in impressive form since his return from injury . Marouane Fellaini, pictured with Van Gaal, is showing his best form since joining United in September 2013 . Michael Carrick’s return to anchor the midfield has been an important factor, so too Marouane Fellaini’s advanced role, which has given United’s attack a new dimension. Even Chris Smalling and Phil Jones, United’s much-maligned England centre backs, look solid after being thrown back together by Marcos Rojo’s groin injury and Jonny Evans’s ban for spitting at Newcastle’s Papiss Cisse. Surprisingly, Jones and Smalling have only started as a central defensive pairing on five occasions in the league, not including four games together as part of Van Gaal’s unpopular back three. And Jones admitted that the expectations raised by succeeding Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic have not made it easy for them. ‘It has been difficult,’ he said. ‘It was well documented that me and Chris were going to be the next centre backs at United but it has not gone how we would have liked. ‘You cannot build a partnership on four games. Hopefully now we have had back-to-back games together we can keep it going. We complement each other well.’ Phil Jones (centre) has admitted he has struggled to fill the boots left by Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic . It was also notable that United’s best 45 minutes of the season, according to Van Gaal, came with Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao on the bench. Both came on to play their part in the victory and it was a reminder of the resources at his disposal, as well as the issues that still need to be ironed out in the remaining months of the season. ‘Those boys are top players but we have a number of players who the manager can choose from, which is great,’ said Carrick. ‘Different games throw up different scenarios and different systems maybe, but the last two games have gone very well for us.’ There is still room for improvement, but it appears Van Gaal’s philosophy is beginning to sink in.","Juan Mata starred in Manchester United's 2-1 win against Liverpool .

Liverpool had opened the scoring when Fernandinho sold Kompany short and Philippe Coutinho nipped in before Jordan Henderson struck from long-range. A source told the paper team-mates feared the pair would come to blows after Fernandinho criticised his captain for his part in the goal. Kompany is said to have reacted furiously before Pellegrini told the Belgium centre-half that he should listen to his team-mate.

Brazilian Fernandinho, a £34m signing from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, was left out of the squad altogether. Manchester City declined to comment on the incident. However, they are understood to be happy that there is no lingering animosity, believe the row was over as quickly as it started and are of the opinion that it was similar to disagreements that happen on a regular basis in dressing rooms across the country. They are also keen to point out that it had nothing to do with Kompany not playing the next game.

This was not the most beautiful goal, it was a heavily deflected free kick, but it is special for me because it was Orlando City’s first ever goal. When I signed for the newly-formed MLS side I really wanted to score their first goal. We were losing by a goal, in their MLS debut game, and the match was in stoppage time, but I hit a 25-yard free kick to the goalkeepers’s right a it took a huge deflection and went into the left of goal. The stadium was full of 63,000 fans practically all from Orlando. The reaction was incredible. Kaka scores his first goal for Orlando City (left) and runs off to celebrate at the Citrus Bowl (right) 4) AC Milan 3-1 Fenerbahce, Champions League group stage at the San Siro, September 2005 . The game was poised at 1-1 and there were only four minutes remaining of the match. I received the ball from Massimo Ambrosini 10 yards inside their half on the left as we broke from our own penalty area. I just kept running with the ball past one player, then another, then one more on the edge of the Fenerbahce box before finishing low under Volkan Demirel. Kaka is congratulated by his team-mate Andriy Shevchenko after scoring a brilliant goal against Fenerbahce . 3) Brazil 4-1 Argentina, Confederations Cup final at the Waldstadion, June 2005 . Cicinho switched the ball from the right side of the pitch to Robinho on the left. He controlled it with his chest and passed to me on the edge of the box. I took one touch to tame the ball then curled a shot into the top right corner. To do it in a Confederations Cup final was special. Kaka bends the ball into the top corner to help Brazil to a convincing win against rivals Argentina in 2005 . 2) Brazil 3-0 Argentina, friendly at The Emirates Stadium, September 2006 . It was late in the game and the ball came out from an Argentina corner. I managed to steal the ball from Lionel Messi and started running at full speed with the ball. He chased me all the way, but I kept ahead of him, ran past Gabriel Milito then finished low past Roberto Abbondanzieri. Pablo Zabaleta couldn’t stop it going over the line, however hard he tried.

"Manchester United have finally been given the go-ahead to close in on Mats Hummels and install him as their new defensive lynchpin at the end of the season. Sportsmail understands that, after years of staying loyal to Borussia Dortmund and resisting overtures from United, the Germany centre-back has decided he's ready to cut his ties with the fallen Bundesliga giants and move on. He is fully aware of continuing interest from Old Trafford and is believed to have set his sights on becoming the latest big-name addition to an expensive United refit under Louis Van Gaal.

The Dortmund defender clears a ball off the line during Saturday's 3-2 Bundesliga win over Hannover . Hummels looks on dejectedly as Juventus knock Dortmund out of the Champions League last 16 .

The one stumbling block could be the asking price, with Dortmund willing to grant Hummels' wish, but only on their terms. They want £36million for the 26-year old and are reluctant to accept less. Van Gaal is unlikely to be deterred, though, and will urge club bosses to open talks in an attempt to agree a valuation for a defender who has the experience and know-how United need at the back. The pursuit of Dortmund skipped Hummels dates back to the 2011-12 season, when Sir Alex Ferguson attended the German Cup final to watch Jurgen Klopp's side crush Bayern Munich 5-2. It completed an historic league and cup double for Dortmund and led to Ferguson launching a bold bid to lure Hummels, Robert Lewandowski and Shinji Kagawa away from the Westfalenstadion. Louis van Gaal needs defensive reinforcements at Old Trafford but may be forced to stump up £36m . Jurgen Klopp's side have struggled this season, spending part of the campaign in the relegation spots . Repeated approaches for Hummels always met with stubborn resistance from Dortmund, but they have been forced to back down after their cultured defender indicated he was unhappy with their fall from grace this season. A sharp decline in fortunes briefly left them embroiled in a relegation battle, and though an overdue revival steadied the ship, there still seems little prospect of Champions' League football next season.. Hummels feels he has remained loyal long enough and is hoping United's negotiators can come up with a package that will smooth the way for his long-awaited arrival at Old Trafford.

"Neymar was back in training with the Brazil national team less than 24hours after playing in Barcelona's 'El Clasico' defeat over  Real Madrid on Sunday. The Catalans opened up a four-point lead over their arch rivals at the top of La Liga following Sunday's 2-1 victory at the Nou Camp. While former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez stole the headlines with his winning goal, Neymar cut a more subdued figure - missing an early opportunity that led to Madrid breaking away and equalising through Cristiano Ronaldo.

The Selecao have travelled to France to play an international friendly against the former World Cup winner on Thursday with Neymar expected to play a leading role at the Stade de France just outside Paris. The 23-year-old, who has scored 42 goals in 60 appearances for Brazil, joined teammates including PSG captain Thiago Silva and Chelsea threesome Oscar, Felipe Luiz and Willian at the Charlety Stadium for a training session.

"Kyle Walker has admitted he is a clean freak, who drives his girlfriend crazy, and is addicted to collecting trainers. The Tottenham full-back returns to Roy Hodgson's England fold for the first time this week since his nine-month injury nightmare. Walker, 24, last played for the Three Lions in November 2013 in the 1-0 defeat at Wembley by Germany. Kyle Walker poses on the street and with his two dogs ahead of his return to the England squad . The Tottenham defender  has admitted being a clean freak and having a trainer fetish . The 24-year-old admits driving model girlfriend Annie Kilner 'insane' with his obsessions . An abdominal problem forced him to painfully miss last summer's World Cup in Brazil. But having returned to action last December for Spurs, Walker is buzzing to be back as he pushes for a start in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania. 'I have had a lot of tests in my career so far,' said Walker, who has been capped 10-times for his country to date. 'I think obviously being injured and missing the World Cup was tough. Not being able to play for my country in Brazil was a big kick in the teeth. 'In football you're going to have a lot of ups and downs, but you need to stay mentally strong and you need to stay focused. You need to know you're a professional and you've got a job to do. 'It’s not a one-man game. It's 10 other players on the pitch that everyone must rely on to get the three points you’re striving for throughout the week.'

Walker is set to return for England, having last played in a friendly against Germany in November 2013 . The right-back is back in the Tottenham first team after a nine-month spell on the sidelines through injury . Away from the pitch, the former Sheffield United right-back revealed he enjoys playing golf with his mates. But it is rather is obsession for cleanliness that drives his model girlfriend Annie Kilner crazy. 'I like things to be clean,' he said, speaking to a Nike Q&A as part of the American brand's launch of Air Max Day. 'I don't like mess. My missus will probably tell you that I drive her insane with all my cleanliness. 'It’s probably why I've got 20 packs of baby wipes in a cupboard down there just so when I come into my sneaker closet, I can keep them clean and fresh.' Walker blames his other obsession - trainers - on his Mum, however. 'I've always had a trainer fetish,' he added. It was flip-flops, not trainers, when Walker and Annie holidayed in Barbados in summer 2013 . And the couple hit the sea on a jet ski during the same holiday . Despite England's woeful performance, Walker says missing the 2014 World Cup was 'a kick in the teeth' 'That's just my thing. I think I caught it from my mum, because I know my mum does like shoes. So I think I've caught it off her, but I think I've kind of overtook her now, definitely. 'How many pairs have I got? Oh, I don't know. I couldn't tell you. Maybe 150 or so. 'I know I've got some in the garage that I still haven't unpacked, because obviously I've just moved to this new house. So I'd say I've got quite a bit. And you know what? I think mum has actually got a full bedroom of them at home.'

"Former NFL star Darren Sharper has been sentenced to nine years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a woman in Arizona. Sharper on Monday admitted to charges of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault arising from the 2013 Arizona case. He appeared in the Phoenix courtroom by video-conferencing from Los Angeles. Former NFL star Darren Sharper has been sentenced to nine years in prison after pleading guilty . Sharper admitted to charges of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault arising from the 2013  case . Sharper also is expected to change his plea in person in Los Angeles on similar allegations. Similar hearings will follow in Las Vegas this week and in New Orleans in April. The Arizona and California cases, combined with others in Nevada and Louisiana, are likely to lead to a long prison sentence. In each state, Sharper was accused of drugging and sexually assaulting women when they were unconscious or otherwise unable to resist or consent. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Warren Granville said Sharper will serve his time in federal custody and that the Louisiana case will be resolved through a federal court. In Arizona, Sharper admitted sexually assaulting one victim, though police say he drugged and sexually assaulted three women, at an apartment in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe in November. The 39-year-old was part of the New Orleans Saints side which won the NFL Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 . Authorities say a search of the Tempe apartment turned up a shot glass with a white residue that turned out to be zolpidem, and California investigators discovered that Sharper had a prescription for the drug. Last year, Sharper's attorneys said their client did not make the drinks that authorities say he used to drug the women. One of the women told police she hadn't had any alcohol that night until Sharper insisted she drink a shot. Another young woman said she had been drugged, then went to bed, locked her door and wasn't attacked. The next day, one of the women confronted Sharper, who denied wrongdoing, according to the reports. The reports said Sharper was in Arizona to visit a woman who lived at the apartment. The two had met about a year earlier in Las Vegas. Sharper is a former defensive back for the New Orleans Saints and other teams.","Darren Sharper has admitted to charges of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault arising from the 2013 Arizona case .

"During a hectic week in San Sebastian, David Moyes is engrossed in all things Spanish. Whether it’s watching Real Sociedad’s next La Liga opponents on DVD, learning the language with his demanding tutor or sampling another tasty Basque speciality dish from the atmospheric pintxos bars, Moyes can’t escape it. But he does like to switch off now and again and turn his attention to the Scotland national team. He will watch Gordon Strachan’s side on the television this week as they play Northern Ireland and then the Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar. Moyes has been a manager at the highest level for more than a decade with Manchester United, Everton and now La Real, and he understands the scrutiny and intensity fellow bosses face from boardrooms, fans and media. Real Sociedad manager David Moyes has been impressed with Scotland boss Gordon Strachan . Strachan, pictured in November, is preparing his side for their match against Northern Ireland . That is why he has nothing but admiration for the job Strachan is doing. The national team sit in a decent position in Group D, in third place with seven points from four games. The weekend’s fixture should be comfortable. Moyes hopes so and believes Strachan and his players have the determination and ability to be at the party in 2016. ‘Gordon is doing a fabulous job. He has everybody believing again but it’s good that there is a measured amount of optimism and nobody in the country has any stupid levels of expectation,’ Moyes told Sportsmail. ‘We’ve had unrealistic ambitions in years gone by and it hasn’t done us any favours. ‘There is belief, and rightly so. I think we are introducing more and more young players and they have taken to it very well. ‘The more experienced players are maturing nicely and the fact a few of them have Champions League experience certainly helps. ‘All things considered, Gordon is doing a quite brilliant job. The 1-0 win against Republic of Ireland was an important victory. Gordon will want to kick on and make sure there is a win on Sunday. Darren Fletcher (far left) impressed Moyes during their time together at Manchester United . Moyes (left) worked with Fletcher (right) during his brief stint as the manager of the Manchester United . ‘But he doesn’t have a magic wand. It’s difficult being a national manager because you can’t buy a new centre half or a new left back, you have to work with what you’ve got. That means you have to get the very best out of the players, try to improve them in order to maximise their standards when they play. ‘I’m not going to add to the pressure by saying I expect Scotland to qualify. What I will say is that I hope they do. ‘We last reached a Finals 17 years ago and I was in France to support them. I was manager of Preston and also used it as an opportunity to enhance my knowledge by taking in games and sessions. ‘If we qualify for 2016, I will be there again.’ Moyes hopes two of his former players — Darren Fletcher and Steven Naismith — continue their good work at this level. Moyes signed Naismith for Everton after Rangers went into liquidation and the player exercised his right to leave for no fee. It was a no-brainer to sign him under such circumstances. The versatile star is now valued in excess of £8million. Moyes is delighted Fletcher is back in the international fold after successfully battling a chronic bowel disease. He worked with the midfielder at Old Trafford and has huge respect for him. Moyes signed Scotland international Steven Naismith for £8million from Rangers back in July 2012 . When Moyes lost his job at United in April of last year, Fletcher was one of the first on the phone to text offering sympathy and expressing regret at the way it all worked out. ‘Darren is a superb person and a great footballer,’ Moyes said. ‘I had the pleasure of working with him and he was an even better player than I thought. He was great in the dressing room, trustworthy and had the best interests of the club at heart. ‘His health problems were well documented but he never once complained. I hold Darren in high regard. I’m delighted he is relishing the responsibility of captaining West Brom. ‘Stevie Naismith is a good lad. He really has come on leaps and bounds at Everton. ‘It was always going to be difficult for him in his first year when he came from Rangers. But he has listened and developed into an important member of the Everton team because he can play a number of different roles. ‘Gordon will be pleased to have guys such as Darren and Stevie. ‘They are excellent senior professionals and the perfect examples for the new arrivals to learn from.’ Real Sociedad boss Moyes masterminded a 1-0 win over Barcelona at the beginning of January . There is genuine feeling for the Scotland set-up from Moyes. Spending a few days in his company in San Sebastian made that clear. He and his assistant, Billy McKinlay, love nothing more than chewing the fat over issues in the game back home. They have lifted La Real into the top half of La Liga with excellent results, including a 1-0 win over Barcelona. Sunday night’s 3-1 victory against Cordoba was their third win on the bounce and only an almighty collapse in their remaining 10 games would see them relegated. The remit for Moyes when he took over in mid-November was to avoid the drop at all costs. They were fifth from bottom at that stage. He is enjoying the challenge and is contracted until the summer of 2016. He would like to return to the UK at some stage and is currently the bookies’ favourite to take over from Sam Allardyce at West Ham United, but he is in no rush to leave Spain. He said: ‘I’m enjoying life here and have really tried to make an effort to adapt to the culture. ‘It’s very pleasant and everyone has been warm and courteous. ‘Billy and I both sense that the people really want us to do well. We’re trying to make them happy. ‘This is a big club and I can improve myself as a coach by being here. ‘This job also helped me get over the disappointment of what happened at Manchester United. I felt this was as good a place as any to do just that. ‘To come to La Real and work in La Liga has absolutely been the right decision.’","David Moyes has been impressed with Scotland manager Gordon Strachan .

"Aaron Ramsey believes Arsenal can use the 3-0 win over West Ham as a template to produce the same result in Monaco next week and keep their Champions League hopes alive. The Gunners eventually saw off the challenge of the Irons, who suffered a third straight Barclays Premier League defeat, to move within a point of second-placed Manchester City with what was a eighth win out of the last nine. There is, however, little time for Arsene Wenger's men to recover before they must again raise themselves for the trip to Monaco and the quest to overturn a 3-1 first-leg deficit which has left their Europeans dreams hanging by a thread.

Ramsey hopes his side can take confidence from the game into the Champions League . CLICK HERE to read the full match report . Ramsey, who scored Arsenal's second goal on 84 minutes before substitute Mathieu Flamini tapped in a third moments after coming on, feels a similar positive approach can see them pull of an unlikely result at the Stade Louis II Stadium. 'We will go there and try to score three or more goals and hopefully not concede any, that is our target and is how we will approach it,' the Welshman said. 'We had a sloppy first leg and we have made it quite difficult for ourselves, but it is not over yet. Olivier Giroud has rediscovered his goal scoring form after missing chances against Monaco . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger watches on knowing his side will face a stiffer test in Europe . 'We are more than capable of scoring three goals. We scored three on Saturday and we believe in ourselves. 'So we will go into the game believing we can achieve that.' After seeing Theo Walcott, recalled into the starting XI for the injured Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, thwarted by some good reactions from West Ham goalkeeper Adrian - who played despite suffering a dislocated finger in the warm-up - Olivier Giroud eventually fired Arsenal into the lead on the stroke of half-time with a fierce left-footed shot drilled in off the far post. West Ham raised their game for the second half, but were unable to convert that dominance into a goal. Alexis Sanchez looks dejected as Monaco tie up a 3-1 first leg lead at the Emirates .

"FA chairman Greg Dyke challenged more clubs to grow their own Harry Kane as he unveiled his new quota proposals designed to boost the numbers of elite English footballers. Dyke wants to change the rules until nearly half of each 25-man squad in the Barclays Premier League is 'Home Grown' under his stricter definition of what makes a 'Home Grown' player. Together with new Home Office rules on work permits for non-EU footballers, agreed with the FA and set to be introduced in May, he believes this can increase the ratio of English players in the Premier League from 35 to over 40 per cent and produce an England team to win the World Cup in 2022. Greg Dyke has challenged more clubs to grow their own Harry Kanes to help England win the World Cup . FA chairman Dyke has proposed three rule changes to what makes a home-grown player . While there is a slight increase in the number of English players in the Premier League this year — up from 32% last year to 35% — that is largely down to Burnley being promoted. If they were to be relegated and replaced by Watford — second in the Championship — the proportion would fall to 31%. However, only 22% of the starters in the current top four teams are qualified to play for England, compared to 28% last year. In 2014, just 23 English players appeared in the Champions League group stage, compared with 78 Spaniards, 55 Germans and 51 Brazilians. This season the three English clubs that reached the knockout stages of the Champions League started only 10 English players, compared to 12 French and nine Spanish in those three sides. In the last two weeks only five English players started in the second legs of the knockout stage. In 2010 England Under 17s won the European Championship, beating Spain in the final. Of that 18-man match-day squad, only four have gone on to play more than 20 top-flight games, while double that from the Spanish squad have done so in La Liga. Of the 12 clubs who have played in each of the last five Premier League seasons, the average number of home-grown players per squad has gone from 11.4 to 9.4. Only 62% of current home-grown players are qualified to play for England. Dyke set this target 18 months ago when he established a Commission to investigate the diminishing number of English players at the top level and a clock on the wall of the coaches' room at St George's Park is counting down to the World Cup final in 2022, albeit the wrong date since FIFA confirmed the Qatar tournament will be moved to winter. Dyke warned he is prepared to force his rule-changes through the courts if agreements cannot be reached with the Premier League and the Football League. His proposal is to make three changes to the 'Home Grown' player rules, to be phased in over four years from the start of 2016-17. 1) A Home Grown player is a player irrespective of nationality who is registered to play in England or Wales for three years before his 18th birthday (rather than his 21st birthday as currently stated). This takes players like Cesc Fabregas out of the equation, and others signed at 16. 2) Reduce the number of non-Home Grown players in a 25-man first-team squad from 17 to 13. And so increase the Home-Grown players from eight to 12. 3) Introduce requirement that at least two Home Grown players are 'club trained', ie. have been registered with their current club for three years prior to their 18th birthday. Dyke's vision is to open pathways for those like Kane to make the final step from talented development player to the first-team without unexceptional foreign players blocking the route. 'How many more Harry Kanes are out there who just can't get a game?' said Dyke, summoning the example of the 21-year-old Tottenham striker who has broken into the first-team this season, took his goal tally to 29 with a hat-trick on Saturday and has been rewarded with his first senior England call-up. Kane scored his first Premier League hat-trick for Tottenham at the weekend and has a bright England future . England manager Roy Hodgson has called up Kane to the England senior squad for the first time . 'Suddenly an English kid who was out on loan and touch-and-go to get a game in the first-team is the top-scorer in English football. It's great news. 'A lot of very talented kids are going into professional football clubs at a very young age and an awful lot are getting lost. We have to do more to help these kids and give future England managers a greater chance of success. 'It is also not aimed at disadvantaging our clubs in UEFA competitions. Apart from Porto, who have this established association with Brazilian talent, every other club in the Champions League quarter-finals would satisfy these criteria. 'If Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, PSG and Monaco can do it, why can't our clubs?' Dyke (centre) has a vision that he hopes will enable England to win the 2022 World Cup . Only 23 English players appeared in the Champions League group stage this season, and three - John Terry (left), Steven Gerrard (centre) and Frank Lampard (right) - have retired from international duty . Only 23 English players appeared in the Champions League group stage this season, compared with 51 Brazilians, 55 Germans and 78 Spanish players. Three - John Terry, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard - have retired from international duty. Only five English players started in the second leg of the last 16 ties: Terry, Gary Cahill, Joe Hart, James Milner and Danny Welbeck. 'That's the grim picture at the top of the game, but it's hard to argue we don' t have the talent,' said Dyke, who applauded the work of the academies and the Premier League's Elite Player Performance Plan. The FA chairman reaffirmed the his commitment to improving coach education and grassroots facilities but has abandoned the idea of allowing B-teams to compete within the Football League framework. Gary Cahill (left) was one of just five English players to start in the second leg of the Champions League last 16 . Steve Cotterill's Bristol City won the Johnstone's Paint Trophy on Sunday, but plans are forming to include Under 21 teams alongside League One and Two clubs . 'There's no point flogging a dead horse,' he said, but plans are forming to include U21 teams from Premier League clubs in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. Asked about the reaction he expected from the clubs, Dyke replied: 'Some will buy in, some won't. We will go round and try to convince them. We will ask: Are you sure you haven't got a Harry Kane playing in your youth side? 'It's not an option I'd like to go down but the FA could change the rules. Or we could persuade UEFA to change the rules.' Dyke has taken legal advice and believes he could force this through. The Italian FA have agreed to non-EU restrictions in Serie A from 2016. Mame Biram Diouf qualifies for a work permit under the old formula, but not under the new formula . Bryan Oviedo (right) is another player who would struggle to obtain a work permit under the new system . The Home Office work permit changes are expected to quicken the process. From May, non-EU work permits will be reset with a new formula involving the player's cost combined with his nationality and international experience and leagues where he has played. The top 50 ranked nations will be eligible, rather than the top 70. Overall this would increase the opportunities of Brazilians and Argentines but reduce those from lower ranked nations, meaning that players like Bryan Ovideo, Ryo Miyaichi, Roger Espinoza, Brek Shea, Mame Biram Diouf and Geoff Cameron who qualified under the old system, would fail. The FA estimate that 42 players who acquired work permits in the last five years would not under the new rules. And, although there will be an appeals process, it will be less lenient than before when 80 per cent of appeals were successful.","Greg Dyke has unveiled new quota proposals to boost home-grown talent .

"Javier Mascherano has poured cold water on his heated altercation with Cristiano Ronaldo during Barcelona's 2-1 win over Real Madrid. A crunching tackle by Mascherano in the second half led to Ronaldo reacting with an ill-tempered, soft kick on the Argentina midfielder.

Their names are displayed in striking orange font, as is the date of the fight (May 2) and the start times of the Las Vegas show. Floyd Mayweather (left) and Manny Pacquiao look ready for action in the official poster for their fight . Mayweather, who is undefeated during his professional career, will meet Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2 . NFL star Tim Tebow poses with Pacquiao at the Wild Card gym in Los Angeles on Saturday . Also included are logos for the fight's venue, the MGM Grand, and Showtime and HBO - the US broadcasters which will jointly broadcast the show live on pay-per-view. Sky Sports are expected to show Mayweather's long-awaited clash with Pacquiao in the UK, although it could cost viewers over £20 to see it. The poster was released as Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arums said the revenue from ticket sales could hit $74m, almost four times the current record. Briefs were initially expected to cost between $1,000 and $5,000 but that upper limit has been raised to $10,000. A small number are set to go on sale to the public shortly. 'It's crazy, but it is what it is,' Arum told ESPN. 'It's amazing.' 'We'll probably have a handful of tickets that will go on sale to the public next week. It's mania.' There was also a fierce bidding war between two beer companies, Tecate and Corona to be one of the main sponsors. Tecate won with a bid of $5.6m compared to $5.2m from its rival. Meanwhile one of Mayweather's former opponents, Saul Alvarez, believes the American will dictate whether the fight is an exciting one for those watching around the world. He told Fox Deportes: 'Floyd is very smart. He can makes things frustrating or he can make a spectacular fight. He does not expose anything. 'In the past, he's thrown very few shots and makes things difficult. If he exposes himself just a little bit more, we can get an enjoyable fight. 'Pacquiao comes forward and he's always throwing a lot of punches, and he's fast. He can complicate things with his movement as he did with (Timothy) Bradley and (Juan Manuel) Marquez. Hopefully the fight is attractive.' Mayweather goes on a run as he prepares to face Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas .

"The pathetic excuses from friends and colleagues defending Steven Gerrard have been a joke. Unfortunately for arguably Liverpool’s greatest-ever player, he proved on Sunday that Brendan Rodgers has made the correct decision to cut him loose from Anfield at the end of this season. I’d be surprised if Gerrard makes the Liverpool starting line-up again, and any substitute appearances will surely only be to give the fans a wave goodbye. Why should Rodgers trust Gerrard again this season? Steven Gerrard looks dejected after seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on for Liverpool at Anfield . Gerrard stamped on Ander Herrera's right leg shortly after coming on at the start of the second half . Herrera gestures and points at Gerrard as the Liverpool midfielder reacts following the challenge . This is an experienced professional, a captain, a legend and there is nothing anyone can say that should mask the truth that he absolutely let everyone at Liverpool Football Club down. He also failed to apologise to Ander Herrera in his brief post-match interview, which showed a lack of class. Some said Gerrard was frustrated because he wasn’t in the starting line-up. That might be true, but it doesn’t excuse a violent stamp on an opponent’s ankle. Others have said he was desperate to get involved and show his passion. After all his years in the game, with all his knowledge of this fixture, he must surely know there is only one way to show passion and commitment on such a huge occasion – and that’s to make good, clean tackles, play well and get the job done. This was Liverpool’s biggest game of the season, against fierce rivals, it’s a game they’re losing when he comes on the pitch and it’s a game they need to win. Liverpool captain Gerrard looks baffled after seeing referee Martin Atkinson brandish a red card . Gerrard walks off the Anfield pitch in what was his last appearance against Man United in a Liverpool shirt . If Wayne Rooney had done it, the reaction would be far worse. There would be calls to strip him of the England captaincy. If it had been Joey Barton, the reaction would have hit fever pitch. Had it been a Chelsea player – well, the internet and the FA would have been in meltdown. There would have been talk of points deductions probably. But because it was Gerrard, the appropriate outrage has been tempered because apparently, according to the apologists, Rodgers made a mistake by failing to put him in the starting line-up. Gerrard (centre) walks past  Brendan Rodgers (left) as Emre Can (right) listens to instructions from his boss . Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton would have been ridiculed if he had made such a challenge . Last season’s slip against Chelsea was accidental, the stamp on Sunday was calculated: at best it was Gerrard being a careless hot-head desperate to make a mark. At worst, it looked like a reckless player who is now past caring about the fortunes of his club. Gerrard was the main man responsible for one of Liverpool’s most glorious nights back in 2005 in Istanbul. Nobody can ever take that away from him. Ten years on, there’s a good chance that Gerrard’s last significant act for his club could be a red card that proves to be a major factor in handing Manchester United a passage back into the Champions League – at Liverpool’s expense. Gerrard’s legacy is shattered. It’s a sad and sorry way to go, but he only has himself to blame. The Liverpool captain has been mocked for slipping against Chelsea during the clash back in April 2014 . Gerrard will want to be remembered for leading Liverpool to Champions League glory in May 2005 .","Steven Gerrard was sent off after just 38 seconds against Man United .

"Half of the Barclays Premier League are yet to hit the fabled 40 points needed to renew membership for next season. But only once in the past decade — Wolves in 2011 — has a team required that total to avoid the drop. Rather, Sportsmail has calculated that the magic number is just 36. Since the turn of the millennium and the establishment of a hierarchy within the top flight — meaning more points are distributed higher up the table — the average of the club finishing third from bottom has been a shade above 35. Struggling duo QPR and Leicester look destined to be heading for the Championship at the end of the season . The current bottom six of the Premier League . That being the case, you can assume that every team upwards of 13th-placed West Brom, on 33 points, will be feeding off the Premier League cash cow come August. Indeed, this weekend saw the bottom six all lose and a points-per-game projection would have all of them finishing the campaign on fewer than 36. But with Leicester and QPR looking increasingly doomed, it is Aston Villa, Hull, Sunderland and Burnley battling to avoid that final spot. Hull City (Odds on being relegated: 5/2) Run-in: Swansea (a), Southampton (a), Liverpool (h), Crystal Palace (a), Arsenal (h), Burnley (h), Tottenham (a), Man Utd (h). Without back-to-back wins over QPR and Aston Villa — inspired by deadline-day arrival Dame N’Doye — Hull would be odds-on for the drop. Just look at their daunting run-in. Remember Norwich City 12 months ago? At this juncture they were 13th and seven points clear of the bottom three. But one point from their final seven matches — which included games against the top four — saw them demoted to the Championship. Steve Bruce’s side finish with a trip to Spurs and the visit of Manchester United and they’ll want to be clear of trouble come the final fortnight. Verdict: They might scramble to about 34 points, and that should be enough, just. Tom Huddlestone (right) will be hoping his side can climb the table during the final batch of league fixtures . Aston Villa (Odds on being relegated: 7/2) Run-in: Man Utd (a), QPR (h), Tottenham (a), Man City (a), Everton (h), West Ham (h), Southampton (a), Burnley (h). If the bounce factor of Tim Sherwood’s arrival falls flat, a deflated Villa could soon be sucked back into serious trouble. Three of the next four are at Old Trafford, White Hart Lane and the Etihad and that, you would think, will throw up zero points. There is also the complicating factor of an FA Cup semi-final. Verdict: Home games against QPR, West Ham and Burnley will decide their fate — if they take six points from these and a draw elsewhere, then they should be fine. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has scored six goals for the Midlands outfit so far this season . Sunderland (Odds on being relegated: 5/4) Run-in: Newcastle (h), Crystal Palace (h), Stoke (a), Southampton (h), Everton (a), Leicester (h), Arsenal (a), Chelsea (a). Sunderland were better during Dick Advocaat’s first game in charge at West Ham. However, it still ended in defeat. And given that they see out the campaign with trips to Arsenal and Chelsea, the Dutch boss probably has six games to save the season and preserve his record of never having been relegated. Supposed January saviour Jermain Defoe is misfiring and the Black Cats have scored just once in 11 hours. Verdict: The club should have realised that they were heading for a relegation battle far sooner. Fail to win the Tyne-Wear derby on Easter Sunday and they could be set on a downward spiral which will surely end in the Championship. Sunderland signed Jermain Defoe in hope that he can score the goals to fire the Black Cats to safety . Burnley (Odds on being relegated: 10/11) Run-in: Tottenham (h), Arsenal (h), Everton (a), Leicester (h), West Ham (a), Hull (a), Stoke (h), Aston Villa (a) A recent victory over Manchester City and a draw at Chelsea shows that Sean Dyche’s men show little regard for reputations and that spirit will serve them well as the stakes increase during the closing weeks. Crucially, they play three of their relegation rivals and, to that end, their fate remains in their own hands. Verdict: If Burnley can take eight points from eight games then it could well prove enough and Dyche would be shortlisted for Manager of the Year recognition. Burnley striker Danny Ings is attracting interest from some of the Premier League's big boys . SPORTSMAIL PREDICTION... 15th — Aston Villa (35 pts) 16th — Hull City (34 pts) 17th — Burnley (33 pts) 18th — Sunderland (32 pts)","Leicester and Queens Park Rangers look destined to be relegated .

"How on earth has Arsene Wenger escaped criticism for yet another failure in Europe? They won on the night – fine. They went out on away goals – sure, it couldn't have been closer. But they lost to Monaco – arguably the worst side to make it through the group stage. Aaron Ramsey's goal against Monaco was not enough to prevent Arsenal going out of the Champions League . Arsenal players look dejected after losing the 3-1 at home to the French side in the first leg of the last-16 tie . Monaco defender Aymen Abdennour celebrates his team's shock victory at the Emirates last month . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger appears to have escaped criticism for yet another failure in Europe . Failing to win the group has been Wenger's massive error in recent seasons. That's why they've faced the European giants early and failed to make the quarter-finals. And yet again, despite being in a group with two no-hopers – Galatasaray and Anderlecht, and a Borussia Dortmund side that spent the first half of the season hovering in and around the relegation zone in the Bundesliga – Arsenal failed to top their group. But they got that stroke of luck everyone says you need if you are going to win the Champions League. They were paired with Monaco, a team defensively sound but offensively weak. I'm going to keep this simple: Arsenal have better players than Monaco. So surely an experienced manager, well versed in French football and Champions League football, especially familiar with his opponents – a club he once managed – with a squad featuring two arguably world-class players in Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez, not even Wenger could mess this one up? Wenger failed even with world-class talent like Mesut Ozil (pictured) and Alexis Sanchez in his Arsenal side . Arsenal boss Wenger looks on and sinks into his seat during Arsenal's shock defeat by Monaco . Monaco are effective, but they are a basic side. In other words, it shouldn't take a tactical genius to work out how to beat them. They got into the Champions League thanks to the quality of James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao (before his injury), but they have since lost those star players. And yet Wenger failed to do this. For the fifth season running Arsenal failed to make the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Damage done in the first leg, and Per Mertesacker said their mentality wasn't right. Therefore the manager has to take the blame for sending his players out with the wrong mentality. Last season, Mertesacker said Arsenal 'gave 10 per cent less mentally' when they were beaten by Napoli to miss out on top spot in the group. Wenger culpable for not preparing his players properly yet again. His preparation of his own team is poor. His ability to out-coach opponents is poor. And still there are people who think he is the right man to manage Arsenal. Some even have the audacity to cling on to that well-worn myth that he had every right not to win big trophies while Arsenal paid for the stadium. Hard to believe gullible Gooners fell for that one. The income and assets from day one at the new stadium meant Arsenal could always compete. Unfortunately Wenger misjudged the impact of Financial Fair Play, another mistake he made. The case for Wenger's defence is getting weaker and weaker. Per Mertesacker admitted Arsenal's mentality wasn't right as Arsenal failed to reach the quarter-finals . Sure, three other English clubs failed in the Champions League this season. Manchester City might change their manager because of it. That's a man who won the title last season. Chelsea know that they have a manager who has already won the Champions League twice before, so his track record is proven. But we all know that if he persistently fails to get to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, Mourinho won't last at the Bridge. And at Liverpool Brendan Rodgers went into his first ever Champions League campaign shorn of Luis Suarez and the injured Daniel Sturridge. He was a rookie and he made big mistakes. Wenger is making equally huge mistakes despite all his years of European experience. So many people are sitting around wringing their hands about why English clubs fail in Europe. No wonder we fail when a club as huge as Arsenal trusts a proven European failure with its Champions League ambitions, and then does nothing when he fails time after time. Manchester City were eliminated from the Champions League by Barcelona and could now change their boss . David Luiz celebrates scoring for PSG against  Chelsea while Blues boss Jose Mourinho shows his frustration . He's the only manager to reach three different European finals and lose them all – Cup Winners' Cup with Monaco, UEFA Cup and Champions League with Arsenal. Wenger's 17 straight seasons in the Champions League are an embarrassment when you consider he has only reached one final, and two semi-finals in that time. Is there anyone else who could do better? There really are people stupid enough to ask that question. If you want a young manager who will be bold and brave in the face of bigger-spending more illustrious opponents then go for the youthful energy of Diego Simeone or Jurgen Klopp. Both have won domestic titles in recent seasons when they could have done what Wenger does every year and wave the white flag because he can't handle what he calls the 'financial doping' of the likes of Man City and Chelsea. If you want proven winners, then Wenger's £8m-a-year salary will surely tempt the quality of Pep Guardiola or Carlo Ancelotti. Wenger's £8m-a-year salary would surely tempt Carlo Ancelotti (left) and Pep Guardiola to north London . Why is it that a juggernaut of a club like Arsenal sticks with a manager who regularly fails when it comes to the big moments? Are they content to miss out? Finishing second wasn't good enough for Thierry Henry, remember? So he left the stinking, sinking ship to go and finish first with Barcelona. That was a long, long time ago of course, but still the fallen Emirates empire remains ruined. The failure to win the Champions League will always be a huge scabby wart on Wenger's record. But Wenger isn't bigger than Arsenal. He is replaceable. He's guilty of failing in Europe with Arsenal and making a massive contribution to the diminishing reputation of English clubs in European competition. Being knocked out by Monaco should be the final straw for Wenger. It would be for any other manager of one of Europe's elite clubs.","Arsene Wenger failed in Europe as Arsenal were beaten by Monaco .

"Luis Suarez left the field a loser last October in his first ever Clasico but on Sunday night he walked off the pitch a man who had put the league title within touching distance of his team – some way to mark your first ever home game against Real Madrid. ‘That’s why we paid a lot of money for him, he compliments what we already have,’ said Luis Enrique of a performance and a goal that meant even though Real Madrid had successfully subdued Lionel Messi they still lost the game. The Barcelona squad have plenty of players who float like butterflies, but at times over the last few seasons what they have really needed was someone who could sting like a bee – Luis Suarez did exactly that on Sunday night. Luis Suarez celebrates after scoring for Barcelona in his first ever home match against Real Madrid . Suarez gets the better of Real Madrid pair Pepe (left) and Sergio Ramos to score for Barcelona on Sunday . It wasn’t quite the 3-1 win that earlier in the season Real Madrid inflicted on Barcelona – and that could still matter if the two teams finish level on points such is the head-to-head goal-difference rule in Spain – but it was still some performance and some win. And what a difference five months had made. That Santiago Bernabeu Clasico was Suarez’s debut after his Fifa ban for biting Georgio Cheillini had ended. He made an almost instant impact setting up Neymar to score after just four minutes. He then laid another golden opportunity on a plate for Messi only to see it missed and Real Madrid come back into the game and win it 3-1. On Sunday night the impact was not so instant but it was lasting. Luis Enrique will also have made a note of how two other new signings who were both still bedding-in last October were also very important in the win. He had insisted on the club signing Real Sociedad keeper Claudio Bravo and he was outstanding, making brilliant saves from Karim Benzema at both ends of the second half. Jeremy Mathieu, meanwhile, was the unlikely scorer of the first goal. ‘I have been pushing myself to get my first goal for the club and finally it comes in the biggest game’ he said. He was also outstanding defensively alongside an immense Gerard Pique. Suarez is crowded out during his first-ever El Clasico match at the Bernabeu as Barcelona lost 3-1 in October . Defender Jeremy Mathieu celebrates with his Barcelona team-mates after giving his team the lead . Luis Enrique was questioned for requesting the signing of Mathieu – a 30-year-old defender with a €20m price tag was always going to have a hard job convincing supporters but Sunday night’s display will have gone a long way to doing that. For Suarez the convincing had already been done with those two crucial goals at the Etihad that made sure Manchester City were brushed aside by Barcelona in the Champions League. Sunday night’s finishing told supporters nothing they didn’t already know. There is a phrase – ‘mig-toc’ – coined by former Barcelona player and coach Charly Rexach which means ‘half-touch’ and is meant to describe Barcelonaa’s passing game as something one step beyond one-touch. Suarez is congratulated by his team-mates as his goal pushed Barcelona closer to the La Liga title . Suarez has that same speed of touch, not in his passing, but in his finishing. The control and shot past Iker Casillas seemed to be part of one movement that happened far too quickly for the Spain keeper and Real defender Pepe to do anything about. He is not the first to score in his first Nou Camp Clasico. Other big signings such as Gary Lineker, Diego Maradona, Romario, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto’o and Zlatan Ibrahimovic all did likewise. Not all their goals were worth La Liga titles however. ‘There is still an eternity to go’ said Javier Mascherano after Sunday night’s game and while 10 matches is little more than a quarter of a season it is true that so much can still happen, especially as Barcelona must travel to Atletico Madrid and Sevilla before the season ends. But Barcelona are now in control of their own destiny and in Suarez they have someone absolutely determined not to finish second this season as he did last year with Liverpool.","Luis Suarez scored winning goal in victory over Real Madrid on Sunday .

"Racism is widespread in English football with police having to deal with hundreds of incidents from the top of the game right down to grassroots level, an investigation has revealed. It also revealed that Chelsea supporters have been involved in the highest number of reported racist incidents as they travelled to and from matches on trains. It follows the high-profile case of a black man who was prevented from boarding a train in Paris by Chelsea fans as they sang a racist song, with five of them due in court this week. Chelsea supporters have been involved in the highest number of reported racist incidents . The information, gathered from 24 police forces across the country, shows there have been over 350 incidents since 2012. But as that only accounts for around half the police forces in the country, the actual figure is likely to be much higher. The charity Show Racism The Red Card said the number of incidents shows that racism is a societal problem and it was particularly shocked by the number of incidents of racist abuse at children's matches. The British Transport Police said since 2012 it had dealt with 15 incidents of alleged racism involving Chelsea fans, the most of any club in the country. Manchester United were second with 10 incidents, followed by Leeds with 10, West Ham with eight, Arsenal with four and Portsmouth with four. Chelsea fans united with a banner stating 'Black or white, we're all blue' ahead of Burnley match . A club spokesman for Chelsea said of the investigation: 'The club's position on discriminatory behaviour is clear and we work closely with relevant authorities on their investigations.' Greater Manchester Police reported 46 incidents, which included a man cleaning a toilet in a stadium being told 'that's a f****** black man's job, you f****** n*****' and a manager at a children's game being told 'I'll do you, I'm gonna wait for you outside, I'm going to do you, you f****** n*****'. The force also said that on two occasions a letter was written to a specific footballer containing racist abuse and during a game someone shouted 'what is this the United Nations, how many chinks and w*** do you need?'. Hertfordshire Police recorded 11 incidents of alleged racist abuse at children's football games, while Northamptonshire Police said that during a non-league game a man was spat at and racially abused before eventually having his leg broken in a strong challenge. Some Chelsea fans were involved in an incident on the Paris Metro, and supporters have worked hard in the aftermath to show that there is no racism at Stamford Bridge . Gavin Sutherland, campaign co-ordinator at Show Racism The Red Card, said: 'This data from police forces around the UK shows that although football clubs have taken strong action against people using racist language inside stadiums, racism is a real problem within society. 'People who exhibit racist behaviours in 2015 are doing so, in the main, away from football grounds. 'Especially worrying are the incidents of racist abuse at youth team football matches. People engaged in racist abuse at these venues know that they are more likely to get away with it, because of facilities, a lack of stewarding and security, but the impact on young people will be considerable. 'Primarily, they are being exposed to racism, which in itself is frightening, but also it may influence their own behaviour.' Other incidents included Cleveland Police reporting repeated monkey sounds and gestures during a Middlesbrough v Blackburn game in November last year and Devon and Cornwall Police said a man was headbutted and racially abused during a non-league game. Chelsea's programme cover for the match against PSG carried a clear message: 'We are all blue #equality' Surrey Police said a referee received racist insults during a kids' game and Essex police said a footballer refused to shake hands with a player from the opposite team before racially abusing him. Due to the fact that some police forces were unable to provide the information or did not reply to the request, Mr Sutherland said there would certainly be a greater number of cases. 'These incidents, although shocking in themselves and how geographically widespread they are, will be just a part of the picture,' he said. 'These are the incidents that have been reported. There will certainly be a greater number unreported and under-investigated. 'Show Racism The Red Card has always stated that the reason racism manifests in football is that it is a societal problem. 'The campaign works with young people and adults not just to educate against racism, but encourage the use and development of critical thinking skills to break down the misinformation that supports racist beliefs.' A club spokesman for Chelsea said of the investigation: 'The club's position on discriminatory behaviour is clear and we work closely with relevant authorities on their investigations.'","An investigation has revealed a widespread racism problem in England .

"When Caitlin Miller first met Scott Worgan six years ago it was ‘love at first sight’. Now Scott's heart-warming proposal video has gone viral after the father-of-two enlisted his impossibly cute little girls to help him pop the question to the love of his life. The 29-year-old, from the Central Coast in NSW, wrote out a series of signs for his romantic proposal and asked his daughters Scarlett, 3, and Sienna, 20 months, to hold them up in front of the camera. ‘You’re so amazing in every way. Everything you do for us. Everything you do for daddy makes us feel so special,’ one card reads. At one point Scarlett holds a sign upside down and Sienna hides behind them. 'Wouldn't it be cool if we were your flower girls?,' they ask. Amazingly 27-year-old Caitlin had no idea what her partner had been planning for weeks, as he even managed to keep his little girls from spilling the secret. Scott Worgan (right) has asked Caitlin Miller (left) to marry him with a heart-warming proposal video . 'I'm still crying,' Caitlin told Daily Mail Australia as she revealed how Scott managed to film the proposal with their daughters in just one take. The couple met in 2009 while they were both working at the same insurance company and quickly fell in love. ‘We became friends first of all, with some flirting in the office. Things started progressing from there. It was a quick little thing and we just fell in love and moved in together five months later,’ Caitlin recalled. The pair had their first daughter, Scarlett, in 2011, and Scott has never stopped doing all he can to make Caitlin happy. ‘He’s a bit of a perfectionist and a romantic. He loves to cheer me up and do sweet things like making videos when I’m having a bad week,’ she explained. The Central Coast dad enlisted daughters Scarlett (right), 3, and Sienna (left), 20 months, to help him pop the question . Scott and Caitlin are seen her on holiday in Bali in 2010, celebrating their friends wedding . Scarlett held up a sign telling her mum 'you're amazing in every way!' The cute little girls told their mum Caitlin 'you would be such a beautiful bride' ‘He makes videos for my birthdays and our anniversaries and when I’m having a bad day. He always picks me up with these little things so he knew I wouldn’t catch on till half way through.’ The pair had often spoken about marriage since having their first child but never really made plans and Caitlin had ‘no idea’ on the day that he was about to propose. ‘I was in shock that my oldest didn’t say anything, she is a bit of a chatterbox and she just stood still in the video and they did one take.’ While Scott was making the video with the girls one Saturday, Caitilin was at work and came home to find all the blinds shut. This photo was taken in 2013 while 'celebrating another year together' This photo was taken on their Thailand trip in 2014 to celebrate another anniversary . The pair had often spoken about marriage since having their first child in 2011 . ‘My daughter came out and said “we made you something”. The next minute Scott came out with three cards saying “welcome home mummy” to cover it up,’ Caitlin recalled. What the touching video doesn’t show is Caitlin’s shocked reaction as Scott handed her a ring just as their daughters held up the ‘marry daddy?’ card. ‘I was sitting on the couch in the lounge room and he was sitting next to me and pulled the ring out,’ Caitlin said. ‘He was shaking I was shaking and crying and flicked the ring across the room. Meanwhile, my oldest daughter was sick at the time and lying down. It was just typical us as parents,’ she laughed. Once they’d picked the ring up off the floor, Caitlin saw the stunning Inverell sapphire Scott had bought her. This adorable photo was taken on Scarlett's naming day in 2012 .

"England's bid to qualify for the Under 17 European Championships got off to a perfect start on Saturday with a 3-1 win over Norway at Burton Albion's Pirelli Stadium. Goals from Daniel Wright, Danny Collinge and Layton Ndukwu carried the Young Lions to victory in the first of three crucial Elite Round qualifiers this week. John Peacock's side are the defending European champions, having beaten Holland on penalties in last May's final in Malta to lift the trophy for the second time.

England coach John Peacock is hoping to lead his team to the European Championship finals in Bulgaria . With home advantage in this final batch of qualifiers, England started as strong favourites to overcome Norway, Slovenia and Romania in their mini-group and reach the finals in Bulgaria. And they had the perfect start here when Sunderland man Wright smashed the ball home from six yards after Norway goalkeeper Kjetil Haug could only palm Nathan Holland's cross into his path. Their lead, however, lasted just seven minutes. The England defence switched off and Andreas Helmersen broke away down the left before squaring for striker Risa Birk to tap in. The remainder of the first-half was an open affair, but the hosts created the better chances. Leicester man Ndukwu twice struck the crossbar and Chelsea forward Ike Ugbo was denied by the Norway keeper when clean through. Ike Ugbo, of Chelsea, tries to win the ball off Norway's Joakim Barstad during the match at Burton . England forward Layton Ndukwu and John Saeter of Norway compete for the ball . England deserved a goal and it duly arrived on 57 minutes when captain Reece Oxford headed down a corner and Collinge, who plays for Stuttgart in Germany, spin to fire home from five yards. And victory was secured five minutes later when Ndukwu collected the ball wide left, advanced towards goal and finished from a tight angle. With one win under their belts, England now head to Chesterfield to play Slovenia on Monday night before rounding off the Elite Round qualifiers against Romania at Burton on Thursday. Peacock urged his team to build on this positive performance and kick on: 'I thought we were really good.

'We got off to a great start, then had a bit of a blip when we conceded, but in terms of the reaction it was really positive. 'I thought we played really well.

"Serena Williams has spoken of her close friendship with tennis rival Caroline Wozniacki. Appearing on the front cover of US Vogue, the American world No 1 admits that times can get tough at the top and that she is glad to have Wozniacki and sister Venus around for support. 'It’s hard and lonely at the top,' Serena confessed to Vogue. 'That’s why it’s so fun to have Caroline and my sister, too. You’re a target when you’re number one. Everyone wants to beat you. Everyone talks behind your back, and you get a lot more criticism. God forbid I lose.' Scroll down for video . American world No 1 Serena Williams appears on the front cover of Vogue and showed off her fit physique . Serena shared an Instagram image touting her Vogue issue in which she admitted: 'It’s lonely at the top' Last May, it was Caroline who needed Serena's support. When Serena got word that Caroline had been dumped by fiance Rory McIlroy, she immediately picked up the phone. 'I was devastated. I had planned the bachelorette party,' Williams said. Serena and Caroline both sat down to chat about the event six months after the fact. 'My phone was going crazy, but I didn’t want to talk to anyone,' said Caroline. 'I kept calling,' Serena said. 'First she texted, ""If you don’t pick up, I am going to fly to Monaco."" And then, ""If you don’t answer the door, I am going to knock it down."" 'So I thought, OK, I better answer the phone. And I am so glad I did. She wasn’t pitying me, like a lot of people were. I mean, it’s not like anyone died.' Williams spoke about her close friendship with Caroline Wozniacki, who is a  rival on the tennis court . Wozniacki added: 'I was in shock, but she was really helpful because she had been through it before. She didn’t sugarcoat it, and she didn’t look down on me. 'She was really there for me when I needed her the most, and that’s why I think our friendship is so strong now.' 'I was impressed with how strong she was,' Serena said, before continuing: 'And you know, there will be other engagement parties... many.' Williams and Wozniacki celebrate after the Dane finished last year's New York Marathon while the pair also attended the Vogue Fashion Fun Awards in New York last year . Serena indicated that Caroline won't have problems finding another guy, as they literally swarm her when the girls go out at night. 'I am really shy. I don’t talk to guys,' Serena conceded. And although she had once wished for a family and children of her own some day, she's not in any particular hurry. 'I guess,' she said. 'I’m not even looking for it.' On the court, it's a different story. Serena went on to say: 'On the court, I am fierce! I am mean and I am tough. I am completely opposite off the court. My confidence just isn’t the same. I wish I was more like I am on the court. Nobody would know that I am constantly crying or complaining.' Williams said: 'On the court, I am fierce! I am mean and I am tough. I am completely opposite off the court'","World No 1 Serena Williams appears in the April issue of US Vogue .

"New Zealand reached their first ever World Cup final as they secured a sensational four-wicket Duckworth/Lewis win over South Africa at a sold out Eden Park on Tuesday. An explosive 49 off 18 balls from South African batsman David Miller saw New Zealand set 298 (D/L) to chase for victory, after a burst of rain reduced the match to 43 overs per side. In response, Brendon McCullum blazed his way to 59 and despite the regular loss of wickets, Grant Elliott smashed the penultimate ball for six to lead New Zealand to a tense victory. Grant Elliott celebrates after smashing the winning runs as New Zealand reached their first ever final . South Africa missed chances in the field, JP Duminy and Ferhaan Berhardian colliding at a crucial moment . Faf du Plessis and Farhaan Behardien cannot believe it after a crucial drop which reprieved Elliott .

Vettori (left) leads his team-mates on a lap of honour to show appreciation for the home fans . Imran Tahir wipes away a tear after South Africa again failed to reach the final of a World Cup . The dejection is clear to see on the faces of the South Africans, after they failed to make it over the line . There was an added spice to the match with neither side having ever previously made it past the semi-finals. New Zealand’s own dismal record of six defeats out of six at this stage of the tournament was a disappointment the native supporters were confident their side would finally overcome in Auckland. But, following their quarter-final victory over Sri Lanka, South African captain AB de Villiers said his side embraced the tag of ‘chokers’ and were striving under the pressure. Having won the toss South Africa chose to bat first and the continued rotation of their side saw Vernon Philander replace the heretofore-impressive Kyle Abbott. With arguably the best attack of the World Cup, New Zealand’s pace bowlers Trent Boult and Tim Southee were successfully swinging the ball and causing the opposition openers all sorts of problems. AB de Villiers falls over the stumps after failing to gather the ball cleanly to run out Corey Anderson . The anguish is clear on De Villiers' face as he let the momentum shift away from South Africa in the semi final . De Villiers has been one of South Africa's stars of the tournament, but his mistake cost his side dear . New Zealand celebrate after taking a wicket during the first innings of their semi-final against South Africa . Du Plessis top-scored for South Africa with 82, as the Proteas scored 281 in a rain-interrupted innings . Corey Anderson, who was expensive but took three of five wickets, celebrates Rilee Roussow's dismissal . David Miller blasted three sixes in his quickfire 49, which boosted the South African score at the end . Somewhat surprisingly the Black Caps’ fielding early on let them down, as first Quinton De Kock was dropped on six by wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi off Boult. Hashim Amla was then put down three balls later on naught at long leg, with Boult the guilty party this time, after he hit a top-edge off Southee. Nonetheless, the tournaments leading wicket-taker redeemed himself in the following over as Boult followed up a bouncer with an in-swinger that took Amla’s (10) inside edge and cannoned into middle stump, with Eden Park erupting in jubilation. Attempting to release the shackles, De Kock (14) shuffled down the wicket to Boult and as he swung hard at a full ball, a thick edge flew to third man and South Africa were reduced to 31 for two after eight overs. Slow starts coupled with explosive finishes have the been framework for many of De Villiers side’s innings during this World Cup and their efforts in Auckland was following the same suit. Required to rebuild, Faf du Plessis and Rillee Rossouw put on an 83-run third-wicket partnership to steady the ship. De Villiers hit another impressive 65, continuing his excellent form, as South Africa accelerated their innings . The South African captain salutes the crowd after reaching yet another half century . However, McCullum brought on Corey Anderson and he sent down a bouncer that hit the shoulder of the Rossouw’s bat and was caught one-handed by Martin Guptill at backwards point to dismiss the left-handed batsman for 39. As De Villier’s came to the crease he was once again required to provide a rescue mission but was almost dismissed on his first delivery as he nearly gloved the ball onto the stumps. But, the right-handed batsman remained un-fazed and in typical style he took the attack to the opposition. Kane Williamson committed the cardinal sin of dropping the South African captain and New Zealand were made to pay as the next three balls were dispatched to the boundary rope. As Du Plessis and De Villier’s partnership passed the 100-run mark some unscheduled rain arrived to check their progress on 216-3 after 38 overs. It was an interruption that undoubtedly favoured New Zealand, just as South Africa looked like they were ready to explode and by the time the skies cleared the match was reduced to 43 overs per side. Having anchored his sides innings Du Plessis was dismissed for 82 off the second ball after the restart, as he gloved a bouncer from Anderson to Ronchi behind the stumps. For South Africa it turned out to be the perfect catalyst for an exciting end as Miller entered and smashed six fours and three sixes in his quick-fire 49. With 65 runs hit off their final five overs after the delay the Proteas posted 281-5, setting New Zealand a challenging 298 (D/L) to win. Brendon McCullum flicks the ball away as he got New Zealand off to a blistering start in their chase . McCullum's combination of clever shotmaking and explosive power set New Zealand up for a win . Morne Morkel hit back for South Africa, dismissing McCullum and Kane Williamson in quick succession . McCullum, who has become known for thriving on leading from the front, signaled his intent in the first over of his sides innings as he sent a short Dale Steyn delivery over extra cover for a maximum. Although Guptill - fresh from hitting a record 237 against the West Indies in fourth quarter-final - was looking uncomfortable, his captain was in full flow at the other end and reached his half-century off just 22 balls. South Africa’s pace bowlers were bleeding runs so De Villiers turned to his energetic spinner Imran Tahir and a tight first over applied a bit of pressure on the batsmen. And, McCullum (59) succumbed attempting to resume clearing the ropes in the next over as he came dancing down the wicket to Morne Morkel and having failed to connect properly could only pick out Steyn at mid-on. Williamson then lasted just 11 balls before he bottom-edged a short Morkel delivery and shattered his stumps on six. New Zealand were faltering and Ross Taylor was guilty for calling for a single and selling Guptill short as he found himself run-out for a scratchy 34. Quinton de Kock runs out Martin Guptill after a mix-up with Ross Taylor as the hosts faltered in Auckland . Duminy (left) celebrates with Du Plessis as South Africa appeared to take control of the contest . Taylor was caught behind for 30, as New Zealand struggled to keep up with the rate . It was fifth bowler JP Duminy who then provided the next crucial breakthrough for South Africa as Taylor was brilliantly caught behind by De Kock for a run-a-ball 30. The match continued to ebb and flow with neither side taking full control of the game before the game changing moment occurred in the 32nd over. As Elliott pushed the ball to point, Anderson called for a run and as he was sent back De Villiers missed a golden opportunity to run-out the stranded batsmen, hitting the stumps with his hand instead of the ball. A superb 103-run fifth-wicket partnership between Elliott and Anderson looked to have taken New Zealand to the brink of victory. However, Anderson skied a Morkel delivery to Du Plessis at square-leg for 58 and Ronchi holed-out in the deep for eight as the tension out in the middle and in the stands stepped up another notch. Anderson (above) and Elliot settled the hosts' nerves with a brilliant partnership of 103 . Anderson punished De Villiers for his missed run out as the game hurtled towards a tense climax . With New Zealand 273-6 and requiring another 26 runs off 16 balls, South Africa missed another crucial run-out opportunity, Elliott this time the lucky survivor. The 36-year-old right-handed batsmen sent a length Morkel delivery high into the evening Auckland sky but the ball fell agonizingly between two Proteas players. Morkel’s final delivery was again pulled high into the air by Elliott but just as Farhaan Behardien looked set to catch it Duminy ran across him as the ball dropped to the ground. Steyn, battling injury, was brought on for the final over with New Zealand requiring 12. And Eden Park erupted in euphoria as Elliott (84 not out) hit the penultimate ball for a maximum as the South African players collapsed to the ground in despair. There is an undeniably belief within the crowd that their side has one more victory in them that will bring New Zealand their elusive first World Cup title. Du Plessis keeps his cool to take a vital catch and dismiss Anderson, setting up a thrilling finish . Du Plessis cannot hide his jubilation as the semi-final came right down to the wire in Auckland .

"Former England hardman Paul Ince has picked his #one2eleven of stars he  played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club on Sky Sports. Ince, whose played for a number of European clubs, picked a mixture of talent in his squad - with players from Inter Milan, Manchester United and England making the cut. Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. Paul Ince (centre) picks his best 11 he played with and included David Beckham (left) and Paul Gascoigne . GOALKEEPER: PETER SCHMEICHEL . Has to be 'Big Pete.' What a fantastic goalkeeper, I played with David Seaman and he was a very good goalkeeper but for me Schmeichel was another level. Just the fact that, one on one's, normally when somebody goes through on the goalkeeper you just pray that they're going to save it but you just knew Schmeichel was going to save it, so we'd always set up a counter-attack because we knew he would. He could also throw the ball as far as he could kick it and the amount of times we would get get corners against us, he'd pluck it and release it to Giggs and Kanchelskis and we'd score goals. Best goalkeeper in the world during his time. RIGHT BACK: JAVIER ZANETTI . He is a great player. Zanetti joined Inter Milan the same time as me and he was just awesome. He was just a young kid but he just slotted into the way we played. The reason I put him in ahead of Gary Neville is because Javier can play in different positions and I always want players who can be flexible and what ever position he played in - he was world class. He was unbelievable. CENTRAL DEFENDER: TONY ADAMS . Colossus. Proper centre half. Men-of-men. In our England team we were all men, we were all big characters and big men but he was men-of-men. He was a leader and he inspired people around him. People say he wasn't the best passer but he wasn't that bad. His volley against Everton showed he could play. He wasn't the quickest but his timing of tackling. He was a brilliant organiser, he's top draw. Peter Schmeichel was labelled as the best goalkeeper in the world by former team-mate Paul Ince . Gary Pallister (right) played with Ince at Manchester United and was picked in his Fantasy squad . CENTRAL DEFENDER: GARY PALLISTER . Very unlucky to not play for England more. Laziest man you'll ever meet in football, if you did running he'd be at the back, when you finished training he'd be the first out of the door. I used to go round his house and he'd be playing on his PlayStation eating Malteasers. But when it came to playing football you would never see anyone go past him, you'd never see anyone beat him and he had telescopic legs, he was quick and he could play. The only negative is that he should have scored more goals but what a player. LEFT BACK: ROBERTO CARLOS . When I first met him at Inter, I thought wow. Firstly, I couldn't believe how big his legs were, you can see that in the way he plays and strikes a ball. He had great pace up and down the line, he could tackle, score and he was an incredible player. The only thing that disappointed me was that Roy Hodgson let him go to Real Madrid a little bit early. RIGHT WING: DAVID BECKHAM . An easy decision. Becks was the true professional, he was probably the best technical player I played with. I used to watch him and watch him. As soon as we'd finished [training], the mannequins would be out and he'd be taking free-kicks, corners and he'd do it for an hour. Every training session he'd give 110 per cent, he would never beat anybody but if you give him a yard, he'll put in the best balls you'll ever see. What a player. Ince described Beckham as the best technical player he played with during his footballing career . MIDFIELDER: ROY KEANE . For a complete player, without a doubt Keano. Apart from the bad side he had, he was the complete midfield player for me. He was an inspiration, a leader, could score you vital goals, he could tackle when he had too, he would be naughty when he had too but playing alongside him for three or four seasons helped him improve my game a lot. MIDFIELDER: PAUL GASCOIGNE . Probably the best player I played with. What more can I say? He's a maverick, he just had everything. He wasn't the quickest but he had that little injection of pace to get away from people and I remember seeing Gazza play for the first time at Upton Park and he was telling Billy Bonds to keep up. He's brilliant, scores all types of goals and without doubt the best player I played alongside. Paul Gascoigne was highly praised by Ince and claims the former Newcastle man was the best he played with . LEFT WING: RYAN GIGGS . He would play 20 games and be unplayable, he was that good. If you're a full back and think get tight - then he'll spin inside, he you drop off then he will rip you apart. Outstanding player, what he's done in the game, his mindset when he played in centre midfielder for Manchester United for two or three years says it all. The best left winger there will ever be. STRIKER: ERIC CANTONA . Couldn't leave him out. When Cantona did come to United I knew that we'd win the title because he just had the aura and presence about him. He took the responsibility away from all of us lot. He was unbelievable, he'd come in at half past nine every morning, do his own warm-up and work on his skills, touch and his x, y and z. He was just brilliant. His goals and importance to the team make him an unbelievable player. STRIKER: ALAN SHEARER . When I think about a complete striker and what I'd want as a manager as my striker is Alan Shearer. It's not just the goals he scored, he was a handful, he could run the channels, his retention of the ball was fantastic and he was a leader of men. I don't think we'll have a striker in that mould again. Eric Cantona (left) and Alan Shearer are two of the best strikers the Premier League has seen .

"Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane has contributed a staggering 22 points in the Barclays Premier League this season, while team-mate Christian Eriksen is runner-up on 13. Kane is poised to make his senior England debut this week after receiving his first call-up and with good reason as Sportsmail reveal the top 20 players that have contributed for their clubs so far. Yet Tottenham aren't alone in relying on a player or two. Queens Park Rangers would be bottom without Charlie Austin, and Burnley would be, too, if Danny Ings was taken out of the picture. Harry Kane runs away in celebration after scoring against Leicester City as he went on his way to a hat-trick . Tottenham Hotspur striker Kane has contributed an incredible 22 points for his club this season . Kane carries the match ball after his hat-trick against Leicester last week at White Hart Lane . Christian Eriksen (pictured being hugged by Kane) is second in the Premier League's top 20 list . He's cried watching England... but now the Tottenham striker wants to put smiles back on the faces of Three Lions supporters. Click here to read Martin Samuel's exclusive interview with England newbie . Kane's fellow Premier League top goalscorer Diego Costa sits 11th in the list, having contributed eight points towards Chelsea's title push compared to the Tottenham striker's 22. But how is all this worked out? Take Kane's hat-trick against Leicester last week, for example. The 21-year-old's three goals at White Hart Lane helped Tottenham win 4-3, whereas without Kane they would  have lost 4-1 - hypothetically speaking, of course. Kane, therefore, 'won' three points by taking Tottenham from a losing position to a winning one, as he did against QPR on March 7 and Arsenal on February 7, too. Kane was 500/1 to finish top goalscorer this year and his contribution  reflects a remarkable season under manager Mauricio Pochettino. Elsewhere in the list, Arsenal are represented twice with third-placed Alexis Sanchez (11 points) and Olivier Giroud (9) leading the way. Fellow Champions League chasers Manchester United have Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney (both 8) to thank for comfortably sitting fourth as we enter the international break. No Manchester City players, meanwhile, make the top 20 - not even the Premier League's third top goalscorer Sergio Aguero. Olivier Giroud makes the list and sits seventh as his 13 goals have contributed nine points for Arsenal . Alexis Sanchez sits third in the list and has contributed 11 points to Arsenal's top four push . Chelsea striker Diego Costa may be the Premier League's joint-top goalscorer but he is nowhere near Kane .

"Paul Gascoigne told the High Court on Wednesday that phone-hacking was linked to his alcoholism. The 47-year-old former England star started his evidence at the hearing in London to determine what compensation should be paid by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) in eight representative cases by telling Mr Justice Mann that he was 'fuming'. Smartly dressed in a dark grey suit and pink-and-white open-necked striped shirt and accompanied by former Tottenham team-mate Gary Mabbutt, he said he changed his mobile because he knew there was something going on with it. Former footballers Gary Mabbutt (second left) and Paul Gascoigne (second right) arrive at the High Court . His voice hoarse and shaking with emotion, he said: 'I knew I was getting hacked by the Mirror. This continued for ages. Phone calls to my father and family were getting blocked so I changed my mobile. It happened again so I kept on changing mobiles, five or six times a month.' Questioned by David Sherborne, who has said hacking was rife at all three of the group's national titles by mid-1999, he said that, to start with, the experience was 'so scary'. Gascoigne, who is complaining about 18 articles - all accepted to have been the product of illegal activity - said: 'I couldn't speak to anybody, I was scared to speak to anybody... my parents, my family and kids, it was just horrendous. 'And people can't understand why I became an alcoholic.' Gascoigne went on: 'At the time I was going through a bad time because I knew I was getting hacked, 110 per cent. Of course (people) wouldn't believe it - my family and Mr McKeown (therapist Johnny McKeown). Gascoigne (right) gave evidence at a hearing to decide the amount of compensation to be awarded . Gascoigne claimed the phone hacking 'ruined his life' as he waits for compensation to be determined . 'As I was speaking to him on the phone, it clicked again. He told me I was paranoid, I was going through a mental disorder. 'I said ""No, there's f***-all wrong with me"". I knew, I knew. I put the phone down... I've never told a lie, nothing to lie about, nothing. 'Disgusting. Crap.' After speaking briefly, Gascoigne was told he would not face cross-examination by Matthew Nicklin QC, for MGN, and his evidence was going unchallenged. He replied: 'I have waited 15 years to be sat here so I am disgusted, really. 'I would like to trade my mobile phone in for a coffin because these guys have ruined my life. I have no life.'

"Some dogs are born with the ability to make impressive catches with their mouths. And some dogs, like Fritz the golden retriever from California, are not – as demonstrated by its owner, who collated  the canine's failed attempts to catch different food items in slow motion. Standing before the camera the dog initially looks calm, composed and ready to make its owner proud. Fritz waits patiently at the start of the video and looks composed before the first item comes his way . Spotting the piece of meat the dog licks its lips in anticipation and locks its eyes on the prize. The owner tosses the piece of meat, which travels in a straight line and at a good pace towards the dog. But as Fritz opens his mouth to make the catch, he leans back just too far and the meat hits him  in the face. After licking its lips at the prospect of a piece of meat, the dog mistimes his jump and is clobbered with it . Leaning back too far the dog is unable to anticipate the flight of a doughnut and it hits him in the neck . Next up is a doughnut, and while not the healthiest piece of food for a dog, one would think the bigger surface area would surely make the task easier. Jumping too eagerly once more Fritz mistimes the doughnut's flight and the food item hits him in the neck. With a new Stars and Stripes bandana comes new opportunities in the form of a meatball and a taco, but the dog once again makes a mess of the catches and the taco explodes against its face. The dog pulls out of his attempt to catch a taco and it smashes against his face and breaks apart . A strawberry appears to by flying directly into the dog's mouth before it bounces off his nose . Gaining a crowd, the dog later attempts to catch a strawberry but despite following the flight of the fruit it ricochets off his nose and onto the floor. The final food items include a hot dog, which covers him in ketchup, and a slice of pizza, which collides awkwardly with his ear. The video concludes with a moment of success as the golden retriever manages to catch a single chip with the side of its mouth. The dog follows the flight of the hot dog but is unable to catch it and is instead covered in ketchup . Success at last! Finally, against all the odds, the dog manages to catch the single chip that comes his way .","The dog named Fritz initially looks composed before the camera .

"She's certainly got the moves on the catwalk, now Karlie Kloss is throwing some shapes in a new video that pays tribute to the height of the disco era. Dressed in a series of revealing outfits the 22-year-old model writhes, twists and dances along with I'll Be There, Chic's first new song in decades. Co-founder and lead guitarist Nile Rodgers enlisted the help of the 22-year-old supermodel for the video that harks back to the band's Seventies heyday, when hits like Le Freak dominated the dancefloor. Scroll down for video . Fashion meets music: Nile Rodgers enlisted Karlie Kloss for Chic's comeback music video for I'll Be There . As the music starts, Karlie  is pictured relaxing in her living room surrounded by old disco records . The video starts with the former Victoria's Secret Angel relaxing at home, watching footage of Chic performing on Seventies television programme Soul Train. Lying on the carpet sporting a provocative off-the-shoulder jumper, high white socks and just her underwear the supermodel, writes and kicks her legs. She's surrounded by records produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers by artists including Madonna and Diana Ross, and she clutches on the group's own records to her chest. Kloss then decides to try on an array of minuscule sparkly dresses, until settling on a skin-tight white flared cut-out jumpsuit, before attending a party where Chic are playing live. At the bash, she is seen frolicking on stage with choreographer and legendary fashion insider, Stephen Galloway, as well as the modern-day Chic line-up. While dance music fans are excited about the new Chic release, fashion insiders are captivated by the high fashion looks picked by Lady Gaga's stylist Brandon Maxwell. The 22-year-old playfully writhes around on the floor, surrounded by vintage vinyl records . He said the first scenes are a Flashdance reference and Karlie's later seen pulling on a tight pearl-encrusted dress by Adam Sellman. But her big moment comes when she dons a clinging  white Versace jumpsuit as she joins the band at a party that was actually held at New York Fashion Week in September, . Brandon told hollywoodreporter.com: 'I had seen her come down the runway in Paris and seen her at a party that night, wearing the jumpsuit and dancing around and flipping her hair everywhere, so as soon as we got those references for the video, I knew we had to have that exact jumpsuit by Versace.' Yet the outfits for the video almost looked very different. He told the site: 'That [Versace] jumpsuit almost didn't make it so we were counting down, checking every five minutes to see if it was coming. It ended up getting stuck because of the snow storm so it was delayed on a flight.' Kloss is dancing to footage of CHIC performing on famous 70's television programme, Soul Train . Everybody dance: Kloss gets ready to go to the Chic party and tries on an array of Seventies mini-dresses, including a pearl-encrusted number by Adam Selman . In the mood for disco: I'll Be There is the 22-year-old model's music video debut . The funky music video was directed by famous Dutch photographer duo, Inez and Vinoodh (Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin), who were also responsible for Lady Gaga's Applause. And in it Karlie braves cold, windy temperatures as she emerges from a cab before joining the revellers inside. Nile - who also produced Madonna's album Like A Virgin, David Bowie's Let's Dance and Duran Duran's album, Notorious - posted on his Facebook page: '#I'llBeThere is a moving concept for me about decisions we make in life. 'We've tried to capture all the nuances in the full length video and still keep it fun. Karlie Kloss connects the past and present. 'She sees the original group (who plays this track) on Soul Train. 'She, visualizes the past looking at old school vinyl - then gets dressed and goes out to a current party to meet up with Stephen Galloway and the current line-up happens to be playing live.' Kloss eventually stuns in a Versace Seventies-style flared jumpsuit and frolics with Chic's current collective . The song is a tribute to CHIC's original bassist and vocalist, Bernard Edwards, who passed away in 1996 . Chic became synonymous with New York's disco scene, with hits including Everybody Dance, I Want Your Love and Dance, Dance, Dance. I'll Be There is a tribute to Chic's original bassist and vocalist, Bernard Edwards, who was discovered dead in a Tokyo hotel room in 1996 by Nile Rodgers during one of the group's world tours. It's based on an old Chic demo called Love Somebody Today, which features all of the original members of the band. Rodgers said: 'These recently-found lost tapes gives me the opportunity to play with my bandmates, who've passed away, again.' The band is currently experiencing something of a revival as the Chic founder played guitar and co-wrote Daft Punk's inescapably catchy hit Daft Punk. Karlie Kloss recently announced she would be hanging up her Victoria's Secret Angel wings to pursue her studies.

"Alastair Cook fell cheaply for the second time in the match for MCC against county champions Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi. Cook, who made just three in the first innings, mustered five at his second attempt on Tuesday morning before his attempt to dispatch a short ball from Jack Brooks went straight into the hands of Adil Rashid at midwicket. The England Test captain will next week depart for his first assignment of this Ashes year - to take on the West Indies in the Caribbean. Alastair Cook fell cheaply for the second time in the match for MCC against county champions Yorkshire . Cook, who made just three in the first innings, mustered five at his second attempt on Tuesday morning . But he will do so on the back of two failures in his only two first-class innings since last season. Cook caused a stir last week when he described England's decision to replace him as their World Cup captain as 'probably wrong', in hindsight. The opener continued his poor form in a one-day international series in Sri Lanka late last year, and England responded by dropping him in favour of Eoin Morgan. They went on, however, to make an embarrassing early exit from the global tournament in Australia and New Zealand - beating only minnows Scotland and Afghanistan, and eliminated by a defeat against Bangladesh. The England Test captain has struggled for form with the bat and heads to the West Indies in terrible nick . Jack Brooks (third from left) celebrates after dismissing Cook early on for Yorkshire . Cook agreed to play for MCC against Yorkshire at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, in the traditional curtain-raiser for the new season. But there has been no return to form for England's most prolific Test centurion - who is without an international hundred in any format since May 2013. MCC were in a spot of bother too after his early dismissal, on 30 for one and still needing another 121 runs merely to avoid an innings defeat.","Alastair Cook out made just five for the MCC against Yorkshire .

"Robin van Persie has targeted the Manchester derby on April 12 for his return from injury. The Manchester United striker has missed the last five games after suffering ankle ligament damage in the 2-1 defeat at Swansea more than a month ago. But Van Persie believes he will be back in time for the Premier League clash with City at Old Trafford as Louis van Gaal’s side fight for second place with their neighbours, who are currently two points ahead. The Dutchman scored a memorable late winner at the Etihad in 2012 to help United seize the title back from City.

The Dutchman scored a memorable late winner at the Etihad in 2012 to help United seize the title . Van Persie has spent some time at home in Holland during his layoff, but he has been working hard in the gym under the supervision of United physio Matt Radcliffe and is expected to step up his rehabilitation during the international break. United have coped well in Van Persie’s absence, winning all four Premier League games – beating top-four rivals Liverpool and Tottenham – but lost in the FA Cup against his old club Arsenal. The 31-year-old has scored 10 goals in 26 games for his club this season, although he admitted in January that his form has not been good enough and is uncertain if United will offer him a contract extension before his current deal runs out in 15 months’ time.

"The heat is on and there are contrasting statements from some of the Premier League’s most prominent managers. Manuel Pellegrini loftily announces that he has no need to win trophies to keep his job at Manchester City. Brendan Rodgers openly admits that unless he had put Liverpool back in the running for honours he would have been sacked. Louis van Gaal urgently instructs his Manchester United players to minimise passes back to their goalkeeper in an attempt to pacify fans who are demanding a return to the attacking style of Sir Alex Ferguson. Manuel Pellegrini claims he does not need to win trophies to hold on to the Manchester City reins . Louis van Gaal has told his players not to pass back to keeper David de Gea to improve United's tempo . Roberto Martinez airily falls back on the support of his chairman Bill Kenwright as Everton drift, as if rudderless, towards the rapids of the drop zone. Get real, Senors Pellegrini and Martinez. Right on, Mister Rodgers and Meneer Van Gaal. Complacency has never been a recipe for security in the football management game and you begin to fear for Pellegrini and Martinez as the season heads towards the home straight. Pellegrini’s calm intelligence and fine football principles have won our admiration but he is kidding himself if he truly believes it when he says: ‘I’m not under any pressure to win titles. It’s about playing with style. We won’t change. It’s not about my relationship with the owners. They are not so desperate to win.’ Oh, really? Good luck with that one if after they spend so much money you come up short of Chelsea in your defence of the Premier League title and Barca finish you off in the Champions League. And it didn’t look that good against gallant Leicester on Wednesday night. Martinez comes across as honest – albeit painfully so at times – as well as a smooth media operator but he may be taking a little too much for granted when he says: ‘I was always aware of the support I would get from the chairman.’ Roberto Martinez has suffered second season syndrome at Everton with the Toffees perilously perched . Brendan Rodgers was candid about his chances of survival before Liverpool's remarkable turnaround . Beware the good old vote of confidence, Roberto, and let’s hope you don’t come to re-evaluate something else you’ve just said about Mr Kenwright: ‘Bill is a mad Evertonian.’ Fanatical fans are not usually very forgiving of only one win in a run of a dozen games including that tepid defeat at Stoke. Rodgers and Van Gaal, meanwhile, are sensibly watching their backs. Not long ago I had occasion to chide Rodgers in this column for doing too much talking about himself but seemingly not enough work on a Liverpool team sliding into crisis. Since then he has seen the warning signs and cleverly switched to a positive 3-4-3 formation which has turned them into the form team of the Premier League and he freely declares now: ‘I’ve learned that if the team is not functioning it doesn’t matter how much support you have in the boardroom. You have to win.’ So it’s well done to him. Since losing to United on December 14, Liverpool have won nine and drawn three in the Premier League . Van Gaal is proving himself shrewd enough to know that sometimes not even a run of only two defeats in 21 matches is enough at a club as huge as United. The Old Trafford faithful are chanting ‘attack, attack, attack’ while his raft of expensive imports – including £60million record signing Angel di Maria – are struggling to comes to terms with the quick-fire culture of the game in England. And the manager hears them: ‘I agree with the fans that we don’t have to use the goalkeeper so much. That there are times when we could play at a higher tempo.’ United are approaching a potentially season-defining sequence of matches against Spurs, Liverpool, City and Chelsea in the League and Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-finals and he promises: ‘We can improve.’ So it’s well done to him, too. This quartet are not the only managers sweating in the boiler room of big-time football. Heaven knows, for example, what poor old Gus Poyet was burbling on about in his bottle-kicking rant during Sunderland’s fractious draw at Hull this midweek. Or whether his sanity will hold up under the pressure of fighting to stave off relegation without his star England winger Adam Johnson following his arrest on suspicion of having sex with an underage girl. Angel di Maria trudges off to be substituted after another disappointing outing against Newcastle . Hull boss Steve Bruce and Sunderland's Gus Poyet played down their spat and have since shaken hands . The trapdoor is beginning to creak under some auspicious names. Don’t feel too sorry for them if it swings open. Unlike the great managers of yore – even Sir Alex was financially strapped in his early years astride the hot seat – these celebrities are paid millions to cope with the pressures. Like several of their more immediate predecessors, they would not necessarily be obliged to find another job after the pay-off. It’s mostly the pride that’s in danger of being hurt. There is one lesson above all others which England’s rugby goliaths need to heed from that Six Nations defeat in Ireland. Brawn alone will not be enough to win the World Cup this autumn, even on home turf. Stuart Lancaster’s pack is a monster, right enough, but you cannot simply shove, bore and batter your way to glory against the best teams on the planet in the Test matches which matter above all others. England will need more than a game based around brute force if they are to succeed in the World Cup . Ireland gave Chris Robshaw his men a lesson and the Red Rose will need to regroup - and add guile . You have to play some football, at least, when it comes to Ireland, probably France, even more so New Zealand. Sir Clive Woodward had Martin Johnson the Enforcer but he also got the sparkling best out of Jonny Wilkinson, whose phenomenal kicking blinded many to his creative talents. Lancaster has Chris Robshaw the Mighty. He also has at his disposal the mercurial genius of Danny Cipriani, who he leaves parked on the bench. There is no reward without risk. There was an awed reaction to my reminiscence earlier this week of how Tottenham’s late, great Dave Mackay refused to believe he had broken his left leg for a second time until he stamped his foot and the jagged white bone stuck out through his sock…then spurned the stretcher and insisted on walking off. So don’t be too surprised if this much loved and revered iron Scot arrives at the funeral on his own two feet.

"England’s fourth Six Nations runners-up finish in succession has been labelled ‘unacceptable’ by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie with head coach Stuart Lancaster told his side’s performances must improve in time for the World Cup. Lancaster’s men suffered championship heartache on Saturday as their thrilling 55-35 victory over France at Twickenham – watched by a record audience of 9.6 million on terrestrial television audience – saw them fall six points short of securing a Six Nations first title since he was appointed in 2012. Instead, his side had to settle for yet another second-place finish in their last competitive tournament before September’s World Cup, and Ritchie expressed his displeasure at the overall outcome. Another Six Nations runner-up spot for England is unacceptable, RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie has said . Ritchie feels Stuart Lancaster's men can win the Rugby World Cup despite their Six Nations second place . ‘Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about,’ he said. ‘If you go back through history, bearing in mind a lot of things, we should be, as a country, winning more in terms of Grand Slams, Six Nations championships, other things. ‘We had opportunities. ‘Let's be clear – entirely in our control. The Irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches. We did not do enough over the five matches. There's no point in bleating about it. ‘We simply didn't take opportunities, didn't do what we should have done, were not clever enough during parts of the game in order to deserve to win.’ England finished second to Ireland by a difference of six points, just falling short of top spot . Chris Robshaw was left devastated after his side ended up being Six Nations runners-up again . Robshaw shakes hands with Referee Nigel Owens  at the end of theSix Nations match  at Twickenham . England’s coaches were badly hamstrung by injuries in the build up to the tournament, with 11 players ruled out of their opening win over Wales in Cardiff and first-choice stars Manu Tuilagi, Joe Launchbury, Ben Morgan and Owen Farrell absent for the duration. That resulted in the emphasis being placed in youngsters such as George Ford, Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph with Lancaster and his staff keen to highlight the depth that has emerged. ‘We're developing, this is a development opportunity' – I don't take that,’ Ritchie added. ‘I don't think we're in a development phase. ‘We should be going into every game, doing our utmost to win and to win well. We've got the resources, the talent, the ability. Saturday was a fantastic example of that. ‘We've got to make sure we come out for the World Cup and deliver.’ Jules Plisson, Robshaw, Loann Goujon and Luther Burrell all challenge for the ball at Twickenham .

"Kevin Pietersen has agreed a release from his Indian Premier League contract as he seeks a new deal with Surrey to try to reignite his hopes of an England recall. Pietersen was axed by England in February 2014 after their whitewash in Australia, but is hoping for a still unlikely international return in time for this summer's Ashes rematch. He confirmed, on his website kevinpietersen.com that he has taken another key step to that end by agreeing a release from the majority of his contract with the Sunrisers Hyderabad. Kevin Pietersen's plans to return to county cricket with Surrey have moved a significant step closer . Pietersen said: 'I'm hugely grateful for all the support and understanding I've received from everyone at the Sunrisers and the IPL. 'My focus is now very much on the upcoming season in England, and I'm absolutely determined to score as many runs as possible.' Surrey de-registered Pietersen at the end of last season but have nonetheless long been front-runners to re-sign him. His availability for all formats, as soon as possible, has appeared a starting point for that to happen - and Pietersen's presence in early season, rather than spending six weeks at the IPL, is therefore a key development. Pietersen plays a shot on the second day of the Ashes series between England and Australia last year . New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves this month revived the record-breaking 34-year-old batsman's hopes of a return to the fold, contrary to the public remarks by anyone else associated with the governing body. But a pre-requisite from Graves was that Pietersen must first of all find a way back into county cricket - and then, of course, start scoring runs again. Pietersen may still be recalled by the Sunrisers for just a one-week period, should they qualify for the IPL knockout stages between May 19 and May 24. That, however, ought not to be an insurmountable problem for any county interested in securing his services. Pietersen bats for Melbourne Stars during the Big Bash League semi-final match against the Perth Scorchers . He added: 'I've never made any secret of my overwhelming desire to once again represent England, and I'm going to do everything in my power to earn a recall to the international set-up. 'To once again put on that England shirt would be a privilege and an honour, but now I have to focus on performing domestically and give myself the best possible chance of meriting selection.' A statement on his website spelled out Pietersen's next move - without specifying Surrey as his immediate destination - and that he has his heart set on an England return in time for the start of the Ashes in July. Pietersen was involved in a high-profile dispute with England coach Peter Moores back in 2009 . It read: 'The four-time Ashes winner, who is also England's highest ever runscorer in all formats, will ... join a domestic county with the aim of earning a place in the England squad for the upcoming Ashes series.' Pietersen quickly made it clear at the start of this month that he was delighted to take Graves at his word, that the slate will be wiped clean for all under his tenure, and he has since confirmed he has already spoken to the incoming chairman on the telephone. The controversial South Africa-born batsman has received little encouragement yet from other quarters. Former England star Pietersen previously rubbished claims suggesting his best days are behind him . ECB managing director Paul Downton pinpointed Pietersen's 'disengagement' with his team-mates during his last Test match to date - the defeat in Sydney which consigned England to their 5-0 2013/14 Ashes whitewash. Downton has not shifted from that in the intervening months. When England announced their squad last week, to travel under Alastair Cook and without Pietersen for three Tests in the West Indies, national selector James Whitaker repeated many times that he is simply 'not part of our plans'. Pietersen, however, has said he will 'do anything' to play for England again.","Kevin Pietersen agrees release from his Indian Premier League contract .

"Diego Simeone has signed a new contract at Atletico Madrid that will keep him at the club until 2020. The current Spanish champions have long since made it clear they want the Argentine coach to be ‘their Sir Alex Ferguson’ and build an empire in Madrid. And finally on Monday negotiations concluded with Simeone’s sister and agent, Natalia, over a new deal that extends his current commitment to 2017 by three years and raises his annual net salary to £4.4m. Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has signed a contract extension at the club until 2020 . Simeone has pledged his future to Atletico for the next five years, with the aim of building an empire . The contract includes a clause allowing him to leave at the end of a season for reduced compensation . All but confirming he had received offers from other clubs Simeone said: ‘I have chosen to stay here because the club is growing. 'It is strong and that fills me with enthusiasm. In life it is difficult to choose sometimes but I am sure about the decision I have taken.’ Confirmation of Simeone’s loyalty to the club where he won La Liga last season will disappoint a clutch of Premier League clubs interested in his services but the deal is believed to include a clause that would allow him to leave for a reduced compensation package if he did so at the end of any given season. Atletico Madrid are now 20 per cent owned by Chinese corporation Wanda and Simeone has been told money will be available in the summer without the need to cash in on top players as in previous seasons. He has already made a summer shortlist of transfer targets and recouping Chelsea full-back Felipe Luis and signing Villarreal striker Luciano Vietto are part of it. Simeone led Atletico Madrid to the Champions League final last year and has been on the radar of both Manchester United and Manchester City in the past year and Chelsea before they hired Jose Mourinho for a second time. The Argentine revealed he had the chance to join other clubs, but chose to stay in Madrid with Atletico .

"Radamel Falcao has admitted for the first time that he is likely to leave Manchester United at the end of the season. The Colombia star has stayed silent amid speculation that United will reject the opportunity to turn his £5million loan from Monaco into a permanent £43m deal. But Falcao conceded on Tuesday that he will probably have to look elsewhere for regular first-team football, having not started a game under Louis van Gaal for the last month. Radamel Falcao dropped a major hint that he could leave Manchester United when his loan expires . ‘Obviously I need to find a place where I have continuity and can play,’ Falcao said in Bahrain, where Colombia play a friendly on Thursday. ‘I think any footballer needs to play and is happy playing. ‘So when the championship ends surely I’ll sit down, do an analysis and decide what’s best for me.’ Falcao has scored just four goals in 22 appearances for United, where he earns £280,000 a week, and was made to play for the club’s Under 21 team earlier this month. His mentor and former agent, Silvano Espindola, revealed last week that the player has been reduced to tears by his treatment at Old Trafford. Liverpool are being linked with the 29-year-old striker but it is understood that Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Valencia are more likely destinations. The Colombian has been more used to starting from the bench for the Reds this season . ‘Calls come every day so in that sense I’ve got to stay calm, but I keep on the fringe of them, there are people who deal with all that situation,’ said Falcao. ‘I owe myself to Manchester United at the moment, I have faith and hope because lots of things can happen in the number of matches remaining. I will continue to fight to the end at Manchester United.’ While United are happy to let Falcao leave Old Trafford, they will do all they can to ensure that £59.7m record signing Angel di Maria stays. The Argentine is said to be unsettled in England just seven months after arriving from Real Madrid. Falcao came on as a substitute in United's win against Liverpool on Sunday and has scored just six goals . Di Maria’s form has dipped after a bright start and his family have been unhappy since an attempted break-in at their Cheshire home last month. United midfielder Marouane Fellaini, meanwhile, has refuted suggestions that his presence in the team leads to a long-ball game, saying: ‘We play beautiful football.’ Robin van Persie could return against Manchester City on April 12 following a month out with ankle ligament damage. United have no plans to let £59.7million record signing Angel di Maria leave the club in the summer though .","Manchester United's loan of Radamel Falcao hasn't worked out .

"Harry Kane stepped out for his first senior England training session at St George's Park on Tuesday morning and it would seem Roy Hodgson is planning to throw the Tottenham striker in at the deep end. According to Hodgson's training notes, Kane was part of a two-man attack alongside Three Lions captain Wayne Rooney in what seemed to be plans for a five-a-side match. The 21-year-old's name was written next to Rooney's with two large circles around each and in front of a back three of Kyle Walker, Gary Cahill and Kieran Gibbs.

Kane looked at ease during a light warm-up as he jogged alongside fellow uncapped Spurs team-mate Ryan Mason, who was drafted in to the squad after Adam Lallana withdrew because of a groin injury. Before training began, Rooney was presented with England Player of the Year award as voted for by fans, while Chelsea youngster Dominic Solanke received the Young Player of the Year gong before joining Hodgson's squad for Tuesday's session. James Milner, Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines trained in the gym as part of their usual regimes while Jordan Henderson and Michael Carrick only took part in the first half of the session. Speaking of his first England call-up, Kane said recently: 'I can't wait. It has been a dream to be called up but obviously I want to go and play.

After assessing the results, the England medical staff decided Sturridge would not be able to play in the upcoming matches and sent the striker back to Liverpool. Sturridge's withdrawal is unfortunate for the player and Hodgson, who has not been able to select the 25-year-old since September. As one of just three strikers in the 24-man party, Kane now has a good chance of starting either the Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley or the friendly in Turin four days later.

"Police surveillance video shown publicly for the first time Tuesday shows Secret Service agents in their government vehicle driving through the secured area and nudging a temporary barrier at low speed as it drove toward a checkpoint. The incident occurred as on-duty officers and agents investigated a suspicious package thrown near the White House on March 4 – and an accompanying threat that it contained a bomb. The House Oversight Committee showed the video from the Washington Metropolitan Police Department during a hearing on Capitol Hill. Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy was testifying for the third time about the incident, in which two senior agents are accused of drinking before driving into the White House complex and pushing the barrier with the SUV's bumper. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This screen grab from a police video shows a March 4, 2015 incident involving allegedly drunk Secret Service agents who hit a White House barricade while a suspicious package was under investigation nearby . NUDGED IT THIS MUCH: Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the third such grilling he's endured in the last week . ANONYMOUS EMAIL: The House Oversight Committee heard testimony about how Clancy learned about the incident – after this message had already circulated among agents for several days . Clancy has been criticized for the agency's handling of the incident. He has said he was out of the loop in the days that followed. 'The fact that I did not learn about this allegation until five days [afterward] ... infuriates me,' he told the congressional panel. 'This is unacceptable. Our mission is too important for this to happen. It undermines my leadership.' He said he only learned about the incident from discussions about an anonymous email that was circulating within the agency. The email described the off-duty agents as 'both extremely intoxicated' and confused about the bomb investigation underway near where their vehicle came to rest. It said uniformed Secret Service officers at the scene 'were going to arrest both of them, but the UD (Uniform Division) watch commander said not to.' 'A liot of people got this email,' fumed Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the oversight committee's ranking Democrat. 'A lot of them got it,' he blared at Clancy, but you didn't!' Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the committee's chairman, angrily recounted a series of events including an 11-minutes stretch of time the Secret Service let the suspicious package lay near the White House before evacuating the area. 'I don’t understand how that happens,' he said. DC Metropolitan Police video shows a car delivering a suspicious package to the White House perimeter; the woman driving claimed it contained a bomb . Minutes later an SUV driven by an agent who had been drinkign at a retirement party drove into a Secret Service barricade near the scene of the 'bomb' investigation . Clancy, a former top agent on President Obama's protective detail, came out of retirement to lead the Secret Service after a series of scandals forced out his predecessor, Julia Pierson . The March 4 debacle was part of 'a litany of recent mishaps,' Chaffet lectured, which 'raise major concerns' about the Secret Service's ability to protect the presidential mansion and the first family. 'This has to stop,' he said. 'We need to understand why these incidents keep happening.' The Homeland Security Department's inspector general is investigating allegations against the agents. Lawmakers asked to speak with the agents involved, as well as Secret Service supervisors who were on duty that night, during the hearing. The Secret Service declined to make them available and Clancy appeared alone. In a written statement, Clancy said the case remains under investigation and any appropriate discipline will be imposed afterward. Clancy also announced a new policy put in place after acknowledging that some video of the March 4 incident had been deleted. The video was shown to a crowded hearing room on Capitol Hill as a helpless Clancy watched . Ultimately the Secret Service agents on duty determined that the package wasn't dangerous – but the agents in the SUV couldn't have known that . Clancy said the agency will start retaining routine surveillance video for seven days. Previously, surveillance recordings that weren't being used as part of ongoing investigations were deleted after 72 hours. Chaffetz said it was 'highly suspicious' the video was deleted. 'We asked Director Clancy to turn over video footage of the incident. He said no,' Chaffetz fumed on Tuesday.","March 4 incident involved allegedly drunk senior agents who drove into the White House complex in a government vehicle .

"Following Sunday's El Clasico spectacle that hugely intensified the run-in for the La Liga title between Barcelona and Real Madrid, Rio Ferdinand gave his stance on the age-old debate of who is better: Cristano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi? Choosing to stay somewhat impartial to the discussion the former England international says we should stand back and appreciate the sheer brilliance we are witnessing in the presence of two of the world's greatest ever players. 'It's inevitable we do all this ""who's better? Blah, blah, blah"" but we should just be enjoying being around these two players and seeing it,' the QPR defender said. Rio Ferdinand (right) speaks to the camera alongside Queen's Park Rangers team-mate Bobby Zamora . Lionel Messi is La Liga's top scorer this season with 32 goals but Cristiano Ronaldo is not far behind . The Real Madrid striker's goal in El Clasico on Sunday took him to just one goal behind the Barcelona forward . 'When Ronaldo, the Brazilian one - who should have been the best if he weren't injured - was scoring 30 goals a season [everybody said]: ""Oh he's a genius, he's the best ever.""' Messi and Ronaldo are this season's top scorers in La Liga, with 32 and 31 goals respectively with 10 games to go. Speaking from his car, kitted out with an X-Box and television screen, the former Manchester United star posted an image on Instagram of himself and Hoops team-mate Bobby Zamora. The two were taking each other on in an in-car game of FIFA whilst travelling to training at the Imperial College Sports Ground, London.

"David Beckham has a whole host of celebrity friends and it appears he's added tennis superstar Rafael Nadal to the ever growing list. The former footballer was out celebrating fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger's birthday and posed for a snap with the Spaniard. Beckham is currently out in United States discussing plans for his proposed MLS franchise, while Nadal is in preparing to play in the Miami Open with the first round getting underway on Thursday. David Beckham (left) and Rafael Nadal posed for a photo with singer Thalia at the birthday event . The sporting superstars were out celebrating fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger's (left) birthday in Miami . The ex-England captain revealed plans to launch a new $25 million MLS franchise after exercising an option tied into the lucrative contract he signed after making a potentially risky move from Madrid to Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. But the development of a new stadium has hit a snag, with an adequate location yet to be approved; team management, name and kit colours have also yet to be finalised by Beckham and his fellow investors. In March, a Beckham source told The Guardian: ‘Things are progressing in Miami, and we are very much on track in our plans. The Spaniard is in the USA to play in the Miami Open and is expected to be fit despite rolling his ankle . ‘David Beckham is very positive about the future of the club and he continues to enjoy incredible support from the people in Miami. ‘Right now, our focus is on identifying the location for a purpose-built stadium that will be the team’s permanent home.’ Nadal had an injury scare during a hitting session with Grigor Dimitrov on Monday morning. After appearing to role his ankle, the No 2 seed limped off before being seen moving a lot more freely as he returned to his car - much to the relief of the competition organisers.

"Katie's approach to weight loss is five parts stick, zero parts carrot . Overweight children are the latest target for serial ranter Katie Hopkins. The controversial columnist has said that fat children should be forced to attend special sports schools until they shed excess weight. Writing in her column for Now! magazine, the 39-year-old said: 'The most upsetting thing of all is a fat child. 'Watching fat parents drop their fat kids off at school in their cars makes me so angry my teeth itch and my nipples twizzle.' The mother-of-three adds in her video blog for the magazine that she blames the parents for children with weight problems: 'I've always said that a fat child lives in the shadow of a fat parent. 'The fat kids go through the school gates and there's the fat mum in the car, who doesn't bother to get out, still wearing her pyjamas...and that really does my head in.' Citing government statistics that say one-in-10 four-year-olds are now overweight, the Celebrity Big Brother star even goes as far to say that, if she had her way, fat children would be 'sent to special sports schools until they make the grade.' Hopkins also opines that she thinks people in England are far too soft on 'fat shaming'. 'There's loads of fat kids and we don't say anything because that would be fat-shaming, or bullying...well, I disagree completely. 'In England, we're far too soft on it and we seem to think it's okay that people are pureeing KFC to spoon-feed to their babies.' Earlier this year, the opinionated former Apprentice star filmed herself gaining and losing four stone in an effort to prove that obesity is purely the fault of the person carrying the weight. Katie has form with insulting overweight people. On her television show Making My Fat, she was kicked out of an 800lb woman's house after rows. Now, she's turned her venom to children, saying obese kids should go to 'special sports schools' until they make the grade' Katie before her own weight gain (left) and after (right) In the programme, Katie was frequently seen bursting into floods of tears over her new body shape, but also over the amount of food that she has to eat every day to put on the weight. She loaded up on junk food every couple of hours, setting herself a target of 5,000 calories every day. Katie's doctor advised her not to go through with the programme, warning the star that she faced a number of health problems including liver strain, damaged knees, altered blood chemistry, and stretched skin among other issues. But she persisted with the experiment, going so far as to travel to North Carolina in the US to take part in an eating competition. Katie reveals she had to sleep next to a sick bucket  because overeating made her feel so nauseous . At the fast food restaurant, customers are given 20 minutes to consume a monster burger, containing a kilo of meat and 8,000 calories. Katie gave the meal her best shot, but only succeeded in consuming around half. She said: 'There are two kids in there who are around 15 or 16 years old and they must weigh between 200 pounds (14.2 stone) and 300 pounds (21 stone) each. 'I can't understand why no one is telling them to stop. 'I feel really sorry for those children. Their parents were just there watching them eat. 'I just want to go and ask them to stop. 'I couldn't do that to my children. I could never feed my children to death.' Katie also visited an American called Nicky, a woman who weighs 803lb (57 stone). Nicky is often confined to her house because of the weight that she carries around. While the women initially got on like a house on fire, Katie quickly insulted Nicky and the women became embroiled in an argument, which saw her asked to leave the house. The TV star was unrepentant, telling the cameras: 'There is no way she is really happy. 'She has managed to become happy with what she has got by accepting it's rubbish. 'I would rather be put down than be Nicky.' Making My Fat followed Katie Hopkins as she gained 4st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day, then lost the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise . The end of the programme saw Katie engage in extreme eating to try and put on the weight, gorging on 400 calories every couple of hours. Katie Hopkins strikes fear into the hearts of many people in the UK - she recently came second in a poll of the world's most hated people. The television star's documentary made her so disliked among larger ladies and men that they actively try to avoid her. She told FEMAIL: 'Fat people can be quite afraid of me, there is this sort of Hopkins fear. 'A lot of them will actually cross the road to avoid me if they see me walking down the street. Katie said she wanted her TLC documentary to start a debate about the nation's obesity crisis . 'Others will present me with their excuses before I have even opened my mouth, which is weird because it's not like I go around judging me all of the time. 'Fat mums completely avoid me, but that’s fine.' Katie has had a bee in her bonnet about overweight men and women for a couple of years. Last year she made headlines around the world after she revealed that she wouldn't hire a fat person because they are 'lazy'. So in the last six months, the 39-year-old decided to put on 30 per cent of her body weight in just three months and then lose it just as quickly, to prove that larger people only have themselves to blame for piling on the pounds. The star has very little time for larger people, admitting than she can hardly bear to touch anyone carrying a little extra fat, but she has even less for their excuses. Instead of laying the blame for Britain's obesity problem at the door of the takeaway shops and junk food companies, Katie says it is the fault of the individual and they need to be aware that it is not okay to look as they do. Katie said: 'At my heaviest during this television experiment, I weighed 12 stone. 'Nowadays, I hear a lot of women say 12st isn’t that big - they say that because you can be 12 stone and a size 14. 'But it's strange idea that we think 12st isn’t that big, I actually find it very alarming. 'We keep pushing up the boundaries, first of all 10st wasn't that big, then 11st and now 12st. 'I really worry about the re-sizing that we have done as a nation. 'By putting size 16 models in Debenhams shop windows and embracing bigger seats, bigger beds and bigger geriatric ambulances - we are re-scaling what we perceive as normal.' The controversial figure claims that while she didn't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children, gaining 3st pushing her weight over 11st  'killed her' and left her in constant floods . But while Katie thinks the plus-size models in Debenhams shop windows are unacceptable, the super-skinny mannequins that recently caused an uproar in Topshop are acceptable in her eyes. She said: 'I don’t mind skinny mannequins. 'I didn’t think that they were particularly skinny, I thought that they looked pretty alright. 'There are a lot of kids at that age who are relatively skinny. I was a pretty skinny kid. 'In terms of sizing, Mango starts their plus-size collection at a size 12 and I’ve always said that size 12 is a size called fat. 'Because for me, it’s not necessarily that a size 12 is fat, it’s so that people can have a sense of what is normal. 'I believe that we take our cues on what is normal from what we see on the high street and as we are getting bigger, we are just re-sizing or super-sizing what we think is normal.' In part two of Katie's documentary she debated diet bloggers and plus-size campaigners . Katie's approach to weight loss is five parts stick, zero parts carrot. Asked about a fat tax as a potential solution, making customers pay a heftier tax on junk food than healthy produce, Katie scoffs and suggests a far more radical option. She says: 'I’m not averse to the idea of a fat tax, but I would go much more brutal than that. 'I think the fact that we don’t own our problems in this country is the biggest issue that we have. 'For instance, our NHS in this country is free at point of use, but most people perceive that as completely free. 'Therefore, any problem that they create with their body is also free, with someone else footing the bill.' She continued: 'Obese people are bankrupting us - they cost us something like £17.4 billion last year. 'We need to make these people own the problem. So, we should have a social security insurance scheme, whereby people are charged if they don’t make a genuine effort to look after their own health. 'If you don’t look after your own health, guess what? You’re going to pay more. So if you smoke, guess what? You’re going to pay more. You drink too much, guess what? You’re going to pay more. 'And if you eat yourself into being morbidly obese, then you’re going to pay for your hip operation as well. 'That would make people own their problems better than some kind of fat tax. 'Because this tea and sympathy lark just isn't working.'","Controversial columnist says she finds 'fat children' upsetting .

"Real Madrid youngster Jack Harper has been snubbed by Scotland Under-19s manager Ricky Sbragia because he is a 'luxury' player who isn't big enough. The young Scots travel to play three games against Austria, Italy and Croatia in the UEFA Under-19s Championship. Highly-rated forward Harper who has netted three goals for Real Madrid in this season's UEFA Youth League, is midway through a five-year deal at the Bernabeu, and can count former club legend Zinedine Zidane as one of his coaches. Real Madrid youngster Jack Harper in action against Ludogorets in the UEFA Youth League match . Scotland Under-19s manager Ricky Sbragia has left Harper out of his squad for the upcoming games . Among Harper's coaches at Real Madrid are former France international Zinedine Zidane (centre) He's already been linked with a move to both Liverpool and Manchester United, but that hasn't been enough to earn him a spot in the squad, despite playing in the qualifiers in Lithuania. However, former Sunderland boss Sbragia has explained it's nothing personal with the 19-year-old, he's just gone for a more physical approach, despite Harper standing at over 6ft tall. Sbragia explained: 'Our concentration is on the opening game with Austria and we've deliberately got more height in our squad. That's one of the reasons why Jack isn't in. 'Unfortunately, I don't see enough of him in action. The last time he was with us, he did OK, but I wanted a little more impact. At Real Madrid he can float all over the place, which he does. But with us, he has to be more disciplined. 'He's an exceptionally gifted lad, but sometimes we can't carry him. He can be a luxury sometimes. In some cases, if it's going well, he can be a good luxury.' Highly rated forward Harper has already been linked with moves to Manchester United and Liverpool . But the ex-Manchester United reserve team coach still believes Harper has a big future ahead of him. Sbragia stressed: 'Listen, Jack's time will come. The last time I spoke to him, he wanted to really settle in at Real Madrid and find a place there. That's been a big thing for him. 'I've gone with the boys I've seen most in the last six months. We keep tabs on Jack and see video clips of him. We have people over there who keep their eye on him. 'There are others I've left out like Dominic Thomas at Motherwell who will have gripes that they're not in the squad. 'But I've picked a group of 18 which will hopefully do well for us. It's my opinion and I'm not saying it's right. But the squad I've picked is an extremely strong one. 'I can only pick 18 when I really could have picked 26 or 27. I've gone for a physical side and runners. Hopefully I'm right. 'It's purely tactical and there certainly hasn't been a lack of enthusiasm from Jack about playing for Scotland.'

"Rory McIlroy will set out on his quest to join the pantheon of golf's greatest-ever players in a fortnight's time. The world No 1 will arrive at Augusta National hunting the elusive Green Jacket he needs to complete a historic Grand Slam of majors. Only five players have achieved the incredible feat, post-war. But victory at the Masters will elevate the Northern Irishman into the company of legends Gene Sarazen, Gary Player, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. Rory McIlroy hits the gym as he prepares for the Masters at Augusta next month . The Northern Irishman has been pumping iron as he goes hunting for the elusive Green Jacket . McIlroy shows off the US Open trophy to fans back in Northern Ireland four years ago . At times, McIlroy has made it look easy. For the past 73 weeks he has been the leading golfer on the planet, landing The Open and the US PGA Championship along the way. Although the 25-year-old still has a long way to go before surpassing Woods' record of 683 total weeks as world No 1, he is undoubtedly the American's successor as golf's heavyweight star - both on and off the greens. And  his obsession with the gym is giving the star more than a helping hand. 'It was when I started to notice results that I fell in love with it,' said McIlroy, who has offered a fascinating and unique insight into his preparation off the course in this new Nike training video, seen exclusively by Sportsmail. Indeed, McIlroy has bulked up considerably over the past five years with his transformation evident in both stature and presence on the course. Since 2010 he has worked closely with Dr Steve McGregor, a British exercise physiologist who has previously masterminded the fitness programmes for Manchester City and the NBA's New York Knicks. When McIlroy first started with McGregor he could barely stand 10 seconds balancing on one leg. Now, with 14 wins and four majors to his name, he has the muscle strength to last on one leg throughout an entire golf swing. McIlroy is setting out on his quest to join the pantheon of golf's greatest-ever players . The 25-year-old needs a Masters crown to complete a historic Grand Slam of golfing majors . McIlroy won the 143rd Open Championship at Royal Liverpool in Hoylake in July last year . 'I wasn't really big into the gym,' he admits. 'So my physical training was pretty much non-existent from when I turned pro at 18 until I turned 21. 'I had three years when I was playing professionally on the Tour, doing OK but not, I guess, maximising my potential by coming into the gym and doing the work that I needed to do. 'I ended up having a few niggles here and there – a few little injuries which, had I let them go on longer, could have turned into serious issues that could have put me out for a while. 'So it was definitely out of necessity that I started – for injury prevention more than anything else. Then the more you get into, you find yourself wanting to get stronger. You want to see what your limits are and to test your body physically. I really started to get into it and it became part of my lifestyle. Up to that point it hadn't been – I'd just played golf without really training much or watching what I ate. Now, obviously, things are very different. McIlroy won by one stroke to clinch the 96th PGA Championship at Valhalla in August last year . 'It took me four years of training to get my body into the best possible shape for what I do, which ultimately is go out and play golf. I have no ambitions to try and squat 500 pounds like some guys do but I do enough and I'm strong enough to control the golf club the whole way through my swing – that's basically what I need to do. 'For some people [going to the gym] it's just looking in the mirror and feeling better about themselves, or tracking their numbers – lifting bigger, lifting heavier, being able to do more reps with more weight or whatever it is. 'But for me it was being able to stand up, hit 50 drivers in a row and feel no pain in my back. That is what made me realise that training is something I need to do – I need to do this a lot, and if I want to prolong my career as much as I can, I need to keep doing it.' Since 2010 he has worked closely with Dr Steve McGregor, who masterminded Man City's fitness programme . McGregor devises programmes that stretch between six to eight weeks in order to get McIlroy in the best possible shape for major tournaments, with the focus on adding stability, strength and power. During tournament week, McGregor attempts to control McIlroy's desire to post a workout. The superstar will train, on top of his practice range sessions, nearly every day bar the tournament-ending Sunday. At last year's Open at Hoylake, McGregor made McIlroy a deal that he could do a gym session if he shot a round of 67. McIlroy carded a 66. 'I'll do my heavier sessions on Monday and Tuesday, maybe take a day off, and then do a couple of lighter ones over the course of the Thursday, Friday and Saturday,' said McIlroy. 'I'll always give myself Sunday off just as it's the last day of the tournament – maybe I'll go in if I feel like some sort of warm-up session, but nothing more. So two heavier sessions and two lighter sessions.' When McIlroy first started with McGregor he could barely stand 10 seconds balancing on one leg . McIlroy believes his preparation for Augusta has been perfect and the man who finished runner-up to Formula One king Lewis Hamilton at last year's BBC Sports Personality of the Year contest is confident that he stands a good chance of triumphing in Georgia. 'Obviously it's the first really big tournament of the year and it's even bigger for me this time round for a few different reasons,' he added. 'I think I've had a good build-up to it. 'We try to put a lot of work into it at the start of the year, around January and February time, going through different phases of training. Endurance at the start, and then more into a strength phase, before maybe tapering off a little bit in the lead up to the Masters. 'We still work hard the week before but then the week of the tournament we try to taper it down so that I know I'm in great shape and I know I'm ready. I'll have done the volume, I'll have done the workload and I'll just be ready to go out and play.' Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam... now is it time for McIlroy to become the next British champion of the Masters? Indeed, the nation hopes the hard work will ultimately pay off. A grand slam and golf folklore awaits if McIlroy can finally lift the big one.

"Misfiring Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao might be struggling to win over English fans with his modest scoring return of just four goals from 19 games, but he will be pleased to know his popularity hasn't diminished too much abroad. Training with his Colombia team-mates in Barhain ahead of the South American country's mini-Asian tour, Falcao was warmly embraced by one supporter who ran on the pitch to reach him. The young fan, wearing one of United's replica away kits managed to get a selfie with Falcao and the striker's signature on the front of his shirt before being escorted away by security staff.

Security take the boy away from the Colombia squad, but he will no doubt be happy with his actions . The hug will no doubt come as a lift for Falcao who is under huge pressure to improve his poor club form. Previously viewed as one of the game's top marksmen while at Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco, the Colombian has failed to reach those same heights since agreeing to a big-money loan deal at Old Trafford.

"Petr Cech looks set to leave Chelsea in the summer after he revealed he does not want to spend another season as understudy to Thibaut Courtois. The 32-year-old Czech Republic international has lost his place to the young Belgian this term, starting only four Premier League games and being primarily used in the domestic cup competitions. While accepting manager Jose Mourinho's decision, Cech, who can class Arsenal and Real Madrid among his suitors, said the situation could not go on indefinitely. Long-serving Blues goalkeeper Petr Cech is set to end his 11-year stay at Chelsea in the summer . A host of clubs will be interested in signing Cech, with Spanish giants Real Madrid among the frontrunners . 'I don't know what the club's idea will be. It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo,' Cech said. 'But that can work for one season only. I don't want another one like this,' he added while on international duty for the Czech Republic who play Latvia in a Euro 2016 qualifier in Prague on Saturday. Cech joined Chelsea in 2004 and has won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the Champions League and three League Cups, the last of which was this season when he stared ahead of Courtios for the 2-0 defeat of Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley. Cech poses with team-mate Didier Drogba after Chelsea beat Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final . Thibaut Courtois, in action during Chelsea's win over Hull, is now the club's No 1 goalkeeper .

'It will be important to sit down with the club, with the manager, to consider all the pros and cons. We will see what will work out the best.' Asked about a possible move to European champions Real Madrid, Cech said: 'When a specific offer comes I will consider it. There are offers one cannot turn down.' Petr Cech joined Chelsea in 2004.

"Tomas Rosicky has revealed he considered leaving Arsenal in January following a lack of first-team football, but hopes to play a full part in the Gunners' end-of-season run-in. After not starting in the Barclays Premier League until the Boxing Day win over QPR, the Czech playmaker has now chalked up some 23 appearances overall as Arsenal moved back into the top four and also booked a place in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley. Rosicky, 34, has not ruled out extending his stay at the Emirates Stadium club, which has been hampered by an unfortunate series of injuries. Tomas Rosicky has revealed he considered leaving Arsenal in January following a lack of first-team football . 'Since the start of the year things have improved, the team has started to play better football and what's more I'm playing. Compared to the first six months, it's much better. We'll see how it goes from here,' Rosicky said to Czech press, quoted by www.isport.blesk.cz. 'I don't really know [why I didn't play]. It's a good question, I would also like to know. 'The coach gave me a chance towards the end the year and then began to give me more playing time. I don't know, maybe it was a watershed moment.' Rosicky, seen with Olivier Giroud,  hopes to play a full part in the Gunners' end-of-season run-in . Rosicky added: 'We had talked about [me leaving in January] in previous meetings back in September and October, but then the market closed and I couldn't do anything. 'When you don't play a single game in December and the market opens, [the prospect of leaving] is obviously on the agenda. Then you start to have second thoughts. 'It was an exception for me though, I really thought about it. Then Arsenal said stay and that was that. Rosicky, 34, has not ruled out extending his stay at the Emirates Stadium come the end of the season . 'The rest of the season will go quickly, then we'll look for a solution. 'Arsenal is still an option for me next season, the ball is in their court. When I get back from international duty we will start to talk about it. 'There are two options open to me [stay at Arsenal or go elsewhere]. At the moment I am in a situation where I make the decision.' Rosicky fights for the ball with Bayern Munich ace David Alaba in the Champions League . Captain Mikel Arteta is another player whose future has to be resolved, the Spaniard out of contract in the summer, but expected to be offered a one-year extension. Arsenal have most of their first-team squad away on international duty. German midfielder Mesut Ozil missed the win at Newcastle on Saturday through a minor illness, but was subsequently spotted in a Berlin nightclub.

"Kell Brook is ready for his return to the ring just six months on from the machete attack that threatened his life - and he has eyes on the winner of the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao mega-fight later in the year. Brook was left needing 32 metal staples in his left thigh after an unprovoked attack in Tenerife last year but is now suitably prepared to defend his IBF welterweight championship on his hometown return at the Sheffield Motorpoint Arena on Saturday. And Britain's most recent world champion showed off his scars in the ring as he counts down the days to his comeback appearance against Romanian mandatory challenger Jo Jo Dan. Kell Brook is ready to return to the ring against Jo Jo Dan just six months after he suffered a machete attack . Brook showed off the scar on his thigh from the attack (left) before putting in more hours ahead of his return . Brook feared on the night of the attack that he would die, or that he would be unable to walk ever again . Brook feared on the night of the attack that he would die, with blood spurting from his leg - and later admitted that he believed that he may not have been able to walk again. Now, once Brook has completed the first step in his comeback, he intends to take on the winner of May's Mayweather-Pacquiao contest after watching them go head-to-head at Las Vegas' MGM Grand. He has ruled out fighting fellow Brit Amir Khan in order to focus on facing the winner of the fight of the century. Brook says a fight with Amir Khan is not appealing to him now, and he wants to take on a 'massive name' The damage to Brook's leg did not seem to phase the Sheffield fighter as he showed off his skipping skills . Saturday's fight with Jo Jo Dan marks Brooks' return to the right, and he looks in good shape for his comeback . Brook seemed in good spirits as he got back into the ring at the workout on Tuesday afternoon . 'I think the Amir Khan fight is gone for this year,' Brook said. 'I'm the world champion and I will fight some other massive name. I'm not interested in what he does next now. 'It makes sense to do a unification fight. No contact has been made yet with either of them (Mayweather or Pacquiao) and I'm just focusing on my mandatory challenge at the moment, but I want to be involved in the big fights.' Brook had previously talked up the chances of fighting Khan at Wembley Stadium but with all eyes on the Mayweather-Pacquiao contest, which Brook will be attending, his attention has been diverted elsewhere. 'I want Mayweather,' he said. 'I want the best pound-for-pound fighter that everyone has titled him as. I want to fight the very best - I'm in my prime, I'm unbeaten, I'm world champion.'

"Hundreds of supporters flocked to the streets of Edinburgh to mark the passing of Dave Mackay, with  Sir Alex Ferguson leading the tributes. The former Manchester United manager labelled the ex-Hearts and Tottenham enforcer as 'humble', adding that 'he was the bravest man in the world'. Mackay, who was laid to rest in Edinburgh on Tuesday, died earlier this month at the age of 80 and - according to Ferguson - ought to have earned far more caps for Scotland than he did.

Denis Law, Frank McLintock, Ian St John, Alan Mullery and Bertie Auld also attended his funeral in the Scottish capital, with the cortege leaving from his beloved Tynecastle for a remembrance service in the city. Mackay won all three Scottish domestic honours with Hearts in the 1950s and was a key part of Spurs' famous 1961 double-winning team. He was named Footballer of the Year in both Scotland and England, and also starred for Derby County, where he won the First Division title as manager. 'He was a fantastic player,' Ferguson said. 'They talk about this great courage he had and I think that is unfair. I know he was the bravest man in the world but he was a fantastic footballer, he was skilful. 'His personality, his intensity, his desire to win could make any team. And he proved that by going to Derby County and winning the league as a centre-back. He could play anywhere. 'I thought it was a nice piece in the papers about how he said he didn't enjoy seeing that photograph of him and Billy Bremner portraying him as a bully. He said ""I don't like bullies"". 'I think that was exactly what Dave Mackay was like. He was a humble person. Humility is embraced by great people and I think Dave Mackay embraced that thoroughly.

'He protected his modesty with the pride only a Scotsman can do. 'His record's fantastic. It's a privilege to speak here today and I think we have seen the passing of a truly great legend.' Mackay won 22 caps for Scotland and began his career with Hearts in 1953. That is something to rankle with Ferguson. 'Scotland was picked by a committee with their heads in the sand. The fact he has only 22 caps tells you [that],' he added. 'Twenty-two caps for a player as good as that. I could never understand that.' A Mackay scarf displayed in the back of a car in respect of the former Scotland international . He captained Hearts to the Scottish League title during the 1957-58 season and joined Spurs in 1959, helping the north London club become the first English side to win the league and FA Cup double during the 1960-61 season. He joined Derby in 1968 and helped Brian Clough's side win promotion to the First Division the following year before taking up a player-manager role at Swindon Town in 1971. A year later Mackay left to manage Nottingham Forest for a brief spell before succeeding Clough as Derby manager in 1973, with the Rams winning the First Division title in 1975. Ferguson recalled the only time he played against Mackay. 'I was playing for Queen's Park reserves against Hearts reserves at Tynecastle and the great Mackay was playing because he was coming back from a broken toe. 'He tackled me and I thought ""Christ"", but in those days you had to get up no matter what. So I got up, had a look at that big barrel chest of his and he just said ""are you all right, son?"".

She told the Daily Mirror: 'I've been looking for a new and exciting challenge, and when they approached me about the opportunity to become a licensed amateur jockey, it captured my imagination. I'm motivated by the scale of the challenge and the opportunity to combine my love of horses with learning a new skill under the guidance of racing experts put together for me.'

He said: 'Victoria is a hugely talented, ambitious and gutsy individual, and these traits will stand her in the best stead possible for achieving this ambitious goal. 'Having worked with her for a week, the progress she has already made in such a small amount of time is quite frankly remarkable. It's a real privilege to work with Victoria on a challenge of this magnitude. 'While no one under estimates the scale of the challenge ahead, Victoria's undoubted mental and physical strength, coupled with the team Betfair have put together to help her with this challenge, means we are in a fantastic position for Victoria to achieve the ambitious goal of riding at Cheltenham Festival in 2016'.","Olympic cycling champion Victoria Pendleton is training to be a jockey .

"You can bring a horse to water but you can’t stop it from going for a swim. A huntsman in Ireland found that out the hard way when he was thrown from a horse making an unscheduled detour through a canal. In the clip a group of men can be seen riding horseback alongside a canal near Lockside Farm and Stables in County Longford. Two riders approach an upturned boat and jump over it without a problem, but as the third rides towards it the horse puts on its brakes and veers left off of the path and into the canal. Trotting through the water the horse falls, sending its rider flying, and after re-emerging swims off back towards the bank. Meanwhile, people on the opposite bank – along with a couple of very excited dogs – greet the sopping man as he clambers his way out of the canal. Easy as jumping a boat: A member of the Longford Harriers shows how it is done as his horse leaps over the obstacle . Applying the brakes: The horse decides that it doesn't want to jump over the boat like the previous two horses . The hunt, which generally attracts around 70 to 80 people of all ages, is an event undertaken by the Longford Harriers – the group featured in the clip. The master horsemen and women, who wear green to stand out, manage the hunt by controlling the hounds with a bugle. Riding across farms, lanes and roadways, the horsemen and women do not hunt foxes but instead jump over a number of high hedges, drains, stone walls and gates for fun. Splash! Veering left the horse detours into the canal before slipping and throwing its rider into the drink . Dogs greet the sopping rider and the horse, who swims back around in front of the man and off towards the other bank . The horse and rider became the first pair from the group to end up in the canal situated alongside the Lockside Farm and Stables . According to one of the huntsman, this is the first time that a rider has ended up in the canal after falling from their horse. The hunts usually last for three hours and take place in different areas around the county. After the run the group meet for a well-earned drink and the horses are allowed to rest with some water and hay.","The clip shows the huntsmen riding horseback alongside a canal .

"The powerbrokers behind Carl Frampton and Scott Quigg will meet in London on Wednesday in an effort to finally make a fight that could be the biggest in Britain this year. Barry McGuigan, who manages Frampton, will sit down with Quigg’s promoter Eddie Hearn at breakfast to try to iron out the issues standing between the two super-bantamweight world champions. If successful, the hope is for a summer showdown that will net a seven-figure payday for each man, but significant obstacles remain in the way, with Hearn concerned that unless progress is made in the next two weeks then the long-awaited fight will be delayed further. IBF world champion Carl Frampton (left) lands a punch on Chris Avalos during their fight in February . Avalos is dropped to the canvas during their IBF super bantamweight world title fight in Belfast . Scott Quigg (right) deals a blow to Hidenori Othake before winning by unanimous decision in November . The principle challenge surrounds television companies, with IBF champion Frampton enjoying huge exposure on ITV while Hearn’s fighters, including WBA (regular) champion Quigg, operate on Sky Sports. Hearn has already submitted a proposal for staging a pay-per-view fight on Sky and, as such, is likely to offer a greater purse. But McGuigan has long been adamant that the fight should prioritise the exposure of terrestrial television over ‘greed’. Hearn told Sportsmail yesterday: ‘I will meet Barry McGuigan and Carl Frampton’s team in London on Wednesday. It’s the fight everyone wants to see - two world champions from Britain in the same division. They simply have to fight. Frampton extended his perfect record to 20 wins after his fifth round TKO victory against Avalos in February . A fight between Frampton and Quigg (centre), who has 30 wins with 22 by KO, is a tantalising prospect . ‘I have given my proposal to them and am waiting to hear what they have from their side. I feel we need to make progress now. The hope is for a summer fight, possibly on June 20. ‘I think we need to reach some kind of agreement soon, probably the next two or three weeks, if we are to get this fight on in the summer. It really is the fight people want to see.’ Frampton, 28, extended his perfect record to 20 wins against Chris Avalos in February, while Quigg is unbeaten with 30 wins and two draws. Options for staging the bout currently include Belfast, which would mean a home fight for Frampton, as well as Manchester and the O2 Arena in London. Meanwhile, a decision is set to be made on James DeGale’s world-title fight against Andre Dirrell. The pair had been expected to fight next month in Chicago for the IBF super-middleweight belt vacated by Carl Froch, but Sportsmail understands that bout is now likely to take place in May in the US.","Super-bantamweight Battle of Britain is taking a step in the right direction .

"This is Bristol City's season. Coasting to the League One title and now with a glistening piece of silverware in the cabinet, times are good again at Ashton Gate. This was as straightforward as a Wembley final gets for Steve Cotterill's team, who reaped the first rewards of what has been a stunning season by easily seeing off the challenge of Walsall. In front of 40,000 jubilant fans, they lifted the Johnstone's Paint Trophy following goals from Aden Flint and Mark Little. But it's merely a taste of what is to come. Captain Wade Elliot (centre) lifts the Johnstone's Paint Trophy as his Bristol City team-mates celebrate their triumph . Steve Cotterill (left) and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas look delighted after winning the trophy and City have a terrific chance of a domestic double . Mark Little (2) bundles home the second goal after a goal mouth scrambled left him a clear goal to aim at . With a 10-point advantage over their nearest challengers in Sky Bet League One, City will surely also be lifting a trophy the next time they meet Walsall, in the last game of the season on May 3. Winning this competition for the third time in their history is a nice distraction, but Cotterill will demand his players remain focused on the season's primary task of returning to the Championship. The job is almost done. Like so often in this campaign, they were in control from start to finish here, showing the greater assurance in front of goal in a game of few chances. The full back celebrates in front of the Bristol City fans after he doubled his side's lead . Wembley looked a picture in the spring sunshine, a sea of red with thousands of supporters descending on the national stadium. Bristol City: Fielding; Little, Ayling, Flint, Williams, Bryan (Cunningham 87); K.Smith, Pack, Freeman (Elliott 90); Agard (Emmanuel-Thomas 88), Wilbraham (c) Substitutes not used: Richards (GK); Tavernier, Saville, Wagstaff . Scorers: Flint 15; Little 51 . Walsall: O'Donnell; Purkiss, Downing, J Chambers, Taylor; Mantom, A.

Referee: Mick Russell (Hertfordshire) Attendance: 72,315 . All the pre-match indications pointed to a City victory. Well clear of Preston North End at the League One summit, it would take a Devon Loch-style collapse to deny them a return to the second tier after two seasons away. The Saddlers sit 16th in the standings, some 37 points behind their opponents, but were still optimistic of springing a surprise as they arrived at Wembley for the first time in their 127-year history. They more than matched their opponents in the opening exchanges, with the goal threatened at both ends. City fired the first salvo when Luke Freeman's 20-yard hit cleared the bar on four minutes, Walsall responding when Anthony Forde tested goalkeeper Frank Fielding from range. Then, on the quarter-hour, a breakthrough. City won a corner and Marlon Pack's corner was pinged to the back post. Flint, completely outmuscling his marker to gain the necessary elevation, headed home and sparked delirium among the visitors from Bristol. The tempo of the game immediately dropped and both teams constructed spells of tidy passing football without finding any penetration. Chances were at a premium and scoring opportunities snuffed out as defences dominated. The best of the half-chances came shortly before the break when Walsall's Andy Taylor whistled a shot over from the edge of the box but there was little else to report. You sensed that a second City goal may settle the contest and it duly arrived six minutes after the break.

The big centre half runs away to celebrate his opening goal at Wembley Stadium for Bristol City . Freeman's tricky feet worked space to cross from the left and after O'Donnell blocked Little's first header, he followed up and bundled the ball home with his knee from a few yards out. It was all Little deserved for a fine performance in which he was constantly looking for ways to unpick the Walsall defence. But far from being subdued, Walsall almost responded when Jordan Cook's vicious inswinging cross from the left had to be touched onto the post by Fielding. The guests from the Midlands were briefly encouraged but it didn't spark the resurgence they needed. City were content to sit back and soak up the pressure, duly claiming the first of what will surely be twin trophies this season.

"Sky have won the bidding war for the rights to screen Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao in the UK, as revealed by Sportsmail last Friday. The richest fight of all time will not come cheap either — for Sky Sports or their subscribers — even though Sky are keeping faith with their core following by keeping the base price below £20. It has taken what is described by industry insiders as ‘a very substantial offer’ for Sky to fend off fierce competition from Frank Warren’s BoxNation. Floyd Mayweather's hotly-anticipated bout with Manny Pacquiao will be shown on Sky Sports . Pacquiao headed for the playground after working out in Los Angeles previously . The price for the fight has been set at £19.95 until midnight of Friday May 1. The cost will remain the same for those paying via remote control or online, but will be £24.95 if booked via phone after Friday. Sky are flirting with their threshold of £20 by charging £19.95 a buy on their Sports Box Office channel until midnight on May 1, rising to £24.95 on May 2, the day of the fight in Las Vegas. Since they are understood to have broken past protocol by offering the US promoters a cut of that revenue as well as a hefty up-front payment, it is expected they will have to shatter the pay-per-view record in this country to break even. The current Sky record stands at 1.2million buys for Ricky Hatton’s Vegas loss to Mayweather in 2007. Warren is believed to have offered a higher lump sum than Sky in the hope of attracting another two million customers to his £12-a-month subscription channel. It is doubtful if Sky can reach that number at £20 per sale at 4am on a Sunday morning, but if they get 1.5m buys they should be out of the red. Mayweather continued to work on the pads in his Las Vegas gym as he prepares for the fight .

"Childcare centres around Australia are sending children home with poo-filled underwear in plastic bags to the shock of parents who have labelled the practice disgusting. Nationwide guidelines prevent childcare centres from rinsing or washing clothing, so if a child has an accident, their pants the underwear must be bagged and labelled and left in a communal bucket for parents to take home at the end of the day. Leah Spender, 34, said that she was presented with her son Ethan's underwear after being informed that the staff were not allowed to touch faecal matter. Scroll down for video . Leah Spender, 34, (above) said that she was presented with her son Ethan's underwear at the end of the day that still had a poo inside . 'I had no idea that this was common practice. When your child is learning to ""potty train"" the Childcare providers ask that you bring in a spare pair of undies and shorts... but that was all I was told,' Ms Spender told Daily Mail Australia. 'The first time I was given my ""goody bag"" the day care mum said ""Oh! Before I forget! Ethan has a present for you.."" she walked to the toilet area and fished out a a grey plastic shopping bag, which was tied in a knot at the top and handed it to me. I could see the words ""Ethan W"" written on the bag and a date,' she said. Ms Spender said that she was shocked that centres would send home a 'full piece of poo'. 'Dirty underwear is one thing, but wrapping the entire thing up, for you to then put in your handbag, walk down the street to your car.. and drive the whole way home with a full piece in the bag.. that's a bit far,' she said. Cristal Jamieson, from Brisbane, took to Facebook to express her frustration over the practice, after she had repeatedly asked her daughter's childcare centre to throw out the soiled underwear rather than send it home. The final straw came when she opened a three-day old bag with her daughter's name on it. Ms Jamieson posted on media personality Em Rusciano's official Facebook page, asking for advice on how to handle the situation. 'Today, I got greeted with a plastic bag with an entire turd wrapped in princess pink undies with 'Ellie 16/03' written on,' she wrote. 'Yes my daughter is named Ellie but surely this isn't her complete turd packaged from 3 days prior after sitting in communal 'turd' bucket for 3 days!!! Surely...Can I please ask, what would have Em done? Please….' Rusciano brought attention of her 100,000 followers to the issue, and said she 'would have lost my mind.' '[I would have] taken the unfortunate doggy bag, found that person's car and placed the poo in a spot they would never find and just let the smell haunt them until they had to set their car on fire.' Outraged parents were quick to comment, with many adding that their childcare centre had a similar practice of sending home packaged poo. 'I have had such a turd greet me, but the day care centre in question were kind enough to distribute each individual turd in their little plastic bags into the respective child's backpack. Revolting, & thrown straight in the bin - because what else can you do with that kind of s**t?' posted one parent. Em Rusciano brought attention of her 100,000 followers to the issue of sending poo home with children . Media personality Rusciano said she 'would have lost my mind' had she been presented with a 'package' Outraged parents were quick to comment, with many adding that their childcare centre had a similar practice of sending home packaged poo . 'This has happened to us!! But didn't know the s**t was in there until it fell on my laundry bench when I opened up the bag!' said another. While some on the post who claimed to be childcare workers expressed disgust at the practice, others pointed to national guidelines which enforced the activity. Recommendations from the National Health and Medical Research Council’s 'Staying Healthy: Preventing infectious diseases in early childhood education and care services' guidelines released in 2012, childcare centres are advised to 'place any soiled clothes in a plastic bag or alternative, so parents can take their child’s clothes home'. While the guidelines are not legislated, some childcare centres around Australia choose to accept the recommendations, and enforce the practice of sending home soiled underwear as part of the centre's blanket policy. Some on the post who claimed to be childcare workers expressed disgust at the practice . Cristal Jamieson, a mother from Brisbane, would like to see a blanket rule that if the centres cannot remove the poo, they throw out the underwear . Childcare centres are advised by the National Health and Medical Research Council to 'place any soiled clothes in a plastic bag or alternative, so parents can take their child’s clothes home' Ms Jamieson said that she has made a formal complaint with the Queensland Department of Child Services . A spokesperson from the Education and Care Services National Regulations said that education and care services are required to 'ensure adequate health and hygiene practices' and 'have laundry facilities or access to laundry facilities; or other arrangements for dealing with soiled clothing'. 'As the regulations do not prescribe what practices are considered adequate, service providers make their own decisions about what health and hygiene practices are used at the service, informed by relevant guidelines and best practice,' the spokesperson said. After communicating with her child care centre, Ms Jamieson said that she has made a formal complaint with the Queensland Department of Child Services, and said she is horrified that the practice is so widespread. 'This is political correctness gone mad, policies need to be changed,' she told Daily Mail Australia. While the NHMRC's guidelines are not legislated, some childcare centres around Australia choose to accept the recommendations . 'The centre said it was against their guidelines to do much more than package it up. I asked for them to throw the underwear out but staff changes mean that not everyone knows and that my daughter's poo keeps being sent home.' Ms Jamieson said that she was worried that the hot bathroom where the soiled bags are kept would negatively impact on the toilet training of the children. 'This is a very critical time, developmentally, for young children, and the environment it meant to be pleasant. The room is disgusting, it smells, and this is not creating an efficient, rewarding experience.' Ms Jamieson would like to see a blanket rule that if the centres cannot remove the poo, they throw out the underwear, and said that the practice is humiliating for children. 'It's like a child isn't deserving of the same respect that adults get. Imagine having to take your bag home with poo inside it, it's degrading,' she said.

"Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel has denied a Football Association charge of violent conduct for standing on Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea. Video evidence was used to charge the centre-back, currently away on international duty with Slovakia, after television pictures highlighted the incident - missed by referee Martin Atkinson - in the last seconds of Sunday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield. Skrtel chased a through-ball as 10-man Liverpool searched for a late equaliser but De Gea slid in to get there first and the defender continued his run and stood on the goalkeeper's right shin. Martin Skrtel's foot lands on David de Gea's leg in the incident which saw the FA charge the defender . Skrtel will fight the violent conduct charge, claiming the alleged stamp was not intentional . Premier League: Arsenal away,  April 4 . FA Cup Sixth round: Blackburn away, April 8 . Premier League: Newcastle at home, April 13 . A three-man panel of former elite officials were asked by the FA to review the footage independently of each other and there was unanimous agreement the offence warranted a red card. Skrtel was given until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge and has decided to contest it. The 30-year-old will argue the incident was accidental and not intentional. If he fails in his challenge, Skrtel will receive a three-match ban - which covers league games at Arsenal and home to Newcastle either side of the FA Cup quarter-final replay at Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn. Manchester United keeper De Gea takes exception to the contact from Skrtel at the end of Sunday's match . A three-man panel of former elite officials reviewed the footage after it wasn't seen by Martin Atkinson (right) Coincidentally, Skrtel could argue a precedent was set back in January when Chelsea striker Diego Costa was charged for a stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can but escaped punishment for one on Skrtel himself. The Spain international stood on the defender as he slid in to make a tackle in a similar incident to Skrtel's coming together with De Gea. The incident was looked at retrospectively using television evidence after both the Skrtel flashpoint and the stamp on Can were missed by referee Michael Oliver. Skrtel could argue a precedent was set in January when Chelsea striker Diego Costa escaped punishment for an alleged stamp on him that was reviewed on video after referee Michael Oliver missed the incident . Costa was however suspended for this contact with Skrtel's team-mate Emre Can in the same match . 'Following a review of an incident during the game involving Costa and Liverpool's Martin Skrtel, The FA will not be taking any further action,' a statement from the FA said at the time. However, Skrtel's hopes of succeeding appear slim. Costa appealed his charge for the offence against Can - with manager Jose Mourinho insisting both incidents were 'absolutely accidental' - but was found guilty and banned for three matches. It led to Mourinho claiming there was a 'clear campaign' against Chelsea.","Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel with fight FA charge of violent conduct .

"Just before a new $6million sports center bearing her name was opened last fall, beach volleyball star Misty May-Treanor said she was excited to be involved in the club and give back to her local southern California community. But six months later, the three-time Olympic gold medalist's office at the Misty May-Treanor Sports Center is empty after a mysterious fallout with her longtime trainer Mike Rangel, who founded the Irvine facility. Now parents are threatening to stop paying their  seasonal dues of $4,300 because their children aren't getting the benefit of May-Treanor's tutelage, as they feel they were promised. Scroll down for video . Olympic gold-medalist Misty May-Treanor has reportedly fallen out with longtime trainer Mike Rangel, just six months after he founded a new sports center in her name . Brand new: The 155,000-square-foot Misty May-Treanor Sports Center was opened in November 2014. Parents pay $4,300 to let their children play at the facility for a seven-month season . Boycotts: Some parents at the facility have threatened to stop paying their dues because May-Treanor has not been involved at the facility recently . In a new report by the OC Register, Rangel said he and May-Treanor split over the simple issue of sponsorship. Rangel agreed to let Asics sponsor the club, while 37-year-old May-Treanor remains a spokesman for competitor Nike. 'I can respect the fact that she doesn’t want to be photographed with 500 girls that are wearing Asics gear,' Rangel said. However, rumors abound in the club about a deeper-seeded issue that caused May-Treanor's distance, and the scrubbing of all her photos from the club's website. Cary Lambeth, a longtime youth basketball organizer who helped in the early planning stages of the MMTSC believes the break is 'because their visions were not the same'. 'I do not think Misty was doing it for Misty. I think Misty was doing it because she wanted to give back,' Lambeth said. Daily Mail Online reached out to May-Treanor's agent for comment on Tuesday, but did not immediately get a reply. Calls to Mike Rangel were also not returned. May-Treanor's apparent rift with Rangel is surprising considering their previously close relationship. In her 2010 autobiography, she described her relationship with Rangel as 'one of the most important partnerships' in her volleyball career. Rangel helped train May-Treanor between 2002 and 2012, during which she won three gold medals in the Olympics for beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. The split was also swift. May-Treanor attended coaches meetings for the new facility in August, and even gave excited interviews about the club in October. But since then it's been radio silence. Checked out: May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the MMTSC since October. The sports legend pictured on the left with a Laguna Hills High School senior at the facility on October 2 . Legend: It's still unclear what caused the rift between May-Treanor and her longtime trainer Rangel. Rangel trained May-Treanor for 12 years, during which she won three Olympic gold medals in beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. May-Treanor pictured above compting in the London Olympic games . Erased: The club's website now shows now sign of Misty May-Treanor's name or image on the homepage . In October, May-Treanor told the OC Register that the building of the sports center was close to her heart, since she grew up in the area and knew there weren't many places for local kids to play. 'Growing up as a volleyball player around here, I know how gym space had become more and more limited,' May-Treanor said. 'This is not going to be just a volleyball place but a place for basketball and other sports, too. With the amount of sports and teams we have here, it’s important to have a facility like this.' Brand minded? Rangel says the split with May-Treanor stems from a sponsorship issue. Asics is sponsoring the club, while May-Treanor remains a spokesman for Nike. May-Treanor and Jennings pictured above celebrating their gold medal win at the London games . She also appeared to be interested in interacting with the youth teams that trained at the center. 'I love the coaching and teaching aspect of what we’ll be doing,' May-Treanor said. 'That’s the big part for me, the sharing of information with younger players. And the beauty of this is that I don’t have to be dedicated to one team.' May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the gym since October, a month before it's official opening and since then parents have been getting angrier and angrier walking past her perennially empty office. Last month, about 60 parents with kids at the gym met in a nearby park to discuss action. And in a meeting with Rangel, volleyball mom Michelle Peters threatened to stop paying, saying she felt her 15-year-old daughter wasn't getting the advertised program (parents at the facility pay $4,300 for a seven-month season). 'What aren’t you getting?' Rangel asked during the meeting. 'Well, we’re not getting Misty May,' Peters responded. Rangel says most of the malcontent parents came from a club in Mission Viejo and were not happy when their former club director, who moved to work at the MMTSC, resigned over clashes with him. The 155,000-square-foot facility was pitched to May-Treanor by Rangel ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. Rangel wanted to built a state-of-the-art sports facility, while May-Treanor wanted to coach so it made the perfect project for the pair. The finished facility has 22 volleyball courts, 21 basketball courts - all with their own electric scoreboards. The facility also includes an air-conditioned 350-seat restaurant with 10 large HDTVs as an area to watch the games and practices.","Misty May-Treanor's longtime trainer Mike Rangel founded a sports center named after her this past fall .

"They like Manchester band The Courteeners at Old Trafford. Upon winning their 20th Premier League title fans had the words of their song 'Not Nineteen Forever' made into a banner that takes pride of place at the Theatre of Dreams. But in the case of forgotten man Ander Herrera and his triumphant return to the side, the Middleton four-piece's earlier hit 'What Took You So Long?' would be more appropriate. Ander Herrera (centre) is starting to make an impact for Louis van Gaal's Manchester United side . Herrera has forged a strong bond with fellow Spaniard Juan Mata, who scored twice against Liverpool . What took you so long Louis van Gaal? Why was Herrera, suddenly a key player in United's new-found swagger, out of the picture for long chunks of the season? There is more than one answer. Firstly, if anyone is a 'club signing' it is Herrera. Long before the coronation of King Louis, United originally vowed to ensure he would be their man following his mesmerising role in Athletic Bilbao' 2011-12 Europa League victory over Sir Alex Ferguson's side. The admiration from within spread to the stands. They have never been shy of praising opponents at Old Trafford – this was where, in 2003, Ronaldo famously secured a standing ovation after a beautiful Champions League hat-trick for Real Madrid. The 25-year-old was signed from Athletic Bilbao in a £28.8million move following Van Gaal's arrival . Herrera made a bright start to his United career, but injury saw the Spaniard sidelined for several weeks . In that frantic and ultimately fruitless first summer David Moyes famously made one attempt to capture Herrera's services which ended in confusion after the complex hurdles within the player's contract could not be overcome. But they would not give up. When Van Gaal arrived talks were at an advanced stage with Herrera's representatives and he was happy to give the £28.8m move the green light with the new season approaching. United have paid more for only four others, but as we have heard more than once, under Van Gaal's philosophy the fee counts for nothing. Former United boss David Moyes made an attempt to capture Herrera's services, but failed . The Spanish midfielder is having to prove his worth to Van Gaal during his first season at Old Trafford . Herrera celebrates scoring during United's FA Cup fifth round victory against Preston in February . Not being the Dutchman's player, Herrera may have had to prove himself more than most. In a stuttering start to the season, he was not seen for a month after being substituted at half-time against West Bromwich Albion. As late as February he had completed 90 minutes just once since the 5-3 humbling at Leicester City in September. With their team struggling for rhythm United fans who remembered Herrera conducting the tune for Bilbao, scratched their heads at his continued absence. When he made a rare start in the 3-1 FA Cup win at Deepdale on February 16 many put it down to Van Gaal's squad rotation. Herrera's partnership with Daley Blind (right) has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield . But Herrera has started every game since, the kickstarting of his Old Trafford career coinciding with United finally clicking into gear. His partnership with Daley Blind has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield. Suddenly United appear as sharp as their 1980s shirt sponsors. Herrera's through ball for Juan Mata to open the scoring against Liverpool came in a dominant half of football United fans wondered if they would ever see again only weeks ago. But there is more to it than Herrera simply not being the boss's signing. In a wide-ranging interview with El Pais, he offered more clues. Herrera and Mata chase down Philippe Coutinho during United's 2-1 victory against Liverpool on Sunday . Mata puts the ball past Simon Mignolet for his firs goal following a brilliant throughball from Herrera . 'Van Gaal loves possession and doesn't like to risk [losing] the ball,' he said. 'He wants long possessions and to keep the ball because he believes you create spaces staying in the right place, because the team have the quality to find you. 'At the beginning he used to tell me off because I always looked for the ball, I wanted to have it, and I must wait for it.' Van Gaal is on the record stating his belief that his players must not play off the cuff – that they should know their jobs and if they do them his side will win. Michael Carrick (left) congratulates Herrera on the part he played in Mata's opening goal . It is a pragmatic cross-sports philosophy used in the NFL by New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, whose team this year won their fourth Super Bowl this century. While it does not sound like the famous United Way, it certainly looked like it at Anfield. Herrera, superb on Merseyside, believes that if it had not been for football he would have tried a career in sports journalism. By the looks of things, he has plenty of new chapters to write at Old Trafford first.","Ander Herrera signed for Manchester United in £29m deal last summer .

"Unsuspecting people walking through a field in the Netherlands are having their heads turned by one very strange bird. An over-familiar owl has taken a liking to landing on the head of anyone walking through the greenery within the town on Noordeinde. Now photographer Menno Shaefer has paid a visit to the spot after hearing about the European eagle owl's unusual behaviour. Scroll down for video . Perched: The European eagle owl enjoys swooping on unsuspecting walkers - and standing on their heads . Duck: Two people try to dodge the bird as it heads for this lady's head as a landing spot . Unusual: Photographer Menno Scheefer travelled 68km to the northern Netherlands town of Noordeinde to photograph the own, after hearing about its strange behaviour . The 48-year-old, of Zaandam, Netherlands, says: 'I had heard a lot about the owl and decided to visit the site to see it in action for myself. 'It was a very funny thing to watch, however I'm just as confused as anyone as to why it does this.' The wild owl, which weighs around 6lbs, spends an average of one minute perched on the head of innocent bystanders, before flying off looking for the next perch. Beautiful: The striking owl surveys the scene for a few moments before deciding where it should fly to next . Clearly unhappy sitting on a fence or a tree, the owl searched for its next landing spot multiple times during Menno's short visit to the field near Noordeinde Palace. The European eagle owl is one of the largest species of owl, and females can grow to a maximum total wingspan of 75 cm. The bird is found in a number of habitats but mostly lives in mountain regions, coniferous forests, steppes and other relatively remote places.

"Sir Chris Hoy has followed a fairly predictable path in his retirement. A bit of media work, plenty of endorsements and a range of bikes, available at good stockists everywhere. He has reportedly turned down Strictly but this week he joined Frank Lampard as a sporting star with his own range of children's books. Flying Fergus are the tales of a young boy who discovers a old rusty bike has magic powers that transport him to sporting success. In the build-up to London 2012, it was Hoy's rivals who wondered whether he and the British team had 'magic wheels', though the truth was his six Olympic golds were achieved by an unmatched will to win and 27 inch thighs that powered him like pistons to sporting history. Chris Hoy celebrates an impressive cycling career with the Great Britain flag after yet more success . British cyclist Hoy poses during the reception for Team GB and Paralympic GB athletes in London . Hoy's legacy is a cycling revolution that has changed the British sporting landscape but it has also created an expectation that success is now assured forever. In Beijing - when Hoy won three medals in a singles Games - Britain won seven from ten golds, a feat that that prompted cycling's governing body to change the rules for London to prevent such domination. And yet, three summers ago, Britain again won seven from ten Olympic titles, including two more golds for Hoy. Hoy celebrates after crossing the finish line to win the gold medal in the London 2012 Olympic Games . However, at the recent track cycling World Championships, British cyclists failed to top the podium in a single event - their worst performance in 14 years. They ranked tenth on the medal table with a haul of just three silver medals, their coach, Shane Sutton, later questioning their hunger to succeed. Anyone who witnessed Hoy's final and most thrilling Olympic gold in the men's keirin will know that timing is his strong point. And it certainly seems like he got out at the right time. Hoy celebrates winning the Men's Keirin final on day eleven of the Olympic Games in London . However, the 11-time world champion insists it's not really as grim as the statistics appear. Some think the team has been missing a leader since his retirement and Hoy believes the return to the track of Sir Bradley Wiggins could be just what's needed to lift the spirits. 'He's an iconic leader and other nations look to him as this global cycling megastar,' he said. 'When he's in the track centre everybody's focusing on him, so it takes the pressure and spotlight off some of the other riders who don't particularly enjoy that attention. He's invaluable for the team as a whole. 'We lost a bit of experience after the Olympics, after Victoria Pendleton and I retired. Success creates its own problems and pressures. Now, if you're the British Olympic Team going into Rio, you've a realistic chance of medalling in maybe 60 per cent of the events. 'But in cycling now, unless it's a gold medal, it is seen as being a massive failure and you've got to manage expectations. 'We do still have realistic chances but I don't think we'll have another Beijing or London but I don't think that's a massive surprise or disappointment. I still think we have a successful Games in Rio but with less medals than previous Games. 'The World Championships in Paris was disappointing, there's no way you can spin it to make it sound like a success, as a team it wasn't. 'However, in individual cases and certain events, progress has been made since the World Championships in Colombia last year.' Hoy speaks and people listen. This week he was back in London as part of his mentor role in a Sports Aid initiative backed by energy company SSE. Hoy in action during the Men's Team Sprint Track Cycling final on Day 6 of the London 2012 Olympic Games . A legacy project of last year's Commonwealth Games, SSE Next Generation is providing 100 talented hopefuls with funding but, more importantly, invaluable advice and experience as they start out on their sporting careers. Olympic silver medallist Leon Taylor, who famously mentored Tom Daley, is guiding them while Olympic gold medallist Darren Campbell is advising on nutrition and Judy Murray is helping prepare their parents for what might come ahead. But it was Hoy that had the teenagers listening in rapt attention and patiently queuing for the obligatory selfie with Britain's most successful Olympian of all-time. When Hoy made his British team debut at the 1993 European under-23 Championship he was told to return his tracksuit but times have changed. 'It reminds me of what it was like when I was their age and you've got your career right in front of you and the excitement that entails,' he adds. British Olympic track cycling gold medalist Hoy poses with his London 2012 gold medals . 'There was nothing like this programme when I was starting out, I definitely would have loved to be involved if there was. 'I take my role as a mentor very seriously, it's an honour, it's not just about me speaking about myself and my experiences but I enjoy listening to the athletes and hearing about what they're doing. 'It's exciting to think there could be half dozen or more of these athletes who could be household names in ten years.' Who knows. Some might even match Hoy's sporting and, perhaps, even literary achievements.'

"Mark Noble is refusing to give up on his dream of breaking into the England squad ahead of the European Championship Finals despite being overlooked once again by Roy Hodgson. Noble has been one of the star performers since West Ham gained promotion back into the Premier League back in 2012. The 27-year-old has represented England at every level from the Under 16s to the Under 19s and was even made captain of the Under 21s team for the Euro Finals in 2009. But he has somehow failed to catch the attention of Hodgson who even called up Tottenham's inexperienced midfielder Ryan Mason ahead of him for the forthcoming games against Lithuania and Italy when Adam Lallana was forced to pull out of the squad with a groin injury. Mark Noble (right), Winston Reid (centre) and Diafra Sakho pose outside West Ham's future home . The Hammers will be moving to the Olympic Stadium in London next summer . However, Noble says he will not sulk over the matter and will continue to show his best form for West Ham as he looks to help the club push for a European place as they prepare to move into the Olympic Stadium next summer. Noble said: ‘I have made it clear what I think about the situation and I would love to play for my country. But obviously at the moment it doesn't look like it is going to happen. ‘I will keep playing as well as I can at West Ham and enjoying it every week. You never know what will happen in the future. Roy Hodgson takes charge of England training, having overlooked Noble for the squad yet again . Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason (second left) was a late call up in the position played by Noble . ‘When we move to the Olympic Stadium we have to be thinking about European football because of the gate receipts and the money coming into the club and hopefully we will be able to invest in better players. We invested really well last summer and that has shown this season.’ Noble hopes he will given a better chance of an England call-up following the proposals by FA chairman Greg Dyke this week to limit the number of non-EU players playing in this country. Harry Kane has come through the Tottenham youth system and only made a name for himself in the top flight back in November, but has already been rewarded for his outstanding season with his first call-up into the England squad this week. Noble has been one of the standout performers since West Ham returned to the top flight in 2012 . The 27-year-old has represented England at every age level from the Under 16s to Under 21s . Noble feels a number of other home-grown players could now follow Kane into the senior squad if they are given the chance to play on a regular basis. When asked about Dyke's proposals, Noble added: ‘I think that is great. When I came through into the league I was played at 17. You don't get that a lot now with players coming through the academies. ’If you do that you have to be very special because of the foreign players coming in. We have got the best league in the world and we want to keep it like that, but it will be nice to see some of our homegrown boys given a chance.’ Lycamobile supports the West Ham Foundation as part of its mission to bring communities together. www.lycamobile.com .","West Ham star was overlooked in Roy Hodgson's latest England squad .

"A Western Australian political staffer has been suspended after he was arrested near his boss' home with a baseball bat, balaclava and latex gloves. WA Premier Colin Barnett has responded by describing the incident as 'like a Monty Python episode'. The deputy clerk of the Legislative Council, Nigel Lake was arrested late at night on February 17. He was dressed entirely in black and just one kilometre away the home of his boss Nigel Pratt, who is the Clerk of the Legislative Council. The deputy clerk of the Legislative Council, Nigel Lake was arrested late at night on February 17. He had a balaclava, baseball bat and latex gloves . Lake, 49, was charged with possessing a controlled weapon and a disguise, both intended for use in connection with committing an offence. Following police investigations, he has also been charged with installing and tracking a device. Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett believes the incident is completely 'bizarre'. 'It's a bit like a Monty Python episode, isn't it?' he told ABC News. Liberal Legislative member Robyn McSweeney has a stronger opinion, describing herself as 'completely appalled' by Lake's actions. After his arrest, Lake was stood down from his $166,000-a-year role. The Crime and Corruption Commission have been notified of the public official's actions. Lake was arrested near his boss' home with a baseball bat, balaclava and latex gloves (stock shot) In his role, Lake has been responsible for the management of the Department of the Legislative Council. Legislative Council President Barry House notified all MPs of Lake's arrest and in a letter to staff. 'Upon learning that Mr Lake had been arrested and charged I immediately directed him to remain away from the workplace and to not undertake any work until further notice,' Mr House wrote, according to Perth Now. 'This was to allow the police to complete their investigation. I consider any behaviour which results in criminal charges being laid against a Parliamentary Officer as very serious.'

"John Watson competed in 152 Formula One races over 10 years. He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline. Ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix, he assesses McLaren's troubled start to the season and the disappointing curtain raiser in Melbourne. John Watson (right) pictured last year with Sir Jackie Stewart, Karun Chandhok and Damon Hill . McLaren have moved from Mercedes engines to Honda and it is a bit like any relationship; it takes time. Formula One has gone down the route of trying to cut costs, and as a result, we have seen a substantial cut in track testing which will hinder McLaren's chances of improving this term. I would like to see teams allowed to test more simply because I think the public is beginning to wonder what we’re watching. Are we seeing an exercise in extremely high-level technical games or are we looking at Formula One as an entertainment and sport? What is Formula One's objective? And where does it see itself going? I understand that TV viewing figures in Germany for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix were down nearly 50 per cent  on the norm and I don’t think that is very good sign. Lewis Hamilton won the season-opening race in Australia ahead of  Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel . Hamilton led from start-to-finish as Mercedes dominated the first race of the new Formula One season . Maybe in Britain it wasn’t so bad because of Lewis Hamilton's recent success, but there is a downside to domination, and we saw that at the turn of the century with Michael Schumacher and Ferrari, and then with four years of Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel. My big concern, and I hope I am not being over-reactionary here, is that there are so many teams in the pit-lane that are struggling financially. Giedo van der Garde's legal case against Sauber in Melbourne was hugely embarrassing and dominated the agenda at the Australian Grand Prix. It is systematic of where Formula One is right now. Driver talent is clearly secondary to budgets, albeit with a few exceptions at the sharp end of the grid. Teams desperately need funding. My other worry is whether global companies are looking at F1 as a sport which they want to commit to. I don’t see any substantial company coming in as a title sponsor to any team. Hamilton is bidding to become the first British driver to win consecutive Formula One world championships . Pastor Maldonado crashed on the opening lap while Lotus team-mate Romain Grosjean retired moments later . The sport, whether it is the governing body, the FIA or CVC, Formula One’s commercial rulers, need to sit down and say ""what are we doing?"" ""what are we trying to achieve?"" and ""are we achieving it?"" Last year we did have some good races, but I don’t want to see another grand prix like Melbourne where at the end of the opening lap we had effectively just 13 cars running. Manor didn't get out of their garage. Kevin Magnussen and Daniil Kvyat suffered mechanical gremlins on their way to the grid. And both Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado failed to complete a lap. It is not acceptable. Formula One let itself down and it is a shame because the opening round of the championship, particularly with Melbourne being the sporting capital of the world, had a poor race. In the case of both McLaren and Honda, make no mistake, the achievement of getting back to the top as quickly as possible is absolutely paramount. They are a team who have won multiple world championships, but the last two years have been their worst since 1981. But I am confident they know what they have got to do, and they have put steps in place to rectify their problems. Jenson Button finished in last place, and two laps down on race winner Hamilton at the 2015 curtain-raiser . Kevin Magnussen, who deputised for Fernando Alonso, waves to the crowd ahead of the race in Melbourne . This year there is a four-engine limit for the entire season. So, combine that with the limited testing, and restrictions on engines, and how are engine manufacturers, particularly somebody coming into this Formula, such as Honda, expected to catch up, let alone match, those who started last year? Mercedes began their programme way back in 2011 and what you are seeing is the culmination of a lot of work which was done parallel to the team competing in 2012 and 2013. Renault were distracted with winning titles with Vettel and Red Bull while Ferrari didn't appear to grasp what was required. That is fundamentally why Mercedes hold the advantage. They had the wisdom to start out ahead of the game. Honda are having to play catch-up in public which is painful for them and McLaren. When you go through the design, manufacturing and development phases it is only when you put that engine in the car do you then realise what you've got. There is no magic wand and any improvement won't happen overnight. McLaren have clearly got a lot of knowledge and expertise from running the Mercedes engine last year. But a Honda and Mercedes engines are completely different. Everybody in the partnership is going to need to be realistic and only hope that they can make progress at fairly large increments. Fernando Alonso is set to return to the McLaren cockpit for this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix . John Watson poses with his McLaren on a visit to the team's factory earlier this month . McLaren say they have a good car, and I don’t doubt that. They have many clever, bright and good people there. It is going to be tough, but what they have to do is make progress at every race, and make that progress fairly rapidly. What we saw in Melbourne was not representative and the best thing that could happen was for Jenson Button to finish the race, albeit last and two laps down. But the benefits Honda would have gained from that would be invaluable. Before then, their longest continuous run had been only 12 laps in Barcelona, so ironically it turned out to be their best test day. Jenson Button was certainly not racing. The massive problem for Honda is that they can do very little, in terms of testing, once the engine is certified and in the car. Renault wanted to have an opportunity to produce a new engine this year, but the rules did not allow it. The earliest this can happen is 2016. McLaren however, will be boosted by the return of Fernando Alonso, who is set to return from injury at this weekend's race in Sepang. I have not had a satisfactory explanation about his testing crash which ruled him out of the season opener, and I don’t think anyone has. I found it very weird. But the most important thing I am concerned about, because I am a huge Alonso fan, is that he is back in the McLaren cockpit. His contribution to the team will be hugely substantial. There is no driver out there who will be more driven in getting that car to the standard he would expect. He did not sign up to McLaren-Honda to run around in an uncompetitive car at the back of the grid.

"Sir Alex Ferguson made a phone call to Tony Blair as part of a desperate attempt to keep Manchester United in the 1999-2000 FA Cup, a man close to the talks has revealed. But the then Prime Minister was about to go into a meeting with Yugoslavia president Slobodan Milosevic in a bid to bring an end to the raging war in Kosovo and could not speak. As a result, Sir Alex admitted defeat and United ended up going to FIFA's inaugural Club World Championship in Brazil in an attempt to boost the FA's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to win the right to host the 2006 World Cup, and pulling out of a competition they had won a year previously. Sir Alex Ferguson  (right) asked Tony Blair (left) if Manchester United could compete in the 1999-2000 FA Cup . Manchester United were asked by Blair's envoy to play at the inaugural Club World Championship in 2000 . United withdrew from the 1999-2000 FA Cup in order to help the FA's bid to host the 2006 World Cup . Andy Walsh is now general manager at FC United, the club set up in protest at the Glazer family's takeover of United in 2005 who are set to move to a new home in April. But in June of 1999 he was an member of the influential Independent Manchester United Supporters Association and in regular contact with the fiery Scotsman. Andy, who made the revelation in an interview with the fanzine Red News, explained the unlikely story to Sportsmail. 'United came out as the villains in all of it,' Andy said. 'But both Sir Alex and then chairman Martin Edwards were under incredible pressure from Tony Banks, the Prime Minister's envoy for the World Cup bid, and from David Davies, the FA's acting chief executive to pull out of the FA Cup and go to Brazil for the Fifa tournament. 'As fans we wanted to find ways of keeping them in the FA Cup and we thought we had come up with a solution. 'It involved moving some of the fixtures to earlier in the season and creating a gap before United were due to go in January during which, if the FA would move the tie, they could play their third round cup match.' Manchester United were under pressure to withdraw from the FA Cup, according to Andy Walsh (centre) Andy explained that the plan had gathered momentum, but added that things took a turn for the worse at the Charity Shield. 'We were playing Arsenal and Martin Edwards was sat next to the new Minister for Sport, Kate Hoey. She made some remark along the lines of ""I believe you're ruining this season's FA Cup"" and when word of that got back to Fergie he was furious. 'I spoke to him over the phone and he said: ""That's it, they're forcing us out. F*** them. We're going to Brazil and that's the end of it"". 'Then he told me that he had tried to call Tony Blair and he couldn't sort it. 'I'd seen Blair on the news that morning going to Yugoslavia so I asked Fergie what had been said. 'He told me that Blair had told him he was about to go into a meeting with Milosevic and that was the end of it.' Blair could not answer Ferguson's request as he was about to speak to  Slobodan Milosevic (pictured) The saga turned into a disaster all around, with England's World Cup bid failing and United drawing with Mexicans Necaxa (with David Beckham sent off and Ferguson sent to the stands for complaining about the decision) and defeated by Brazilians Vasco da Gama. Sir Alex would have the last laugh, however, with his side returning to England to romp to the Premier League title, finishing 18 points ahead of Arsenal. In the summer of 1999 peacekeepers entered Kosovo as Milosevic's forces withdrew. He would eventually be found dead in his cell in 2006 during a war crimes prosecution at The Hague at which he was defending himself.","Man United were asked by Tony Blair's envoy to play at the Club World Championship in order to boost the FA's bid to host the 2006 World Cup .

"Andy Murray is so determined to maintain his positive start to the tennis season that he is shelving any plans for a honeymoon until the end of the year in November. And the world No 4, who is marrying Kim Sears on April 11 in Dunblane Cathedral, has not entirely ruled out playing in the Monte Carlo Open in the week immediately afterwards. He thinks that unlikely, but as one of the most momentous days in his eventful life looms he is adamant that he can compartmentalise such questions and focus on the Miami Open, his last tournament as a single man. Andy Murray practices in Florida ahead of his opening match at the Miami Open this week . Andy Murray takes time out to sign autographs for supporters in Florida on the second day of the Miami Open . The world No 4 poses with fans  at the Crandon Park Tennis Centre . Murray happily signed autographs ahead of his opening match against either Donald Young or Yen Hsun Lu . After reaching the semi-final in Indian Wells last week Murray is now the second highest points scorer on the ATP Tour this year, albeit some way behind the dominant Novak Djokovic. He now arrives at the event hosted by the city he considers a second home – where plays either Donald Young or Yen Hsun Lu – and is not finding it hard to separate the two biggest things in his life, happy to discuss the forthcoming nuptials with Kim when relaxing at his downtown apartment. 'Tennis is important but we also have lives to live as well,' he said on Tuesday. 'When I'm on the court I'm not thinking ""I'm getting married in a few weeks"" but back at the apartment there's time to do that. I can concentrate on both. 'As long as it's not in the forefront of my mind when I'm training then it's fine. It hasn't been a problem for me yet and I don't see it as an issue.' Whatever happens at this tournament the 27 year-old Scot will not rush back across the Atlantic: 'Hopefully it won't finish for me here until a week on Sunday and then I'll go home after that,' said Murray, who is having not just one but three best men: brother Jamie, former Davis Cup player Ross Hutchins and an old friend from Spain, Carlos Mier. Murray said he is shelving plans for a honeymoon after marrying Kim Sears in April until later this year . The 27-year-old, who has started the year in good form, waits to speak to members of the media on Tuesday . Murray says he is coping fine juggling his tennis and planning a wedding . Murray is marrying long-term partner Sears in his hometown Dunblane on April 11 . 'If I don't do well I'm going to stay here anyway and train on the clay and get used to playing in hot conditions. Regardless of how I do I'll be here for the next ten days.' With his 28th birthday looming time is short and Murray's first few weeks as a married man will involve getting stuck into the clay with little luxuriating in his new status. He will play in Munich, Madrid and Rome before the French Open, and might even take his new bride straight to the Riviera. 'Depending on how I feel after the wedding there's potential to play Monte Carlo, but I'd say that's unlikely. The honeymoon won't be until the end of the year.' It was this time last year that he split from Ivan Lendl in a tumultuous week when he cut a distraught figure, and he now feels far more settled with the Czech's replacement Amelie Mauresmo. 'My mind is a lot clearer and I think that's shown,' he said. 'Last year I came here and had struggled for the first three months and physically I was still not feeling great after surgery. I hadn't seen Ivan much, probably for only three to four weeks since my surgery (in late September) and there wasn't much direction. That carried on for a bit after I finished here. 'I was disappointed with how I played against Novak on Saturday but otherwise I felt I played well at Indian Wells. I hadn't played well there for about five years and this was by far the best in that time.'

Murray will be hoping to go one step further in Miami, a tournament he has won twice before in 2009 and 2013 . Murray's caoch Amelie Mauresmo watches on from the stands in Indian Wells . A look at the 'Race for London' confirms this has been a decent start to the year for Murray, with him ahead of Tomas Berdych, Stan Wawrinka and Roger Federer, in that order. The perception that he has stuttered might have been inflated by the loss to the imperious Djokovic. The world No 4 took one of his near three million followers on Twitter to task on Monday for questioning his methods in a curiously long exchange – you never know what you are going to get from Murray on social media, but at least he does not leave his account to others for mere PR puffs. In the hot mid-day sun on Tuesday he went well beyond the call of duty doing pictures and autographs, having also discussed his hiring of Jonas Bjorkman as assistant coach. The Swede cannot join him until he is knocked out of his country's version of Strictly Come Dancing. 'We spoke on the phone for two and a half hours,' Murray revealed. 'The time went very quickly. He has also spoken to Amelie on the phone and apparently they also got along very well.'","Murray will be playing in the Miami Open this week .

"Alastair Cook fell cheaply in both innings as MCC lost inside three days to county champions Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi. Cook, who made just three first time round, mustered five at his second attempt on Tuesday morning - before his attempt to dispatch a short ball from Jack Brooks went straight into the hands of Adil Rashid at midwicket. The England Test captain will next week depart for his first international assignment of this Ashes year - to take on West Indies. Alastair Cook trudges off the field in Abu Dhabi after falling for five following just three in the first innings . The England Test captain faced 30 balls for his five for the MCC as they were easily beaten by Yorkshire . But he will do so on the back of two failures in his only two first-class innings since last season. Without a major contribution from him - and despite 74 in the second innings from his fellow, and former England, opener Nick Compton - MCC went down by nine wickets. They conceded a first-innings deficit of 151, and then managed only 220 all out next time as Brooks (three for 22) and Rashid (four for 72) took the bowling honours - England's leg-spin call-up finishing with two wickets in two balls. Yorkshire needed 20 overs under lights against the pink ball in the desert to knock off the 70 required. Cook's potential England opening partner, Adam Lyth, wrapped up the match with 46 not out . Lyth hits through the offside at Sheikh Zayed Stadium as Yorkshire claimed a nine-wicket victory . First-innings centurion Adam Lyth, Cook's prospective new Test opening partner after being named in the squad to take on the Windies, finished the match with successive boundaries off Adam Riley for an unbeaten 46. The White Rose therefore started the new season with an emphatic win. Cook caused a stir last week when he described England's decision to replace him as their World Cup captain as ""probably wrong"", in hindsight. He continued his poor form in a one-day international series in Sri Lanka late last year, and England responded by dropping him in favour of Eoin Morgan. Yorkshire opener, Lyth (centre), at the end of the match as his side needed 20 overs to chase down 70 . They went on, however, to make an embarrassing early exit from the global tournament in Australia and New Zealand - beating only minnows Scotland and Afghanistan, and eliminated by a defeat against Bangladesh. Cook agreed to play for MCC against Yorkshire at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in the traditional curtain-raiser for the new season. But there was to be no return to form for England's most prolific Test centurion - who is without an international hundred in any format since May 2013.","England captain Alastair Cook scored three and five for the MCC .

"When Gareth Bale scored in the final of the European Cup and the Spanish Cup in the same season last year, he did something for Real Madrid that only Raul and Ferenc Puskas had managed before him. We can be fairly sure that no one ever tried to kick Puskas’ 1959 Mercedes 180 as it pulled out of the club’s training ground. The same cannot be said for Bale’s white Bentley, which was attacked as he left Madrid’s Valdebebas training complex in the early hours of Monday morning after the Clasico. Gareth Bale has joined up with the Wales national team ahead of their upcoming match against Israel . Bale's car was attacked by angry Real Madrid fans following their 2-1 defeat by Barcelona on Sunday . The world's most expensive footballer was confronted by fans as he left the club's Valdebebas training base . The £86million signing's white Bentley is struck by this fan while others jeered Wales international Bale . Bale has struggled to replicate the form he had shown during his first season at Real Madrid . Bale would not expect to have earned the same level of respect as the ‘Galloping Major’, who won three European Cups and scored 156 league goals in 180 games, but he has four trophies in his first year-and-a-half at the club, so the animosity he has encountered is impossible to justify and hard to understand. ‘He scored the winner in the Spanish Cup final; he scored the winner in the Champions League final. He is already a Real Madrid legend,’ gushed Madrid sports daily Marca when Bale won the European Cup in Lisbon last May. Its rival publication in the Spanish capital, Diaro AS added: ‘Marcelo and (Cristiano) Ronaldo both scored afterwards but Bale’s was the winner because it was game-over after that.’ Those two publications have changed their tune 10 months on — dedicating pages to fan polls that call for the Welshman to be dropped. On Tuesday, 70 per cent of 8,000 supporters responding to one online survey said they wanted Bale left out of the team. There was no shortage of ammunition in the Madrid press, with statistics such as ‘he never set foot in the penalty area in the second half against Barca’ and ‘he only played seven passes after the break — just three more than Lucas Silva who came on three minutes from time’. The fan tries to give the car a kick as Bale pulls away and the abuse continues to be thrown his way in Spain . Bale and his Madrid team-mates lost 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Sunday night in a fiercely-contested El Clasico . An estimated 400 million people watched Bale struggle on television as Real moved four points behind Barca . Following the incidents that occurred involving three individuals in the early hours of Monday morning outside Ciudad Real Madrid, Real Madrid C. F. wishes to outline the following: . 1. The Club has already identified the individuals responsible, one a Real Madrid member, for these aggressive and violent actions against several of our players. 2. Details of this member's identity were sent to the Club's Discipline Commission, requesting that it expel the individual from Real Madrid for what is considered a very serious offence. 3. This afternoon, the Discipline Commission held an emergency meeting and decided to open a disciplinary investigation and provisionally suspend the individual's rights as a member and access to the Santiago Bernabéu or any Real Madrid facilities. 4. Real Madrid has notified Spain's National Anti-Violence Commission of the incidents that took place, as well as the identities of the individuals responsible, requesting that it apply those sanctions that it considers appropriate. 5. Furthermore, Real Madrid will take any applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for these incidents. All this supposedly supports the theory that Bale is in decline. But behind the numbers the story is a little more complicated than his critics care to admit. Bale came back to pre-season training in peak physical condition last summer and was comfortably the club’s best player on the tour of the US, scoring in friendlies against Manchester United and Inter Milan. When Real Madrid went on a run of 22 straight wins, Bale scored in the 5-1 win over Basle that began that hot streak, he got two in the next game that saw them beat Deportivo 8-2 and netted again in the 5-1 win over Cordoba that followed. But a thigh injury suffered in October saw him miss three weeks of the season and in his absence Carlo Ancelotti fielded a midfield quartet of James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Isco. And that is where many of his current problems began. Bale has been criticised by Real supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013 . Bale followed in the footsteps of former Real Madrid duo Ferenc Puskas (left) and Raul by scoring in the final of the European Cup and the Spanish Cup during the same season . The Wales international took his anger out on a corner flag after netting a brace against Levante on March 15 . Real Madrid superstar Bale (right) will be hoping to lead Chris Coleman's Wales to Euro 2016 . Wales, who are currently just one point behind Group B leaders Israel, need Bale to be firing on all cylinders . The team kept winning and with the four passing midfielders the football resembled that played by Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona which many Madrid followers had spent so long envying. The purists loved it and they also loved Isco’s part in it — a Malaga lad who felt like one of their own. Bale came back into the team and his part in the club’s historic run picked up where it had left off, scoring in the 2-0 win over San Lorenzo that made Real Madrid world club champions in December. But when the run came to an end in their next competitive game against Valencia, the season began to unravel and he became the scapegoat. In the defeat by Valencia he was blamed for squandering a late chance and ignoring Karim Benzema’s screams for a pass. The idea that he should make way for Isco now went hand in hand with the theory that he was selfish. Ronaldo did him no favours in the next game when he very publicly chastised him for shooting instead of passing late in a match against Espanyol. ‘Puta’ (f***!) shouted the Portuguese throwing his arms down in disgust. Bale’s every touch from there on in was whistled, despite the fact that he had scored direct from a free-kick earlier in the game — something that Ronaldo hasn’t done now in over 50 attempts. The under-current of competition between Bale and Ronaldo is another factor. It is no secret that president Florentino Perez sees Bale as Ronaldo’s eventual successor both on the pitch as a match winner and off it as a big-money contract winner. Cracks appear to be appearing in Bale's relationship with Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo . Bale and his girlfriend Emma Rhys-Jones must decide where their young daughter goes to school . Ronaldo is not enamoured with the idea of being replaced by anyone and, despite the fact Bale lives in the same luxury ‘La Finca’ neighbourhood as Ronaldo, there is not the closeness between the two that has developed at Barcelona between Neymar and Lionel Messi. When Ronaldo threw a party for his 30th birthday, Bale was invited but did not attend — perhaps wisely, considering the fall-out that followed the festivities, coming as they did on the day of a 4-0 Madrid-derby defeat. Bale’s partner Emma Rhys-Jones lives with him in Madrid although, with a young daughter Alba-Violet not yet three years of age, frequent trips can be made back to Wales. At some point in the future a decision will have to be made about schools. And he will need to be a sure that Madrid is the right city to justify putting down deeper roots. He says he barely noticed the thugs who tried to kick his car as he drove away from the training ground at 1.30am on Monday. But how long before the lack of respect from supporters, commentators and at times even team-mates begins to take its toll? Tuesday marked 10 months to the day since Madrid won the Champions League and Bale arrived back in the city at 4.30am to be greeted by an open-top bus that took him through streets filled with jubilant supporters. The Madrid homecomings are not as pleasant as they used to be.","Gareth Bale's car was attacked after Real Madrid were beaten by Barcelona .

"Harry Arter had only to turn to his brother-in-law for advice as he prepared to embark upon his senior international career with the Republic of Ireland. The Bournemouth midfielder arrived at the Republic's Portmarnock base on Monday to meet up with Martin O'Neill's squad for the first time ahead of Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland, but he did so having quizzed Fulham's former England international Scott Parker about life on the big stage. Parker is married to Arter's sister, Carly, and sent the 25-year-old on his way telling him just to do what he has been doing for the Cherries this season to help leave them within striking distance of the Barclays Premier League. Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter (left) holds off the challenge of Middlesbrough's Lee Tomlin on Saturday . Asked what the former Charlton, Chelsea, Newcastle, West Ham and Tottenham midfielder's advice had been, Arter said: 'Just 'be yourself', really, I think that's all you can do. 'You have been picked for a reason and I have been picked because the manager was impressed with the way I play, so if I come here any different and not confident, then I would not show the best of my ability. 'He just said, 'be yourself, that's what you are picked for'. 'I'm pleased with my form. I am part of a team that's top of the league and things are going well. My main goal when I play is to be a positive influence on the team and try to be part of a successful team, and at the moment, we are so all in all, good.' Arter celebrates scoring his side's second goal during Bournemouth's 3-0 win against Boro on Saturday . Arter, who qualifies for the Republic through his grandmother, has fought his way back in his career after having to prove himself all over again in non-league football with Woking after being released by Charlton. However, he never lost belief in his own ability and has worked his way back to where he believes he belongs, ready to make his mark in international football and hopefully, in the Premier League. He said: 'I was playing non-league and international football is far from that. I was obviously only a young boy then. My main focus then was just to work as hard as I could to get back to a level I thought I could play at. 'I am confident in my own ability and the level I feel I am capable of playing at. The key to that is just working hard and not resting on your laurels. 'From the age of 19 up until now, I haven't done that.' Scott Parker told his brother-in-law Arter to 'be yourself, that's what you are picked for' O'Neill has been to see the player, who has represented Ireland at Under-17 and Under- 19 level, on several occasions this season, but did not inform him of his impending elevation. Arter said: 'I didn't realise. It was a Thursday and I was just in the gym, and one of the lads just popped in and said 'congratulations, you got called up'. Obviously, I wasn't aware of anything, so it was a nice surprise. 'It was a different way of finding out, but one that was exciting. I spoke to Martin maybe a few days after that and he told me his thoughts, and I just couldn't wait to get over here.' Arter was one of several new faces at the training ground on Tuesday with skipper Robbie Keane and Stoke striker Jonathan Walters also now in harness, although there was an addition to a casualty list which includes Burnley defender Stephen Ward when winger James McClean limped off. Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill (sixth left) addresses his squad in Malahide on Monday . He was immediately sent for a scan on his left ankle, leaving O'Neill fretting over one of his regular starters. The manager said: 'James has got a sore ankle. He's gone for a scan - precautionary, I hope - but he was just feeling it a little bit. We'll see how he is. 'It didn't happen in training. He felt a little bit sore after yesterday. He thought it might go away, but it's just a bit of a pain across the ankle. 'James has played exceptionally well for us in most of the games since I have been in charge. Obviously I know him quite well - very well, in fact - and yes, he's a good player for us.'","Harry Arter has been called up to the Republic of Ireland squad .

"QPR director of football Les Ferdinand has called for a Rooney Rule-style law to be introduced in English football to challenge what he believes is a 'lack of diversity' in the game. Football Association chairman Greg Dyke was first to suggest the adoption of the American system - which requires NFL teams to interview at least one minority candidate for each head coaching role - in 2014. And now Ferdinand has reopened the debate by insisting it could be the best way to give prospective black managers the confidence to aspire to positions they currently feel are beyond them. QPR director of football Les Ferdinand would like to see the introduction of a Rooney Rule-style law . The QPR director of football believes there is a lack of diversity in English football . Ferdinand told Sky Sports: 'We're not saying you have to give anybody the job - we're just saying ""give us an interview"" - that's all. 'It's just a case of being able to sit down and put your credentials on the table. At the moment we're not even getting that chance. 'People often talk and say ""I'm not racist"" and don't even realise that they are being racist because they won't give you that opportunity. 'You may have already decided who your next manager is going to be but if I sit down in front of you I might impress you so much that you might recommend me to someone else.' FA chairman Greg Dyke was first to suggest the adoption of the American system in 2014 . Ferdinand wants black managers to be given the opportunity to showcase their credentials at interviews . Dyke's support for the Rooney Rule was not shared by others in the game with  Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore rejecting the idea. But Ferdinand's views are shared by anti-racist campaigners Kick It Out, which told Sky Sports News: 'The access to opportunities for employment in football continue to be out of reach for many. The recruitment procedures are flawed, and there is a lack of accountability and transparency in the processes. 'We need to see a level playing field established where individuals possessing the necessary qualifications and experience are able to apply and be taken into proper consideration for positions. 'As it stands, many credible candidates who are suitable for jobs do not feel it is worthwhile applying as they see a closed culture which exists preventing them from having a fair chance.' The League Managers Association supports the implementation of a Rooney Rule-style law, and a spokesman said: 'The LMA is committed to the fundamental principle of equal opportunities for anyone, from any background, who wishes to work and build a career, as a manager or coach, in professional football and we are focussed on the need to increase the number of managers from black and ethnic minorities who have coaching or management qualifications.'","QPR director Les Ferdinand believes there is a lack of diversity in football .

"Luis Suarez has backed his Barcelona team-mate Neymar after the Brazilian was criticised for hogging the ball during Sunday's El Clasico win against Real Madrid. The former Liverpool man scored the winning goal early in the second half, as the Catalonian side extended their lead at the top of La Liga to four points but his team-mate came under-fire after choosing to shoot instead of pass the ball when in a good positions. But Suarez has defended Neymar and believes he was doing what he supposed to do as an attacker and reckons the talented attacker will win the most prestigious award a footballer can in the future. Luis Suarez has backed his Barcelona team-mate Neymar after the forward was criticised for being 'selfish' Neymar (centre) was defended by the Uruguayan who thinks he was right to play how he did as a forward . The Uruguayan told RAC1: 'He was right to try and finish his chances and not pass. Strikers are selfish. 'He is a key player and I'm convinced that he will win the Ballon d'Or.' Suarez was Barcelona's hero at full time after his brilliant control was matched with an equally impressive finish following Dani Alves' pinpoint pass. The Brazilian had a number of opportunities to release the ball in a good position but chose to go for goal . But the £75million man, was less than impressed with his overall performance. 'The goal obviously has added significance because of who we were playing and in terms of La Liga,' he said. 'At the end of the match I made some amateurish mistakes but that was because I was tired. Luckily nothing happened.' Suarez slots home the winner after brilliantly controlling Dani Alves' long ball over the top of the defence . Barcelona were drawn against Chelsea's conquerors in the quarter finals of the Champions League after dispatching of Manchester City and ending England's hopes of having a team progress into the last eight. But Suarez knows that his side have to beat the top teams if they want to be the best in Europe. 'We are aware that to win the Champions have to beat the best teams, starting with PSG,' he added. Suarez knows his side will be in for a tough task against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League .","Luis Suarez has defended Neymar over claims the Brazilian is 'selfish'

"England proposals for men’s Team GB football at the Rio Olympics have already been kicked into the long grass by the other home nations — and the women’s hopes are going in the same direction. There were strong hopes that a women’s team could still represent GB in Brazil in 2016 when the strength of the opposition for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland soon made it obvious that the men’s initiative was a non-starter. Team GB are unlikely to reform for 2016 Olympics after coming together for London 2012 . But the Celtic countries, having been promised that the two football sides at London 2012 were a one-off, have informed the FA that they see no reason to treat women’s football any differently because it still threatens their independence — however many times they’re reassured by FIFA that it won’t. The FA will announce imminently that both Team GB football sides have been scrapped. Such are football’s sensitive politics that after FIFA president Sepp Blatter had praised UEFA’s work in his opening speech at the UEFA Congress in Vienna, the president of the European body, Michel Platini, left out his one dig at Blatter contained in advance copies of his speech. Michel Platini (right) seemed to bite his lip during his speech about Sepp Blatter's FIFA at the UEFA Congress . Platini, in an obvious nod to Blatter’s regular references to steering the world football ship, was due to say: ‘I regard myself as a simple team-mate, at most your captain. But not the captain of a ship that is being battered by a storm, clinging to the helm for dear life.’ But he skipped the bit about ‘clinging to the helm for dear life’. Nothing sums up Blatter’s presidential election trickery more than the decision to have a special meeting in Zurich to decide future numbers of World Cup places — the day after the Congress vote in May. This will allow Blatter at least to make promises about more World Cup places to the confederations who support him. FIFA say the issue has to be debated afterwards as candidate Luis Figo (right) has increasing World Cup participation as part of his manifesto. England return to Dublin for a friendly against Ireland after riots saw the last game abandoned in 1995 . There is confidence England’s powderkeg friendly against the Republic of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium on June 7 — the first time England have played in Dublin since a riot forced the abandonment in 1995 — will pass without trouble. All the focus in Ireland is on the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier with Scotland on June 13. No whitewash for Gill . There was no surprise about David Gill being elected British vice-president on the FIFA ExCo at the UEFA Congress on Tuesay. But FA of Wales’ outspoken president Trefor Lloyd-Hughes, who has made increasingly outlandish claims about FA skulduggery, received 10 votes out of 54 which is nine more than many expected. Meanwhile, Gill said that rather than ask ‘awkward’ questions of the Zurich regime which FA chairman Greg Dyke wants him to do, he will be putting ‘relevant and appropriate’ ones. Luis Figo (left) and the more impressive Michael van Praag are unlikely to oust Blatter as FIFA president . The worry for all three UEFA-endorsed rivals for Blatter’s crown — Prince Ali of Jordan, Holland’s Michael Van Praag and Portugal’s Luis Figo — is that the FIFA president still enjoys backing in Europe. Estonia football president Aivar Pohlak claims as many as half of UEFA delegates could back Blatter. That seems unlikely but at least 15 out of 54 countries could. Meanwhile, Van Praag was easily the most impressive of the three challengers when they were given the Congress floor. FA chairman Greg Dyke’s demand for radical changes in top-flight clubs’ 25-man squads to ensure young English players get more game time has irritated the Premier League. Dyke said: ‘We’re open to discussions and I’d like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue.’ FA chief Greg Dyke has angered Premier League clubs with his plans for more home-grown players . There could now be tension between Dyke and the PL at the clubs’ summit on Thursday, particularly given Dyke was last week advised not to go public by the Professional Game representatives on the FA Board. But the extent to which Wembley were determined to get maximum publicity for Dyke’s proposals was shown by them bringing in expensive PR firm Milltown Partners to lobby media to attend the press briefing. It was also held at the start of international week so the PL could have no complaints about it deflecting attention from their competition.","Opposition from home nations is set to scrap plans for Women's Team GB football team at the 2016 Olympic Games .

"UEFA president Michel Platini has strongly supported FA chairman Greg Dyke’s campaign for more home grown players in the Premier League. Dyke revealed on Monday that he wanted to increase the minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12 in order to help the England team. Platini, speaking after being elected unopposed for a third term at the UEFA Congress in Vienna, is the best possible ally for Dyke, who is sure to face formidable opposition from the all-powerful Premier League. UEFA president Michel Platini agrees with Gerg Dyke's plans to increase number of homegrown players . The FA chairman wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12 . Greg Dyke wants more homegrown players in Premier League teams, raising the number per squad from eight to 12. But only three current squads fall short of that number, though many of their homegrown players have yet to play for the first team. Chelsea (11): . Cesc Fabregas, Gary Cahill, John Terry, Nathan Ake, Andreas Christensen, Jeremie Boga, Mitchell Beeney, Dominic Solanke, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Isaiah Brown, Jamal Blackman. Tottenham (9): . Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason, Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb, Ben Davies, Harry Winks, Joshua Onomah. Manchester City (8): . Joe Hart, James Milner, Frank Lampard, Gael Clichy, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Bersant Celina, Jose Pozo. Platini said: ‘This is a position we defend. We’re not only talking about England, we’re talking all of Europe. Mr Dyke’s struggle with the FA is something we share and we agree with him. With the new leader of the European Commission (Jean-Claude Juncker), it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect homegrown, grassroots young players. ‘We share the same perspective. We will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one. There is free flow of workers in Europe but there are some things that doesn’t apply to, like in this case.’ UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino was also enthusiastic about Dyke’s mission. He said: ‘It’s fantastic. Eight out of 25 (the number of home-grown players that currently must be included in a Champions League squad) is not as many as it should be. So whatever move in favour of increasing homegrown players is something we can only support. Congratulations to England.’ Dyke’s proposals have irritated the Premier League who never like being dictated to by the FA. Dyke said on Tuesday: ‘We’re open to discussions and I’d like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue.’ Dyke's plans also include 'home-grown' players having to train in England for three years before the age of 18 . Manchester United director David Gill said the proposals needed 'to be discussed by all the stakeholders' It could make for some tension between Dyke and the Premier League at the club summit tomorrow, especially as the Professional Game representatives on the FA Board had advised Dyke (left) last week not to go public. Manchester United director David Gill sits on the UEFA ExCo and will join the FIFA ExCo in May after his election on Tuesday as the British vice-president. Gill, who is also a PL representative on the FA board, said: ‘It’s a relevant thing to look at, but it needs to be discussed by all the stakeholders.’ Michael Carrick said he would love more homegrown players to get opportunities but admitted it is difficult . Carrick said that the system doesn't always work in favour of players like it has for Harry Kane of late . United and England midfielder Michael Carrick said: ‘We’d all love more homegrown, British players to get opportunities. It’s difficult. There are two sides to the argument: you’ve got to be good enough to get the chance in the first place but someone’s got to give you that chance. ‘Someone like Harry Kane is the perfect example of how we’d all like it to be. He gets his chance and takes it and has elevated himself to another level. ‘But it doesn’t always work like that. Plenty of times you look at young lads and think, he’s got a chance but it doesn’t quite work.’ England team-mate Gary Cahill said: ‘I agree with some aspects. I think it’s important to have a mixture. I love to see young players getting opportunities. But I’m respectful of the fact that the Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world and it attracts some of the top players. ‘Fans want to see exciting players and top clubs want top players and sometimes they are overseas. It is a matter of getting that balance.’ Gary Cahill wants more young players to get opportunities but respected the Premier League's position . Cahill hopes a balance can be reached between the quality of the league and young players coming through . Ritchie Humphreys, the PFA chairman and an FA Commission member, said: ‘Any foreign player who comes to this country we welcome. But we also have a duty of care to our national game and to young homegrown players. ‘Everything we are working towards on the FA Commission is with the aim of making our national side more competitive at elite level. The PFA supports that.’","FA chairman proposed raising the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12 at Premier League clubs .

"Frank Lampard has no regrets over delaying his move to New York City FC – but has already pencilled in the date when he faces Steven Gerrard for the first time. The Manchester City midfielder was expected to join the club's sister outfit for their maiden MLS season which kicked off earlier this month. But in a controversial move which angered many of the new franchise's supporters, he extended his stay at the Etihad Stadium to the end of the season as Manuel Pellegrini's men attempt to retain their Premier League title. Frank Lampard delayed his move to New York City FC to see out the season with Manchester City . The former Chelsea legend has no regrets in controversially putting off his move to the MLS . Lampard's decision has been questioned after starting only two games for City in 2015 . With Lampard's former club Chelsea now six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand, and having started just two matches since the turn of the year, some have questioned the logic behind the decision. But the veteran midfielder, who won 11 trophies in a glittering 13 years at Stamford Bridge, has no such thoughts. 'I’m very fortunate,' he said. 'This part of my career, coming to City, was something I never saw coming and when I look back and think, blimey, at 36 I got asked to come to the champions and a club with this pedigree of player here. 'I’m delighted that happened as it has done and I’m delighted with the future I’ ve got and the opportunity to go on and play in New York and individually try to help there, but also be part of a new football club in one of the greatest cities in the world.' The veteran midfielder poses in front of the New York skyline after signing for the new franchise . The 36-year-old was all smiles after being introduced as a New York City player in July 2014 . Lampard will join former Spain and Barcelona star David Villa (centre) at his new club . Former England team-mate Steven Gerrard will also head across the Atlantic at the end of the season to join rivals LA Galaxy. And Lampard is relishing the prospect of facing his old pal - when asked when the match takes place he was quick to answer. 'August 23,' he said without hesitation. 'It’s at their place. It’s the day after my daughter’s birthday so I should know!' Lampard believes Liverpool legend Gerrard, 34, has made the right call to follow him to the US after 17 years in the first team at Anfield. Steven Gerrad was sent of in his last game against Manchester United ahead of his own move to America . Former England team-mates never quite clicked while playing together for the national team . Lampard is looking forward to renewing hostilities with Gerrard once they are both playing across the pond . 'I’m pleased for Stevie,' he said. 'I think it’s a very good move for him. What more can he do at Liverpool? 'He’s had a fantastic career.' Lampard added that the pair, who retired from international duty a month apart last year, became close during their time with the Three Lions. 'We get on very well, particularly in our latter years, as captain and vice-captain of England,' he explained. 'I’ve a huge amount of respect for him and look forward to getting up against him out there.' Gerrard has signed to join MLS champions LA Galaxy where David Beckham and Robbie Keane have starred . Another of the MLS's marquee signings has been Brazil legend Kaka arriving at Orlando City . Lampard believes it is the right moment to go for Gerrard, who was sent off 38 seconds after coming off the bench in Liverpool's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. 'I think only individuals know the right time for them,' he said. 'I wasn’t sure about my time as a Chelsea player. The decision got made for me. When the decision is not made for you, and you have to make it yourself then it’ s more difficult maybe. Only he knows that and I think at the minute I would say yes because what more can he do? If not their greatest player he will be right up there with the greatest players ever.'","Frank Lampard signed for  New York City before delaying his MLS arrival to finish the Premier League season playing for Manchester City .

"Former Northern Ireland international and Real Mallorca striker Gerry Armstrong is an expert analyst and commentator for Sky Sports’ coverage of Spanish football. Here, he shares his thoughts with Sportsmail's Craig Hope on the Gareth Bale saga at Real Madrid… . Gareth is under a lot of pressure and sometimes that can get to you. But the recent criticism aimed at him is completely unfounded and unnecessary. I have seen him play really well this season and I have seen him play some indifferent games. He is probably having a decent season, but it could still be brilliant. Real are only four points behind Barcelona in the league and you would fancy them to get past Atletico and into the last four of the Champions League. Gareth Bale was heavily criticised after Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat at the hands of La Liga rivals Barcelona . An estimated 400 million people watched Bale struggle on television as Real moved four points behind Barca . Bale has been criticised by Real  supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013 . And don’t forget what an impact he had last year. He scored in the final of the Champions League and Copa del Rey and finished with 22 goals. He's on 16 now and will better that total this year, what more can you ask? All this talk of dropping him is rubbish – you can’t drop Gareth Bale, he scores and creates too many goals. Real have been going through a slump in the past five weeks or so. They have been missing key players. But it seems Gareth has been taking a lot of the stick from fans, and I don’t agree with that, although he has probably been trying too hard at times. Now that Toni Kroos and Luka Modric are back I think you’ll see Gareth really re-emerge and rediscover his best form, because I admit he wasn’t great against Barcelona on Sunday. He wasn’t the only top player to disappoint, but he disappeared from the game for long periods and sometimes he needs to be more forceful. The Wales international took his anger out on a corner flag after netting a brace against Levante on March 15 . Cracks seem to be appearing in Bale's relationship with Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo . On the issue of him being unhappy, only he knows how happy he really is at Madrid. Part of the problem is the language and being comfortable with your team-mates. Then there is the situation with Cristiano Ronaldo. I wouldn’t say the relationship between himself and Ronaldo is bad, but Cristiano was so petulant when Gareth scored his goals against Levante last week - he could not hide the disappointment from his face. He’s like a spoilt brat at times. But the fans are so forgiving with Ronaldo because of the goals he scores, it’s very unfair. They say Gareth should pass more to Ronaldo - that’s nonsense. It was the same with Cesc Fabregas and the pressure on him to pass to Lionel Messi at Barcelona. It’s not helpful. AS say Real 'missed and they paid for it' while Marca highlight Madrid's misses during the La Liga match . I would like to see Gareth say, “I’m better than all of this” and prove how good he is on the pitch - and I think he will because he has got great ability. He’s got everything - he scores goals and creates them, he’s brilliant in the air, he strong, he’s fast, he’s aggressive. For me, he’s very close to being right up there with Messi and Ronaldo. There is talk of him going to Manchester United, but it would be a huge mistake on Real’s part if they agreed to sell him. If I was him though I’d keep my options open and see how I feel at the end of the season. But I think he will still be at Madrid next season. This will blow over given a few goals and the team clicking again. In a few weeks’ time I’d bet we’ll be having completely different discussions about Gareth and all of this will be forgotten.","Gareth Bale has been criticised following his display against Barcelona .

Just hours after the Gunners beat John Carver's side 2-1 at St James' Park - a game that Ozil was not well enough to feature in - the playmaker was spotted in a nightclub in the German capital.

"England’s fourth Six Nations runners-up finish in a row has been labelled ‘unacceptable’ by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie, with head coach Stuart Lancaster told performances must improve before the World Cup. Lancaster’s men suffered heartache as their thrilling 55-35 victory over France on Saturday saw them fall six points short of overhauling Ireland and securing a first title since 2011. But Ritchie said: ‘Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about. We should be winning more in terms of Grand Slams, Six Nations championships, other things. England are left reeling on the pitch as their 55-35 victory against France failed to secure the title . Captain Chris Robshaw (fourth right) looks dejected after England concede a try to France at Twickenham . Stuart Lancaster (left) and his players ponder a second-placed finish for a fourth successive season . ‘We had opportunities, let’s be clear — entirely in our control. The Irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches. We did not do enough. There’s no point in bleating about it. ‘We didn’t take opportunities, didn’t do what we should have done, were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win.’ But there was more than a little sense that Ian Ritchie was playing to his audience at Twickenham. And not only because the RFU’s affable chief executive quoted Hamlet when describing the ‘slings and arrows of outrageous fortune’ he experienced watching the engrossing Six Nations denouement. His public pronouncements were designed to strike a chord with those still uncomfortable with the six-year contracts served to England’s coaches last year. They were also designed as a shot across head coach Stuart Lancaster’s bows. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie (right) chats to Lancaster at England's base in Pennyhill Park in Bagshot . Ritchie (left) and Lancaster talk in the Twickenham stands prior to England's clash with New Zealand . Ritchie, an intelligent and thoughtful man, needed very little pressing to deliver the headline-grabbing line that England’s fourth successive runners-up spot under Lancaster was ‘unacceptable’. Often it takes hundreds of questions to extract such strong quotes from a senior figure. Yesterday it took two. It was almost as if Ritchie had decided what he was going to say in advance. This was no slip of the tongue. More a clever piece of brinkmanship designed to keep the pressure on Lancaster. The aim was also to avoid accusations that complacency has crept into an organisation which has pulled itself back from the brink in the public’s eyes since the dark days surrounding the scandal-hit 2011 World Cup campaign. Ritchie, the man at the top of an organisation now delivering everywhere but on the pitch, felt the need to crack the whip. Just not too hard. ‘Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about,’ said the former chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. ‘If you go back through history, bearing in mind a lot of things, we should be, as a country, winning more in terms of Grand Slams, Six Nations championships, other things. We had opportunities, let’s be clear — entirely in our control. The Irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches. ‘We did not do enough over the five matches. There’s no point in bleating about it. We simply didn’t take opportunities, didn’t do what we should have done, were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win.’ England winger Jack Nowell bursts through for the first of his two tries against Les Bleus . In six months, the RFU will host a tournament which is predicted to generate close to £1billion for the UK economy. Success for the home nation on the field is critical for fans, sponsors, media and administrators alike. The RFU’s strategic vision, which Ritchie helped draw up, decreed that England should head into the World Cup with a Six Nations title under their belt and a world ranking no lower than second. For all the brilliance of Saturday’s seven-try triumph over France, watched by 9.6million on terrestrial television, they have achieved neither. But the natural question if results are ‘unacceptable’ is ‘so what are the consequences?’ Surely there is no point having targets if shoulders are simply shrugged when they are not met. But, with six-year deals secured, the reality is that Lancaster and his tight-knit coaching team of Andy Farrell, Mike Catt and Graham Rowntree are going nowhere in a hurry. ‘It’s quite right in any management to have targets,’ insisted Ritchie. ‘But they’re not the be-all and end-all. You’ve got to look around at the totality of what’s going on, where we are and what we believe. Frontline players such as Owen Farrell (left) and Manu Tuilagi were unavailable for the Six Nations . ‘Have we missed some targets? Well, yes. We wanted to win the Six Nations. We wanted to be ranked two in the world. ‘We remain confident and optimistic with a belief we can do well at the World Cup. We remain absolutely confident, happy and committed to the team that we’ve got on the coaching staff.’ England were hamstrung by injuries in the build-up to the tournament. No fewer than 11 players were ruled out of their opening win over Wales in Cardiff and first-choice stars Manu Tuilagi, Joe Launchbury, Ben Morgan and Owen Farrell were absent for the duration. Stuart Lancaster with his tight-knit coaching team of Graham Rowntree (left), Mike Catt and Andy Farrell . That resulted in the emphasis being placed on youngsters such as George Ford, Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph, with Lancaster and his staff keen to highlight the depth that has emerged. But Ritchie, the man in charge of a union which makes more than twice as much money as any other in the world and has access to more players, added: ‘“We’re developing, this is a development opportunity” — I don’t take that. ‘We’ve got the resources, the talent, the ability. We’ve got to make sure we come out for the World Cup and deliver.’","RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie branded England's second-placed Six Nations finish as 'unacceptable'

"England are interested in bidding for Euro 2028 but are very unlikely to bid for the 2026 World Cup, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has revealed. FIFA announced last week that the decision on the 2026 tournament will be made in 2017 - when Sepp Blatter is still likely to be FIFA president.

David Beckham was part of the failed bid . Dyke said: 'The truth is, the chances of the 2026 World Cup being in Europe are virtually nil; Sepp Blatter has still got a good chance of being there when it is decided and we certainly won't bid if Blatter is there. 'Our policy is that we won't bid for almost any tournaments while the current leadership is there. 'We would be much more interested in bidding for Euro 2028 because we like UEFA but it is a very long time away still.'

"It is back to the drawing board for manager Chris Ramsey after embattled QPR fell to an uninspiring defeat at Crystal Palace. The west Londoners have just five points to show from their last 12 top-flight matches, putting their Premier League status at serious risk. Saturday's 3-1 defeat at Selhurst Park was the latest hammer blow, making it four straight defeats after Ramsey last month oversaw Rangers' first away win of the campaign. QPR boss Chris Ramsey believes that his side can still stay up despite their defeat at Crystal Palace . Former Manchester United winger Wilfired Zaha slid in at the back post to give Palace a first-half lead . James McArthur doubled the home side's lead five minutes before half-time against QPR . Morale had been boosted by that victory but now they are hurtling towards the Championship, with the first-half capitulation against Palace a particular concern. 'We'll go for it as best we can,' Ramsey said, looking ahead to the final nine matches. 'The players are disappointed. They're still unified in what we're trying to do and all we can do is keep fighting. 'The only thing we can do is go back to the drawing board, there's nothing else we can do.

"Roy Hodgson had in his hand a piece of paper. Well, more of a crumpled scrap, to be honest, and it was more a reminder of his ambition and his faith in the future than a declaration of war. When Hodgson unfolded his training notes, they included names scribbled in biro for a session at St George's Park and the two circled were Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane. Captain Rooney, with 101 caps and 46 goals, had started the day with a formal presentation of the England player of the year award for 2014, as voted for by supporters. Is this going to be England's new strike partnership for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday?

Inside area: 17 . Outside area: 2 . Kane was the new-boy, uncapped, in his first squad, but with eyes and lenses focused on him in search of clues about whether his Tottenham goal rate could be transplanted to the international stage. The 21-year-old Spurs striker took his tally for the season to 29 with a hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday and inched a little closer to his England debut when Daniel Sturridge pulled out with an injury. Hodgson proved with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling that he can be bold when it comes to selecting young players and his key decisions will revolve around whether to start with Kane against Lithuania in a sell-out Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley, on Friday.

Kane's chances of making his England debut improved after Daniel Sturridge withdrew from the squad . Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions for club side Tottenham Hotspur this term . 'His confidence must be sky-high,' said England's vice-captain Gary Cahill. 'To meet up with England for the first time off the back of a hat-trick, he is in a good place and deserves his place in this squad. 'For me he's ready to play, I'm sure he'd relish the opportunity, but so are the other guys. So that's down to the manager. 'It's always daunting when you're in the squad for the first time, even if you' re in fantastic form and I'm sure Harry's no different. He's still a young boy. But he needs to carry on doing what he does at club level. Everyone is aware of him. Everyone knows him. This should be no different. I'm sure he'll do terrifically well if called upon.' At club level, Cahill has played against him three times this season, winning twice with Chelsea, including the Capital One Cup final, and losing 5-3 at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day, when Kane scored twice. Kane and his England team-mates listen to instructions during a break in training . Rooney (centre) was presented with England Player of the Year award as voted for by fans . Gary Cahill applies pressure to the England new-boy during training on Tuesday morning . 'It's hard to talk a young player up too much because we do that a lot in this country, but for me he has everything,' said Cahill. 'He can hold the ball up, he runs in behind, he has two good feet, he can head, he can finish, he has a bit of pace and physically he is strong enough. 'For me, the attributes a striker needs are all there. It's about how he progresses. He comes across as a top professional.' The England players tried to make the transition smooth for Kane when he arrived at St George's Park on Monday. 'You introduce yourself and we train together,' said Cahill. Sturridge's thigh injury leaves Hodgson with three recognised strikers. Rooney will start as he closes in on Sir Bobby Charlton's England goal record after two goals in Scotland, in November, and Danny Welbeck performed well, scoring twice in a 3-1 win against Slovenia, three days before. If Hodgson sticks with a diamond formation Kane will be competing for a starting berth with Danny Welbeck . Michael Carrick is hoping the manager plays with a diamond because it will better suit the midfielder . If Hodgson sticks with the diamond midfield formation, which has served him well since he introduced it for the first qualifier in Switzerland, he will have to choose between Kane and Welbeck to partner the captain up front. This shape suits Sterling, in behind the strikers, and Michael Carrick, in front of the centre-halves, with Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph providing the mileage on either side. Delph has been ill and is yet to train with England this week but he reported to the camp yesterday. Another option Hodgson will consider, especially if Delph is below full power, is a 4-2-3-1 system with Henderson deep in tandem with Carrick and Kane up front, ahead of Welbeck, Rooney and Sterling. 'We've played a diamond enough times at Manchester United,' said Carrick. 'That's not to say it's the only position I can play, but it's a formation that would probably suit me. Hopefully it will.'","England play Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on Friday night .

"Gordon Strachan is living proof there is life after Manchester United. Scotland’s manager left the world’s wealthiest football club at the age of 32 and, like the cliché says, feared the only way was down. Within three years, he was captain of Leeds United, champions of England. The odds of Darren Fletcher mirroring that achievement at West Bromwich Albion are long. Yet Strachan casts a glance at one of his star midfielders now and sees a rejuvenated figure. Free of the ulcerative colitis which cast a long shadow over his Old Trafford career, Fletcher is playing football again. His performances at The Hawthorns have drawn critical acclaim. Scotland manager Gordon Strachan has praised Darren Fletcher for leaving Manchester United . Strachan has revealed he is yet to decide if Fletcher (centre) will lead Scotland in their upcoming fixtures . Scotland manager Strachan says he doesn't know who will be his captain for the upcoming fixtures . There can be no denying that having a Manchester United player as captain was a boon to Scots morale. Yet Strachan knew when the time was right to seek fresh pastures. Fletcher, he believes, is thriving in his new environment. ‘You can, when you leave Man United, go on and create a new career for yourself,’ said the Scotland boss as he prepared for the twin challenges of Northern Ireland and Gibraltar. ‘Some find it difficult, some get on with it and create a new career. That’s what Darren is doing now. ‘Tony Pulis, apart from being a good coach, knows good players. Getting good people around you is the secret. ‘I got on all right after I left Man United. I had good players around me and good people. ‘Football players just like playing football. Darren has got a hunger and a pride. It’s not easy to leave United. It’s one of the best clubs in the world, if not the best. ‘So there’s a point when you think, “Is this it?” But then you realise there’s more to life and your career can continue. There is another world out there.’ Manchester United was all Fletcher had known. Strachan (far right, pictured with Ron Atkinson, Jesper Olsen and Alan Brazil) left Man United to join Leeds . Celtic captain Scott Brown has been Scotland skipper in the absence of West Brom skipper Fletcher . Born in Dalkeith, he signed for Sir Alex Ferguson in 2003 and spent 12 years at the club. Celtic tried to bring him back to his native land before the opportunity to remain in the Premier League proved irresistible. In contrast with his latter years at United, when first-team appearances were bitty and sporadic, Fletcher has played almost every game since signing for Tony Pulis in the January window. ‘I think he’s happier in himself, which is understandable,’ said Strachan. ‘He has played 10 or 15 games this season and is enjoying life. ‘He has answered a few questions by playing all those games. I saw him a couple of weeks ago at Aston Villa and he was terrific, even though West Brom lost. ‘I’ve been lucky during his absence that I’ve got Scott Brown, James McArthur, James Morrison and Charlie Mulgrew. In the Republic of Ireland game, Mulgrew was as good as anyone in there. We have good players in midfield. ‘There is a physical and mental side to it for Darren but he has dealt with that. He has decided what his career is and that it’s not with Manchester United any more. He doesn’t want to be a sub, he wanted to do something about it.’ Fletcher has played seven games for West Brom since joining the Midlands outfit on February 2 . Fletcher decided to leave Manchester United after struggling to break into Louis van Gaal's first team plans . Capped 66 times, Fletcher has been captain of the national team for most of that time. It’s far from clear he will be this time, with Celtic’s Scott Brown claiming the armband in recent games. Strachan says he has yet to decide his team to face Northern Ireland, let alone the identity of his captain. The intensity of training has taken the Scotland boss by surprise, adding to the difficult decisions which lie in wait. ‘When I went out to training, I thought to myself I had four things to do and really I should be doing them over a four-day period,’ he continued. ‘I had to try to cram four things in and I wasn’t sure if we could push the players to do this. ‘But I kid you not, after I did the four things the players would happily have gone on for another half hour. ‘We couldn’t believe the intensity of the training - it’s amazing because some of them have already played 40 games this season but not one of them was giving an inch on either side. It was terrific and if we can take that into the game then we’ll be fine. ‘I almost had to calm them down and make a few adjustments just so that we could all get a breather.’ Steven Naismith (right) was desperate to train with the Scotland national team despite his recent exploits . It’s impossible for outsiders to know how true this is, yet there is a simple gauge for the contentment levels of a national team. The call-offs. If tired, mentally jaded players were tempted to miss an international week this would be it. An uninspiring friendly with Northern Ireland, followed by a qualifier with Gibraltar on Sunday at 5pm. Yet Shaun Maloney flew from California, where new club Chicago Fire lost to San Jose Earthquakes on Sunday night. Steven Naismith, in Ukraine with Everton last week, also passed on the chance to take some time off before joining up. ‘They surprise me with their enthusiasm because I thought, after four months and all the games they have played for their clubs in between, that this week would be all about rest and talking,’ said Strachan. ‘I thought I would have to protect them. But their energy is fantastic - they don’t seem to want to be protected. Most of them are happy with life and just want to play. ‘I’ve no idea what it is about them but they have a natural enthusiasm and enjoy working with each other. I don’t think we should analyse it too much - just go with the flow. You can screw yourself up the wall by over analysing things. ‘All I need to say is that Tuesday was not what I expected. ‘Shaun Maloney has just flown in from California. You say to him, “Do you want a wee rest?” But he’s not interested. ‘I said the same thing to Steven Naismith because he’s been doing a lot of playing and travelling in the Europa League with Everton. I actually asked him if he wanted two days off to spend at home with his family because I thought it would be beneficial. But again, he was not interested. He just wanted to come up and be part of the group. ‘On Monday, I needed 16 players for a specific training session I had in mind. But I had 17 of them all desperate to take part. ‘In the end, I had to remind Jordan Rhodes that he’s had a knock and that he could do with sitting this one out...’","Darren Fletcher ended his 12-year affiliation with Man United in February .

"Gary Cahill insists Harry Kane is ready to start for England against Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday. The absence of Daniel Sturridge, withdrawn from the squad with a hip injury, has boosted the Tottenham striker’s chances of being included in the first eleven. Cahill has faced Kane three times playing for Chelsea this season and was given a torrid time by the forward when he scored twice in Spurs’ 5-3 win on New Years' Day. Harry Kane could cap his first England squad call-up with a starting place against Lithuania on Friday night . England defender Gary Cahill (right) believes Kane would be ready to start for the Three Lions if selected . Kane trained with the England senior squad for the first time at St George's Park on Tuesday morning . Asked how Kane was fitting into training after getting his first call-up to the national squad, Cahill replied: ‘Really good. He’s been a real handful every time I’ve played against him. He’s a fantastic talent, not just holding the ball up but running in behind defenders. For me he’s got all the attributes a striker needs. ‘He scored a hat-trick just before his first meet-up with the England team is ideal so his confidence will be sky high. He’s still a young boy and it’s his first time in the squad. It’s always a bit daunting.’ Kane, still only 21, scored a treble against Leicester at the weekend to take his tally to 29 in all competitions, joint-top Premier League scorer with Diego Costa on 19 goals. Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck are both available, but Cahill is confident Kane will be ready if England manager Roy Hodgson decides to throw him in. ‘That’s down to the manager,’ he added. ‘We’ve got top strikers here. They’re all chomping at the bit to play, all good enough to play from the start, and Harry’s in that bracket. ‘He’s in top form in the league. To score a hat-trick leading up to your first senior call up is fantastic. I’m sure he feels he’s ready to play. It’s down to the manager, whatever he decides.’ Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions for club side Tottenham Hotspur this term . Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick echoed Cahill’s sentiment and has also backed Kane to have a bright future in the England senior team. He said: 'I think the progress he has made has been sensational from the start of the season to the level that he is at now. He has gone up two or three levels and the thing that has impressed me most about him is that as the spotlight has grown and expectations have grown he has grown and his performances have improved and improved and that is a really good sign. It by no means looks like this is a one off season. He looks like the real deal. I am sure he has a big big future ahead of him. ’The options are frightening, whoever plays whether it’s Sturridge, Welbeck, Wayne, Raheem Sterling, it's great to have those in the squad. We have an abundance of talent going forward. When you are at that level like the boys are they can play with each other no problem.’ Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has tipped Kane to have a bright international future .","Daniel Sturridge withdrew from the England squad on Monday night .

"England manager Roy Hodgson fears he may have to play a vastly weakened side in next Tuesday's friendly against Italy, with more players set to drop out of his squad once the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania has been played. Daniel Sturridge, Adam Lallana, Fraser Forster and Luke Shaw have all been forced to withdraw through injury already while Michael Carrick and Fabian Delph were unable to play a full part in training on Tuesday. And Hodgson expects to lose even more players in what is one of his most-significantly weakened England squads in recent memory. Roy Hodgson fears he could lose even more members of his England squad to injury in the coming days . The England manager already has a long list of absentees but could see more ahead of facing Italy . Hodgson oversaw training with the squad at St George's Park on Tuesday ahead of the two upcoming games . The Three Lions fly to Turin on Monday following Friday night's game against Lithuania at Wembley, but they could be missing even more players by the time they come to face the side they were beaten by in their World Cup opener last summer. 'Apart from all those players that I’ve suggested or have said aren’t here through injury I fear we’re going to lose a few more,' Hodgson said. 'There’s one or two that I know won’t be able to join us against Italy because of the current problems that they’re dealing with at the moment, so on this occasion in particular it won’t be as strong a team as I maybe would have liked to put out. 'In England, unfortunately you're always judged harshly and you're in the spotlight because everyone wants England to do well and believes we can do well. 'We’ll accept that but as far as I’m concerned it’s still the qualifiers that I put top of my list of priorities even though on paper Italy are a strong team to play than Lithuania.' Daniel Sturridge scored for Liverpool at the weekend but has been ruled out for England with a hip problem . Adam Lallana is another Liverpool and England player struggling with injury - he pulled out with groin trouble . Fraser Forster was in significant pain after picking up an injury for Southampton and also withdrew . Luke Shaw is another absentee for Hodgson, pulling out with an ankle problem ahead of the Lithuania game . Hodgson has been frustrated to see so many players absent from this selection but admits his luck with injuries of late may be coming back to bite him. 'We’ve been a bit unlucky on this occasion, it’s unusual,' he told talkSPORT. 'We’ve been very lucky most of the times we’ve got squads together that we haven’t lost a lot of players. This time to lose the two goalkeepers (Forster and Ben Foster) for example is an incredible blow. To lose people like (Jack) Wilshere, Lallana, (Alex) Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sturridge, all of whom you think are very important players in the year to come, to lose them all ahead of a qualifier that’s been a bit hard to take. 'But I still think theres enough good ones out there, so I still think we can get 11 good players on the field.' Michael Carrick was unable to take part in a full training session with the rest of the squad on Tuesday . Fabian Delph (bottom) has only just joined up with England after suffering from sickness of late . England have taken a maximum 12 points from their four games in qualifying group E so far, marking an impressive turnaround since the summer's embarrassing World Cup group stage exit which came without a win from games against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica. But Hodgson is not getting carried away with the momentum his side appear to be building up ahead of next summer's tournament in France that they look dead-certs to qualify for. 'You’re always pleased when you’re winning but I think we’re also trying to keep our feet on the ground,' he said. 'We've been benefiting from a group which isn't the toughest of the groups. There’s lots of very, very difficult games ahead and we realise also that everything we're doing at the moment is going to be truly judged in 2016.'","Roy Hodgson thinks England will lose more players to injury soon .

"The best of British come face-to-face on Saturday afternoon when Charlie Austin's QPR take on Harry Kane's Tottenham at Loftus Road. And Austin, who has scored the most goals of any English player in the Premier League this season, is keen to put his past behind him to be viewed as a footballer and not an ex-builder. The 25-year-old came up through the ranks in lower league football, before getting his break in the big time. To fund himself while playing for clubs like Kintbury Rangers and Hungerford Town, Austin was a builder by trade, but now the time has come for a change in mentality. Charlie Austin (right) thinks he has scored enough goals to be considered a footballer rather than a builder . Austin has come up through the ranks, starting in non-League and working his way to the top . 'I have scored 100-odd career goals now,' Austin told The Sun, 'and think I have done enough to be considered a player rather than a builder who plays football. I know where I have come from but I feel like I have done enough to be known as a footballer now. 'The only blisters I have on my hands these days are from the gym. Laying bricks was about five or six years ago now.' His journey to this point is the antithesis of Kane's, who has spent 11 years in the relative comfort of Tottenham Hotspur's academy. The now-QPR striker got his first League break at Swindon Town, for whom he scored over 30 goals . Austin takes on team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips during a training session at Queens Park Rangers . For Austin though, that route didn't work out. He was released by Reading as a teenager for being too small, and had to rely on opportunities elsewhere to get where he is today. 'Coming through the academies didn't work for me,' the QPR striker continues. 'I was released at 14. I wouldn't change it at all. Harry [Kane] would probably tell you the same about his upbringing. We just got taught differently. 'My way you pick up things as you go through the game. For players in academies... everything is in place for them at the clubs.' Regardless of their differences, Austin and Kane will face each other for the first time on Saturday afternoon.

"A Swedish football team has told of how they narrowly escaped death after a last-minute decision against booking their players on Germanwings Flight 4U9525. Four Lufthansa subsidiary flights left Barcelona around the same time this morning, Division 1 team Dalkurd FF, from Borlänge, central Sweden, had players on three of them. The team had initially planned to travel on Flight 4U9525 to Düsseldorf, but instead split the team over the three remaining flights from Barcelona, via Germany. Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: Swedish Division 1 team Dalkurd FF had initially planned to travel on Flight 4U9525 to Düsseldorf, but instead split the team over the three remaining flights from Barcelona this morning . When the Dalkurd FF delegation of 29 players and staff landed, they found out that the fourth flight had crashed, and the passengers next to them at check in a few hours earlier had died. All 144 passengers, including two babies and 16 teenagers from a German high school, and six crew members lost their lives when Germanwings Flight 4U9525 crashed this morning. The Airbus A320 ploughed into the mountainside in a remote region of the French Alps en route from Spain to Germany at more than 400mph. 'We were supposed to have been on that flight. We checked in with all of the passengers. It's surreal,' Dalkurd FF's sports chief Adil Kizil told Aftonbladet. 'When we got to the airport in Barcelona there were four  flights leaving that time, flying north over the alps. All 144 passengers, including two babies and 16 teenagers from a German high school, and six crew members lost their lives when Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed near Seyne les Alpes, French Alps . Video from the scene of the crash shows debris of the Germanwings Airbus A320 at the crash site in the French Alps above the southeastern town of Seyne . Destroyed: Crews in the first helicopter to reach the site said they had seen no survivors and reported finding chunks of plane the size of a car . 'Four flights and we had players on three of them. Let's just say we were very lucky.' Dalkurd FF, formed in 2004 by Kurdish immigrants, play in Sweden's Division 1, the third level in the league system of Swedish football. The team had been on a week-long training camp in Barcelona and were flying home this morning, and were supposed to have been on Flight 9525. Mr Kizil told the newspaper how they had tried to fit the entire team on the Germanwings flight, but that the connection time in Düsseldorf to continue their journey home to Sweden was too long. Instead they split the team onto the three other  flights, with one group flying via München and two others via Zürich. Mr Kizil said the players are still shocked, and that their thoughts are with the families of the victims. 'All the people on that plane were at the same check-in as us. We also flew with a subsidiary to Lufthansa, so everyone went to the same gates.' Others have today spoken of narrowly escaping death after missing Flight 4U 9525. The Airbus A320 ploughed into the mountainside in a remote region of the French Alps en route from Spain to Germany at more than 400mph . One woman, whose husband has been named by Spanish media as one of the 150 victims, was refused boarding as she was deemed 'too pregnant' to fly. News website La Voz de Galicia claims Marta Carceller had to stay behind in Barcelona while her husband Josep Sabat Casellas boarded the Germanwings flight, The Mirror reports. A man named Manuel Blasco also spoken of his lucky escape, as he was convinced by his wife not to change his flights last minute. Mr Blasco had intended to swap a Monday flight for the ill-fated Airbus A320 today after waking up with a cold. He told Spanish newspaper El Mundo: 'I woke up with a cold and a bit of a temperature. 'I was going to change the flight and fly today with the plane that crashed. 'My wife made me change my mind. I still asked at the Lufthansa desk when I got to Barcelona airport if I could change the flight but they said the plane that ended up crashing was very full and I'd have to pay a lot of money to reserve a seat. 'As I saw it was going to cost quite a lot, I ended up sticking to my original plan and going on Monday.'","Dalkurd FF from Sweden were supposed to have travelled on Flight 9525 .

"On reflection, it would be wrong to describe inter-squad relations back then as frosty. Cordial might be more appropriate. Yet the warmth was distinctly a few degrees south of what Steven Naismith is currently enjoying each time the Scotland squad gathers on the banks of Loch Lomond. The reasons for the dawning of an age of bonhomie are not too hard to fathom. In little over two years, Gordon Strachan has transformed the national team from a laughing stock into a source of genuine pride and hope. One that people naturally want to be part of. Awkward conversations between players who would much rather be elsewhere are conspicuous by their absence. A sense of togetherness - which can only truly be fostered by a string of positive results and performances - is palpable. The Scotland squad are in high spirits in the lead-up to their clash with Northern Ireland on Wednesday . Naismith says: 'From when I joined the national team to now, it’s a totally different dynamic' The old cliché about a club-like atmosphere surrounding Team Scotland – for so long just empty rhetoric – now has a solid basis in reality. ‘From when I joined the national team to now, it’s a totally different dynamic in that every single player is chatting away to anybody,’ said Naismith. ‘It’s just normal. We’re a bunch of guys who are at similar points in life – starting families, getting married but all driven. Seeing what we have here and what we can do is what’s driving everyone. It’s great that we’re all of similar mind-sets and it works. ‘(Previously) I wouldn’t say it was as tight as it is now. Everyone wasn’t as open as they are now. ‘I wouldn’t say there were cliques and people not talking to each other. But the Rangers boys and the Celtic boys did tend to stay together. It’s just who you are familiar with. ‘Now everybody is just a bit more open. So many more of us get on and will be texting each other outwith football. It just brings people closer.’ For much of Naismith’s Scotland career, a call-up to the national side brought mixed emotions for many. Gordon Strachan's reign has brought back a sense of pride to the Scotland shirt . At times, the pride of being selected to pull on a dark blue jersey was diminished by a realisation that the team was going nowhere fast. Frequent numerous call-offs just became the way of things. Many of those who did assemble for duty wore the look of men who wish they hadn’t bothered. Not now. Naismith says there are no cliques in the side . ‘Most folk will hang about in the communal areas and chill and enjoy banter,’ he added. ‘In the past, people maybe went to their own room or someone else’s room in twos or threes. ‘Now you could walk through the hotel and see eight or nine guys mixing – and it’s always a different mix. ‘The manager has not directly encouraged it but the way he operates being so open and honest rubs off on the way we behave and work together.’ It says much that only Ross McCormack has withdrawn from Strachan’s original party to face Northern Ireland on Wednesday  and Gibraltar on Sunday. Hardly fixtures that necessitate a dose of tranquillisers to calm the pulse of the Tartan Army, but tellingly viewed by the entire squad as matters of the utmost importance. ‘It’s a very good game as we’ve both started our campaigns very well,’ Naismith said of Wednesday's Hampden friendly. ‘It’s a game with a little more to it, like Ireland and England, because they are close to home and the players are all familiar with each other. It’ll be a very good test. It’s an opportunity to try a few things and refresh the minds of what we’ve been doing because we’ve not been together for a period or four or five months.’ For Naismith, this match is also a case of Friends Reunited. Both Steven Davis and Kyle Lafferty shared a dressing room with him at Rangers for four years with three Scottish titles gleaned in that period. Norwich striker Lafferty didn’t have his troubles to seek at Ibrox initially but his latter contributions – together with his current displays for club and country – have long since convinced Naismith of his value to any side. Naismith will be reunited with friends Kyle Lafferty, who who played with during a successful run at Rangers . He will also compete with Steven Davis, another former Rangers star now on the Southampton books . ‘Ever since he was at Rangers he was been a big player for Northern Ireland,’ he said. ‘He has scored a few goals for them and he has been their main striker since David Healy. He has always been a threat and has matured more as he has grown older. ‘He probably lacked a bit of maturity back then, definitely. Around the changing room he was a great laugh and when times were tough he was always there to keep the boys up, even if he was the brunt of the jokes. When he was younger, he probably didn’t know when to stop. He has matured more now and speaking to the boys at Norwich they say he is different now to how he was back then. ‘The way he finished seasons (at Rangers) was remarkable. At specific times in a season you need players who are going to drag you through games and Laff would always pop up at the end of a season.’ What Everton would currently give for such a lucky charm. Currently sitting 13th in the Premiership, last season’s remarkable run to fifth under Roberto Martinez seems distant, while their Europa League aspirations were ripped to shreds by Dynamo Kiev. Everton's Naismith and Chicago-based Shaun Maloney, formerly of Rangers and Celtic respectively, share a laugh as they warm up with the Scotland squad on Tuesday . Typifying how many fans now have the collective memories of goldfish, graffiti denigrating the Spaniard has been seen around Goodison Park. ‘I’ve seen that,’ Naismith admitted. ‘To be honest, it’s very unlike Everton fans. I think it’s a very small minority. They are normally great. ‘At times this season it’s been so frustrating for them after the success of last season. The way we played then was great and everything was going for us. ‘It’s not nice to see but we definitely believe in what we are doing. It worked last season.’ The irony of Scotland now providing a lift for ailing club players is lost on no one. If defeat to England last time out was a natural disappointment, there was no shortage of understanding given the toil in putting Ireland to the sword four days previously. ‘The last trip was quite tricky,’ Naismith recalled. ‘There was so much build up on the Ireland game, the main event, and to get such a good result took such a lot out of the boys. ‘In hindsight, everyone was desperate to play against England … the manager was speaking to a few players to see if they would sit it out, but everyone was dying to play and that probably went against us. ‘England caught us off guard, were on the front foot and pressed us well and took their chances. It was difficult for us to take but we are a much more solid unit now with so much confidence for places. ‘Even Matt Ritchie has come in, who is such a great talent. He’s exactly the type of player who will add something to the squad.’","Scotland face Northern Ireland on Wednesday and Gibraltar on Sunday .
