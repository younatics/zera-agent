"Solitary: Steve Fuller has worked as the winter caretaker of Yellowstone National Park since 1973 . Steve Fuller has lived in New York, San Francisco and London, but the place he decided to settle down is about the opposite of any booming metropolis. For the past 42 years, Fuller has worked as the caretaker of Yellowstone National Park, protecting the park's buildings during the long and brutal winter months. He lives in a small cabin alone during the winter, with enough food stored up since his closest neighbors are a two-hour snowmobile ride away. It sounds like the premise of Stephen King's thriller The Shining, but Fuller claims he's never felt lonely or the least bit antsy cooped up alone in his cabin. 'Never had cabin fever. Never been bored,' the 70-something outdoorsman told CBS. That's because there's plenty of work to keep Fuller busy. Winter preparation starts in November, when he works with a crew to board up his share of the parks about 100 buildings. Then, once everyone is gone, he waits for the snow to come - and it never disappoints. Yellowstone averages about 150 inches of snowfall a year and Fuller has to stop it from accumulating on the roofs of the park's buildings, which can collapse under the weight of the snow. Over the years, Fuller has developed a system which takes some of the hassle out of shoveling the roofs. Instead, he uses a saw to cut the snow into blocks which he then pushes off the roof with the help of gravity. Fuller has been doing the job since 1973, when he was the only applicant and the pay was just $13.24 a day. Over the years, Fuller's responsibilities have grown and now he is one of the only Yellowstone staffers who work at the park year round. Scroll down for video . Content: In the winter, Fuller stays behind to take care of his section of the park. But he says he never gets lonely . Tough work: During the day, Fuller works to keep about 100 buildings free from snow, since they can collapse under the several feet that accumulate every year. He has developed a method of sawing the snow into blocks and pushing them off the roof, which makes the job a little easier . The cold months: The winter care-taking job starts at the beginning of November and ends whenever plows can reach the park. Above a group of bison seen in a snow-covered Yellowstone field . Winter home: This small 100-year-old cabin is where Fuller calls home. he packs it with just enough food to last the winter . While most caretakers only last a few years in the job, Fuller continues because he's comfortable with the solitude and has the right interests to make the job fun. Amazingly, Fuller has no TV in his small cabin, which he estimates is about 100 years old. Instead, he gets his news by tuning into Wyoming Public Radio and entertains himself with his vast library of books. He also spends a lot of time outside cross-country skiing and taking pictures of the winter landscape. Many of his pictures of the frozen-over park have been featured in National Geographic. 'I've seen many wonderful things here,' he said. 'Occasionally get a picture of them. But a lot of the great pictures are in my head, you know, that you couldn't quite pull it off with a camera.' In 1978, he illustrated his own story for the magazine about raising his two daughters at the park. Avid reader: Fuller has no TV. Instead, he reads for entertainment and has a vast library . Technology: Fuller is able to connect to the outside world with a computer. He gets his news from listening to the radio . Far from civilization: Fuller's closest neighbors are about a two-hour snowmobile ride away . During the winter, he and ex-wife Angela home-schooled the two girls, which they were suited to with his bachelor's degree in history and her master's in education. His daughters are grown now and Fuller has since broken up with his wife, but they made plenty of memories during their winters together in Yellowstone. In 1973, a female grizzly bear broke a window into their kitchen while Angela was cooking a pot of stew for dinner. The sow reached in and grabbed the pot and luckily took off with the meal instead of sticking around. 'The next morning I found the pot behind the house, licked shiny clean,' Fuller said in his National Geographic piece. Beautiful scenery: Fuller is also a gifted photographer, and many of his pictures of the snowy Yellowstone landscape have been featured in National Geographic . All to himself: Above, Fuller is seen walking near the park's legendary geysers, which three million people flock to see every year . He had iron bars installed on the windows to protect from any future run-ins with the local wildlife. Fuller says there's no set schedule in place for when the care-taking season ends. It's over when the plows can reach him. 'This job has never been by the calendar or by the clock,' Fuller said. 'You work with the winter. You work with Mother Nature.' In the warmer months, Fuller gets some much-needed sun and travels to Africa where he spends every April on safari. Before be became caretaker at Yellowstone, Fuller spent three years living in Uganda and Kenya teaching and it was during that time that he first became interested in the quieter life. 'It changed my life,' he said of his time in the African bush, 'and that's what brought me here.' With his older age, Fuller says he's considered retirement, but doesn't seem to have taken the prospect too seriously. 'I think of it. They say a lot of people die when they retire, you know?' he said. However, he does think his way of life may be coming to an end, as transportation in and out the park during the winter months gets easier.","Since 1973, Steve Fuller has worked as the winter caretaker of Yellowstone .

"A 35-year-old graphic designer has taken a different approach in his search for love. The self-employed man, who would only like to be known as Dan, has distributed 'Girlfriend Wanted' posters around Melbourne. Dan - who describes himself as 'fit, sporty and educated' - is seeking an attractive woman aged between 23 to 35 who is 'genuine, caring and happy'. But he looking for a serious relationship - 'no game players or time wasters'. A 35-year-old graphic designer, who would only like to be known as Dan, has distributed 'Girlfriend Wanted' posters around Melbourne . Dan told Daily Mail Australia he's been single for three months and decided to distribute his posters as other methods didn't work out. 'I had heard of other stories of people doing similar things so I thought ""why not"",' he said. 'I was not meeting anyone at bars and clubs. I had tried online and speed dating with mixed results and now I'm bored of it. It's also hard to meet people in general. Everyone is so busy with their face stuck to their phone. So I felt like I had to do something different. 'Basically I like to take chances and just give things a go. Hoping there's a girl out there who has a similar outlook on life and also thinks ""why not"".' So far Dan has received 60 emails from interested women from his poster but not one who ticks all the boxes. 'Some write just out of curiosity. Others are not what I'm asking for or are girls from interstate or overseas. Some write on behalf of friends. Some flake when it comes to meeting up,' he said. 'Girls appear to be wary of the poster. It's understandable but I also think of it as a bit of test. Is she willing to take a chance like me? Those that do, stand out to me and am thankful for it.' And this is a method Dan has tried before. 'Did it late last year. I met one girl and we dated twice but she only wanted to be friends after that. So I decided to try a second time this year with the poster,' he said. Although he admits he wants to 'settle down', Dan is still undecided about marriage and kids. 'I'm wanting a relationship so one step at a time,' he said.","Dan is a single Aussie male seeking a girlfriend who is 'fun, fit and active'

"This is the dramatic moment four fearless Indian bison managed to avoid certain death by chasing a giant tiger away from their herd. Praveen Siddannavar, 47, captured the stunning shots as the Indian bison, also known as gaurs, teamed up to frighten away their would-be killer at the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in the Karnataka State of India. The photographer, from Bangalore, says he looked on with amazement as the animals clashed near a water puddle - with the gaurs standing their ground before the tiger made a run for it. The chase: The group of Indian bison teamed up to frighten away their would-be killer at the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in India . On the prowl: The tiger was walking in the open, heading straight towards a water pipe where the group of bison were having a drink . On high alert: One of the gaurs picked up on the scent of the approaching tiger and made all the others aware of its presence . Speaking of the incident, Mr Siddannavar said: 'I was enjoying a late afternoon drive and after scanning the forest and I drove to the sunset point on the backwaters of river Kabini that had gone completely dry due to poor monsoons'. 'I was fortunate to spot a huge tiger resting underneath the shade of dried bamboo bushes,' he added. 'After a while the tiger started walking in the open and loud alarm calls were given by spotted deer and also the Sambar deer. The tiger ignored these calls and headed straight towards the culvert [water pipe] to cool himself in a puddle,' he went on to say. Mr Siddannavar said that a herd of gaurs were heading the same way to quench their thirst - a sight that 'really excited' him as he knew he was going to see some action. One of the gaurs then picked up on the scent of the tiger and they were all alerted. 'The gaurs seemed uncomfortable upon seeing the tiger and decided to launch an offensive attack,' the photographer said. Not going easy: The gaurs were uncomfortable at the presence of the massive tiger and decided to launch an offensive attack . Running scared: As soon as the four Indian bison charged at their would-be killer, the tiger decided he wasn't going to hang around . Filled with fear: The four bison chased the tiger, who seemed more interested in saving his own life than making a kill . Mr Siddannavar said the the entire herd of gaurs  stormed towards the tiger, after first snorting aggressively. As soon as the animals charged, the photographer said, their would-be killer decided to run away.' The photographer admitted he was stunned to see the tiger backing away from its prey and said the gaurs proved to be a formidable force. 'What an unbelievable sight this was - I have never seen such action-packed drama before,' Mr Siddannavar said. 'Tigers are apex predators - meaning they are at the top of the food chain in the forest ecosystem,' he added. Great defence: Praveen Siddannavar said the the entire herd of gaurs stormed towards the tiger, after first snorting aggressively . Safe: After being chased away from the scene, the tiger went back to sheltering under the safety of dry bamboo trees . All in a day's work: After seeing off the tiger, the gaurs wandered off into the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, in India's Karnataka State . Mr Siddannavar said gaurs are not normally scared of other animals, but taking on a tiger showed particular unity, strength and bravery. 'Tigers hunt gaurs regularly but it was amazing to see them working together - their strength lies in numbers and unity plays a key role in fending a tiger away,' he said. 'It really surprised me to see the tiger running away as tigers rarely back off as they are the kings of the jungles,' he added. 'But because it was a group of four gaurs and they attacked from all ends, the tiger had no option but to run away to save his life.' Photographer: Praveen Siddannavar, 47, says he looked on with amazement as the animals clashed near a water puddle - with the gaurs standing their ground before the tiger made a run for it .","Four Indian bison were relaxing near a puddle of water in India's Karnataka State when a large tiger approached .

"The man who invented the coffee pods used by millions of Americans in their Keurig instant brewing machines has admitted he regrets ever coming up with the design. In an interview with The Atlantic, John Sylvan, who came up with the idea for the coffee pods and the machine in the early 1990s, revealed that he 'feels bad' about the negative impact that the pods are having on the environment. Sylvan, who no longer uses the plastic pods himself, also confessed he wishes he had never created them in the first place. 'I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,' said Mr Sylvan, who sold his share of the company in 1997 for $50,000. Scroll down for video . Regrets: John Sylvan (pictured) says that he often wishes he had never invented the Keurig coffee pods . Keurig is currently thought to be one of the most popular at-home brewing systems in America. Last year the company sold 9.8 billion Keurig-brewed portion packs and earned $4.7billion. The design is simple - a small plastic capsule containing ground beans that can be put into a machine to produce a cup of coffee at the touch of a button. However despite the multi-billion pound success of the company nothing has been done to try and make the packaging of the popular Keurig pods recyclable. And Mr Sylvan insists this will never happen. 'No matter what they say about recycling, those things will never be recyclable,' he said. 'The plastic is a specialized plastic made of four different layers.' Mr Sylvan, who co-founded the company with Peter Dragone, added that the unique plastic used in the K-Cups - known as plastic #7 - is only recyclable in a small number of cities in Canada, and cannot as yet be processed yet in the United States. Unfortunately the plastic is also integral to the unique design of the pods. It ensures that the coffee inside stays completely protected from any outside elements and remains completely intact while the coffee is being brewed. The popularity of the simplistic coffee pods has also come across the shores to the UK. Adverts for K-Cup featuring the slogan 'Brew the Love', enticed American audiences. And in England thousands of customers have been lured into buying Nespresso machines following similar adverts featuring George Clooney. Nespresso is now the most prominent capsule company in the UK. The machines do not take the Keurig capsules but take similar plastic ones and Nespresso has established its own sustainability advisory board. Mr Sylvan  also confessed that despite his earlier dedication to the brand, he no longer drinks coffee made using the capsules. In 1995 he had to go to hospital with heart palpitations after testing up to 40 cups of his coffee a day. He now no longer even owns a K-Cup machine and only drinks filter coffee. George Clooney has helped popularise the Nespresso brand in the UK, a similar version of the K-Cups . Damaging: Keurig has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of K-Cups sold in 2014 alone would circle the earth 12 times if they were laid down end-to-end . Keurig has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of K-Cups sold in 2014 alone, and subsequently put into landfills, would circle the earth a staggering 12 times if they were laid down end-to-end. They have started a Kill The K-Cup campaign, which features a YouTube video showing the world being destroyed by the plastic coffee capsules. But despite the continued criticism, Keurig Green Mountain, the brewing system's parent company, has yet to come up with a viable solution to the problem, despite insisting that they have been trying to find an environmentally-friendly alternative since 2006. 'It's a warranted criticism,' Monique Oxender, chief sustainability officer for Keurig Green Mountain, told The Salt earlier this year. 'We're not proud of where we are right now, and we're committed to fixing it.' Alternative option: Mr Sylvan insists that he has managed to create a new design for the K-Cups which would be far more environmentally-friendly than the ones currently being used . Not according to Mr Sylvan. The entrepreneur insists that he has come up with an alternative design to his original creation which would involve relying on the same kinds of materials used for foil ketchup packets. But while Mr Sylvan is convinced that he holds the answer to Keurig's ongoing environmental concerns, he added that the company have thus far refused to trial his new design. 'I told them how to improve it, but they don't want to listen,' he added to The Atlantic. 'There's a much better way of doing it.' Ironically, Mr Sylvan's current work, running energy efficient solar energy company ZonBak, requires him to be much more mindful of the environment, which is perhaps why he is suffering from such feelings of guilt over his most infamous creation.","John Sylvan created the Keurig instant coffee system in the early 1990s .

"A swimwear model has told how a DIY lip job ended in disaster when she tried to emulate the super pout of reality star Kylie Jenner. The youngest reality star sister has sparked a huge craze for lip fillers, despite insisting that her full lips are natural. But unable to afford £200 injectable chemical fillers, part-time swimwear model and retail worker Gail Scott, from Salisbury in Wiltshire, was intrigued when she heard about a DIY version. Gail Scott was desperate to emulate Kylie Jenner's famous pout but didn't want to spend any money so sucked on a hairspray lid and was left with painful bruising above and below her lips . Gail had heard about a tool available online, which promises an enhanced look without injections. Buyers suck into a lip shaped vessel to increase blood supply to the lips, temporarily giving an artificial plumped look. Instead of spending £30 on the product, she used the lid of a mini hairspray bottle instead. After placing it over her lips, she sucked for five minutes until her lips started to tingle. Initially she was delighted when she removed the lid to see her lips looked fuller. But minutes later she was left with painful  bruising around her mouth that has left her unable to model since and now she wants to issue a warning against the craze currently sweeping social media. Unable to afford £200 for injectable chemical fillers, part-time swimwear model and retail worker Gail was intrigued when she heard about a DIY version . Gail had heard about a tool available online whereby buyers suck into a lip shaped vessel to increase blood supply to the lips temporarily giving an artificial plumped look, but she decided to try her own method . She said: ‘I look like I’ve been punched in the mouth. Apart from the pain, the dark bruising above my mouth looks like a moustache. 'I feel ridiculous and I haven’t wanted to leave the house since. I thought I was saving money but it’s cost me a fortune in make-up trying to cover it up. 'My lips looked great after - but only for about three minutes until the bruising started and then my lips went down anyway. 'I want other women to know the dangers, it’s not worth it. I was lucky not to burst a blood vessel because since I posted my warning I’ve heard that can happen.’ Kylie Jenner has sparked a huge craze for lip fillers, despite insisting that her full lips are natural . Gail says she feels ridiculous and hasn't wanted to leave the house since the incident, even having to forego modelling until her bruising heals . Gail had been saving for lip fillers ever since Kylie Jenner’s pout sparked a huge craze for lip enhancements. Gail explains: ‘I know a lot of girls who have had it done because they like the way her lips look. It’s never been so popular.’ So keen to keep up with her peers, Gail planned to have the procedure, too. She explains: ‘It wasn’t that I was unhappy with my lips, I’ve never had an issue with them, but I liked the way enhanced lips look, especially around the cupids bow.' But at £200 a time she was struggling to save the cash. She said: ‘I wanted it done earlier this year but I’ve been saving for a holiday and then my laptop broke so when heard about a cheaper way I decided to try it.’ Gail is warning other women who may have heard about DIY lip jobs to steer well clear after her botched attempt that left her in serious pain . However, her thrifty attempt has left her worse off than she was before and she's turned to make-up to try and cover the bruising and says she won’t be able to model again until it’s healed completely. 'I thought I’d saved money but it’s probably cost me that in foundation trying to cover it,’ she added. Gail posted a warning on her own Facebook page at the weekend and says she has since been thanked by other women who were planning to perform DIY lip jobs. She said: ‘I have been lucky. I’ve since heard of other women who have actually burst blood vessels doing this. It’s just not worth it.’","Gail Scott was intrigued when she heard about a DIY lip job .

"An 88-year-old Missouri man has pleaded guilty in the stabbing death of his ailing 86-year-old wife last year. Donald Rowland pleaded guilty in Boone County Circuit Court Monday to first-degree involuntary manslaughter. His sentencing has been scheduled for April 13. Rowland was originally charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action in the death of his wife, Betty Rowland, but prosecutors reduced those charges last month. Authorities have said an adult daughter called police after going to the couple's home in Columbia in October 2014 and finding her parents together in bed, both with stab wounds. Tragic couple: Donald Rowland (left), 88, has pleaded guilty to first-degree involuntary manslaughter in the October 2014 stabbing death of his wife of 64 years, Betty Rowland (right) Police say Rowland told officers he killed his wife and tried to take his own life, because he didn't want them to be a burden on their family. A neighbor told the Columbia Daily Tribune that Betty Rowland had recently had a stroke. Appearing in court Monday in a striped jail garb and accompanied by his attorney, Rowland only answered 'yes' and 'no' in response to Judge Kevin Crane's questions. Prosecutor Merilee Crockett recommended seven years in prison for the octogenarian defendant. At around 12.20pm on October 31, 2014, Betty and Donald Rowland's grown daughter stopped by her parents' condominium in the 3400 block of Woodrail Terrace to check up on them and discovered the couple wounded in bed. Horrific discovery: Betty and Donald Rowland's grown daughter stopped by her parents' condominium in the 3400 block of Woodrail Terrace to check up on them and discovered the couple wounded in bed . Mrs Rowland suffered two fatal stab wounds to the chest and was pronounced dead at the scene. Her husband of 64 years was taken to University Hospital with self-inflicted injuries, according to a probable cause affidavit. Betty Montgomery married Donald Rowland, her college sweetheart, in 1950, and the two went on to have four children, 13 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Mrs Rowland, a music teacher by trade, followed her husband, a career military officer in the US Air Force, when he was posted to Yokota Air Base in Japan, where she taught piano to military personnel. When she was not giving music lessons and singing in a choir, the mother of four acted as a Brownie and Girl Scout leader, a PTA officer and was involved in charity work.","Donald Rowland, pleaded guilty to first-degree involuntary manslaughter in wife Betty's October 2014 death .

"More than a dozen homes were raided on Tuesday in a crackdown on so-called 'maternity tourism' operators who arrange for pregnant Chinese women to give birth in the U.S., where their babies automatically become American citizens. The crackdown on three alleged maternity tourism rings may be the biggest yet by federal homeland security agents who say that, while pregnant women may travel to the U.S., they cannot lie about the purpose of their trip when applying for a visa. Birth tourism has been reported from a range of countries, but authorities say the most recent cases in California have catered to wealthy Chinese amid a boom in tourism from mainland China. It is unclear how many women travel to the United States for maternity tourism. Scroll down for video . Federal agents serve warrants and question several residents at the Pheasant Ridge Apartment complex in Rowland Heights, California, while investigating alleged 'birth tourism' centers on Tuesday . A woman appears shocked as she takes to a federal agent on Tuesday in what was described as one of the biggest ever raids on 'maternity tourism' in the U.S. A federal agent looks through a disposable diaper box while executing search warrants during the ongoing investigation into alleged birth tourism centers . Shortly after sunrise on Tuesday, federal agents swarmed an upscale apartment complex in the Orange County city of Irvine where authorities say a birth tourism business charged pregnant women $50,000 for lodging, food and transportation. According to the LA Times, during the raid pregnant women were seen opening doors to apartments, looking confused and then slamming them shut. One agent announced 'baby here' and then called over a colleague to go inside. Crying babies could be heard from several apartments, according to the LA Times. Investigators said women were coached to lie about their travel plans when applying for tourist visas and were promised they would receive Social Security numbers and U.S. passports for their babies before returning to China. In one instance, a trainer in China helped fabricate employment and income information for an undercover federal agent posing as a pregnant client to secure a tourist visa and encouraged her to fly through Hawaii, where customs officers were believed to be more lenient than in Los Angeles, according to a copy of an affidavit in support of a search warrant. The business netted its owners hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past two years and helped Chinese tourists deliver more than 400 American babies at Orange County hospitals, the court papers said. No arrests were made or charges filed. Investigators conducted the searches in Orange, Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, hoping to collect evidence of crimes tied to three separate maternity tourism operations, including visa and tax fraud, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said.

Federal agents enter an upscale apartment complex on Tuesday in Irvine, California. Shortly after sunrise, federal agents swarmed the complex in Orange County where authorities say a birth tourism business charged pregnant women $50,000 for lodging, food and transportation . A website that advertises the services of a U.S. company catering to women from China who want to give birth in the U.S. Federal agents undertook a massive raid at a complex in Irvine, California on Tuesday . The key draw for travelers is that the United States offers birthright citizenship. Maternity tourists believe citizenship will help their children secure a top-notch U.S. college education and provide a sort of insurance policy should economic conditions crumble in their home country — especially since the tourists themselves can apply for a green card once their American child turns 21. Bill Ong Hing, professor of the University of San Francisco School of Law, said wealthy foreigners from across the world often travel to the United States for medical care and are allowed to do so on visitor visas, provided they don't overstay. U.S. Customs and Border Protection warns on its website that officers at airports and on the border will consider a pregnant woman's due date, travel plans and medical insurance to determine whether she can enter the country. In the Irvine case, investigators said another undercover officer posing as a pregnant traveler was told not to apply for her visa too late as she would be denied if she were noticeably pregnant. A pregnant woman who was questioned at the airport said she was told to say she was simply a tourist, court papers said. Investigators also tracked the movements of a couple who arrived in February 2014, had their baby in April and returned in May. While the couple's bank account recorded charges at luxury stores including Louis Vuitton and Rolex, they paid $4,080 — less than 15 per cent of the billed amount — to the hospital for medical services after stating the mother was not employed, the affidavit said. Federal agents started investigating the business after an anonymous tip last year. In 2013, Los Angeles County cited more than a dozen maternity hotels for code violations after an uproar in a nearby suburban community about a hotel operating in a residential neighborhood. Jon Feere, legal policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, said he believes birth tourism will grow along with international travel. 'There is a sense the foreigner has control over our immigration policy rather than the American people,' said Feere, who wants stricter limits on immigration. The business netted its owners hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past two years and helped Chinese tourists deliver more than 400 American babies at Orange County hospitals, according to court papers .","Authorities say the most recent cases in California have catered to wealthy Chinese amid a boom in birth tourism from mainland China .

"Damaging splits have opened in the upper ranks of the Tory party over David Cameron’s plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration. The Prime Minister and Home Secretary Theresa May have become increasingly isolated in their determination to fix a new measure for bringing net migration under control. Mr Cameron is considering including two different targets in next month’s manifesto – including a specific target to slash net migration from outside the EU, which, unlike EU migration, ministers can fully control. Tory rift: Splits have opened in the upper ranks of the Tories over David Cameron’s plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration - with the Prime Minister and Theresa May becoming increasingly isolated . He is also expected to re-state his commitment to sharply reducing overall net migration. But senior figures, including Chancellor George Osborne, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles are understood to have voiced doubts about the idea. It follows the failure of Mr Cameron’s 2010 pledge to reduce overall net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. Last week, the figure hit 300,000 – fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the EU of 190,000. Left-wing Tories outside of the Cabinet, who are in favour of a more relaxed borders policy, have seized on the figures as their moment to strike. They believe that, in the wake of this shuddering failure, it is easier to make the case for scrapping the target altogether. Yesterday, ex-Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke said: ‘We will have to drop the target. It would not be possible to achieve it without damaging our economy quite severely. I’m afraid that the net migration target has proved to be a mistake.’ George Osborne is said to be among thoseto to have voiced doubts about the Prime Minister's idea . Baroness Warsi, a former Foreign Office minister, added: ‘If you set yourself unrealistic targets, you are setting yourself up to fail and, in the long term, turn the whole thing into a bigger issue by fuelling the perception that the Government can’t get a grip.’ But Mrs May is understood to believe that giving up on the target would be a huge error, not least because immigration still ranks in the top two concerns of voters. She recently resigned from the advisory board of a prominent Conservative think tank, called Bright Blue, which has publicly criticised the idea of a migration target. In a report, the right-of-centre organisation declared: ‘Putting an unreliable cap on net migration centre-stage has meant that other measures of competency have been missed and unnoticed.’ Its findings were given positive coverage in both the left-wing Guardian and Independent newspapers. One senior Government source, who supports the migration target, said: ‘This is the coming fight in the party – liberal metropolitans versus people who have lived in the real world.’ Illegal migrants run on October 29, 2014 behind a truck to try to board it in Calais last October . Over the past five years, Mrs May has introduced a series of policies to bring migration from outside the EU under control. These included a crackdown on bogus students and sham marriages. However, plans to go further – including the introduction of bonds for visitors – were blocked by the Treasury and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Yesterday, immigration minister James Brokenshire, an ally of Mrs May, dropped strong hints a target would feature in the manifesto so that ‘people can measure’ progress made in cutting immigration. He said: ‘We do believe very strongly that net migration matters. Long-term figures will show you that net migration to this country over the long term has been in that below the 100,000 figure. So, we’re looking very carefully and we will be coming back so people can measure us on what success looks like in terms of our migration policy.’ He added: ‘The Prime Minister has said that we will come back and set out what you can measure us on – because that’s the key thing – on how we perform, on controlling our immigration system.’ The number of migrants in Calais has dropped by two thirds in recent weeks – suggesting many have managed to dodge border controls and reach Britain. The latest figures reveal that some 2,500 African, Asian and Eastern Europeans were in the French port town over the Christmas period but that number has now fallen to around 1,000.

Last night it emerged that on one day in January alone a fire in the town caused chaos and allowed 300 migrants to sneak through the Channel Tunnel. A winter storm also caused major problems for border officials when a large section of fencing was blown down near the truck parking area. Hundreds more have succeeded in stowing away on trucks and vehicles from French ports such as Caen and Cherbourg where border controls are less stringent. In recent weeks Albanian people smugglers have moved their profitable operations down the coast from Calais and managed to load a number of migrants on to lorries at motorway rest areas. A recent head count in Calais revealed that only around 1,000 Africans, Asians and Eastern Europeans are now sleeping rough and in squats and at three open air camps in Calais. Shortly after Christmas when a similar survey was carried out the number was put at some 2,500. The French newspaper Nord Littoral reported over the weekend: ‘It is difficult to estimate the number of migrants present in Calais but one thing is certain – it has decreased significantly.’","PM is expected to re-state commitment to sharply reduce net migration .

"Annaleisa Gordon was found to have used a police computer to search for information about her ex-husband, Christopher McNair, and has been sacked . An anti-terror policewoman who used Scotland Yard computers to look for information on her ex-husband has been sacked. PC Annaleisa Gordon conducted the unauthorised searches on Christopher McNair while working for the Met's counter-terrorism squad in 2010 and 2011. A court later heard she feared he was dead or missing and was frantically trying to find him. Gordon was found guilty of a data protection offence in 2013 and has now been sacked from the Metropolitan Police. The 50-year-old was appointed counter-terror intelligence officer to the borough of Greenwich, south-east London in 2007 after joining the police in 1988. A Scotland Yard spokesman said today: 'Police Constable Annaleisa Gordon, an officer attached to Specialist Operations, was dismissed without notice on Monday from the Metropolitan Police Service following a misconduct hearing.' The force said that Gordon had 'breached standards of professional behaviour' in relation to 'discreditable conduct and confidentiality'. The spokesman added: 'The panel agreed these circumstances amount to gross misconduct. She was subsequently dismissed.' During her trial, the court heard Gordon feared her ex was missing or even dead and that's why she accessed records, dating back to 2004. She was convicted of one count of obtaining personal data which breached the Data Protection Act. Sentencing her after her two-day trial at Southwark Crown Court, Recorder Aidan Christie said he accepted her actions were 'entirely out of character'. He said she not acted out of 'malice or with sinister motives', but due to fears Mr McNair was missing. Gordon was fined £350 for the data protection offence. She was cleared of a further two charges in relation to searches for information on two roads, one being her mother's and the other her own address, between 2009 and 2011. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police today confirmed her actions amounted to gross misconduct . The judge said: 'You have no convictions, no cautions, no police warnings and a clean disciplinary record. Your record of service is a credit to you. 'You have references from your former supervisor which speaks in glowing terms of your absolute integrity with sensitive information. 'You accept you should not have go about things in the way you did and should have reported the matter to the missing persons division. 'It was an error of judgment for which you have paid a very high price.'","Intelligence officer feared her ex-husband was dead or missing in 2010 .

"OJ Simpson, who is currently incarcerated in the Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, cannot walk without a cane and fears he will be in a wheelchair when he finally leaves prison, the Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively. He is furious with prison officials because he says they refuse to allow him to leave the prison to get the surgery he can only get on the outside. let him get medical care outside. And now, OJ fears he will soon be in a wheelchair and may never walk again. OJ, 67, was recently seen struggling to walk around the prison with a cane and telling fellow inmates he was angry because he is not getting the specialized medical care he needs. Scroll down for video . Fallen idol: OJ Simpson says that without getting the special surgery he needs he will never be able to walk out of the prison on his own two feet. He is currently serving a nine-to-33-year sentence in state prison as a result of his 2008 conviction for armed robbery and kidnapping, but he could be out in two years . Painful: OJ's knee injuries are a result from his 11-year career as a running back in the NFL. He doesn't walk around the prison a lot like he used to but when he has to walk to get his meals in the commissary he walks with a new silver cane while grimacing in pain . On display: OJ's knee injuries had such an impact on his health, attorney Johnnie Cochran, used his disability in his trial for the murder of wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. to convince the jury that he was not physically capable of  the killings. At one point Cochran instructed OJ to stand and raise his suit pant leg to show the jury his multiple scars on his left knee to prove he was severely handicapped . OJ was found guilty in 2008 of criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, assault, robbery and using a deadly weapon and was sentenced to thirty-three years in prison with the possibility of parole after nine years, in 2017. 'I can only get mediocre health care in here,' OJ told a fellow inmate, 'and it really pisses me off because I have the money to go to any specialist in the world to get knee surgery but they won't let me leave to get help. 'They don't give a damn that I am going to end up crippled and can't walk for the rest of my life' A prison insider tells Daily Mail Online, OJ doesn't walk around the prison a lot like he used to but when he has to get his meals in the commissary he walks with a new silver cane, grimacing in pain. OJ stops frequently to lean up against the wall to rest if there is not a bench nearby to sit and complains the pain is getting worse every day. OJ is given pain medication but it only helps him sleep, it doesn't make the pain go away during the day. And OJ's girth doesn't help. Says the prison insider, 'OJ started gaining weight  because he was eating pork-n-beans, breads and a lot of sweets, like cookies and ice cream but now that he can't get any exercise he has ballooned up to almost 340 pounds. 'When there was nice weather OJ used to walk around the track on the prison yard for an hour at a time but now the pain in his knee is so severe he can barely walk ten steps without moaning in pain. OJ's weight is definitely a factor and putting more stress on his knees but he also has advanced arthritis.' OJ's knee injuries are a result from his 11-year career as a running back in the NFL and although he has gone through two surgeries on his left knee in the late 1970's he is still in extreme pain. These injuries had such an impact on his health OJ's attorney, Johnnie Cochran, Jr., used his disability in his murder trial 20 years ago to convince the jury his knee was so weak that he was not physically capable of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. At one point Johnnie instructed OJ to stand and raise his suit pant leg to show the jury his multiple scars on his left knee to prove he was severely handicapped. OJ may be getting released from prison in 2017 on parole and he's telling the other inmates it looks like he's going to be leaving there in a wheelchair. OJ Simpson, then with the  Buffalo Bills,  is carried off the field at the end of the half. This is not the first time that his pal Al Cowlings (at right, No. 82) helped take him away. He was along on the low-speed chase in the Bronco 'following the murders . OJ is not in jail for the murder of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson but for criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, assault, robbery and using a deadly weapon years later . 'I won't be out of here for at least another two years and if they won't let me get to a specialist soon I may never walk again!' OJ slammed his fists down on the table, revealed the insider. 'I have the money to pay for any surgery I need and the transportation so it won't be on the freakin' tax payers but they are still saying 'No.' 'Most of the time if a patient gets a recommendation from a doctor to have surgery but it is not life-threatening, the prison will deny that request,' the insider added. 'OJ said they just gave him a pill and told him to take it easy. 'Hehas talked to his attorneys about going to court so he can get some outside medical help but by the time the courts decide he may be already on parole. 'OJ is in bad shape and it's only going to get worse. The pain is excruciating and his knee is so deformed that he cant even straighten his left leg anymore. 'OJ is so worried about being seen in a wheelchair that he said he is not going to tell anyone, not even his family, when he's leaving Lovelock. 'OJ said when he gets parole he will leave in the middle of the night so he can disappear and there will not be any pictures of an old man a wheelchair on the cover of every newspaper across this country with the caption, 'The Juice - Old and Broken!'","OJ Simpson was recently seen struggling to walk with a silver cane at Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada .

"With millions of eligible men populating Tinder, how can you ensure that you get a right swipe? Ex-Coronation Street star Scott Wright is convinced he has the answer after conducting a unique experiment to show just what men should be wearing to find love. The actor, who played stripper Sam Kingston in the soap and was previously crowned Rear Of The Year, went on the world's most popular mobile dating app  with five very different looks. He wanted to see which profile would get the most 'matches' - where women indicate they are up for a date. Scroll down for video . Ex-Coronation Street star Scott Wright, who played Sam Kingston in the soap, conducted a unique experiment to show just what men should be wearing to find love on Tinder. He wore five different outfits and discovered that going topless garnered the most matches (it probably helps that he's a personal trainer) By far the most popular of 40-year-old Scott's looks was when he stripped off for a topless profile picture. Within minutes of his profile going live, Scott had 28 matches from attractive women all eager to engage with the star, who now combines acting with a successful career as a fitness guru. This profile was seven times more successful that Scott's least popular profile - where he was dressed smartly in a work jacket and shirt, which attained just four matches. Once he posted each profile, he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives to gauge the popularity of each look. The 'chav look' was the second most successful of the five. Right: Scott concluded that the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture, which, he says, perhaps explains why the 'normal bloke' look got 16 matches . Stylists created five different looks for Scott: smart, chav, hipster, normal bloke and muscle man. Once he posted each profile, he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives in Manchester to gauge the popularity of each look - and waited to see how many matches he achieved. The experiment was carried out over two weeks at Tinder's peak times between 6pm and 8pm - with Scott targeting different women so that the same women were not matching with him. Scott reckoned the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture. Scott's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches . That might explain why the 'chav' look, where Scott wore a zip-up top, tracksuit bottoms and trainers got 17 matches, and 'normal bloke' got 16 matches. Scott's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches. If Scott's experiment is anything to go by, dressing smartly virtually kills your chances of dating success with Scott's profile picture in a jacket and shirt getting just four matches. Scott made no mention of his previous TV fame because he just wanted to be judged on his pictures, though some Tinder users may have recognised him. The least successful of the lot was Scott's suited and booted look, which landed him just four matches . Speaking about his experiment, Scott said: 'Obviously because of my work in fitness I am in pretty good shape, so I guess it is no surprise that going topless is the best way to get matches on Tinder. 'I am thinking this strategy may not be be quite as successful if you have a beer belly and man boobs!. 'Seriously, what it shows is that online dating is a minefield and by making small tweaks to your profile pictures, you can significantly increase your chances of dating success.' A spokesperson for Theidleman.com, who provided the clothes for the experiment, added: 'What this shows is that men need to be comfortable in their own skin when they are dating online - and I think the same applies when they are dressing to look good. 'What most men want to do is pass the pub test: find clothes that look sufficiently good that their mates won't take the mickey out of them in down the pub. 'If they pass that test with their mates, they will also adopt the right look when dating online.'","The actor, who played stripper Sam Kingston, carried out experiment .

"Disgraced Rolf Harris, 84 (pictured with his CBE), has seen his honour annulled at the order of the Queen following his conviction for historic sex abuse . Rolf Harris has finally been stripped of the CBE that was awarded to him by the Queen. The move came eight months after the disgraced former children’s entertainer was jailed for nearly six years for a string of attacks on girls as young as seven. The paedophile, 84, had his honour annulled at the order of the Queen, days after being stripped of his Australian honours. Officials at the Cabinet Office had been accused of dragging their feet over the issue, but sources insisted they had to follow established procedures before removing the gong. An announcement in the London Gazette yesterday stated: ‘The Queen has directed that the appointment of Rolf Harris to be a Commander of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, dated 17 June 2006, shall be cancelled and annulled and that his name shall be erased from the Register of the said Order.’ Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who in January raised concerns in the Daily Mail about why Harris still had a CBE, welcomed the news. He said: ‘I am delighted to hear that Rolf Harris has been stripped of his CBE. It is simply unacceptable convicted sex offenders like Rolf Harris should be allowed to make a mockery of our honours system.’ When Harris, who was jailed in July last year for 12 indecent assaults against four girls between 1968 and 1986, was stripped of his Australian honours last week, there was widespread disbelief that he still held his coveted CBE in Britain. It was awarded to him for services to entertainment and the arts, a year after he painted the Queen’s 80th birthday portrait. Scroll down for video . Normal protocol sees honours forfeited where the person is considered to have brought the system into disrepute. A recommendation can be made by the Honours and Appointments Secretariat to the forfeiture committee to revoke an honour if a person has been found guilty of a criminal offence, and the final decision must be approved by the Queen. Harris was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later, and a CBE in 2006. During sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told him: 'Your reputation lies in ruins. You have been stripped of your honours and you have no one to blame but yourself.' Seven of the 12 counts related to the friend of Harris's daughter Bindi, including one incident when she was 15-years-old when he sexually assaulted her while Bindi slept in the adjacent bed. During his trial, Harris was revealed as a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character who had a dark side to his personality and used his fame to 'mesmerise' underage fans before abusing them with impunity. Scotland Yard said he 'committed many offences in plain sight of people as he thought his celebrity status placed him above the law.' The entertainer's conviction caused widespread revulsion in Australia and Britain, where his television programs were watched by millions of children. The decision by the Honours Forfeiture Committee, published in the London Gazette today (pictured), would have been approved by Prime Minister David Cameron and the Queen before being officially published . All public traces of the entertainer have since been removed from his home town of Bassendean in Western Australia following his convictions, while a plaque outside his childhood home has been demolished. His artworks have also been removed from the council chambers, and his status as a freeman of the city has been revoked. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who wrote an acclaimed book on the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, was among those who campaigned for the removal of the CBE. He has previously said: 'I find it difficult to understand why it has taken this committee so long. 'A number of paedophiles, of which Rolf Harris is one, have held significant honours, including Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith. They used their power and cloak of respectability to abuse children.' Last week, Mr Danczuk wrote to Cabinet Secretary Francis Maude asking him for an update on plans to strip Harris of his CBE. He added: 'They have come close to bringing the whole honours system into disrepute, and you would have their honours would have been removed more quickly. 'The Australians acted more quickly against Rolf Harris than we did.' Harris, whose fortune is estimated at £11 million was the second person to be convicted under a wide-ranging police investigation set up in the wake of revelations that the late Jimmy Savile, a fellow BBC star, was a prolific abuser. The former children's entertainer joins the likes of dictators Robert Mugabe and Nicolae Ceausescu and disgraced ex- banker Fred 'the Shred' Goodwin in being stripped of their titles. In January 2012, Mr Gooodwin had his knighthood revoked after he was accused of contributing to the financial crash through his mismanagement of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Honours are usually only removed from people convicted and jailed, but the Cabinet Office said the scale of the RBS disaster - which had to be bailed out to the tune of £45billion by the taxpayer - made the case 'exceptional'. Harris was awarded the CBE in 2006, a year after he painted the Queen's 80th birthday portrait (pictured) In 2008, Mr Mugabe was stripped of his honorary knighthood over his 'abuse of human rights' and 'abject disregard' for democracy, the Foreign Office said. The Queen approved the annulment of Mr Mugabe's knighthood, which was awarded in 1994, on the recommendation of former Foreign Secretary David Miliband. Mr Mugabe was the first foreigner to be stripped of an honorary knighthood since Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, the day before his execution by firing squad. In 1979, art historian Anthony Blunt, who was personal adviser to the Queen on art, lost his knighthood after being exposed as a Soviet spy. And in 2007, boxer 'Prince' Naseem Hamed was stripped of his MBE after serving a sentence for dangerous driving. Other recent cases involved a doctor who was struck off following the Bristol Royal Infirmary baby death scandal, a CBE holder who was disqualified from being a company director, and a man who forged the papers that secured him an MBE for 'services to the community'. The forfeiture of a knighthood is a rare event, and in past centuries it could involve a public ceremony of degradation during which the accoutrements of the honour would be stripped from the culprit. This would happen when a knight was found guilty of treachery or treason. In 1468, Sir Ralph Grey was taken to Doncaster where, being found guilty of treason, his 'gold spurs were hewn from his heels while his sword and all his armour were broken'. What is believed to be the last public degradation was in 1621 at Westminster Hall, when Sir Francis Mitchell was found guilty of 'grievous exactions' and had his spurs broken and thrown away, his belt cut and his sword broken over his head. Finally, he was pronounced to be 'no longer a Knight but Knave'. More recently, Sir Roger Casement had his knighthood cancelled during the First World War for treason. He was executed after trying to enlist Germany's help in the Irish independence movement. Count 1: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on girl aged 15 .

"Bobbi Kristina Brown's relatives have denied report that they are  part of a reality TV show which shows them coming to terms with the singer being in an induced coma in hospital. A source had previously told TMZ at least three relatives of the 21-year-old's father Bobby Brown have taken part in the unnamed show, part of which documents Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life. 'Yet again, TMZ has chosen to engage in false news reporting,' said Brown’s attorney Christopher Brown. Scroll down for video . New development: Relatives of Bobbi Kristina Brown (right) are taking part in a reality show while she battles for life in a coma, it has been reported. Left: Her parents Bobby Brown and the late Whitney Houston . Family: Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston's sister-in-law, Pat Houston, visiting Bobbi Kristina in hospital today. Bobby, the 21-year-old's father, is not part of the show, his lawyers told TMZ . Brown's attorney then added in a statement to RumorFix; 'There is no Brown family reality show that is in production which chronicles Bobby Brown, Bobbi Kristina or the medical emergency she presently faces at Emory Hospital. These reports are irresponsible and Warner Brothers as the owner of TMZ, should be ashamed to publish such nonsense, particularly one day before Bobbi Kristina’s birthday.' He ended by saying; 'Bobbi Kristina and Bobby Brown are dealing with enough right now. The fact that TMZ/Warner Brothers has decided to inject negativity into their lives at this critical time is plain insanity.' Whitney Houston's daughter remains in a serious condition after being found unconscious in a bathtub at her home on January 31. There are already reportedly tensions between her family members. Last month Bobby Brown's sister allegedly smacked her son in the head with a bottle during a hotel fight after the family gathered in Atlanta to be at Bobbi Kristina's  bedside. Pop legend: Whitney Houston died in 2012 . Tina Brown hit Shayne Brown in the head with a bottle at the bar of the W. Midtown Atlanta Hotel, according to an Atlanta Police report. Shayne Brown then drove himself to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for lacerations to the side of the head, while Tina Brown took off before police arrived, according to the report. The police report noted that the family had been at a birthday party for Bobby Brown - who had just turned 46 - when the mother and son started arguing over a valet parking ticket. There are also tensions between family members and her boyfriend Nick Gordon, who launched a Twitter rant against Bobby Brown last week. Gordon, who has reportedly been banned from visiting Bobbi Kristina, told Brown to 'grow up' - insisting she will hate him when she wakes up. The angry tirade came hours after attorneys from the Brown family told Gordon he will not be allowed at her bedside until he reveals exactly what happened the evening before Bobbi Kristina was found face down in a bathtub. Gordon also insisted he has taken care of his girlfriend '24/7' since her mother died in 2012. Last Monday, he first tweeted: 'Okay, so I'll probably get in trouble for this,' before uploading a screenshot of damning text messages he claimed to have sent Bobby Brown. The first, underneath a picture of the new Bobbi Kristina tattoo on his right arm, read: 'Man to man I love your daughter.' He added: 'I don't know why you won't let me see her. Grow up. Your daughter is going to hate you when she wakes up.' Not taking part: The 21-year-old's father Bobby Brown (pictured) is not part of the show, his lawyers told TMZ . Bobby Brown (pictured right earlier this month) said his daughter's boyfriend Nick Gordon (pictured left) has been lying about trying to visit her in the hospital . Motivation: The 22-year-old claims the Brown family only want the money from Whitney Houston's legacy . Hope: Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend is still optimistic that she will wake up from the medically-induced coma she has been in  for the last three weeks . Regrets: Referring to the night she was found face down in a bathtub, he told his followers he wishes he could have done more to save her. Police said they arrived and found him giving CPR . The messages were  deleted from his profile but he later wrote: 'Crazy how all the Browns came to the hospital when this went down. I've been with her 24/7 watching over her and mom. Bobby left when it got heavy. Gordon then claimed: 'Bobby seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs.' He added: 'Now him and his family want Whitneys $$$ which belongs to Krissi or Cissy.' Doctors were unable to take Bobbi Kristina out of her medically-induced coma last week. The 21-year-old, who is on life support at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, began having seizures when they began taking her off various medications, it was reported. It was then decided to keep her in the coma. The 21-year-old  is on life support at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia . Last week, she was given a tracheotomy. Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, Bobby Brown, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition. A lawyer for Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown, said in a statement that Bobbi Kristina's partner, Nick Gordon, was offered an opportunity to potentially visit her if he agreed to meet certain conditions. 'Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe. At least not desperate enough to inform Bobby Brown, in writing, what happened to Bobbi Kristina,' attorney Christopher Brown told E!. But Gordon's attorneys said R&B singer Brown has consistently denied Gordon permission to visit. They said they advised Gordon not to agree to the conditions set by Brown. The conditions have not been made public. The attorneys said Gordon has repeatedly offered to discuss the issue privately with Brown. A  report which surfaced last month claimed  Bobbi Kristina  was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub. In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident, according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claimed, and still was 'distraught' over her mother's death three years ago. One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words'. Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married.","The family of Bobbi Kristina has denied a report by TMZ that claimed her father Bobby Brown's relatives are filming a reality shiw .

"A five-year-old boy has undergone extensive plastic surgery after his ear was bitten off when his neighbour's dog viciously mauled him a day before his birthday. Kellen Cormie's ear was bitten off in the attack outside his Gold Coast home on Saturday and he suffered puncture wounds to his shoulder and abdomen where the dog latched on. The large blue staffy that savaged the little boy  was put down on Monday afternoon after its owners surrendered it to Gold Coast City Council. Scroll down for video . Kellen Cormie (right) celebrated his birthday in hospital with his twin Jake after he was savagely mauled by his neighbour's dog on Saturday . Kellen, who has been left traumatised by the incident, spent his birthday recovering in hospital with his twin brother Jake by his side. His mother Kay was getting the car ready to take the twins to pick up their birthday cake when Kellen ran next door to thank the neighbour for mowing their lawn. 'When my wife turned around Kellen's hand was already on the door. The dog barrelled the door open and came over the top of him,' his father, Scott, told Daily Mail Australia. 'He had him around the rib cage and the shoulder. The neighbour came out and just tried to get the dog off him by opening his jaw but (the dog) came back again. 'It wasn't just one bite, it was a full blown attack. He wanted to kill my son.'

His mother Kay was getting the car ready to take the twins to pick up their birthday cake when Kellen ran next door to thank the neighbour for mowing their lawn . Half of Kellen's ear was on the floor when the dog was eventually pulled away and the five-year-old was rushed to hospital for surgery. 'On the scale of dog attacks, the head surgeon said this was on the higher scale. The reality is there is no doubt he is going to lose part of his ear. He will have some disfigurement,' Mr Cormie said. 'Everyone is extremely traumatised. My son has to go back to the hospital on Thursday and he is bawling his eyes out already. He is having nightmares and he is very restless.' The family now have to wait three weeks to learn if the operation to reattach his ear was successful. 'We have to go back on Thursday and we're just preparing ourselves for what we'll see when they take the dressing off,' Mr Cormie said. 'Nothing can prepare us for it, we don't know what is going to be under there.' Kellen and his twin Jake had been warned by their father about dangerous dogs before he was injured . Half of Kellen's ear was on the floor when the dog was eventually pulled away and the five-year-old was rushed to hospital for surgery. He now has to wait three weeks to find out if the surgery was successful . Kellen and his twin Jake had been warned about dangerous dogs before, according to Mr Cormie. 'We have a dog ourselves, but that is the problem I think. The dog we have is gentle. You could step on him and he wouldn't bite you,' he said. 'My kids see this and think this is what dogs are like. I knew that dog was bad and I repeatedly told them to stay away from it. 'Even when Kellen came home from the hospital, he went straight over to our dog and started patting him saying he missed him.' Kellen, pictured here with brother Jake and dad Scott, will start counselling on Tuesday to help with the trauma he experienced .

Kellen's parents hope their son's accident can raise awareness about dangerous dogs. 'If you have an aggressive dog, train it professionally,' Mr Cormie said.

"26-year-old Timothy Turner Jr., of Waterbury, was arrested after a 22-year-old woman called authorities claiming he raped her . A Connecticut man has been charged with raping a Massachusetts woman he met on a dating app. New Haven police say they arrested 26-year-old Timothy Turner Jr., of Waterbury, early Monday after the 22-year-old woman called authorities. Officials allege the woman met Turner on the dating app Tagged and invited her to a multifamily home where one of his relatives lives. The woman says Turner pulled a gun on her and raped her on the second-floor landing. The Hartford Courant reports that officer who later went to the home spotted Turner and said he matched the description of the assailant. Turner allegedly opened the door of a third floor room only to immediately shut it upon seeing the officers. Turner was charged with aggravated first-degree sexual assault and other crimes. Turner is being held on bail and wasn't immediately available to comment on the charges. It's not clear if he has a lawyer. Police warned dating app users to be cautious and to not meet strangers in private, unfamiliar locations. Police said that these types of assaults will become more common as use of dating apps rises . 'This is something people need to be aware of, and be careful of,' David Hartman of New Haven police told WTNH.

"Katy Perry has launched an official 'left shark' costume inspired by one of the backing dancers from her Super Bowl halftime show, who became an overnight internet sensation when he appeared to forget his dance moves live on air. The 30-year-old singer, who was joined by backing dancers dressed as surfboards, palm trees and beach balls, as well as the now-infamous shark duo, for her rendition of California Girls and Teenage Dream at the NFL final in February, tweeted the news to her delighted followers on Monday evening, advising them to head to her online store and pick up one of the $129.99 onesies. Alongside a picture of the new product, she said: 'YOU CAN NOW BE A PROPER #LEFTSHARK WITH THIS OFFICIAL, GLORIOUS #LEFTSHARK ONESIE' Scroll down for video . Step into the role: Katy Perry announced the launch of an official $129.99 left shark onesie (pictured) on Monday evening . Famous: The dancing sea creature first hit headlines back in February when he appeared alongside Katy during her Super Bowl halftime performance and seemed to lose time with the singer and her music . Social media sale: The 30-year-old singer took to Twitter to plug the new addition to her online store . A few minutes earlier, the Unconditional singer had tweeted an image of a makeshift shark costume, which was accompanied by the message: 'ATTENTION INTERNET: NO LONGER DO YOU HAVE TO DIY LEFT SHARK COSTUME LIKE THIS GUY' As part of her new line of left shark clothing, the pop superstar has also released a T-shirt emblazoned with an image of the left shark, with the words 'Current Mood' emblazoned across the front and 'Katy Perry' and '#leftshark' on the back. And while many of her fans were thrilled to see that the left shark's five minutes of fame have been extended, others were horrified by the high price tag attached to the novelty loungewear design. 'I can't even afford to go out with my friend let alone $129 onesies!!!! Stop taunting me!!!!!!' one person wrote in response to Katy's tweet. Another added: 'It's too expensive, I will buy fake ones.' DIY alternative: Katy advised her fans that they no longer need to attempt to make their own left shark onesies at home, using this image as an example . Attention! The Unconditional singer peaked her fans' interest when she posted this tweet, just minutes before announcing the launch of the left shark onesie . But the news has come as a welcome surprise to many people, who admitted that they would be more than willing to shell out the money needed to lay their hands on one of the onesies. 'MY DREAM HAS COME TRUE CAUSE I SUCK AT DIY!!!' one person wrote, clearly overjoyed that they would not need to create their own left shark costume at home. 'But I'm good at spending money. Ordering it now!!' Prior to the launch of Katy's official left shark merchandise line, a number of unofficial products have been made available by eager entrepreneurs hoping to cash in on the left shark's seemingly unwavering popularity. Last month, Katy's attorneys served an artist who was selling small figurines of the globally-famous dancing shark, who was played by professional dancer Bryan Gaw, online with a cease and desist letter, insisting that he remove the products from the website on which they were being sold. Prior to their warning, Fernando Sosa, 31, had been selling up to 15 of the $24.99 three-inch sharks, which were made using a 3D printer, per day via online marketplace Shapeways.com. Wardrobe update: As well as the onesie, Katy is also selling this left shark T-shirt for $25 . Shake your fin: Many fans watching the halftime performance felt that the sharks had stolen the show . Center stage: During the performance, the singer was also joined by dancing beach balls, surfboards and palm trees . However, less than 36 hours after his statues became available, Shapeways officials  notified Mr Sosa of a cease-and-desist letter from Perry's Los Angeles-based attorneys who demanded the shark's removal from the site. 'They said they were pulling the design because they didn't want to deal with lawyers,' Mr Sosa said, adding that the company promptly cancelled his orders and refunded his customers. The letter from attorney Steve Plinio said Katy is the 'owner of the intellectual property depicted or embodied in connection with the shark images and costumes' portrayed during the halftime show. The letter said the failure to comply with the demands outlined 'will be viewed by the courts as willful infringement'. Sosa said he didn't think a halftime show prop would be copyrighted. He added that his product didn't mention Katy Perry or claim that it was associated with her.","30-year-old Katy's dancing sharks stole the spotlight during the Super Bowl halftime show .

"Bostonians have another reason to be steamed about this winter of epic snow: The city is starting to remove the lawn chairs, milk crates, coolers and other stuff that people put on the street to reserve the parking spaces they've dug out. Garbage haulers began collecting the 'space savers' Monday after Mayor Marty Walsh declared an end to the longstanding practice — at least until the next major storm. Boston has been slammed with more than 8 1/2 feet of snow this season, including about 3 inches Sunday night, and more is on the way later this week. The city is just a few inches away from its snowiest winter in history. Scroll down for video . Residents in Boston have been saving parking spots with milkcrates, coolers and lawn chairs as the city battles an historic amount of snowfall. But garbage cleaners have started picking up the spot savers because the city says they are not allowed. Above, a doll in a crate saves a parking spot in a street in south Boston on February 23 . Some of the space savers include threatening notes like this orange cone pictured on a south Boston Street on February 23 . In this February 23, 2015 photo, a car remains buried in snow along a residential street in south Boston. Officials typically turn a blind eye to the lawn chairs, orange cones and assorted bric-a-brac Bostonians use to reserve a parking space after clearing it of snow . In South Boston, the working-class neighborhood where the wintertime battles over parking spots are legendary, some complained the ban on space savers is coming too soon. Southie residents fear the nasty parking disputes that have pitted neighbor against neighbor will only get worse. 'Some people think they own these spots,' said Heidi Labes, who keeps her family's two spots reserved with traffic cones. In tightly packed Boston neighborhoods — and, for that matter, in other snowy cities where parking on the street is a problem even in the best of circumstances — homeowners use space savers to enforce the unwritten rule of the urban jungle: If you shoveled it out, it's yours. Drivers who violate space-saver etiquette risk returning to find hostile notes on their windshields, fresh snow piled on their cars, and even smashed windows, keyed doors and flattened tires. Above, some of the more humorous parking savers seen on the streets of Boston in the recent snowfall . Residents have been defacing and vandalizing cars that take their coveted, dug out spots . Typical space savers include orange traffic cones, beat-up lawn chairs, coolers and garbage cans. Stuffed animals, dolls and a tattered golf bag were among the more colorful items left on Boston streets this winter. A recycling-truck operator in Roxbury who would identify himself only as Mason said he recently saw a toilet bowl holding down a parking spot. This winter, he added, seems to have brought out more threatening messages than years past. A traffic cone bore this message: 'I am a resident and if you value your car, don't take my space.' In general, space savers are allowed on Boston streets up to 48 hours after a storm. But many of the objects have been out at the curb for more than a month because city officials largely turned a blind eye to the practice as storm after storm hit Boston. The city stopped allowing the parking savers on March 2, reigniting the ugly parking wars that have pitted neighbor against neighbor . On the left, a clever spot saver in Boston.

Above a yard chair acts as a parking spot saver on February 23, 2015 . Kaline Mulvihill and Ben Peters, who moved to Boston last summer from Syracuse, New York, said the city should do away with space savers altogether. 'It's stupid that you can claim spots in the first place,' Mulvihill said. 'It should be a free-for-all.' In the city's Roxbury section, some placed the blame squarely on the city. 'If we had better snow removal, then we would have no a need for space savers,' said the Rev. Larry Green, a pastor at the Timothy Baptist Church. 'The people have a responsibility to be neighborly, but the city also has a responsibility to create an environment where they can be neighborly.'

Larry Green, a pastor at the Timothy Baptist Church. Above, a walker and cane hold a spot in Boston . In Philadelphia, where residents similarly use shopping carts and other objects to protect shoveled-out parking spaces, the police department regularly tweets humorous warnings against the illegal custom under the hashtag 'NoSavesies.' One, featuring a picture of Elsa from the Disney movie 'Frozen' holding an orange traffic cone, urged residents upset about people parking in their spots to 'Let it go.' 'We have a long winter ahead of us, and we're prepared to put out as many ridiculously bad memes as necessary to get folks to shovel and share,' the department said in a Facebook post. Somerville, a Boston suburb, doesn't allow space savers either, and residents have been putting up signs this winter to remind neighbors that they don't tolerate the bare-knuckle tactics parts of Boston are notorious for. 'How should we be behaving? LIKE RATIONAL, LEVEL-HEADED ADULTS,' the bright green signs read. 'So should we be slashing tires? NO. And should we be bashing in windshields? NO.'","Bostonians have been saving parking spaces they've dug out with milk crates, coolers, lawn chairs and other objects .

"Top of her science class: Amira Abase, in her uniform for Bethnal Green Academy in East London . These pictures show a teenage girl enjoying life in modern Britain before joining ISIS to become a ‘jihadi bride’. She laughs in the park, shows off vividly painted nails, and poses with the athletics’ squad of her East London school, where she was top of her science class. On Facebook, she writes of going swimming with a friend, loving the music of American rapper Tupac Shakur and enjoying a birthday treat. Few could have predicted what 15-year-old Amira Abase would do next. Two weeks ago, in the middle of half-term, she abruptly walked out of her family’s council home in East London, wearing black jeans and trainers. She caught a bus to Gatwick Airport and flew to Istanbul with two fellow Muslim classmates, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Shamima Begum, 15. Next — in footage captured by CCTV cameras — the trio waited in the snow to board another bus to travel to the Turkish border with Syria. There, Islamic State militants were waiting for them. The girls, by now dressed in burkas, were bundled into cars and disappeared to a life where they will have to marry a fighter selected for them, never step foot outside without him, and become a household drone doing chores restricted to women. Intelligence services say they may even be trained to become fighters themselves. Amira is not the first Western girl to join Islamic State. Police said this week that 60 young British women, many of them schoolgirls, have left for Syria. Few, however, have been radicalised so swiftly as Amira Abase. Back in East London, her friends — many of them non-Muslims — have given a series of exclusive interviews to explain how she had changed before their eyes. As one 16-year-old girl told me this week: ‘She was perfectly normal. She talked about having a lip-piercing one day, and listened to pop chart songs. ‘She was pretty, popular, and a bit of a rebel who saw the funny side of life. I first met her in maths class four years ago. We became best friends.’ Painted nails: Fifteen-year-old Amira, who was born in Ethiopia, larks around with her friends in the park . Born in Ethiopia, Amira moved with her family first to England, and then Germany, before returning here and starting school at Bethnal Green Academy at the age of 11. ‘When I visited, I found her home was not overpoweringly Islamic,’ her friend added. ‘We had a family meal cooked by her mother, who did not wear the hijab at home. After eating, Amira and I went out to the park. ‘She had a BlackBerry phone at 11 or 12, and later an iPhone and computer. She was on them all the time.’ At school, Amira, a Chelsea football fan, shone in debates, once giving a speech on why Muslim women wear the veil. She passed three GCSEs in maths and science early, at age 14. This autumn, she’d planned to study A-level history, maths and biology at the London Academy of Excellence, set up for high-fliers under the free school programme. Her talents did not stop in class. At 13 and 14 she was a star of the school athletics squad, competing across Southern England in the 800 and 1,200 metres. Off to join ISIS: Amira (centre, circled) caught a bus to Gatwick Airport and flew to Istanbul with two fellow Muslim classmates, Kadiza Sultana (left), 16, and Shamima Begum (right), 15. They are pictured at Gatwick . Although she wore the hijab to class, covering her hair in line with Islamic teachings, she abandoned the headgear when she played sport or was with her girl friends. A member of the athletics squad explained: ‘Amira didn’t make a big thing about her Muslim faith. She came to parties if there was no alcohol, and we’d go shopping for clothes. She was one of us. ‘She got friendly with a boy she met at athletics. We teased her about standing very close to him, so she joked she was leaning on him for support. Her parents would not have approved of a boyfriend.’ Yet last year Amira was exposed to a parallel world from her non-Muslim friends. While they were going clubbing, meeting boyfriends, and taking foreign holidays together, these Western ways were forbidden to Amira because of her background. She was expected to pray regularly, and was, her friends think, facing an arranged marriage to a man of her family’s choice in the future. Another friend said: ‘We suspect she joined ISIS because it was exciting thing to do; a way of rebelling. Unlike us, there were not a lot of exciting options open to her.’ Model student: Amira was due to study three A-levels at the London Academy of Excellence this autumn . By the time of her 15th birthday in May last year, Amira had become a ‘different person’. She cut herself off from her ‘clique’ of non-Muslim friends, and mixed instead with two other Muslim girls in the same school year group: Kadiza and Shamima, who, of course, are now with her in Syria. Her old school friends said they were shocked when she sent them a video link claiming that Israelis were deliberately burning Palestinian children. ‘It was horrifying because it showed babies being hurt. I deleted it,’ admitted one. Amira and her two Muslim friends were overheard using derogatory terms for non-Muslim girls, calling one a ‘slag’ and others ‘kafir’ (an Arabic term for non-believer). ‘She was getting into religion and Middle Eastern affairs seriously. She hung around with these two Muslim girls all the time,’ said her friend. We now know that one of those girls, Shamima, used her Twitter account to contact a former medical student, 20-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, who left Glasgow last year to join ISIS and marry a jihadist. Bayrampasa bus station: In footage captured by CCTV cameras, the trio (above) waited  to board a bus to travel to the Turkish border with Syria. There, Islamic State militants were waiting for them . Shamima was following 70 other ISIS terrorists on Twitter, too, many of whom, like Aqsa, used a messaging programme called Surespot. This encrypts messages to avoid interception by intelligence authorities. When messages are deleted by ISIS recruiters, they are automatically erased from the phones of those who have received them. Friends suspect that Amira and the other girls were in touch with Aqsa and other ISIS recruiters via their mobile phones or home computers since before Christmas. ‘Amira is portrayed by police and the school as naïve and vulnerable,’ said one of her friends. ‘But she was savvy and intelligent, and used to getting what she wanted.’ Police were called to Bethnal Green Academy in December after a friend of Amira’s, a Muslim girl of 15 who has not been named, disappeared to Syria. They talked to Amira and her two new friends, but concluded they were not being groomed by ISIS online recruiters. Yet one of Amira’s friends insists: ‘By the time the police came, Amira had isolated herself from non-Muslim pupils. I am surprised the police did not discover she was already fascinated with the Islamic State and people like Jihadi John.’ Runner: At 13 and 14 Amira was a star of the school athletics squad, competing across Southern England in the 800 and 1,200 metres . Amira left her family home in the morning of Tuesday, February 17, telling her father she was going to a wedding. He believed her. She was carrying no luggage, although CCTV shows her and the other girls at Gatwick before boarding a flight with heavy holdalls. Who gave them the bags? Was it an on-the-ground ISIS recruiter in London? The question has not yet been answered. The bags contained the Islamic robes and coats with hoods that the girls were wearing by the time they reached Istanbul. By late morning on the Tuesday, Amira had texted her father, 47-year-old Abase Hussen, who thought his daughter was at the wedding. She said it was ‘a little bit far’, and added: ‘Daddy, I will pray my midday prayer and get back home.’ At midnight, the family reported Amira missing and were desperately messaging her school friends to see if she was with them. One of her old friends admits now: ‘I was getting worried about her. She told girls in school that she agreed with what the Islamic State was doing in Syria. ‘I feel that I have lost my friend for ever.’ She is probably right.","Amira Abase is one of three pupils from East London who went to Syria .

"'Chick sexers' are paid £40,000 a year to spend their days with tens of thousands of fluffy chicks. But despite the seemingly attractive offer, Britain's poultry industry is struggling to recruit and is now facing a staff shortage that is threatening exports. The problem, according to one industry chief, lies in the nature of the job: sexers spend 12 hours a day 'staring at the backside of a chick'. And each new recruit must spend three years learning how to do it. Scroll down for video . Chicken sexers: Workers spot the 'minuscule differences' in the size and shape of each one-day-old chick's genitalia - known as its 'vent' - to determine whether it will be a rooster, or will one day lay eggs . Andrew Large, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, added that another part of the problem is that the awareness of the role is not as high as it could be. Each future 'chick sexer' receives years in training in how to spot 'minuscule differences' in the size and shape of a newly-hatched chick's genitalia to determine whether it will be a rooster or a hen. They are expected to be able to sort between 800 and 1,200 day-old old chicks an hour - between three and five seconds a chick - with an accuracy of 97 or 98 per cent. This must be done for as long as it takes to fill an order, which can be up to 13 hours. And each chick must have its genitalia - known as its 'vent' - checked without being harmed, Mr Large told The Times. Delicate: Each chick must be handled with care . Although the checking technique can be taught relatively quickly, the ability to maintain standards for such long periods at such level of intensity has to be developed over a longer time. In 2013 the industry failed to recruit a single 'vent chick sexer' and asked for the job to be added to an official government list of occupations with staff shortages. Mr Large told The Times: 'It takes three years to train someone so they  develop the sensitivity and dexterity to reliably sex the bird and a lot of people don't want to spend that amount of time training. 'I think the problem is the job itself. You are spending hours every day staring at the backside of a chick. That is not seen as being attractive. 'In southeast Asia a chick sexer is a high status job. In the UK it is more likely to be the butt of humour.' There are an estimated 100 to 150 chick sexers in the country but a shortage of 15 workers means the industry risks losing overseas clients. But the Migration Management Committee, who advises the government on whether a job should be added to the shortage list, ruled that chick sexing should not be included. Chick sexing has previously made headlines as a number of the birds - mainly male - are discarded and killed if they are surplus to the requirement of the order. When asked by MailOnline whether this could affect the number of jobseekers applying for jobs as chick sexers, Mr Large said it was not an issue that had been raised with them. He added that it was only if the birds did not fit the order, and could not be redirected to meat production, that they were 'humanely culled'. Waiting to be checked: Chick sexers are expected to be able to sort between 800 and 1,200 day-old old chicks an hour - between three and five seconds a chick - with an accuracy of 97 or 98 per cent .","Sexers are paid £40,000 to determine whether chicks are male or female .

"The remains of an 18-year-old girl who went missing after hitchhiking in December have been found in a remote park in Colorado. Kelly Mae Myers was reported missing on December 18 by distraught relatives in Colorado who said her disappearance was 'out of character'. Police are investigating the death as suspicious after discovering the remains in Cactus Park, Mesa County - a hotspot for four-wheel truck drivers performing stunts. Tragic: The remains of Kelly Mae Myers, 18, were found in a remote desert park of Colorado on Saturday . On Saturday, the Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook: 'Kelly Mae Myers...it is with deep sympathy we notify our community that her remains were recovered in a remote Mesa County area, yesterday. 'This death investigation is active and on-going, so please be patient as many details are not yet available for release. 'We hope the community will surround her family and friends, and support them in their time of grief.' An autopsy was conducted on Sunday. That results have yet to be released. Search: She had been missing since December 18 when family thought she had hitchhiked to friends in Utah . A search team was not sent out for Myers until January 19 as authorities suggested she appeared to have fled independently to meet friends in Salt Lake City, Utah. In an appeal that day, the sheriff's office said: 'A few reports to investigators have indicated Kelly might have hitch hiked to Utah. 'Investigators believe she has friends or known associates in the Salt Lake City area, and may have been trying to get there. 'Currently, investigators do not have any information she in endangered, however, her family insists this is very unusual behavior for Kelly and a great cause for concern.' According to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, Myers worked at Abra Formal Wear and attended Central High School. A friend commented on her Facebook page: 'With a heavy heart I have to inform all my family and friends that they have found our sweet Kelly.

"Tracy Leann Bess-Thacker, 29, is charged with theft for allegedly scamming a Utah couple out of $200 . An Iowa woman has been arrested after allegedly faking a pregnancy to scam adoptive parents out of money - and it's the second time she has been busted. Tracy Leann Bess-Thacker, 29, used a sonogram and other hospital pictures from a previous pregnancy to trick a Utah couple desperate for a baby into sending her $200, according to police. Authorities say she's up to her old tricks again. In 2011, she was charged with filing a false report and suborning perjury after she used 19 different alias to scam parents from Nebraska, Illinois, Hawaii, Iowa, and Kansas. Many of the prospective parents in that case traveled to Iowa to meet Bess-Thacker and gave her $3,000 for food, clothing and baby supplies, according to authorities. 'Tracy Bess is an internet predator who intentionally inflicts mental anguish and emotional distress on adoptive parents. This is a strong example of an internet bullying case that has not been considered in the law,' Ankeny Police Chief Gary Mikulec told WHO-TV. Police say the Utah couple contacted police about Bess-Thacker last July after they discovered stories online about her 2011 arrest. At the time, police said there wasn't enough evidence to arrest her. Last month, a break in the case came and police took her into custody. She is charged with fourth-degree theft. Bess-Thacker allegedly created a birth mother registry on for LifeLong Adoptions, which pairs mothers with adoptive parents. She also made posts online and on social media groups where adoptive parents connect with birth mothers, according to police. Police say they fear other victims of Bess-Thacker could still be out there. They've asked anyone else who's had contact with her online to call 515-289-5240.","Tracy Leann Bess-Thacker, 29, took $200 from a Utah couple who thought she was pregnant .

When Pieces of Eight Tattoo Studio, on the northeast of Wellington, posted the design on their Facebook page, they could never have anticipated the viral sensation caused by the emotive artwork. Scroll down for video . The tattoo that the social media world fell in love with -  World War I soldiers marching into the distance in a shape of a fern . Bruce Neal waited 41 years until he finally came across a design that he fell in love with for his second tattoo . Mr Neal saw the image a few months ago on a historical information board along the Wellington waterfront where the troops left for Gallipoli. Then his wife spotted the same design again on TV last week which was when he knew it was just meant to be and made an appointment last Thursday for his second 'toughie sticker'. 'I chose it for myself and nobody else - it was my way of showing respect,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I did it for the old guys (soldiers) who don't get much publicity - and there are not many of them left now.' Mr Neal now works an ice cream salesman, but spent 18 years in the army where he met his wife - and their daughter also works for the Air Force. Other social media users then posted their own similar designs  of the soldiers . The tattoo parlour will not replicate Mr Neal's exact design again (pictured another similar design posted) He is flabbergasted at how his idea for the tattoo has taken off around the globe. 'It must have hit a cord with people around the world - I couldn't believe it,' he said. 'The tattooist got a call from Russia today asking for the stencil.' The photo of Mr Neal's tattoo has so far received 130,000 likes, almost 44,000 shares and close to 5,000 comments on the tattoo studio's Facebook page. Some decided to share their similar designs that they had inked on their skin while many others expressed that they didn't usually like tattoos but were really impressed with Mr Neal's. Tattoo artist Derek Thunders said most posts of the studio's body artwork get about 80 likes over a couple of weeks. 'When it got to 2,000 likes I took a screenshot, because I thought it would tail off pretty soon,' he told stuff.co.uk. He said people have started asking for the same design but he would not replicate as he prefers to make unique creations.

"A gay rights activist who caused a national panic on social media when he posted that he had been kidnapped has been found- and charged with faking his own abduction. Adam Hoover, 20, from Cincinnati, Ohio, the co-president of Marriage Equality Ohio, sent out a post on Twitter and Facebook Monday evening saying that he had been taken by individuals who were keeping him in the trunk of his car and threatening to kill him and his family. The post was quickly picked up by thousands across the country, most notably LGBT advocate Tyler Oakley, who shared the young man's cry for help with his 3.8million Twitter followers. Hoover was found safe in the trunk of his car some time later, and then, early this morning, charged with faking the entire incident. Scroll down for video . Adam Hoover (above) has been charged with faking his own kidnapping after an incident that happened late Monday night . Hoover sent a message out on Facebook (above) and Twitter saying individuals were threatening to kill him and his family . Authorities soon found Hoover in the trunk of his car (above) thanks to support from social media . 'Please help me I'm in the trunk of my ford escort red,' Hoover posted last night, including the license plate number of his car, his mother's phone number and the stretch of road where police could find the automobile. 'They said they are going to kill my family please call 911 I don't want them to hear me. Please please call. I don't want to die.' Authorities did find him, shortly after, thanks to the widespread support and outreach conducted on social media, but, according to WLWT, determined soon after that the entire abduction had been orchestrated by Hoover. It is not known if he had any accomplices in the alleged hoax. Hoover's mother seemed to confirm these charges when she posted on his Facebook account Tuesday morning; 'This is Adams mom Anna. Thank you for your support and prayers. I have a special request. Social media is powerful. Could every please remove posts and tags and give us some time to figure this all out.

"A man who walked off a Qantas flight after he realised an asylum seeker was on board being deported is taking the airline to a tribunal because the airline banned him from flying after the incident. Paul Leary, 51, decided to leave the February 2 flight from Melbourne to Darwin before the flight took off, after an asylum seeker advocate on the plane began protesting the deportation. Mr Leary learned he was on the same flight as a 25-year-old Tamil asylum seeker, known as Puvaneethan, when he arrived at Melbourne Airport to see advocates handing out flyers, and when the female protester refused to sit down as the plane prepared for take-off. Scroll down for video . Paul Leary, 51, made a personal decision to leave the flight he had boarded from Melbourne to Darwin on February 2 but has now been banned from flying with Qantas . Mr Leary said he and a colleague felt faced with a 'moral dilemma.' His female colleague decided she was not comfortable being on the plane and Mr Leary stood by her and also decided not to fly. ‘We couldn’t have been politer. We were travelling for business, we’ve both got executive roles in the organisation we work for… we were not aggravating or inciting other people,’ Mr Leary told Daily Mail Australia. ‘The protester was probably 20 seats behind us.’ Mr Leary and his colleague pressed the assistance light above their seats and a Qantas stewardess came over to speak with them. ‘My colleague courageously and in a polite gesture stood up and pressed the call button. When the Qantas steward came over she indicated she was not comfortable with what was going on,’ Mr Leary explained. They were told to wait and eventually a federal police officer came aboard the aircraft. Mr Leary’s colleague told the stewardess she wanted to leave. ‘I stood up and said “can you explain what’s going on?” and they said the woman is protesting and we are going to have a discussion and I said “look I think I’ll get off too”,’ Mr Leary said. When he and his colleague were back inside the airport the federal police took their details but no one from Qantas informed them at that point of any kind of flight ban. It wasn’t until Mr Leary was returning from Darwin four days later after catching a flight with a different airline that he attempted to return to Melbourne with Qantas and was told he was subject to a no-fly ban. Paul Leary was issued with this 'no fly notification' after he walked off a flight from Melbourne to Darwin which was carrying an asylum seeker thought to have been taken for deportation . ‘A manager came over and said “you are involved in a security review and won’t be flying today”,’ Mr Leary recalled. He was told to email Qantas security to find out more but when he did that straight away he claims he did not hear anything back. After six hours he managed to catch a flight with a different airline. ‘I still didn't hear anything by Monday and the only response I got was to submit a customer care complaint,’ he added. After Mr Leary submitted his complaint he then received a formal letter on February 16 informing him of his ban. ‘As a result of your actions on board QF838 from MELDRW on 2nd February, we have decided to issue you a No Fly Notification - Until Further Notice while the incident is investigated,’ Qantas wrote. ‘Your actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the Qantas Group or the Jetstar Group. ‘A Qantas Customer Care Representative will make contact with you upon completion of the investigation to advise you of the outcome,’ the airline said. Mr Leary said he has not been able to find out what the review process entails or if Qantas are going to refund the cost of his flights to his employer. Mr Leary and his colleague have also been banned from flying with Jetstar and Qantas affiliates . Flyers were handed out at Melbourne airport asking the public to save asylum seeker Puvaneethan from torture . ‘It’s like a Kafkaesque situation where you just find out the result at the end,’ he said. The letter spells out how Mr Leary cannot ‘travel on any flight operated by a member of the Qantas Group or the Jetstar Group or travel on any codeshare flight operated by another airline (including Emirates) that has a Qantas or Jetstar flight number, such as “QF” or “JQ”, on your ticket’. Mr Leary has complained to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal's human rights division that the ban discriminates against him on the basis of his political belief. His female colleague is also in the process of filing a complaint. ‘Myself and my colleague didn't want to do anything, we thought Qantas are a big company with a good reputation I’ll find out the facts and it will all go away but it hasn’t. ‘If alternatively there was no asylum seeker on the plane and I decided to accompany my colleague off the plane because she was ill I don’t think I’d be banned. ‘So the only reason I can see for this ban is my political beliefs… I’m not a known activist, I never have been. I’m in my fifties, I’m not a radical.’ A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia there was a delay in issuing the no fly notification to Mr Leary which is why he did not receive it prior to his next flight. 'A number of passengers were identified as being involved in the on board incident, causing the flight to be delayed by almost an hour,' Qantas said. 'A ‘no fly notification’ has been issued by Qantas to those passengers while the incident is investigated by the AFP.  As the incident is under investigation, it is not appropriate to comment further.'","Paul Leary, 51, walked off a Qantas flight from Melbourne to Darwin .

"A rogue Amish sect leader and seven of his followers who were jailed for brutally chopping off the hair and beards of their rivals in their eastern Ohio community have had their sentences reduced. Sam Mullet Sr and 15 others were convicted three years ago of restraining and forcibly disfiguring Amish people with whom they disagreed in a bid to destroy an important symbol of their beliefs. But after an appeals court dismissed hate crimes convictions against them last year, eight of them were resentenced on their remaining charges - mainly, conspiracy to obstruct justice - on Monday. Mullet, who originally received a 15-year sentence, was ordered to serve 10 years, nine months, in prison. Meanwhile, sentences for four other men who received seven years were cut to five years. Scroll down for video . Court hearing: A rogue Amish sect leader and seven of his followers who were jailed for brutally chopping off the hair and beards of rivals in their eastern Ohio community have had their sentences reduced following an appeal. Above, members of the Bergholz community are seen leaving federal court in Cleveland on Monday . Leaving court: Sam Mullet Sr and 15 others were convicted three years ago of restraining and forcibly disfiguring Amish people with whom they disagreed. Eight of them were resentenced on their remaining charges - mainly, conspiracy to obstruct justice - on Monday. Abov, more Amish people leave the courthouse . Leader: Mullet (pictured, left, in his police mug shot, and right, standing in the front yard of his home in Bergholz in 2011), who originally received a 15-year sentence, was resentenced to 10 years and nine months in prison . And the sentences for three men who initially got five years were lowered to three years, seven months. The other eight convicts, including six women, have already served their sentences. None of the 16 defendants spoke in court. Hair and beards have spiritual significance in the Amish faith. Amish men do not shave their beards after marriage, believing it shows their devotion to God. During the 2011 attacks, some of the victims were awakened in the middle of the night by members of the Bergholz-based breakaway Amish group, before being restrained and viciously disfigured. At an earlier court hearing, a sheriff testified that one bishop's hair was unevenly chopped to the scalp by Mullet's followers, leaving his skin bloody. Another victim claimed four or five men dragged him out of his house by his chest-length beard and chopped it to within 1 1/2 inches of his chin. Prosecutors argued the original sentences should have remained intact because of the defendants' religious motivation and the fact that the sentences were lower than what federal guidelines allowed. However, attorneys for all the imprisoned men asked Judge Dan Aaron Polster at the court in Cleveland on Monday to reduce their clients' sentences to time served, allowing for their release. Protest: Sentences for four other men who received seven years were cut to five years. Above, Werner Lange holds a sign reading, 'FREE THE AMISH', as he stands outside the federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, on Monday . Met by the press: The sentences for three men who initially got five years were lowered to three years and seven months. The other eight convicts, including six women, have already served their sentences . Shocking assaults: During the 2011 attacks, some of the victims were awakened in the middle of the night by members of the Bergholz-based breakaway Amish group, before being restrained and viciously disfigured . Edward Bryan, one of Mullet's attorneys, told the court it would be an 'irrational fear' to think his client - who was accused of ruling his followers with an iron fist - would commit another crime. The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals dismissed the hate crime convictions because of improper jury instructions by Polster on whether the 16 attacked their victims because of their religion. However, on Monday, Judge Polster made it clear that he remains convinced the hair and beard-cutting assaults were 'substantially motivated by the victims' religion.' He said the defendants inflicted trauma on the victims and trampled on their First Amendment right of religious freedom. 'The remaining eight defendants still warrant substantial sentences,' he said. Religious: At an earlier court hearing, a sheriff testified that one bishop's hair was unevenly chopped to the scalp by Mullet's followers, leaving his skin bloody. Above, five Amish men at the courthouse three years ago . Sons: Mullet's sons Johnny (left) and Lester (right) were among those charged in the 'beard-cutting' attacks . Although Mullet did not participate in any of the attacks, assistant U.S. attorney Bridget Brennan said in court that he exerted tight control as bishop and leader of the sect. She said that he encouraged the assaults, each of which began and ended at Mullet's home. 'These were orchestrated, terrorizing attacks,' Ms Brennan said. Mr Bryan tried to evoke sympathy for Samuel Mullet by pointing out that his wife of nearly 40 years died in November and that some members of the sect, situated near the panhandle of West Virginia, have left the group, including a co-defendant whose husband was  resentenced on Monday. 'No one is trying to minimize what happened,' Mr Bryan said. 'It was wrong. My client knows that.' 'Tight control': Mullet (pictured) did not participate in any of the attacks, but assistant U.S. attorney Bridget Brennan said in court he exerted tight control as bishop and leader of the sect, and encouraged the attacks . The community has been shunned since the attacks by other Amish communities and hasn't been able to find another Amish bishop willing to perform marriages and funerals, the defense said. 'A stigma will forever be attached to this community,' Mullet's attorneys said. Ohio has an Amish population of around 61,000 - second only to Pennsylvania - with most living in rural counties south and east of Cleveland. They have a modest lifestyle and are deeply religious. Their traditions of traveling by horse and buggy and forgoing most modern conveniences distance themselves from the outside world and symbolize a yielding to a collective order.","Sam Mullet Sr and 15 others  convicted three years ago of 'beard-cutting'

"Vicious: Kerry Roberts slashed 44-year-old Ashley Arnold's throat and chest after accusing her of taking drugs behind his back, a court was told . A man who almost hacked his girlfriend to death with a meant cleaver before going to a Halloween party covered in her blood has been jailed for life. Kerry Roberts slashed 44-year-old Ashley Arnold's throat and chest after in a 'frenzied' attack after accusing her of taking drugs behind his back, a court was told. He then went to the Halloween party in Colchester, Essex, wearing just his boxers and told his daughter, Linzi, who was hosting the party: 'I've killed her, she's dead.' Roberts, known as Wart, was due to stand trial charged with attempted murder but changed his plea to guilty when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday. Today he was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of nine years. Sentencing Roberts, Judge Charles Gratwicke said: 'You embarked on an unprovoked, murderous, frenzied and sustained attack on Ms Arnold in which you viciously and mercilessly attempted to butcher her to death with a meat cleaver. 'The injuries you inflicted on that women were horrific. The most significant being a severe, gaping wound to the neck running from ear to ear. 'But for the intervention of skilled medical professionals, I am certain she would have died. This was a brutal and callous attempt to kill.' Roberts, 49, had been seen acting strangely while at the party with his then-girlfriend Ms Arnold earlier in the evening of 1 November last year. He told one guest he was in love with Ms Arnold but was convinced she was going to die. The couple left the party at 10pm and returned to Ms Arnold's home in Jaywick, Essex. Mother-of-four Ms Arnold suffered severe cuts to her throat, running almost from ear to ear, when Roberts attacked her, the court heard. She also sustained a 6in cut from her armpit to her right breast and suffered severe injuries to her hands when she tried to defend herself. Ms Arnold staggered outside where she was helped by neighbours and passers-by. She was taken to Colchester General Hospital, Essex, in a critical condition. The court heard Ms Arnold has recovered but is still unable to use her right hand properly. Brutal: Police cars outside the home in Essex where the attack took place on the 1 November last year . Roberts, who suffers from depression, returned to the party, but his daughter told him to leave after he told her: 'I've killed her, she's dead.' After he left the party, Linzi and her partner, Wayne Sams, went searching for him and found him crouched in the driveway of his parents' home, where he had previously lodged. Mr Sams gave Roberts his tracksuit bottoms when he begged for clothes before Roberts fled. Police found him crouching in a bush on a nearby road. At the time of the attack, Roberts was on licence after serving just two years of a six-year jail sentence for setting fire to a former girlfriend's home in Corringham, Essex. Investigation: The home in Essex where the attack took place. Roberts was due to stand trial charged with attempted murder but changed his plea to guilty when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday . Peter Clark, prosecuting, said: 'This was a sustained attack that caused serious physical and mental harm. 'Perhaps the most disconcerting thing is the similarities with the previous incident.' Speaking after the hearing yesterday, Det Insp Anne Cameron said: 'I am relieved Roberts has admitted his guilt, albeit at the start of his trial. 'He has saved the victim having to relieve the events of that traumatic night in court. We were so lucky we were not investigating a murder.' John Caudle, mitigating, today said Roberts had been driven by a misguided obsession with his partner misusing drugs - a similar motive to what had led him to commit the previous arson. He added: 'This was not a planned attack. It was spontaneous and as Your Honour observed yesterday during opening he was not pre-armed and it was during that he went and got the weapon. 'Clearly, he flipped.'","Kerry Roberts slashed Ashley Arnold's throat and chest in attack last year .

"Most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient's skin entering the surgical wound . Scientists in the U.S. have devised an implant in a tiny silk 'purse' that kills infections after surgery and then dissolves in the body. Up to four in 100 people undergoing surgery in the UK will develop an infection, and this can prolong hospital stays by as much as nine days. Surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions after operations, according to a study published last month. Most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient's skin entering the surgical wound. The most common culprits are Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, responsible for 20 per cent of surgical site infections, coagulase negative staphylococcus, and enterococcus bacteria. The infection can usually be treated with antibiotics but sometimes patients need more complex treatment, including further surgery. The new implant uses heat to kill off bacteria. It consists of a tiny, magnesium coil wrapped in a pocket of silk protein, and is implanted during surgery - if the patient later shows sign of infection, the implant can be switched on using a remote control. This raises the temperature of the coil. The silk protein protects the coil - both harmlessly dissolve in the body over the next fortnight. This is an improvement on previous medical implant devices, which are made from non-degradable materials that need to be removed. Researchers at Tufts University have used the implant in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, raising its temperature for two periods of ten minutes. Within 24 hours the tissue was infection-free. The device, including the coil, completely dissolved after 15 days. 'This is an important step forward for the development of on-demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely,' the researchers said. 'These wireless strategies could help manage post-surgical infection, for example, or pave the way for eventual ""wi-fi"" drug delivery.' The team has also carried out experiments using remote control to deliver antibiotics to treat E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Stella Vig, consultant vascular and general surgeon at Croydon University Hospital, said: 'This is an exciting new concept and an innovative tool against the war of surgical site infection. This new purse could allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device . The concept of reducing bacterium within the tissues and thereby reducing risk of infections is not new, and was previously achieved by deploying antibiotic beads within the tissues. These required retrieval and therefore are not used routinely. 'This new device would allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device, which then disappears without the need for surgery to remove it. 'Surgical site infections are costly as they increase the length of stay for patients and can lead to further surgery.' Meanwhile, a team at the University of South Florida has developed a new antibiotic to fight the superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA, which kills thousands of people worldwide each year. The bug is a form of Staphylococcus aureus which does not respond to the usual antibiotics. The new treatment is based on a class of drugs called quinazolines, which have been used in treating malaria and cancer. They have recently been shown to act on bacteria, too. 'In recent years, MRSA has become resistant to vancomycin, our most valuable treatment option against staphylococcal infections,' said Dr Lindsey N. Shaw, whose team developed the new drugs. 'Bacterial disease remains the second-leading cause of death globally, especially among children and the elderly. 'We need new drugs to fight these infections.'","Surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions .

"Sean Moses faces 86 counts of invasion of privacy and one count of child pornography . A man sneaking around on his hands and knees videotaped dozens of naked girls and women in dressing rooms at one of the country's largest malls and then posted the clips on pornography websites, police said Monday. Sean Moses, who admitted what he did, is seen on a cellphone video he recorded at the King of Prussia Mall outside Philadelphia reaching under doors to videotape women changing in dressing rooms at stores including Forever 21 and Express, police said. Detectives called it one of the largest invasion-of-privacy cases they've seen in the area. They said Moses, a 37-year-old self-employed information technology worker, did it for 'self-gratification' and kept 'volumes of files on his computer known as jail bait' with videos of girls. 'You have young girls on a Saturday afternoon with their girlfriends, they go to try on some clothes and you have a pervert like this violating your personal space and your privacy,' Radnor Township police Superintendent William Colarulo said. Police arrested Moses on Monday at the Penn Valley home where he lives with his girlfriend and his 6-year-old daughter and charged him with dozens of counts of invasion of privacy and a count of child pornography. He was jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail. He couldn't be reached for comment in jail and didn't have a lawyer. Hunting through the King of Prussia mall allowed Moses to prey on women at one of the largest shopping centers in the U.S. Colarulo said detectives found the videos posted on porn sites and tracked them back to Moses. From a previous unrelated incident, Detective Thomas Schreiber learned that people engaged in these crimes tend to post the videos online. 'He did an exhaustive search on the Internet and Detective Schreiber actually located the videos that Mr. Moses took of our unsuspecting victims,' Colarulo said. At least 69 videos were filmed at the Forever 21 store and posted online, according to an affidavit of probable cause. Moses would lie on the floor of fitting rooms that had stalls that stopped about 2 feet from the floor, giving him 'easy access to record from a ground up direction,' the affidavit said. In the videos, one woman sees the camera and flashes an obscene gesture at it, and another woman takes a photo of it, but neither came forward to police. Moses allegedly posted his pictures and videos to several pornography sites . A complaint was filed by a mother and a daughter in December, but they never reported the incident to the police. A spokesman for the mall did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Police have worked to scrub the videos from the Internet, but Colarulo said they keep appearing because of the loyal following Moses had online. 'Mr. Moses had such a following on the Internet that even though these videos were removed, his fans are reposting these videos as a tribute to Mr. Moses because he actually had a fan club,' Colarulo said. Police said they started investigating allegations of video voyeurism against Moses in September, when two Villanova University students in Bryn Mawr reported seeing a camera light in their window. Police said they found a video Moses uploaded of the women labeled 'Amazing Brunette and roommate who noticed peep.'","Sean Moses admitted to taping the women at the King of Prussia Mall outside Philadelphia .

"Wary: The Vatican's head of security, Domenico Giani (pictured) has revealed that the threat to the Pope from Isis is 'real' The Vatican is on alert in case of . an attack by Islamist militants against the city-state or Pope . Francis, but officials are not aware of any specific plot, the . head of Vatican security said in a rare interview. 'The threat exists. This is what has emerged from . conversations with Italian and foreign colleagues,' Domenico . Giani told an Italian police magazine when asked if threats from Islamic State militants were . credible. '(But) at the moment I can say that we are not aware of any . plan to attack the Vatican or the Holy Father,' he added in the . interview, published on the magazine's website on Monday. Giani has a force of some 130 agents protecting most of the Vatican and the Pope, with the help of the more ceremonial Swiss Guard. The Italian police guard the exterior, as well as St. Peter's Square. Twenty of his agents, Giani explained, have specialist anti-terror training and guard the Pope when he's abroad. He told Polizia Moderna: 'Twenty Vatican bodyguards have received special training that makes them suitable also ready to use in anti-terrorist actions. Some of them accompany the Pope during his international travels.' The security operation at the Vatican is aided by a command and control centre that Giani says has a 'high level' of technology, along with thousands of surveillance cameras. The Vatican is on alert in case of an attack by Islamist militants against the city-state or Pope Francis, but officials are not aware of any specific plot, Giani said in a rare interview . Islamic State militants have made threats against Catholic . targets in Rome that have been given much space in Italian . media. Last month, in a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian . Coptic Christians in Libya, one of the killers said: 'Safety for . you crusaders is something you can only wish for ... We will . conquer Rome, by the will of Allah.' A website used by militants ran a photo montage showing the . movement's black flag flying from the obelisk at the centre of . St. Peter's Square. Giani said the alert level was 'constantly high' in and . around the tiny city-state, which sits inside Rome. The Swiss Guard are largely ceremonial, but do offer another layer of security at the Vatican . The threat from 'lone wolf' operators are considered by his security team as particularly dangerous because they're 'unpredictable'. They are also aware that some people may try and carry out an act of violence at the Vatican because it would guarantee them maximum media coverage. What makes their job more challenging is that the Holy Father is not willing to abandon speaking to his followers directly during visits. Giani said: 'The Holy Father is not abandoning the style of his pontificate... he does not want to lose touch with his flock. Therefore, we... have to adjust to him, and not vice versa.' Many Islamic countries ensure that there is a flow of intelligence directed at the Vatican - and have a great deal of respect for the Pope. Giani said: 'Many Islamic countries not only give me valuable information, but also esteem and admiration for the Holy Father.' Last month, in the wake of killings by Islamist militants in . Paris and Copenhagen, 4,800 soldiers were placed on the streets . throughout Italy. Francis has several times condemned attacks by Islamic . militants. On Sunday, he called for an end to their 'intolerable . brutality'.","Domenico Giani, head of Vatican security, has given a rare interview .

"Hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials in Victoria due to concerns over starvation in a key habitat. The Victorian government euthanised 686 koalas  at Cape Otway, about 230km southwest of Melbourne, in 2013 and 2014 in response to overpopulation in manna gum woodlands in the area. The koalas, many of which were starving, were killed via lethal injection after being captured in trees. Animal activists are furious and have condemned the government for their 'cruel' treatment of koalas and questioned why the program was conducted in secret. Hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials in Victoria due to concerns over starvation . The Victorian government euthanised 686 koalas at Cape Otway, about 230km southwest of Melbourne . During three separate operations, veterinarians captured and sedated koalas to assess their health. Koalas suffering starvation were euthanised, while healthy koalas were released back into the wild and healthy females were treated with control hormone implants. The cull is said to have occurred in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals. Australian Koala Foundation chief Deborah Tabart OAM said she had heard rumours that koalas were being killed but had never had proof until now. 'I want somebody charged,' Ms Tabart said. 'The Australian government over my whole career has said there will never be a cull in Australia ever. 'It's cruel and mean to koalas and pays no respect for the role they play in tourism - how dare they treat this animal with that sort of level of disrespect. Australian Koala Foundation chief Deborah Tabart OAM questioned why the program was conducted in secret . 'And if they are so proud of what they were doing why was it done in secret?' Koala expert Dr Desley Whisson, who advised the government on the euthanasia program, said that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size. Ms Tabart said more should have been done in previous years to stop the problem from escalating . 'Watching an animal starve to death is a horrible thing,' Dr Whisson, from Deakin University, told Daily Mail Australia. 'For every one koala that was euthanised there were probably two or three that starved without intervention. 'It at least was a good thing to put them out of their misery.' Dr Whisson said moving the population to other areas or conducting fertility control programs were expensive options. 'A lot of people ask why we can't just move the koalas somewhere else, but I think it's important to recognise the translocation koalas often has a negative impact,' she said. 'A large number would die, and they don't want to move from manna gum. 'It's sort of a lose-lose situation all round.' Dr Whisson said the problem in the manna gum woodland at Cape Otway was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from French Island. 'Manna gum is a very good food source for koalas, it's low in toxins and high in nutrients so koalas love it,' she said. 'To the point where they don't move for the food supply. 'Koalas can move one or two kilometres in a night but in this population, they stay in these manna gum areas and numbers build up.' Ms Tabart said more should have been done in previous years to prevent the problem from escalating. The problem in the manna gum woodland at Cape Otway was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from French Island . The koalas, many of which were starving, were killed via lethal injection after being captured in tree . 'Instead of doing this why didn't they plant trees all those years ago?' she said . 'They could have taken young ones out and relocated them. 'They've done nothing – they've watched until the problem becomes immense and then gone ""Oh we better do something let's kill them."" 'It's easy to say we had to put them out of their misery – they shouldn't have got to that misery in first place.' At Cape Otway there are up to 11 koalas per hectare, but the sustainable density is less than one koala per hectare. The cull is said to have occurred in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals . Koala expert Dr Desley Whisson, who advised the government on the euthanasia program, stressed that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size . Victorian Environment Minister Lisa Neville said she was putting in place a koala management program to deal with the 'a very challenging and complex issue'. 'It is clear it's an overpopulation issue and it is clear that we have had koalas suffer in that Cape Otway area because of ill health and starvation,' Ms Neville told ABC. 'That's just not good enough and that's a terrible way to treat koalas. 'I'm wanting to make sure that we're taking the best action we can in this terrible situation of overpopulation. 'I don't want to see koalas suffer.' The koala is listed as 'vulnerable' in New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT and as 'rare' in South Australia but it has no official listing in Victoria.","Hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials .

"The world's first trillionaire - someone worth a staggering $1,000,000,000,000 - could emerge within just 20 years, analysts believe. The predictions come as Forbes released its billionaires list this week with Bill Gates - who is widely expected to become the world's first trillionaire - at the top with a worth of $79.2 billion. If the U.S. national wealth continues to grow at its current rate, Gates, who saw his fortune grow by $4.2 billion in the past year alone, could well reach the eye-watering figure in his old age. Among those who believe a trillionaire is only years away, entrepreneur Peter Diamandis says he believes the wealth could be earned through space discoveries, the Washington Times reported. Could he be the first? Microsoft's Bill Gates topped Forbes' billionaire list earlier this week and he could well be the first person to become a trillionaire. Analysts say the first trillionaire could be just 20 years away . 1. Bill Gates - Microsoft, $79.2 bn . 2. Carlos Slim Helu -  telecoms, $77.1bn . 3. Warren Buffet - investor, $72.7bn . 4. Amancio Ortega - Zara, $64.5 bn . 5. Larry Ellison - Oracle, $54.3 bn . 6. Charles Koch - various, $42.9 bn . 6. David Koch - various, $42.9 bn . 8. Christy Walton -  Walmart, $41.7 bn . 9. Jim Walton - Walmart, $40.6 bn . 10. Liliane Bettencourt - L'Oreal, $40.1 bn . 'I think the first trillionaire is going to be made in space,' he told Business Insider this week. Diamandis, an engineer and physician behind companies including Space Adventures Ltd., said individuals and firms finally have the capabilities to explore space for themselves, which could lead to lucrative discoveries. Among Diamandis' own 17 companies, he has teams prospecting near-Earth asteroids, which he calls 'trillion dollar assets'. They represent 'everything we hold of value on Earth, minerals, metals, real estate,' he said. But he's not the only one who believes bank accounts are set to expand. International investment bank Credit Suisse has previously said in an annual Global Wealth Report that there will be 11 trillionaires within two generations. 'Two generations ahead, future extrapolation of current wealth growth rates yields almost a billion millionaires, equivalent to 20 per cent of the total adult population,' the bank said in 2013. Shooting for the stars: Entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, pictured last month, says he believes the first trillionaire could be made in space, where minerals and real estate are waiting to be claimed . 'If this scenario unfolds, then billionaires will be commonplace, and there is likely to be a few trillionaires too, 11 according to our best estimate.' In its list this week, Forbes  identified a record 1,826 billionaires - up from 1,645 last year - with a combined net worth of $7.05 trillion. Gates has topped the list for 16 of the last 21 years. In second place was telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu, who has a net worth of $77.1 billion. Third was investor Warren Buffett, who moved up one slot this year with a net worth of $72.7 billion. They still have a way to go, but among the youngest billionaires, who could well have their eye on that trillion dollar mark, are Uber founder Travis Kalanik, worth $5.3 billion, Rockstar Energy drinks founder Russ Weiner, worth $2.1 billion, and Airbnb founder, Brian Chesky, worth $2 billion. Billions: Beer heiress Tatiana Casiraghi . 1. Mark Zuckerberg, 30 - Facebook, $33.4bn . 2. Dustin Moskovitz, 30 - Facebook, $7.9bn . 3. Elizabeth Holmes, 31 - blood-testing, $4.5bn . 4. Tom Persson, 30 - H&M, $3bn . 5. Julio Mario Santo Domingo, III, 29 - Bavaria beer, $2.2bn . 6. Tatiana Casiraghi, 31 - Bavaria beer, $2.2bn . 7. Nathan Blecharczyk, 31 - Airbnb, $1.9bn . 8.

"The worst thing most people will get caught carrying at security is a bottle of water, but there are some passengers who attempt to sneak some dangerous and very bizarre items onto planes. The TSA (Transport Security Administration) has its own Instagram feed documenting the unusual items it confiscates from airport security checkpoints - and it certainly makes for interesting viewing. From passengers travelling with their beloved eels, to hiding knives in the most unlikely of places, the TSA shares it all with its 238,000 followers. Though potentially harmless, this toy must be checked by explosive detection professionals, the TSA says . Discovered in a carry-on bag at the Eagle County Regional Airport in Colorado, it's hard to know what this odd-looking creature is. While it might be nothing more than a homourous novelty toy, TSA agents have no way of knowing if the grenade in its hand is actually inert until explosive detection professionals have the chance to examine the item. Grenades, whether inactive or otherwise, are prohibited in any carry-on or checked luggage. Another item to leave out of your hand luggage? Seal bombs, like those discovered in a passenger's carry-on bag in Seattle's Tacoma International Airport. A seal bomb is a small explosive used to frighten seals from fishing areas, but, unfortunately, what this traveller didn't know is that all explosives are prohibited from both carry-on and checked baggage. Seal bombs, used for fishing, are prohibited from both carry-on and checked luggage . One of the oddest items that MailOnline came across while browsing the TSA Instagram was definitely a medieval mace, which was discovered in a carry-on bag at Chicago's Midway International Airport. Similarly dangerous, a pair of cat-shaped brass knuckles were seized at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. While they may look like a key chain at first glance, these feline-inspired weapons can cause serious harm and are banned from bringing on board. One of the strangest confiscated items? A medieval mace, found at Chicago's Midway International Airport . These cat-shaped brass knuckles must be checked into the hold in order to be transported . In 2012, officers seized a bag of live eels, which they found in a passenger's checked luggage in Miami . Officers received a massive shock when they discovered a bag full of live eels back in 2012. Found in a passenger's checked bag at the Miami International Airport, the traveller was attempting to transport 163 marine tropical fish and 22 invertebrates to Maracaibo, Venezuela. However, instead of arguing with security, the passenger, smartly, opted to surrender all items to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Seven small snakes were also discovered in Miami in 2011, after being stuffed down a traveller's trousers in nylon stockings. The snakes were found using TSA's Advanced Imaging Technology, which allows officers to find threatening items that have been concealed from plain sight. The passenger was later arrested and charged. And yet another animal-based smuggling attempt was made in the form of a knife concealed within a Scooby Doo greeting card, despite the fact that all knives are prohibited from carry-on bags. A Scooby Doo greeting card was used by a crafty passenger to unsuccessfully conceal a knife . Also in Miami in 2011, a passenger attempted to smuggle seven snakes, in nylon stockings, in their trousers . Swords, though fine to check, cannot be brought on board an airplane as a carry-on item . This Jack the Ripper-like sickle was seized from a passenger's bag because no blades are allowed on board . Throwing stars, which are used in martial arts, are banned in some American states but not others . Interestingly, one item travellers can bring through security: a freshly-baked pie, like this one . From swords and a Jack the Ripper-like sickle to throwing stars, all bladed objects are prohibited from carry-on bags - but that hasn't kept many passengers from attempting to transport them through the security checkpoint. But don't worry, even swords can be taken to your destination in a checked suitcase. Interestingly, however, you are allowed to bring baked goods through security, such as this pecan pie.","Transportation Security Administration posts odd findings to Instagram .

"A blood test that screens couples for thousands of genetic flaws which they could pass on to a baby is to go on sale. Couples will be told if the combination of their genes puts them at risk of having a child with an incurable disease. The compatibility test can flag up more than 600 conditions, including some that kill within the first years of life. If couples are told they are at risk of having a child whose life would be blighted by ill-health, they can decide whether to adopt, have IVF treatment or go ahead and get pregnant naturally. New test: Couples will be told if the combination of their genes puts them at risk of having a child with an incurable disease . Spanish firm iGenomix, which developed the test, says pre-pregnancy genetic screening could soon become as commonplace as ultrasound scans. The company’s test is designed to give peace of mind, but at £1,800 per couple – £900 per person – it doesn’t come cheap. Plus, there are concerns people will become stigmatised simply because they are carrying the ‘wrong genes’. Critics also say it panders to those who believe the only acceptable child is a perfect one. The NHS does pre-pregnancy testing but focuses on people with a family history of just a few conditions. The new test, which will be available at Randox Health clinics in London and Northern Ireland from May, checks for thousands of faulty pieces of DNA. Conditions include cystic fibrosis, which is carried by one in 25 Britons, as well as rarer conditions that cause blindness, blood disorders and life-threatening hormonal problems. Conditions such as autism, Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes are not included. Spanish firm iGenomix, which developed the test, says pre-pregnancy genetic screening could soon become as commonplace as ultrasound scans . The test is aimed at people who are carriers of disease genes, meaning they will not have symptoms themselves and may even be unaware of the problem lurking in their DNA. Most people have several disease genes and a recent study by iGenomix found that 8 per cent of couples were ‘clinically incompatible’, meaning both had the same faulty DNA. Such couples would be told there was a one in four chance of their child being ill and counselled on their options. These include an IVF technique, in which only healthy embryos are implanted in the womb, the use of donor eggs or sperm or adoption. Some women may opt to get pregnant naturally and abort later. Dr Peter FitzGerald, managing director of Randox Health, said: ‘Our wide-ranging new screen will detect potential problems before pregnancy by obtaining information from both parents. With this test, we can alert prospective parents to the risk of serious genetic conditions.’ There is another pre-pregnancy test available privately but it checks for only 100 diseases. Philippa Taylor, of the Christian Medical Fellowship, said the limited and expensive options available to couples who ‘fail’ the test could push them toward getting pregnant naturally – and aborting if the baby is unhealthy. She added: ‘This test is going to create further anxiety through the over-medicalisation of pregnancy.’ Dr David King, of campaign group Human Genetics Alert, warned that if testing became popular, couples could feel pressurised to use it to avoid having children with genetic conditions. He added: ‘That will lead to a society in which parents with disabled children will be blamed and disability will become less and less acceptable. We need regulation and ethical debate before such tests are introduced.’","The test is aimed at people who are carriers of disease genes .

"William Shatner has defended his decision to miss Leonard Nimoy’s funeral on Sunday and attend a charity event in Florida instead. Star Trek legend Nimoy passed away on Friday following a long battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and his funeral was held on Sunday in Los Angeles. Shatner had led tributes to the late actor saying he loved him like a 'brother', but found himself the target of a barrage of abuse over the weekend from Twitter users condemning his decision to skip his friend’s funeral. Scroll down for video . Star Trek legend William Shatner has defended himself for not attending the funeral of late co-star Leonard Nimoy after being criticized for honoring a charity commitment in Florida instead . Speaking to Inside Edition on Monday, Shatner stood by his controversial decision to honor a charity commitment he had made months ago. ‘My understanding is mourn the dead but celebrate life. I chose to celebrate life by going to the Red Cross gathering in Palm Beach, raised a lot of money for the Red Cross,’ he said. ‘In that ceremony, in that time, I asked over a thousand people to remember Leonard Nimoy and Maury Hurley, another wonderful writer and another dear friend of mine who died this week. 'And to take a moment to remember them, but also remember them by doing good deeds. And those good deeds will be remembered long after any other kind of memorial.’ Shatner’s daughters Melanie and Lisabeth attended the funeral in place of their father. Nimoy's widow Susan Bay was surrounded and comforted by friends just hours her husband was laid to rest during an intimate service on Sunday. Shatner has stood by his controversial decision to honor a charity commitment made months ago rather than attend his old friend's funeral. 'Those good deeds will be remembered long after any other kind of memorial,' he said . Embrace: Nimoy's wife Susan Bay was seen outside of the Bouchon Bistro in Beverly Hills following the 83-year-old star's funeral near their home in Bel Air on Sunday . Actress Bay was seen outside of the Bouchon Bistro in Beverly Hills following the 83-year-old star's funeral near their home in Bel Air. The 71-year-old was hugged by a close companion as they remembered her husband of 26 years, who passed away on Friday morning. Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock in the sci-fi franchise for 47 years, was reportedly buried at the Hillside Memorial Cemetery and Mortuary in Los Angeles, surrounded by close family and friends. According to reports the service was restricted to a small number of guests, including the couple's children Adam and Julie, and the star's stepson Aaron Bay Schuck. Afterwards, his family wrote a statement on Facebook saying: 'Thank you for all the love and kind words to Leonard. We lost a wonderful, talented, sweet man, a great father, husband, grandpa, and friend. Tributes: Shatner tweeted tributes to Nimoy (together, left, in 2009) as he attended an event with his wife (right) Elizabeth for the 58th International Red Cross Ball at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach . 'Lame excuse': A Twitter user condemned the decision by Mr Shatner. Others questioned why he didn't pay for a flight back from the event . 'Again thank you for all the love and good wishes. R.I.P and LLAP.' It is Jewish tradition for the dead to be buried within 24 hours of their passing. But, as the practice is forbidden on a Saturday, Nimoy was buried on Sunday. Although fans were barred from attending, they found their own ways to pay their respects. A moment of silence was held at the the Long Beach Comic Expo, a two-day comic book convention in California, with many attendees also dressed as Spock. Meanwhile, the actor's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was adorned with flowers, photographs and tribute messages. Shanter revealed on Saturday that he would not be able to make it back for the service. In the post, the 83-year-old Canadian actor wrote: 'I am currently in FL [Florida] as I agreed to appear at the Red Cross Ball tonight. Leonard's funeral is tomorrow. I can't make it back in time. 'I feel really awful. Here I am doing charity work and one of my dearest friends is being buried.' When he revealed he was in Florida attending the Red Cross Ball and couldn't make it back in time, one of his followers said: 'Lame excuse. Man up.' Social media users demanded to know why Shatner did not pay $30,000 to fly back from Palm Beach to LA immediately after the Red Cross event on Saturday night. Relationship: The couple were married for 26 years. The actress and Mr Nimoy's son Adam announced his death on Friday . Defence: Shatner responded to comments condemning his decision, saying he was honoring a commitment he had made months ago, adding that his daughters Melanie and Lisabeth will be there . 'Priceline? Do Red Cross event and then private jet to LA,' wrote Todd Schnitt, a host of a morning talk show on WOR AM 710. Another said: 'Why not fly back right after?' Answering one post addressed at him, he said: 'Walking out on a major fundraiser wouldn't have you calling me a jerk for leaving a charity high & dry? Hmm?' In response to people who expressed anger toward him for not flying to Los Angeles, the actor wrote: 'One of the other misconceptions seems to be that folks think flights to LAX occur all night long.' He then used the social media platform to share his memories of Nimoy and answer questions from his followers about the late actor using the hashtag '#leonardnimoy.' 'I do want to thank everyone for coming here and sharing their memories and celebrating the life of LLAP! MBB,' he tweeted.

"An Islamic extremist was paraded in court today after an American blogger was hacked to death with a machete in the middle of the street in Bangladesh. Farabi Shafiur Rahman wore a stern look and stared straight ahead as he was escorted through the street by police officers in the capital Dhaka today. The fundamentalist blogger was arrested after at least two men killed Avijit Roy on his way back from a book fair, apparently targeting him because of his opposition to religious extremism. Rahman was remanded in custody for ten days for questioning. The U.S. is sending a team of federal investigators to Bangladesh to help probe the murder of the author of bestseller The Virus of Faith, who was visiting the city where he was born. Scroll down for video . WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Paraded: Suspect Farabi Shafiur Rahman was escorted into court by police in Bangladesh today . Murder: Islamic fundamentalist Rahman had previously sent death threats to Avijit Roy, it was reported . Assistance: Police have ten days to question Rahman and will be joined by FBI investigators from the U.S. The 43-year-old's family has accused Bangladeshi authorities of failing to do enough to protect him after he received death threats for his anti-religious writing. A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) team will arrive in Dhaka later this week, Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Monirul Islam said. 'He has confessed that he threatened Avijit Roy... Intense interrogation of Farabi could lead to important clues,' the police spokesman added. 'Initial information indicates this was done by extremist religious group.' Roy, the founder of the Mukto-Mona (free mind) blog, was born in Bangladesh to a family of scholars but moved to Atlanta, Georgia, around 15 years ago. He and his blogger wife Rafida Ahmed, who was also badly injured in the attack, were hauled off their rickshaw by two assailants in the attack. He was on his way back from a university book fair in Bangladesh when he was targeted on Thursday by at least two men over his opposition to religious extremism. They sliced his head with the long blades before turning on his wife, Rafida Ahmed, and cutting her finger off when she tried to save him. Islamic extremist Farabi Shafiur Rahman (centre) has been arrested and paraded before the media after last week's murder of American blogger Avijit Roy. Mr Roy was hacked to death with a machete in the middle of the street on Thursday . Mr Roy with his wife Rafida Ahmed on holiday together at the Grand Canyon. She remains in hospital in a serious condition after she suffered head injuries and lost a finger in the attack . A source in the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) said that an elite force had seen correspondence between former physics student Farabi and another person about killing Mr Roy. Mufti Mahmud, a spokesman for the RAB, said: 'On different occasions, he exchanged [Roy’s] location, his identity and his family’s photographs with various people. 'He wrote: ""Avijit Roy lives in America. So it’s not possible to kill him at this moment. But when he’ll return to the country, he’ll be murdered.""' Police added that Mr Roy's family had been threatened by the extremist, who is known for his Facebook postings against atheist writers, on several occasions on Facebook and Twitter. Farabi posted on Facebook last year: 'It's a holy duty of Bangalee Muslims to kill Avijit.' Major Maksudul Alam, another spokesman, said: 'He is the main suspect. [Roy’s] family told us that he got threats from Farabi several times. Commander Mufti Mahmud Khan added: 'Farabi has admitted that he threatened Avijit but we are not sharing more information with you for the sake of the investigation. We need to ask him more.' Farabi was previously arrested over the murder of another blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haide, in February 2013 but was released on bail. The arrest came a day after hundreds of mourners gathered around the blogger's coffin near Dhaka University to pay their respects. Ms Ahmed remained in hospital in a serious condition. Shahriar Kabir, a writer, said at the memorial: 'Free thinking in Bangladesh is become a great danger, all the free thinkers are at great risk. The scene immediately following the attack on the couple shows Ms Ahmed covered in blood. An obscure militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack it said was in retaliation for his 'crime against Islam' Ms Ahmed lying on a stretcher after the brutal attack. She is still recovering in hospital . A source in the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) said the elite force had seen correspondence between Farabi (centre) and another person about killing Mr Roy . A RAB spokesman confirmed that Farabi (centre) is the main suspect and said that Mr Roy's family had been threatened by the extremist on several occasions . Mr Roy's family said Islamist radicals, like Farabi (centre), had threatened him over his blog, 'Mukto-mona,' or 'Freemind,' that highlighted humanist and rationalist ideas and condemned religious extremism . 'We want to know why the government failed to ensure the safety of him, despite knowing that he had been facing threats from the Islamist radicals.' As Mr Roy's father stood by, Kamal Hossain, the architect of Bangladesh's secular constitution, called the killing 'a heinous murder'. 'My question is, why did it take place?' said Mr Hossain. 'Avijit was killed because of his writing. By killing him, the killers have torn apart our constitution.' People also held a demonstration at the spot where he was killed and chanted slogans demanding 'immediate arrest and quick trial of the perpetrator'. The murder of Mr Roy, an atheist who advocated secularism in Bangladesh, came amid a crackdown on the country's Islamist groups after they increased their activities in recent years. Friends and relatives of Mr Roy sob as mourners came to pay respects to the writer on Sunday, whose murder came amid a crackdown on Bangladesh's resurgent Islamist groups . Mr Roy's father Ajoy Roy, seated right, is comforted by fellow mourners at his son's funeral on Sunday . The naturalised U.S. citizen, who was a bio-engineer as well as a blogger, had been receiving death threats online for years. Mr Roy and his wife have a daughter at university in the US. Ajoy Roy stood alongside his son's coffin as mourners filed past. He reiterated that Islamist militants were responsible for his son's death, but also blamed the government for failing to protect him despite repeated threats on his life. 'I am speechless at this moment of mourning. When the fundamentalists threatened, I informed the Inspector General of Police and Deputy Inspector General of Police,' he said. 'This murder has proved their utter failure.' An obscure militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said was in retaliation for his 'crime against Islam'. The extremists also said he was singled out because he is a U.S. citizen - and characterized the vicious killing as 'revenge' for attacks on ISIS in Syria. Orange and red flowers are laid on the coffin of Mr Roy as hundreds gather to pay their respects . Police have expressed shock that extremists struck at a university book fair, which was heavily guarded. Witnesses have even said officers and bystanders were there during the murder - but did nothing. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called it 'a shocking act of violence' that was 'horrific in its brutality and cowardice'. Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of free speech campaign group Index on Censorship said: 'Our sympathies are with the family of Avijit Roy. 'Roy was targeted simply for expressing his own beliefs and we are appalled by his death and condemn all such killings.' Mr Roy was a family man and is pictured above with his wife in a photo believed to show their daughter, right, a student at a US college . In 2013, religious extremists targeted several secular bloggers who had demanded capital punishment for Islamist leaders convicted of war crimes during Bangladesh's war for independence. Blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider was killed that year in a similar attack near his home in Dhaka after he led one such protest demanding capital punishment. In 2004, Humayun Azad, a secular writer and professor at Dhaka University, was also attacked by militants while returning home from a Dhaka book fair. He later died in Germany while undergoing treatment. Media group Reporters Without Borders rated Bangladesh 146th among 180 countries in a ranking of press freedom last year.","Farabi Shafiur Rahman appeared in court today in Dhaka, Bangladesh .

"A wartime airman’s poignant gift to his fallen RAF comrades has prompted an ‘overwhelming’ public response to ensure they are never forgotten. Squadron Leader Les Munro, now the only surviving pilot of the legendary Dambusters raid, is to auction his gallantry  medals to help pay for the upkeep of Britain’s recently built memorial to the 55,573 airmen killed in the war . Yesterday after the Daily Mail reported the 95-year-old ex-pilot’s gesture, a wave of tributes and offers of donations swept social media and the RAF Benevolent Fund, which is responsible for the £50,000-a-year upkeep of the memorial in London’s Green Park. Donation: Squadron Leader Les Munro, 95, pictured, who is the last surviving Dambusters commander, hopes to raise £50,000 for the Bomber Command Memorial in London by selling his war medals . Comrades: Les Munro (centre at front) with his crew in front of the Lancaster Bomber he flew on the raid that smashed two dams . Now the Fund is starting a formal book of gratitude for Sqdrn Ldr Munro and opening an online facility for people to donate in his name. Director Mike Neville said: ‘The public response to Les Munro’s incredibly generous donation of his medals and log books has been overwhelming. 'We’ve been really impressed with the public support generated by the coverage, in particular an incredible response on social media. People who have been touched by Les’s generosity can now leave a message of thanks for him or make a donation towards the memorial.’ Yesterday the New Zealand born flyer, now the only surviving pilot of the 1943 Dambusters raid, revealed he was inspired to make the medal gesture after being moved by a visit to the memorial. Up for auction: Les Munro will sell his medal for New Zealand Order of Merit, above and, pictured left to right his medals for Distinguished Service Order, New Zealand Queen's Service Order, Distinguished Flying Cross, 1939-45 Star; Air Crew Europe Star with clasp France and Germany, Italy Star; Defence and War Medals 1939-45, New Zealand Service Medal 1939-45, and the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal . Service: Les Munro leaning out of the cockpit of his Lancaster Bomber , which he flew on the Dambusters raid.

Remembered: The Bomber Command Memorial is dedicated to the 55,573 airmen and ground staff killed during the Second World War. It costs £50,000 a year to maintain, and Les Munro wants to help pay for it .

Old friends: Les Munro (left) shares a joke with Wing Commander Leonard Cheshire VC, who took over as 617 Squadron commander, at a 1986 reunion in New Zealand . He said he wanted to do so ‘out of comradeship’ for the airmen who never came home. He added it was a ‘travesty’ that the ‘magnificent memorial’ – dedicated to British and Commonwealth airmen and ground crew after a campaign led by the Daily Mail and others – was not unveiled until 2012, more than 67 years after the war ended. Among the tributes on Facebook in the wake of his selfless pledge were comments from both sides of the world. 'Hero for his actions in the war, hero for wanting to keep the memories of his comrades alive...,' one person wrote. Another added: 'A real hero who fought for our freedom. X' Mark Gillespie wrote: 'What a top bloke!' Facebook user Mike Davies posted: 'Great respect to you Sir.' The medals, which include a Distinguished Service Order and Distinguished Flying Cross, are expected to fetch around £50,000 when they are sold with his flying logs and other memorabilia on March 25 in London.

"Former  Red Sox and  Phillies player Curt Schilling on Tuesday explained why he had exposed cyber bullies who posted sexually-explicit comments about his daughter on Twitter. The 48-year-old ESPN analyst told GMA that the vile tweets about 17-year-old Gabby were 'a conscious decision to say evil stuff'. The baseball legend had shared a proud tweet last week about his only daughter joining as a pitcher for Salve Regina University's softball team - but it was met with crude, sexual remarks. Schilling named two of the culprits including Adam Nagel, a student and DJ at Brookdale Community College in New Jersey, who since has been suspended from school and faces a conduct hearing, according to Boston.com.

The second troll that Schilling named is Sean MacDonald, a part-time, ticket-seller for the New York Yankees and former vice president of the Theta Xi fraternity at Montclair State University, who recently graduated from the school. He was fired from his job with the Yankees, which he held since January, according to NJ.com.

Schilling wrote a blog post commenting on the astounding ignorance and lack of morals following the incident, and also shared the vile tweets by the trolls. He said on Tuesday: 'I'll do everything not to embarrass her but I'll never not protect her.' His daughter Gabby, who appeared with her father in the interview, added: 'No one should be able to get away with saying those things to a father about his daughter.' In what was meant to be an incredibly proud day for the family, quickly went sour on February 25 with vile responses to the baseball legend's original tweet. Schilling wrote on his blog post: 'And tweets with the word rape, bloody underwear and pretty much every other vulgar and defiling word you could likely fathom began to follow.' Mr Schilling told GMA on Tuesday: 'Anybody that reads those tweets and says it's just a joke, they are not fathers of kids.' He continued: 'I grew up in a locker room and never in my life have I uttered the words these guys were using.' MacDonald who went by Twitter handle @primetime227 along with Nagel, user @Nagels_Bagels, were among those who shared offensive tweets.

The school, said: '[The Twitter comments] clearly violate the standards of conduct that are expected of all Brookdale students. 'The student has been summarily suspended and will be scheduled for a conduct hearing where further disciplinary action will be taken. The Brookdale Police are actively investigating this matter.'

'I know every one of their names, their parents, where they go to school, what they do, what team they are on, their positions, stats, all of it.' He said that the guys behind the bullying are not thugs or 'kids who had it rough', but they are 'pretty much' all white, affluent, college-attending children. Following the incident, he said a few of the other trolls wrote to him apologizing after they were suspended from their college sports' teams, and two others have since deleted their Twitter accounts. One Twitter user, Mike Kelly from Utah, wrote to Schilling asking if he felt good to have gotten kids 'kicked off' their sports teams. Schilling responded: 'Not sure I can tell you how good. Being able to defend my daughter. Someday when you understand honor, integrity, you'll get it.' In his protective-father mode, he also wrote as a reminder to those who went after his daughter that 'the real world has consequences' and that 'we're at a point now where you better be sure who you're going after'.

"London Mayor Boris Johnson has hit out at the 'human rights' group who claimed Britain was to blame for Jihadi John's murderous actions. He tore into controversial campaigner Asim Qureshi today branding suggestions UK authorities caused the ISIS killer's radicalisation '100% the wrong way up'. The outspoken mayor then added: 'If you're a human rights group then you should be sticking up for the human rights of those who are being beheaded in Syria and northern Iraq.' Scroll down for video . London mayor Boris Johnson today hit back at the group who have blamed the radicalisation of Jihadi John on British security services . Mr Johnson (left) slammed prisoners' rights group Cage after the group's leader Asim Qureshi (right) called into his radio show and claimed security services may have made Jihadi John feel unwelcome in the UK . Prisoners rights group Cage held a press conference in which they called Mohammed Emwazi - unmasked as Jihadi John last week - 'a beautiful man' who was 'harassed' by British security services. After widespread condemnation of the group and their comments, the London Mayor took on Qureshi, the group's leader, today. Qureshi called into Mr Johnson's radio show on London's LBC radio this morning, claiming his defence of Emwazi had been 'unfairly represented'. But Mr Johnson refused to go back on his previous criticism of the group and slammed Mr Qureshi's claims. The Tory mayor said: 'I really, really think that the focus of your indignation and outrage should be at people who go out and join groups that throw gays off cliffs, that behead people who don't subscribe to their version of Islam, that glorify in the execution of innocent journalists and aid workers. 'They should be the object of your wrath, not the security services who are trying to keep us safe.' Families of the victims of ISIS killer Jihadi John (pictured) - unmasked last week as west Londoner Mohammed Emwazi - have also slammed Cage's comments, branding Emwazi 'a monster' Mr Johnson said the group's claims sent out the completely wrong message, adding: 'If you're going to have an impact on the lives of young Muslims you have to focus on what these people are doing wrong and not instantly scatter blame around.' But Mr Kureshi refused to change his line and replied: 'What we want is to understand whether or not, the security agencies, their actions led to [Emwasi] feeling that he did not belong to UK society.' Mr Johnson, who looked furious on a video of the broadcast filmed in the studio, replied: 'I just feel that you've got it 100% the wrong way up. You need to see this thing differently. 'The security services are trying to keep is safe. They cannot conceivably be blamed for their actions trying to prevent people from committing such atrocities.' Qureshi's group press conference last week was broadcast live for 52 minutes on the BBC and 58 on Sky News, with Qureshi speaking uninterrupted for 18 minutes. Mr Johnson is the latest politician to hit out at the perceived apologists for ISIS killers. In a statement to the Commons yesterday, Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘I condemn anyone who attempts to excuse that barbarism in the way that has been done by Cage.’ The row came after a shocking press conference last week, at which Cage said Jihadi John was 'beautiful' And Jacqui Smith, a Labour former Home Secretary, added: ‘We can – and should – dismiss the outrageous apologists of Cage who claimed that Emwazi was just a good lad radicalised by the actions of western authorities.’ Families of the victim's of Jihadi John's killing spree have also attacked Cage's defence of the murderer. Reg Henning, brother of British aid worker Alan Henning who died at the ISIS executioner's hands, said: 'If he's a ""beautiful, kind man"", why is he killing innocent civilians? 'He's a monster. Everyone should be doing everything they can to capture him and bring him to justice - not stick up for him like he's been hard done by.' Qureshi previously urged protestors at a protest outside the US embassy to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya'. Speaking through a microphone at the 2006 pan-Islamic Hizb ut-Tahrir movement rally, he said: 'When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies. Cage's comments last week has sparked a charity commission investigation into organisations, including the Joseph Rowntree trust and Body Shop founder Anita Roddick's Roddick Foundation, who fund the group. Qureshi appeared at a protest in 2006 at which he said Muslims were being oppressed by the West and called for support for jihad, shouting: 'Allahu Akhbar! Allahu Akhbar!'","'Human rights' group  sparked outrage claiming ISIS killer was 'beautiful'

"The trailer for Lena Dunham's new documentary about Hilary Knight, the artist who illustrated the famed Eloise children's books, has been unveiled, five weeks after it was screened at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. The 36-minute HBO film, which profiles the esteemed 88-year-old New Yorker and his storied career, first came about in 2013 after Mr Knight heard that Miss Dunham, 28, had a tattoo of Eloise on her back, and wrote to the Girls creator to initiate contact. Miss Dunham, who made It's Me, Hilary: The Man Who Drew Eloise with her Girls co-producer Jenni Konner, has long cherished the popular book series, written in the 50s by author Kay Thompson and chronicling the misadventures of a precocious six-year-old girl who lives in New York's Plaza Hotel.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, the famed illustrator said of Miss Dunham: 'It was as though I had known her all my life. We totally bonded.' Miss Dunham admits she closely relates to the fictional character Mr Knight brought to life all those years ago. 'Eloise is the p****d off little riot girl in all of us,' she says fondly, while the film's director Matt Wolfe describes Eloise as 'a punky feminist icon from the 50s, drawn by a man in his mid-twenties '.

According to the film's synopsis, Mr Knight is 'as remarkable a character' as Eloise herself. 'Temperamental, flamboyant, on the one hand fiercely private and on the other desperate to make his legacy known', it states.

Mr Knight wrote to Miss Dunham about her Eloise tattoo in February 2013. His later stated: 'First, I must say how pleased I am for you and all your awards and new plans. 'To know a smart, sassy fan who definitely understands this child is a thrill for me.' The tattoo in question was Miss Dunham's very first inking, which she had done in a New Mexico strip mall when she was 17. 'That was my first tattoo because it felt like the only thing that I knew I would never get sick of,' she told The New York Daily News last month at the film's Sundance premiere.

"Ed Miliband has vowed to adopt a ‘Turing’s law’ to allow the pardoning of tens of thousands of men convicted of gay sex when it was illegal. Alan Turing, the Second World War codebreaker, was convicted of homosexual activity in 1952 but given a posthumous royal pardon 15 months ago. Since then his relatives have campaigned for the 49,000 men convicted under gross indecency laws to be similarly pardoned. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband has vowed to introduce a new 'Turing's Law' pardoning men convicted of historic gay sex 'offences' like the World War Two hero Alan Turing . Under a law passed by the coalition government, anyone still alive who has a conviction or caution for consensual gay sex can apply to the Home Office to have the offences removed from their records. Mr Miliband has said he will extend this to the families and friends of gay men who received convictions in their lifetime but died before they could apply to have the records changed. The Labour leader told Gay Times that, if elected Prime Minister in May, he would make the matter a priority. The campaign to parden gay men convicted of 'gross indecency' has been backed by celebrities including Hollywood star Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Mr Turing in the Oscar-winning drama The Imitation Game . He said: ‘I think it’s worth saying that we do want to extend the principles being applied to Alan Turing and his family, to be able to say to others who were convicted of a criminal offence simply because of the person that they loved – whether they are alive or no longer alive – that we can get a pardon for them. ‘I think it’s a stain on our society, frankly. I think it’s right what’s been done in relation to Alan Turing and his family, but there are also other families that will have had relatives who were convicted, as I say, simply because of the person they love. 'And I think it’s time we acted for them, too. I think we owe it to the LGBT [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender] community to make this move.’ Turing died after eating an apple laced with cyanide . On 8 June 1954, Turing's cleaner found him dead. A post-mortem examination established the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June. Several scholars, and even his family, have suggested Turing's death was not suicide - and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy. When his body was discovered, an apple laid half-eaten next to his bed. It was never tested for cyanide but it is speculated it was the source of the fatal does. Some more peculiar theories suggest Turing was 'obsessed' with fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story. The theory was supported in an article in The Guardian written by Turing's friend, the author Alan Garner, in 2011. However, later evidence suggested that Turing habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten. His mother is said to have thought the ingestion was accidental, cause by her son's storage of chemicals in his home. Speaking on the 100th anniversary of Alan Turing's birth on 23rd June 2012, Professor of Philosophy Jack Copeland, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, questioned the evidence given to the inquiry in 1954. He said there was no evidence of premeditation - there was no suicide note and he seemed to be in a cheerful mood in the days leading up to his death. He added that Turing's career was at an all time high and that he would not want to intentionally kill himself. He pointer out that his friend Robin Gandy stayed with Turing a week before his death and he remarked how happy Turing seemed . Finally, the academic remarked that the inquest was so bad that Turing could even have been murdered. Although it is is unclear who would have wanted to murder him Mr Copeland said his work at Bletchly Park was under strict secrecy until well after his death. Last week relatives of the mathematician and codebreaker delivered a petition to Downing Street calling for all those convicted under anti-gay laws to be pardoned. Celebrities including Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-winning film The Imitation Game, have also backed the campaign. During the Second World War, Turing was pivotal in cracking the German Enigma codes, which gave vital information about Hitler’s forces. Historians credit the work of Turing and his fellow codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire with shortening the war by up to two years, saving countless lives. Turing is also widely seen as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. But in 1952 he was convicted for homosexual activity, which was illegal at the time, after having an affair with a 19-year-old man in Manchester. Turing underwent ‘chemical castration’ as part of his sentence and his conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for GCHQ. He died two years later, aged 41, having apparently committed suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide. In 2013 Turing was granted a royal pardon after a request from Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Cumberbatch said: ‘Alan Turing was not only prosecuted, but quite arguably persuaded to end his own life early, by a society who called him a criminal for simply seeking out the love he deserved, as all human beings do.’","Relatives of gay WW2 codebreaker Alan Turing petitioned  Downing Street .

"When astronomers first started taking ultraviolet images of Venus, they were somewhat baffled by a mysterious ‘Y’ shape that covered the entire planet. But now researchers say they have an answer - high intensity winds are distorting a ‘wave’ of clouds to produce a stretched effect. The discovery could also reveal how similar processes take place on other slow-rotating bodies in the solar system. Scroll down for a video animation showing the effect . Spanish astronomers have revealed a new theory for a 'Y' shape on Venus (annotated image from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter in 1979 shown). They say it is formed by winds pushing a 'wave' of clouds on the planet. These winds move faster at higher altitudes, creating the odd shape . The latest theory was proposed by astronomers from the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC) in Granada, Spain, in collaboration with the university of the Basque Country and the Institute of Astrophysics and Space Sciences of Portugal. Venus is slightly smaller than Earth but has a similar mass. It is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million kilometres), and takes about 225 days to orbit the sun. One day on Venus lasts as long as 243 Earth days. Its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets. It's believed that its atmosphere contributed to a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet inhospitable. The planet's extreme high temperatures of almost 480°C (900°F) make it seem an unlikely place for for life as we know it. On Venus strong winds move the upper atmosphere 225 mph (360km/h), circling the planet every four to five Earth days. But the planet itself takes almost 243 Earth days to complete an orbit - meaning the winds are much faster than the rotation speed of the planet. The winds have a mostly constant speed at different latitude, but nearer the pole they circle the planet quicker as the circumference of the planet is smaller. This ultimately gives rise to this ‘Y’ shape, as the clouds at the top and bottom of the shape are moved more quickly. 'This [atmospheric] wave is dragged by the winds of Venus, so if they are constant the wave should round the planet without getting deformed, right?' Dr Javier Peralta, the IAA-CSIC researcher in charge of this study, told MailOnline. 'But we must consider that these waves propagate over a ""sphere"", and ""circles"" completed both at the equator and at 40ºN have a different radius (the higher latitude, the smaller the parallels or circles are). 'So, having the same velocity than that at the equator, anything moving horizontally at 40º will complete the longitude of the circle sooner that when doing the same at the equator. 'This is why the wave gets deformed. The area of the wave at higher latitudes complete circles quicker than at the equator.' Winds on Venus can circle the planet in four to five Earth days. But the planet takes 243 Earth days to rotate, amplifying the Y shape. The effect is also amplified by the winds moving round the planet quicker nearer the poles (Marine 10 image from 1974 shown left). An illustration of the surface of Venus is shown on the right . He added that the idea was not entirely new - but his theory was the first that explained a new type of atmospheric wave, different to anything seen on Earth. Using the new type of wave, he said they could predict the vertical structure of the Y feature, and show that it was trapped about the altitude where the winds are strongest. The shape is defined with dark regions, produced by an unknown compound that absorbs ultraviolet radiation. The wave seems to be 'pushing up' this ultraviolet absorber from below on Venus - although what this substance is, which gives the feature its dark appearance, remains a mystery. 'It has been a mystery for decades. Nobody knows for sure,' added Dr Peralta. 'Many candidates have been proposed: hydrobromic acid, amorphous sulfur, disulphur monoxide or even living sources such as bacteria.' The strange shape on Venus was first spotted by Nasa's Mariner 10 spacecraft when it arrived at Venus in 1974. An illustration of the spacecraft is shown here. The new theory could have important implications for other slowly rotating bodies in the solar system . As the clouds are pushed through the atmosphere, those either side are dragged behind, giving the whole planet a ‘stretched’ appearance when viewed in ultraviolet wavelengths. When viewed in visible light, the planet simply appears bright yellow or white - as the high amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reflect a lot of sunlight. The astronomers have also, for the first time, created a simulation that reproduces the evolution of the shape over the course of a month. Understanding the shape will allow astronomers to study the ‘super-rotating’ nature of the Venusian atmosphere. ‘A wave with the size of the Y must play a key role in explaining why the atmosphere rotates sixty times faster than the surface, so it was crucial to understand it,’ said Dr Peralta in a release.","Spanish astronomers have revealed a new theory for a 'Y' shape on Venus .

"New figures show childhood obesity rates double while children are at primary school, with one in five leaving primary school obese . One in 10 children are obese when they start primary school at the age of four, shocking new figures have revealed. And in the space of five years, childhood obesity rates double, with one in five children leaving primary school obese. Experts today warned that not enough is being done in schools to tackle the childhood obesity epidemic, urging the Government to increase compulsory physical activity levels. The new figures, published today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, show 9.5 per cent of reception class children, aged four to five, were obese in 2013-14. It marks a slight rise from 9.3 per cent the previous year, but is lower than in 2006-07, when 9.9 per cent of the age group were obese. In Year 6, the proportion of 10 to 11-year-olds who were obese was 19.1 per cent in 2013-14, up from 18.9 per cent the previous year, and also a rise from 17.5 per cent in 2006-07. Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said while the 'adult population seems to be getting the message', with rates remaining largely constant in men and women, childhood obesity is the 'real concern'. He told MailOnline: 'The huge doubling between children aged four and 11 is particularly disastrous.' Mr Fry warned by the time children reach 11 it is 'recognised they have more or less made up their minds about their lifestyle'. 'Those 11-year-olds are probably going to end up as obese adults,' he said. 'It means every year there will be more and more obese adults adding to these statistics.' He said in Scotland the NHS has been forced to re-evaluate its obesity forecast figures, predicting that 50 per cent of the nation will be obese by 2030 - 20 years earlier than previously estimated. 'We used to think we'd be retired and buried by 2050,' he said. 'But 2030 is a whole generation earlier.' While acknowledging the forecast is currently only specific to Scotland, Mr Fry said it is a concerning trend. Mr Fry, who is also chair of the Child Growth Foundation, told MailOnline the blame for spiralling primary school obesity rates, in part, lies with a failed education programme. He said the current scheme, introduced by Labour and pursued by the Coalition Government, 'isn't working'. 'One of the reasons for these high rates of obesity by the time a child is 11 is a lack of physical education,' Mr Fry told MailOnline. 'Children are just not getting enough exercise.' He rejected the tendency of politicians to lay blame solely at the door of parents, noting the period where child obesity rates rise is when they are in primary school - and so spending the majority of their time away from home. And he warned an added concern is not knowing how children are spending their pocket money at corner shops and on their way home. Experts say the exercise programme in schools 'isn't working' and today called for the Government to introduce more PE lessons into the curriculum (file picture posed by models) 'If only schools were to have proper physical activity, these numbers would reduce significantly' Mr Fry said. 'There must be an absolute requirement to bring physical education back into mainstream school activity. 'Parental responsibility is always the quick response from Government. 'But in fact once a child goes to school they are outside parental responsibility for a great amount of the day. The PE and Sport Survey, conducted in 2009-10, found 55 per cent of pupils in years one to 13 participated in at least three hours of high-quality PE and out-of-hours school sport each week. Sixty-four per cent of pupils in primary schools reached that level of exercise each week. The guidelines, introduced in 2011, state children aged five to 18 should be at least moderately active for at least an hour every day. Sixty minutes is, however, just a minimum and children and young people should in fact be active for several hours each day. For the first time in 2011, the chief medical officers in the UK published guidelines for children under the age of five. Those able to walk unaided should be active for at least three hours a day, spread throughout the day. Source: HSCIC . 'Schools should take over that responsibility both in terms of teaching the child, and their wellbeing and welfare, but that is plainly not happening. 'The Government has really got to up the focus on physical activity for children at school and in pre-school.' But action to tackle childhood obesity rates cannot stop there, Mr Fry argued. He said in light of statistics revealed at the weekend, that show hundreds of babies born each year are classified as obese, the focus must also be on informing women of the dangers of being overweight or obese at conception. 'Making sure females of child bearing age understand their responsibilities to the next generation is vital. 'If a woman is overweight or obese at conception, it is most likely her baby will be obese from the moment it is born.' He added: 'There is a huge amount of work to be done.' Today's figures do reveal childhood obesity has fallen from its peak of 19 per cent in 2004 and 2005. The HSCIC said the latest data is 'not statistically significantly different from those over the last three or four years'. Eustace de Sousa, national lead for children, young people and families at Public Health England, said: 'Overall childhood obesity rates have remained stable since 2010, however for children from the poorest households levels have continued to worsen so there is no room for complacency. 'We know that almost one in 10 four to five year olds are obese (9.5 per cent) and by age 10-11 this doubles to nearly one in five (19.1 per cent). 'Obese children are more likely to experience bullying, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression and have a higher risk of becoming obese adults and developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease as a result.'","10% of children start primary school obese, new figures show today .

"Jihadi John's father has disowned his terrorist son in an emotional outburst, calling him 'a dog, an animal and a terrorist'. Jaseem Emwazi blasted his killer son Mohammed - who was last week revealed as the notorious Islamic State executioner - and said: 'To hell with my son'. In an phone call to a colleague yesterday, Jaseem is said to have broken down in tears and confessed he was 'ashamed' of his son. Scroll down for video . Ashamed: Jaseem Emwazi (left), father of Jihadi John, described his killer son as 'a dog, an animal'. Mohammed Emwazi, is seen right in a 1996 school photograph . Abu Meshaal, 40, who works with Jaseem in a supermarket depot in rural Kuwait, told the Telegraph that Mr Emwazi disowned his son when he telephoned his family to tell them he was fleeing to Syria in 2013 and to beg for their forgiveness. Mr Meshaal revealed: 'Mohammed called his father and said 'I'm going to Syria to fight jihad, please release me and forgive me for everything'. Jassem said, 'F*** you. I hope you die before you arrive in Syria'.' Jaseem is said to be too ashamed to return to his job as a storekeeper after his son's identity was revealed last week. He appeared drawn but did not display any signs of emotions when he visited his lawyer in Kuwait today, the BBC reported. His lawyer said he was in a 'state of shock' after being questioned by the Kuwaiti authorities about his son's actions. A second colleague - who spoke anonymously to Kuwait's Qabbas newspaper - said: 'All I know is that he was talking about his son whose behaviour he was not able to control. He was so tired and kept on repeating that my son is not a good son.' Other appalled relatives of Emwazi condemned his actions and said they would welcome his death. A Kuwaiti cousin, who would not give his name, said: 'We hate him. We hope he will be killed soon. This will be good news for our family.' Jaseem was a member of the 'Bidoun' group of stateless people denied citizenship by countries in the Gulf. He worked as a police officer in Kuwait until he found his loyalties questioned after Saddam Hussein's 1990-1 invasion of the Gulf State because his family was originally from Iraq. His family was reportedly accused of collaborating with the Iraqi army during the seven-month occupation. Mr Emwazi took his wife and his children to live in London in 1993.He was awarded British nationality in 2002 and returned to Kuwait the next year, the Arab Times reported today. Evil: Mohammed Emwazi (left) was last week unmasked as Jihadi John (right), the killer who carried out a series of beheadings of Western hostages in violent videos . It is not known when he settled in his native country, and he is thought to have regularly travelled back and forth between the UK and Kuwait. Local sources say he has been living and working in Kuwait for at least two years. MailOnline today visited a house in the dusty Kuwaiti suburb of Al-Ayoun said to be linked to the Emwazis. But a Kuwaiti woman who answered the door said she had never heard of the family and insisted she had lived there for many years. Meanwhile, it was also revealed today that Jihadi John is understood to have taken a bride in Syria after becoming Islamic State's most feared executioner. A family friend said the masked butcher is believed to have married since joining the terror group in 2013. It is unclear whether the British intelligence services are aware who his bride is. But once she is identified, security chiefs will be desperate to investigate her and her family's background for clues that could help them locate the feared terrorist. Married: A recent film is believed to show Emwazi shortly after he arrived in Syria in 2013. It is now understood he married whilst in the war-torn country . Emwazi, from Queen's Park, north-west London, was born in Kuwait in 1988 but moved to Britain with his parents and younger siblings in 1993 after the Gulf War. He went to school and university in the UK before returning to Kuwait to work in 2009. While living in the Gulf State, he became engaged to a local woman and found a job as a salesman for a computer software company. Emwazi was banned from re-entering Kuwait in May 2010 after the British authorities raised concerns about his links to extremism. He claimed this cost him his job and his fiancée in the Gulf State. A family friend said Emwazi was thought to have married after joining IS in Syria. 'I heard from a few friends that he had gone to fight, and when I asked a family member about it, she said, 'Oh he's moved to Syria to work and has gotten married',' he told The Times. Killer: A man thought to be Jihadi John proclaims allegiance to a terror group in footage filmed in 2013. The video is thought to be the first known appearance by the executioner now unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi . A video emerged this week which is believed to show Emwazi ranting on camera shortly after he arrived in Syria from the UK. The footage is of two bands of fanatical fighters joining forces in 2013 under the command of notorious terrorist Omar al-Shishani. At the front stands a man thought to be Emwazi - the west Londoner last week unmasked as the killer of Western hostages in a series of videos which have shocked the world. New tapes also revealed today that the killer told MI5 he was a 'moderate Muslim' as he desperately tried explain why he had been picked up in terror-plagued east Africa. Cage, the campaign group criticised for blaming the ISIS killer's actions on Britain, released a recording of a 2009 interview they carried out with Emwazi. Home: The Emwazi family have left their house in north London and are believed to have been living in Kuwait for the last two years . In the recording, Emwazi tells how he was questioned by British security services after he was flown home from Tanzania suspected of trying to join Somali terror group al-Shabaab. The ISIS killer complained that he was being 'threatened' by MI5 and moaned that agents were 'putting words in his mouth'. But just three years after claiming he harboured no extremist tendencies, Emwazi appeared in Syria beheading Western hostages in violent Islamic State videos.","Ashamed father of Mohammed Emwazi disowns son in emotional outburst .

"A couple are being forced to shut their upmarket fireplace shop because of the sound of noisy swingers upstairs. Matthew and Cheryl Jewell have had enough of 'embarrassing' noises coming from the sex club above their Stovestore business in Chorley, Lancashire. Despite their attempts to drown out the sounds, they claim customers are being driven away by the noises, which start around lunchtime. Matthew and Cheryl Jewell (pictured) claim it is 'embarrassing' when customers in their shop can hear screaming from upstairs . Mrs Jewell said: 'Customers are stood here and they're screaming upstairs. I'm going red, customers are going red and they're leaving the shop. 'We've spent thousands of pounds here and we're going to have to leave. We have so many customers that return to us here.' Despite their protestations, a representative of the No 3 swingers club, which has been open for two years, claims they are doing nothing wrong. No 3 Club owner, who said she only wanted to known as Mary, said she had suggested soundproofing, and had changed a day the club opened so it did not conflict with when the Stovestore was open. She said: 'I've done everything I possibly can. I don't want them to move. I don't think they like my type of business. They knew what it was before they moved in. 'I'm very disappointed and quite upset they're moving. I'll be sorry. I don't want to interfere with anybody else's business.' Problems began for Mr and Mrs Jewell when the No 3 Club expanded its opening hours into the working day, as well as its late night and early hours opening. 'It's more frequent now, they're open from 1pm onwards,' said Mrs Jewell. 'We were changing all our days for when they were noisiest. 'We know what's going on up there, but we can't do anything about it. Nobody can help.' The club website advertises the first Wednesday of every month as 'greedy girl day' beginning at midday . The Jewell's business The Stovestore (pictured) may be forced to close due to the noises from upstairs . The couple, who have owned the shop for two years, have complained to Chorley Council, but say their only option is to leave. Mrs Jewell added: 'We've made a couple of complaints, but there's no law for sexual activities. It's two years now just wasted.' According to the No 3 Club website, daytime activities include 'greedy girl day', which takes place on the first Wednesday of every month, between noon and 10pm. The two businesses share a landlord, Frank Patterson, who said he has asked No 3 Club to take steps improve the situation. Mr Patterson said: 'The No 3 Club came into the unit five years ago, Cheryl and Matthew have been there two years. There were two other tenants before them and it wasn't a problem. 'Now the No 3 Club has extended its hours into the working day. 'I've heard the noises and it's not acceptable. I've spoken to the No 3 Club about it on numerous occasions on behalf of Cheryl and Matthew and they've made no effort to improve the situation. If anything it's got worse.' He added: 'I've written to the No 3 Club and, if and when they renew their lease, I've told them there will be a restriction on them operating during the working day.' Councillor Paul Walmsley, from Chorley Council, said: 'The council has received a complaint about the No.3 Club, but as both parties are commercial premises, we do not have the powers to enforce nuisance proceedings. 'We will, however, continue to ensure they are compliant with their licence agreement as we would do with any other premises.'","Couple claim the noises from upstairs swingers club are 'embarrassing'

Some of it was scorched black by fire, while some pieces of the plane's thin metal body were scratched, twisted and torn. Not visible to the media were parts of the plane that investigators said last year appeared 'to indicate that the aircraft was penetrated by a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft'. Experts will soon begin piecing together parts of the plane to help investigators assess the damage and definitively establish the cause, said Sara Vernooij, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Safety Board, which is leading the civilian probe.

"A middle-aged man and woman have been found dead in a £350-a-night luxury hotel room after allegedly forming a suicide pact. The bodies of the pair, who were not believed to have been married, were discovered in the same hotel room at The Forbury Hotel in Reading, Berkshire, on Monday. Police confirmed the man, who is in his 60s, and woman, in her 50s, were both pronounced dead at the scene and said their deaths were being treated as 'unexplained but not suspicious'. The bodies of the man, who was in his 60s, and the woman, in her 50s, were discovered in the same room at The Forbury Hotel in Reading, Berkshire (above). Police said the deaths were 'unexplained but not suspicious' The Forbury Hotel, which boasts of 'an indulgent and relaxing experience', remained sealed off yesterday while forensic specialists carried out their investigations. Thames Valley Police confirmed today that both the man and woman's next of kin had been informed of the discovery. A spokesman for Berkshire Coroner's Office said the names of the couple could not be released as they were yet to be formally identified. It is understood paramedics were called to the grade II listed hotel yesterday afternoon when a chambermaid discovered the bodies after the pair failed to check out. The door to their room remained locked and after the worker gained entry, she raised the alarm. The manager of the hotel refused to discuss the incident when contacted by MailOnline today. It is believed the pair may have hatched a plan to kill themselves and may have taken an overdose. Guests at the hotel told how the pair, who checked into the hotel on Sunday evening and booked a double room for the night, may have been suffering severe illness. It was believed the couple, who are said to live in a nearby town, decided to splash out on some luxury where they could spend their final hours. One hotel guest, who asked not to be named, said: 'Apparently it was quite obvious to the paramedics and police who were called that they intended to commit suicide. 'We have been told that they were a fairly local couple and that both were very ill - the woman more seriously so than the man. 'We were told that there was a lot of paraphernalia around in the room and also a note explaining what they were doing. 'I guess all the details will come out in the inquest into their deaths.' Other guests checking out of the five-star hotel today spoke of their shock at the incident. A man aged in his 50s, who was staying at the hotel while in Reading on business, said: 'It is just shocking and so sad. I only checked in last night, so I missed the emergency services but I read about what happened. 'I really feel for them, it is just tragic that they felt they could not go on.' The luxury hotel boasts of 'an indulgent and relaxing experience' on its website (pictured). Rooms cost up to £350-a-night and each comes complete with Egyptian cotton sheets and complementary branded toiletries . A 35-year-old man, who works in the area, added: 'I saw all the police cars and ambulances here yesterday as I only work around the corner. I actually thought someone had been murdered. 'You just never expect something like that to happen around here and at such an upmarket hotel. I guess perhaps if it was a double suicide, they wanted to go out in style in nice surroundings, it is a lovely hotel - not to sound insensitive at all, but it is known for being among the best in the area. 'I just hope the staff who found them are okay, that must have been very traumatic.' A woman aged in her 30s, who was at the hotel with her mother, said: 'It is such a sad tale. It is devastating to think they felt they had nothing left to live for.' The hotel has 23 rooms and a series of 16 apartments, which it lets out. Each room has Egyptian cotton sheets on all king size beds, with complementary Molton Brown toiletries and Nespresso coffee machines in every bedroom. Thames Valley Police confirmed that both bodies were discovered in the same hotel room. A spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police were called to The Forbury Hotel in Forbury Square, Reading, yesterday at 2.39pm to reports of two people found dead in the hotel. 'A man in his 60s and woman in her 50s were confirmed deceased at the scene. Their next of kin have been informed. 'The deaths are currently being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. The investigation will be passed to the coroner. 'Post mortem examinations on both bodies will be carried out at the Royal Berkshire Hospital and an inquest will be opened and adjourned. 'We can confirm that the deaths are not being treated as suspicious and no-one else is being sought in connection with them.' Inquests into the deaths are due to be opened and adjourned by the end of the week.","Man and woman found dead in luxury hotel room at The Forbury, Reading .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have released sickening images of a young man having his hand hacked off after he was accused of stealing. The images, understood to have been taken in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa, show the terrified young man being dragged out onto a public square in front of a bloodthirsty crowd. The blindfolded victim is forced to sit in a chair in the centre of the square, where he is held in place by one of the jihadis, while two others use a large meat cleaver to brutally sever his hand from his arm. Sick: The victim is seen pinned in a chair by a group of men, one of whom uses a chord to pull his arm taut while two others place a heavy meat cleaver on the top of his wrist, ready to strike . Horror: The images, understood to have been taken in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, show the terrified young man being led from a vehicle by three heavily armed terrorists, one of whom appears to be no older than 16 . The horrific images were shared on the Twitter page of the local  activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, who work undercover in the city to expose the atrocities committed by ISIS. The four photographs are high quality shots and carry the distinctive yellow branding of ISIS' Al-Hayat Media Center, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video. The first image shows the blindfold and baseball cap-wearing victim being led from a vehicle by three heavily armed Islamic State terrorists, one of whom appears to be no older than 16. Another shot captures a bearded cleric appearing to read charges against the man - using a microphone and PA system to tell the crowd of sadistic onlookers that the man is accused of stealing. The victim is then seen pinned in a chair by a separate group of men, one of whom uses a chord to pull his arm taut while two others place a heavy meat cleaver on the top of his wrist, ready to strike. A final image shows the victim lying on his back in agony on a metal gurney while a man who appears to be a surgeon tends to the injury on his left hand. Accusations: A bearded cleric appears to read charges against the man - using a microphone and PA system to tell the gathered crowd of sadistic onlookers that the man has been accused of stealing . Painful: A final image shows the victim lying on his back in agony on a metal gurney while a man who appears to be a surgeon tends to the injury on his left hand . The video comes just one day after ISIS released gruesome footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy. The video was filmed in  Aleppo and shows a man believed to be named Ahmed Muhammad being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners, who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range. In a chilling sign of ISIS' reach and influence, Muhammad is understood to have been accused of working as part of a secret spy network based  in neighbouring NATO member state Turkey before his brutal filmed execution over the border in Syria. Titled 'A Lesson To Be Learned', the three minute 40 second video has all the hallmarks of an official ISIS release - employing HD cameras, Hollywood-style sound and visual effects and slick editing and direction. It also carries the logo of one of the group's official Aleppo-based propaganda arms, Halab. The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say. It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law. The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example. But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith. An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad . It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections. Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners. But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS. He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme. He added: 'It would be a mistake to conclude the Islamic State group's extremism is the true Islam that emerges from the Koran and Hadith.","Victim is dragged before bloodthirsty onlookers in the Syrian city of Raqqa .

"Dressed smartly for a night out, a group of young women beam for the camera in an upmarket restaurant. All seems well, but appearances can be deceptive. When the hen party returned home, bride-to-be Melissa Grogan-Morgan logged on to the eaterie’s Facebook page and left some scathing comments about the service. Scroll down for video . Melissa Grogan-Morgan, 27 (front left), was joined by family and friends for a hen party dinner at 47 King Street West in Manchester city centre but posted negative feedback online after being disappointed with the service . Restaurant manager: Barry Hymanson and his partner Zuzana Budveselova . However, instead of apologising or offering a constructive response to the bride-to-be's review, the restaurant replied with a vicious tirade which called her group 'the chaviest worst most vile people' and 'absolute trash' Few, however, would have expected the volley of abuse that was served up by staff in return. Variously, they described the party as ‘cheap chav trash’ and ‘ugly peasants’. Miss Grogan-Morgan, 27 – at the front of the group picture on the left – had been celebrating her hen night with 17 friends and family at 47 King Street West in Manchester. But the group said they were disappointed by how disorganised the staff were and left comments about the seating arrangements and the attitude of the manager. In reply to the remarks the restaurant branded the women the worst diners ever to enter the premises. It said: ‘The chaviest worst most vile people ever to grace our restaurant. Wouldn’t know fine dining if it slapped them in their ugly faces!’ It continued: ‘Best thing ever is that they won’t return! Bottom of the barrel. Ms Grogan-Morgan, who spent £600 at the venue with the party, wrote negative feedback on the restaurant's Facebook page after being disappointed with the attitude of staff and how they split the party onto two tables . The restaurant also continued its social media rant following a review from Lynsey Herron, who organised the hen do on behalf of the bride-to-be. 47 King Street West called the group 'chav cheap trash' and 'peasants' 47 King Street West (pictured), which opened in Manchester city centre in 2011, describes itself as a provider of 'quality food and first class service' and offers a mix of 'modern upmarket French and British' cuisine . Mike Hymanson (pictured) is the owner of 47 King Street West restaurant in Manchester city centre . ‘And five out of 18 of them turned up 1 hour and 10 minutes after the booking time and expected fresh starters...are you having a laugh... What absolute trash they were. We pity the groom!’ Yesterday the Facebook page of the restaurant, which has welcomed Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal and Coronation Street star Kym Marsh as guests, had been disabled. Miss Grogan-Morgan, a customer service manager from Stoke-on-Trent, said: ‘For them to post these messages beggars belief…It’s left a bit of a shadow over the whole occasion.’ In the offending review, Miss Grogan-Morgan wrote: ‘The restaurant was nice and the food was fab however the service was awful. My friends booked this restaurant for my hen do for 18 of us, originally it was 10 but numbers grew and they let the restaurant know about it with plenty of notice however we were sat on two separate tables that weren’t even next to each other.’ Lynsey Herron, who organised the evening out, wrote: ‘We were treated with disdain and aggression the moment we got through the door.’ The restaurant owned by former lawyer Michael Hymanson opened in 2011 and has been a hit with critics. Mr Hymanson, 62, whose son Barry is manager, said: ‘The whole incident is regrettable. It has been investigated and dealt with internally.’ Howard Hymanson, 62, who is director of 47 King Street West (pictured) and won an MBE last year, told MailOnline today: 'The entire incident is regrettable and it has been both investigated and dealt with internally' A TripAdvisor review left by a member of the hen party, under the name Laura C, said: 'I don't normally leave a review but I have never experienced management which have been so rude.' She awarded a one star rating . Reviews left on TripAdvisor over the past week, from customers who were not part of the hen party, have been mixed.

"A mother has helped her own son become a father - by carrying his child as a surrogate. In a procedure believed to be a world first, a fertility clinic arranged the woman’s pregnancy using a donor egg and her son’s sperm. She offered to have the baby – with her husband’s consent – after plans by their son to have an IVF child with another female relative collapsed. The High Court (pictured) heard how a fertility clinic arranged the woman’s pregnancy using a donor egg and her son’s sperm . The extraordinary arrangement emerged when a High Court judge ruled that the son can now adopt the baby boy and become his legal father – even though in the eyes of the law he is also the infant’s brother. However, the move was met with howls of protest by critics, who described the procedure as ‘dubious’ and called for urgent reforms to prevent abuses of fertility law. Mrs Justice Theis, who did not identify the family, the clinic or the local authority in the area where they live, said: ‘The arrangement the parties entered into is not one, as far as I am aware, that either this court or the clinic have previously encountered and although highly unusual is entirely lawful under the relevant statutory provisions.’ The father, who is in his mid-20s and lives alone, has wanted to be a parent ‘for some considerable time’ but waited until he had a settled job and home so he could provide ‘the care a child would need’. Mrs Justice Theis (pictured) did not identify the family, the clinic or the local authority in the area where they live . The judge said he discussed the issue openly with family and close friends and arranged for another relative to act as surrogate mother, but the woman dropped out because of a medical condition. At that stage, Mrs Justice Theis said, the man’s mother discussed with her husband the possibility of stepping in to help. The family attended a series of counselling sessions and discussions with the clinic, which is licensed by regulator the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The plans, described by the centre’s medical director as unique, were then given the go-head after ‘careful consideration’. The baby, now seven months old, was born at full term and now lives with his father. However the judge warned others not to embark on surrogacy deals without ‘comprehensive legal advice’ because the process is a ‘legal minefield’. Mrs Justice Theis said that under the 2008 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, which governs surrogacy arrangements, the woman who carried the child is the legal mother. Her husband is the legal father because he consented to the pregnancy. Rules stipulate that a surrogate mother must hand over a child to two parents – usually a couple ‘in an enduring family relationship’. Under the law, it would be a crime to hand over the baby to the biological father alone. But the judge argued that the adoption would not break laws because the baby and its father are legally related already as brothers. Social workers backed the adoption, saying it would ‘strengthen the bond’ the father and child already share’. A report described how the baby ‘clearly has formulated a secure attachment to the father’, adding: ‘The father understands that the child will need to know about how he was conceived and feels that he will utilise the security of the family structure to support his son in understanding that he is a very much wanted child.’ Another report said the mother and her husband regard the child as their grandson, adding that the family want the child to know about the circumstances surrounding his birth. Mrs Justice Theis said the closeness of the family was a ‘critical feature’ of the case. The woman offered to have the baby – with her husband’s consent – after plans by their son to have an IVF child with another female relative collapsed (file picture) ‘The strength of these familial relationships, and the consequent support they provide now and in the future, will ensure the child’s lifelong needs are met,’ she added. But last night critics said the law should never permit such an arrangement. Author and broadcaster on family issues Jill Kirby said: ‘The ethics in this case are very dubious indeed. If the HFEA considers this to be a legal procedure, there is an urgent need to look at the law again.’ Patricia Morgan, a leading researcher on family policy, said: ‘This child will have so much confusion in its background. ‘The evidence suggests that the further we move away from two biological parents, the less good that is for the child.’ Robert Flello, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent South, said: ‘This case throws up many concerns and worries. My greatest concern in all of this is the potential emotional damage to the child in years to come, as he tries to work out family relationships that most of us can take for granted.’ The job of the HFEA, established in 1991, is to licence and monitor clinics and embryo research, and provide the public with impartial information about both. Its chairman since last year is former accountant Sally Cheshire.","Mother helped her son become a father by carrying his child as a surrogate .

"He ruled the prestigious Sydney school Knox Grammar with an iron fist and students nicknamed him The Snake because of it. But a former Knox pupil told Daily Mail Australia one-time headmaster Dr Ian Paterson lived up to that reputation by 'slithering away'  while providing evidence at the Royal Commission into Child Sex Abuse on Tuesday. Dr Paterson, the school's headmaster from 1969 to 1998, began the proceedings by reading out a statement apologising to students for what had occurred, accepting responsibility for 'all that occurs during my headmastership'. Further remarks provoked a loud groan from former students, relatives and support personnel watching on when he described an alleged sexual assault victim as a 'drama boy who liked to exaggerate stories' . Scroll down for video . Fronting up: Dr Ian Paterson is pictured after giving evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse . Dr Paterson began today's hearing by apologising for what had occurred under his headmastership . Christopher Fotis, pictured, has vanished following allegations that arose at the child sex abuse inquiry . The 15-year-old victim, known as ASD, had approached Dr Paterson in 1987 to report that teacher and resident housemaster Damien Vance had touched his bottom and made an 'inappropriate sexual suggestion' under the school chapel, the commission heard. 'I'm not aware it was a crime,' the former headmaster told the commission, as he confirmed he had asked the boy to sit in the library while he attempted to investigate the story by questioning Mr Vance. Dr Paterson did not contact the police. 'In light of today, (it is) an extremely serious matter.' On several occasions, a frustrated Dr Paterson, 81, said he did not recall specific details - including what concerns he had about teacher Roger James' relationship with young men. The commission's inquiry into Knox Grammar continues. At Knox years ago, Dr Pateron was an all-powerful figure, according to former students. 'He was the power in the land,' Knox old boy and author Peter FitzSimons told Daily Mail Australia outside the hearing today. 'He was the Parliament and the King.' 'I'm not aware it was a crime', Dr Paterson told the inquiry in Sydney today . More than five teachers have been convicted with child sex abuse offences at the school . Former students: Peter FitzSimons (pictured left, outside the royal commission today), actor Hugh Jackman . But Mr FitzSimons said that while Dr Paterson appeared to be 'running a tight ship' to his unaware students, many were unaware of the 'carnage below the decks'. He ruled the prestigious Sydney school Knox Grammar with an iron fist and students nicknamed him The Snake because of it. But in the words of a former Knox pupil, one-time headmaster Dr Ian Paterson lived up to that reputation by 'slithering away' from tough questions while providing evidence. The American-educated Dr Paterson's testimony drew considerable interest from former students, after allegations his school had a 'cover-up culture'. Former senior prefect at the school and radio broadcaster Gus Worland told Daily Mail Australia last week: 'We all respected Dr P so much and were scared of him,' said Worland. A former Knox Grammar student onlooker, who attended between 1987 and 1991, was unimpressed by his former headmaster's testimony, which lasted for most of six hours today. ‘I just have to say, his nickname at school was The Snake,' said the student, who did not wish to be named for fear of offending a friend and a relative. 'That’s true then and that’s true today. ' 'He’s slithering his way out of this mess his teachers’ made and he’s covered it up.' Dr Paterson ran the school with an iron fist.

"A young teenager lost her life and her mother was hospitalized following an accident Saturday night. Trinity Bachamann, 13, of Apopka, Florida, was struck dead as she sat in the street arguing with her mother, Janice Perdoza, about who would sit in the front seat of the car. Perdoza, 36, was also injured in the accident and hospitalized, but has since been released. Scroll down for video . Trinity Bachamann (above) was killed Saturday night as she sat in the middle of the road arguing with her mother . The young girl's friends set up a memorial at the site (above) where Trinity was hit by a driver who 'had the odor of alcohol on her breath and her eyes were glassy and bloodshot' Apopka police told WKMG that the pair were struck by a 21-year-old woman who 'had the odor of alcohol on her breath and her eyes were glassy and bloodshot.' They also found an open bottle of Mike's Hard Lemonade in the center console of her car. Trinity, an eighth-grader at Apopka Middle School, was upset with her mother after she was refused a spot in the front seat while driving home from a friend's house. Though three miles from home, the young girl got out of the car refusing to get back in, despite her mother's pleas. She then sat down in the middle of the road, refusing to move. 'We heard arguing going on and stepped outside,' said Jackie Suggs, who lives across the street from the scene of the accident. 'Somebody said ""get outta here,"" and next thing you know, bam! She got hit and flew up in the air. It was awful.' The driver of the car, who did stop after the incident, was given a blood test on the scene. Authorities are awaiting the results of that test before charging the woman, and said the accident is under investigation. 'She was lifeless, right there, just lifeless,' added Suggs. 'And her mom was just panicking. Screaming.' The scene of the incident was dark (above) and the teenager was wearing dark clothing noted one passerby . Pizza driver Michael Bryan, 25, said he also saw the girl sitting in the road, but not until the very last second. 'I couldn't see her clearly until I passed them,' he told the Orlando Sentinel, explaining the the road was poorly lit and the teen was wearing dark clothing at the time. Thinking that the car had broken down, he returned back to scene after dropping off his next delivery, but by then it was too late. Now, a Go Fund Me page has been set up for the family during this difficult time by Amy Shelly, who was one of Trinity's cheerleading coaches. 'A big personality, a huge heart,' is how Shelley described the popular young teenager. Friends of Trinity set up a memorial for the girl, who they remember as a 'firecracker' who loved to sing, at the scene of the accident, and grief counselors were made available at the middle school.","Trinity Bachamann, 13, of Apopka, Florida, was struck dead as she sat in the street arguing with her mother about who would sit in front seat of the car .

"A medieval man, who may have been a knight, died from injuries sustained from jousting, marks on his skeleton suggest. The remains were found at Hereford Cathedral and show signs of injury to the right shoulder as well as fractured ribs. Experts said the wounds are all consistent with injuries that are sustained through tourney or jousting. Did he ride in shining armour? A medieval man who is believed to be a knight, may have died from injuries sustained from jousting, marks found on this skeleton (pictured) suggest . Jousting involved two or more knights on horseback fighting with lances and was used in medieval times to practice battle skills and settle disputes. Archaeologists were excavating the remains at the Heritage Lottery-funded project between 2009 and 2011 – but investigations are still ongoing into some of the more unusual skeletons, including that of the knight. They have all been uncovered at the Cathedral, which was built in the early 12th Century and forms a Norman centre piece to the Historic City of Hereford on the banks of the River Wye. The knight was laid to rest in a partial stone lined burial, which was popular in the area between 1100 and 1300 – the late medieval period. The skeleton has many fractures to the ribs and right shoulder, some of which have healed and others have not, indicating they were caused on numerous occasions. The bones were found at Hereford Cathedral and show signs of injury to the right shoulder as well as fractured ribs (pictured far left) which experts say are consistent with jousting . The knight suffered an unusual twisting break to his left lower leg, so perhaps suffered a blow to his right torso and came off his horse while his left foot remained in the stirrup, causing his leg to twist. A modern recreation of a joust is pictured . Archaeologists were excavating the remains at the Heritage Lottery-funded project at Hereford Cathedral (marked on the map) between 2009 and 2011 – but investigations are still ongoing into some of the more unusual skeletons, including that of the knight . They suggest that the man did not recover from the wounds when he died, aged approximately 45. There is even a chance that his injuries may have caused his demise. The knight suffered an unusual twisting break to his left lower leg, so perhaps suffered a blow to his right torso and came off his horse while his left foot remained in the stirrup, causing his leg to twist. This is another injury that is consistent with jousting, according to experts at Headland Archaeology, based in Edinburgh. Jousting began with the emergence of the knights as warriors in the 10th century. Tournaments were organised as a way for them to practice their horsemanship and lance skills. A Frenchman called Godfrey de Preuilly is said to have arranged the first tournament in 1066,LordsandLadies.org reported. After the Normans conquered the English at the Battle of Hastings, they divided up land among themselves and set up the medieval feudal system, in which everyone owed allegiance to the King and also the nobles. Andy Boucher, said: '...there is a considerable amount of evidence suggesting this man was involved in some form of violent activity and the locations of his injuries do match quite closely what might be expected from taking part in mock battles.' A 13th century manuscript depicting a joust is shown . Nobles provided trained knights to fight for the king and tournaments were devised so they could practice their skills in vicious mock battles. These took the form of a line of knights facing each other on horseback in full armour, who began the 'lance charge'. The dangerous gatherings were banned by Henry II to prevent injuries to valuable fighters. But his son, Richard I, relaxed the rules and granted licenses to hold jousting tournaments. The original tournaments saw large numbers of knights fighting as individuals or teams, on horse and foot. The fights were treated as real battles – some resulted in death and some losers were ransomed. But in 1292, a new rule decreed that weapons should be blunted and the 'lance of peace' with a decorative tip was rolled out. Sometimes disputes were settled by jousting and the victor was seen to have God on his side and was therefore not guilty. In Tudor times, jousting was merged with magnificent pageants and state occasions, such as for the marriage of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and they were still popular during Elizabeth I's reign. The sport declined with the invention of the musket in 1520 and became a form of entertainment only. The knight was laid to rest in a partial stone lined burial, which was popular in the area between 1100 and 1300 – the early medieval period. Experts believe that the man had not recovered from his latest wounds when he died, at approximately 45 years old . Archaeologists were excavating the remains at Hereford Cathedral (stock image) between 2009 and 2011 – but investigations are still ongoing into some of the more unusual skeletons, including that of the knight . The skeleton has many fractures to the ribs (pictured) and right shoulder, some of which have healed and others have not, indicating they were caused on numerous occasions . Andy Boucher who managed the post excavation work, said: 'Obviously we can never be sure how people came about their wounds, but in this case there is a considerable amount of evidence suggesting this man was involved in some form of violent activity and the locations of his injuries do match quite closely what might be expected from taking part in mock battles. ‘The fact that he was still doing this after he was 45 suggests he must have been very tough'. Analysis of the knight’s teeth suggest he had been brought up in Normandy and moved to Hereford in later life. Some 700 individuals were unearthed at the site, offering glimpses of life, disease, accident and injury from the Norman Conquest until Victorian times. Among the remains are one of a leper and a mysterious lady with a severed hand, leading some archaeologists to hypothesise she may have been a thief.","Skeleton was unearthed at Hereford Cathedral with hundreds of others .

Battle: Shi'ite fighters clash with Islamic State militants at Udhaim dam, north of Baghdad yesterday . Combat: Despite reports of local successes and the killing of ISIS' local second in command, officials in northern Iraq say troops are still clashing with jihadis south of Tikrit . Iraqi Army and volunteer fighters move in to position in Saladin Governorate before an operation against ISIS . Iraqi warplanes and artillery began pounding Tikrit yesterday as 30,000 troops and irregulars prepared to attack the city. The operation in the birthplace of former dictator Saddam Hussein was announced on Sunday by Iraq's prime minister, who urged soldiers and government-backed Shi'ite militias to spare civilians. Speaking from Samarra, the other main city in Salaheddin province, Haider al-Abadi appeared to be addressing fears of reprisals against Tikrit's mainly Sunni population. The Iraqi regime forces have yet to enter Tikrit or the nearby Tigris river town of al-Dour, which officials describe as a major centre for the Islamic State fighters. On the southern flank of the offensive, army and police officials said government forces moving north from the city of Samarra could launch an attack on al-Dour later on Tuesday. Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, who has helped coordinate Baghdad's counter-attacks against Islamic State since it seized much of northern Iraq in June, was overseeing at least part of the operation, witnesses told Reuters. His presence on the frontline highlights neighbouring Iran's influence over the Shi'ite fighters who have been key to containing the militants in Iraq. Explosion: As fighting continues to rage in and around Tikrit, a shocking video emerged showing an Islamic State suicide bomber launching a failed attack on an Iraqi military convoy . Accident: It is understood that the jihadi who carried out the attack detonated his device too early and accidentally killed several of his fellow militants. 58 ISIS fighters subsequently surrendered to the Iraqi army, while the bodies of at least 10 others were found nearby . In contrast the US-led air coalition which has been attacking Islamic State across Iraq and Syria has not yet played a role in Tikrit, the Pentagon said on Monday, perhaps in part because of the high-level Iranian presence. Soleimani, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, was directing operations on the eastern flank from a village about 55 km (35 miles) from Tikrit called Albu Rayash, captured from Islamic State two days ago. With him were two Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary leaders: the leader of the Hashid Shaabi, Abu Mahdi al-Mohandis, and Hadi al-Amiri who leads the Badr Organisation, a powerful Shi'ite militia. As fighting continues to rage in and around Tikrit, a shocking video emerged showing an Islamic State suicide bomber launching a failed attack on an Iraqi military convoy. The 52-second video, released on LiveLeak, shows a massive blast near the ISIS stronghold filmed from the back of a vehicle driven by regime forces. So ferocious is the explosion that a thick black cloud of smoke is seen rising high in to the air, while debris litters the landscape for several hundred metres. It is understood that the jihadi who carried out the attack detonated his device too early and accidentally killed several of his fellow militants. 58 ISIS fighters subsequently surrendered to the Iraqi army, while the bodies of at least 10 others were found nearby. Lookout: Retaking the ISIS stronghold is considered vital if government forces are to succeed in their plan to force ISIS out of the oil rich city of Mosul .

Iraqi soldiers gesture towards the camera before yesterday's attack on Islamic State targets near Tikrit . Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State, but the attack by thousands of Shi'ite irregulars could severely test the government's ability to handle sectarian divisions. Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam Hussein, despite his regime's nominal secularism, and the Shi'ite majority. Since the Islamic State insurgency began, the Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shi'ite militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq. 'The priority we gave to the armed forces and all the forces taking part alongside them is to preserve the security of citizens,' Mr Abadi said last night. Iraqi forces tried and failed several times to wrestle back Tikrit, a Sunni Arab city on the Tigris river around 100 miles north of Baghdad. Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State, but the attack by thousands of Shi'ite irregulars could severely test the government's ability to handle sectarian divisions . Prepared: Heavily armed Shi'ite milita are seen taking up positions ahead their fight against the Islamic State . The military commander for Salaheddin province, Abdel Wahab Saadi, said Tikrit had both symbolic and strategic importance. 'The aim of course is to liberate Salaheddin to allow for the return of displaced families but it is also going to be a stepping stone on the way to liberating Mosul,' he told AFP. Tikrit is the hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein, the remnants of whose Baath party have collaborated with IS in attempting to topple the Shi'ite-dominated government. IS declared a 'caliphate' last June straddling Iraq and Syria, where the US-led coalition has also been conducting air strikes but not coordinating with any significant ground force.","30,000 members of the Iraqi military are attacking ISIS targets in Tikrit .

The testing revealed that 30 of the 31 samples were not up to California Air Resources Board standards . When the results came back, nearly all of the samples had levels of formaldehyde that exceeded California health and safety standards. The show used the formaldehyde standards set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) as a measuring stick, the Wall Street Journal reported. 'Out of the 31 samples of Chinese-made laminate flooring, only one was compliant with formaldehyde emissions standards. Some were more than 13 times over the California limit,' according to CBS. The flooring comes from mills in China, according to the report. The report sent Lumber Liquidators shares tumbling. The stock had fallen 24.8 per cent before the market opened Monday and trading was eventually halted. Lumber Liquidators stock had fallen 24.8 per cent before the market opened for business on Monday . In a statement, Lumber Liquidators said 'we stand by every single plank of wood and laminate we sell all around the country'.

"Airline food does not have the best reputation. From stodgy meals to unrecognisable dishes, it seems everyone has a horror story about being served up inedible food on flights. And some even go as far as taking a picture of their unappetising snack and uploading it to the website AirlineMeals.net to warn others about the questionable dishes. Scroll down for video . AirlineMeals gives people the platform to share their dining delights. This United Flight roll from Japan to America in October 2014 was not met with happiness . This offering from Ryanair did not go down a treat. While we are a fan of cheese, Ryanair have created a swimming pool of cheesy sauce for the limp burger . When Delta Air Lines decided to serve this sun dried tomato sandwich, they were met with horror by the flying customer, who had to put it back in the bag . Unappetising: This China Eastern selection failed to impress the customer who received it, although at least there was a variety of choices . Unhappy with Utair. This disgruntled passenger rated gave this dry 'scanty sandwich' a 1/10 rating on the site. Not the most appetising sandwich we have seen . You would be forgiven from thinking this slimy peach dessert was a slug. It is fact the dish on offer onboard a Ukraine International flight . From 'toxic' salad to pasta that looks three days old and even 'untouchable' fish dishes, the hall of shame seems almost unending and will soon have you reaching for the sick bag. AirlineMeals was created over ten years ago, by Marco ‘t Hart and allows users to upload their food and rate it out of ten. There are now over 34,000 pictures on the site, covering 680 airlines from every corner of the globe. Some of the uploads are singing the praises of the dishes and others shouting their displeasure. 't Hart said he created the site after his mother asked what plane food he had when he travelled between Amsterdam and Istanbul to see his girlfriend. He started the website with his photographs, and added some from other fliers, with their permission. Soon he had millions of views and thousands of uploaded meals. 'We used the lowest ratings for a while... that used to be fun, but we now focus on the quality airlines offer. We need friends within the industry, not enemies,' he said. Despite this focus, AirlineMeals still shows the contributor's score out of ten and honest comments. North Korea's Air Koryo served this burger, with a few sad-looking leaves of lettuce, to an unhappy victim on a flight . This Vietnam Airlines meal, with the meat tossed on top of a watery sauce, looks less than appealing for the consumer . This Hawaiian Airlines dish served in December 2014 appears to be missing a few ingredients, although at least they have tried to garnish it with some decorative parsley . The mother of the boy who received this pancake onboard a KLM flight (Royal Dutch Airlines) said he called it 'gross' and refused to eat it - we aren't sure we would eat it either! This Cyprus Airways bland ham and cheese sandwich gained a 5/10 on the site and was described as 'nothing special' The AirlineMeals creator said that usually the bigger airlines from the Middle East, (Emirates, Qatar Airways, Gulf Air) and the Far East (All Nippon, JAL) get the best scores. In Europe, some of the smaller airlines, such as airBaltic, and larger European airlines including BA, Virgin, KLM, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines, hold their own on the site too. In December, US-based DietDetective.com Charles Platkin revealed the results of a survey about airline food showing Virgin America was the best for nutrition, followed by Air Canada and Alaska Airlines. Ryanair served this disappointing meatball sub to a guest, who promptly uploaded to name and shame the airline . Thai Airways International: 'This was the most disgusting and bland meal I have ever tried to eat on an aircraft. The egg was gross, the beef was dry and flavourless and the salad smelled toxic.

'The appetiser is untouchable...smoked marlin with Belgian endives, baby green and capsicum,' said the uploader of this oily dish who flew with Cathay Pacific . A customer onboard a Thomson Airways flight was not happy with his frozen gouda sandwich, on his flight between Greece and United States . Elaborate dining with Utair: The recipient probably had other expectations in mind when they selected the cheese and biscuits spread, and gave the food 1/10 for taste and quality. 'The pasta was like three days old' according to one Aegean Airlines user who tried this dry, bland dish on their flight from Germany to Greece in 2015 .

"Lisa Pigram, 42, was shocked to be told her wheezing and chest pains were due to a bronchial carcinoid tumour . For four years, mother-of-three Lisa Pigram went back and forth to her GP, complaining of wheeziness and occasional sharp pains in her shoulder and chest. Sometimes, she felt as though she was struggling to breathe, or that she was coming down with the flu. Yet she was 'just pooh-poohed' by doctors, says Lisa, 42, who lives in Essex with her husband and has three children, aged 22, 13 and eight. She was not sent for tests, and one doctor even insinuated that it was all in her mind and she was just 'a bit sensitive'. It was after she coughed up blood on holiday in 2004 - and still the doctor told her to wait and see if it got worse - that she decided to use her private medical insurance. Lisa, a teaching assistant, saw a specialist, who inserted a tube with a camera into her lungs and found a growth in her airways. She had a grape-sized bronchial carcinoid tumour - the same condition that the BBC's political editor Nick Robinson announced he had this weekend. The news came as a shock. Like Robinson, Lisa, 42, had never smoked - and no one could explain why she had developed it. She was told the tumour was essentially 'benign' and that if they removed it surgically, that would be the end of it. So, in May 2005, she had a section of her top lung cut out. Nick Robinson, 51, followed up the announcement of his cancer with typical good humour: . 'Timing lousy. Prognosis good,' he quipped. Indeed, the prognosis for most people with his form of cancer is very good if the tumour is caught early and surgically removed. Bronchial carcinoid tumours are a form of cancer known as neuroendocrine tumours. These form on the endocrine system, a network of glands and cells throughout the body that produces hormones. They can be found elsewhere in the body, mainly the intestines, the pancreas and the appendix - 10 to 20 per cent occur in the lungs. Every year, 3,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour. 'It is far less aggressive than many other cancers and even people with an advanced form can live for decades - Steve Jobs had a pancreatic form and lived for a long time with it,' says Neil Pearce, a surgeon who leads the team treating neuroendocrine tumours at University Hospital, Southampton. Jobs, the Apple boss, was diagnosed in 2003 and died in 2011. The news came as a shock for both BBC journalist Nick Robinson (pictured) and Lisa - as neither of them had ever smoked . The difference between typical lung cancer and bronchial carcinoid is that the former occurs within the main cells of the lung; bronchoid carcinoids occur in the neuroendocrine cells dotted around the lining of the main airways. Wherever a neuro-endocrine tumour develops, it can begin to produce hormones - and 30 per cent do so, resulting in a range of symptoms. The type of hormone produced varies significantly, but tumours in the lungs tend to produce either ACTH, which regulates production of the stress hormone cortisol, or serotonin, which can affect gut function, mood and the dilation of blood vessels. If tumours produce serotonin, this causes flushing, diarrhoea and wheezing. But these vague symptoms can make a neuroendocrine tumour more difficult to diagnose and, often, they are only picked up by chance, says Catherine Bouvier of the Net Patient Foundation. 'In around 20 per cent of cases, they are detected either at A&E, as the patient has become very ill, or by chance when they go for a routine health check,' she says. Diagnosis is made more difficult by the fact that non-smokers often don't think that they can get lung cancer. 'We don't actually know what causes it - it is a total mystery, but it does not seem to be associated with smoking,' says Mr Pearce. In fact, while smoking is by far the most common cause of the 43,000 cases of lung cancer each year, 14 per cent of people who develop it will not be smokers. Lisa says her future is now uncertain and she is worried about her children . The type of lung cancer most heavily linked to smoking is squamous cell, yet even this can affect non-smokers. 'What we think happens with lung cancer is that smoking irritates the airways and this causes the cells there to change,' says Professor Keith Prowse, honorary medical director of the British Lung Foundation. 'In cases where people have not even had this connection with cigarette smoke, there is a suggestion that it may be linked to atmospheric pollution.' Some may also be genetically more prone to lung cancer. Almost all lung cancers cause similar symptoms. 'Patients get infection-type symptoms, such as a cough, coughing up blood or wheezing. The difficulty is, some of these symptoms also occur with other conditions, such as asthma,' says Professor Prowse. The lung is also a large organ - lay it out flat and it is as big as a tennis court. Getting a diagnosis relies on taking a biopsy from the right part. The good news is that for 70 per cent of those who are diagnosed with a bronchial carcinoid, the condition can be 'cured' simply by removing it surgically, says Professor Prowse. And here in the UK, we have more centres of excellence for treating this than anywhere in Europe, says Mr Pearce. 'However, not every patient with a neuroendocrine tumour gets seen by a specialist in one of these centres,' he adds. Lisa is one of the unlucky ones. After her surgery in 2005, she was discharged without any follow-up scans or investigations. She thought the experience was behind her and, the next year, went on to have another baby. Then, in 2010, she began to feel unwell. She couldn't quite put her finger on it - she had a bit of an upset stomach from time to time, daily acid indigestion, the odd palpitation and flushing. She also had pains in her chest. Lisa now knows this was caused by another tumour on her lung, pumping out hormones. When she initially went to her GP, she was told to cut out alcohol and given omeprazole, a drug to reduce her stomach acid. But eventually, in July 2012, she was sent for a scan. It revealed that the cancer had returned to the same lung. 'Suddenly, doctors started using the word cancer for the first time - I had no idea that was what I had, which came as a major shock to say the least,' says Lisa. The tumour is between two major blood vessels, and she has been told it is inoperable. The problem is that, aside from surgery, there is no cure for this cancer - as it is a slow-growing form of the disease, it does not respond to conventional chemotherapy, which targets cells with a rapid turnover. Proportion of lung cancer cases linked to inadequate intake of fruit and veg . But there are drugs that can stop the tumour getting bigger, and nuclear medicine treatments, using radioactivity to target receptors on the tumour cells. Initially, Lisa was given hormone injections, called lanreotide, which she had to self-administer once a month. 'At first, it was great as it stopped my other symptoms such as an upset stomach. I was told that the cancer was stable, but I felt as if I had a ticking time-bomb inside me and dreaded going to my scans.' A recent scan showed her tumour had started to increase, and she now needs further follow-up scans to look at it in more detail. People often wrongly refer to this cancer as benign, says Mr Pearce. 'They say: ""Good news, it's a benign tumour"", then a few years later: ""Bad news, it's spread"". 'The cells can look benign down a microscope and that's why you need to see a specialist, because they will know how these really do behave - and they do spread, in 30 to 40 per cent of cases.' Lisa is very angry that neuroendocrine cancer is portrayed as almost 'harmless' and that while specialists say anyone with an endocrine tumour should be followed up, she was not - she has also been in touch with others like her who have not been followed up, either. Lisa says: 'It's unfair. I brought another child into the world after my operation, thinking that I would be fine. 'No one can tell me what the future holds, but I know this - if you have a neuroendocrine cancer, make sure you get followed up. 'It might be a slow growing, easy-to-treat cancer for most people - but not for all.'

"Never work with children or animals goes the old Hollywood saying but today, Prince William found himself doing both - of a sort. After a day spent meeting students at a Shanghai school, the Duke of Cambridge found himself meeting Paddington Bear on the red carpet at a film premiere. Walking down the red carpet outside the Shanghai Film Museum, William was accosted by the much-loved character and cheerfully posed for photos. Scroll down for video . Working with animals? The Duke of Cambridge joins Paddington Bear on the red carpet . Cheerful: William appeared to enjoy meeting the character and posed for photos on the red carpet . On show: The Duke of Cambridge arrives at the film premiere in Shanghai . The event was part of the GREAT Festival of Creativity, which is a government-inspired scheme designed to give a boost to all things British. One of those things is the UK film industry and during the reception that followed the premiere, the Duke presented his hosts with some old footage of Shanghai recently restored by BFI. William's visit to the Museum came after a day spent meeting school children and enjoying a kickabout with locals. Watched by the excited children, William teed up a penalty and, after taking it, beamed as an excited child rushed up to give him a high five. Football is about to become part of the national curriculum in China, and the British Council runs a scheme called Premier Skills which fosters a passion for the game. He shoots... William shows off his ball skills watched by British coaches and local children . Poised: William tees up the penalty before walloping it, narrowly missing the assembled Press as he did so . Good shot! A delighted local then rushed up to give the Prince a high five . The Prince was shown around by Paul Hughes, 33, a former coach at Reading FC, Millwall and Southampton, who now travels the world passing on his experience to local coaches under the British Council scheme. 'The Duke told the children that if they keep on working hard hopefully one day they might play in the Premier League,' explained Hughes afterwards. 'He asked them if they knew who David Beckham was, and said that if they got involved in football then one day they might meet him. 'The Duke was interested in how football helps build confidence, self esteem and promotes good health, and how the game is going to become a big focal point in schools here.' The kickabout came on the third day of William's state visit to China, the first time a senior royal has visited the country since the Queen in 1986. All smiles: William wasn't the only delighted one - the coaches also seemed to approve . Well done: The Duke looked just as pleased by his efforts as the little boy did . Nice work: William and the youngster share smiles as they high five on the pitch . And while it has been almost 30 years since she stepped off the plane in Beijing, the visit clearly hasn't been forgotten as her grandson discovered during a tour of a Shanghai trade fair. There, William came face-to-face with a portrait of his grandmother, which was taken by photographer David Bailey to mark the Queen's 88th birthday last year. The delighted Prince exclaimed: 'That’s fantastic, it’s a great photo, does anyone know when they were taken? I love them.' The images are part of a collection display along with other top British design products at the event in Shanghai's Long Museum. After officially opening the GREAT Festival of Creativity on Monday night, William returned for a closer look at the goods on show. Beckham ring any bells? The Prince asked the children whether they had heard of David Beckham . Football fan: William, seen here with the children, is a keen football fan and supports Aston Villa . Coaching: Premier Skills sends British coaches to China to pass on their skills to local children . Round of applause: The Duke got a cheer as he arrived at the training field . At the BBC Worldwide stand he was greeted by a moving penguin cam, christened George  which walked towards him and bowed. The lifelike model, with a hidden camera behind one eye, has just returned from the Antarctic where it was used to gather footage of real penguins in the wild for the TV series Spy in the Huddle. William laughed and said: 'That’s incredible, it’s brilliant.' Speaking to Mike Gurston, creative director of the BBC’s Natural History Unit, he said: 'What you produce really gives people a chance to see these animals.' Later, the Prince was particularly moved by the REX robot, made by Rex bionics, which allows paraplegics to stand and even walk. William, meet George! The Duke was introduced to a robotic Emperor Penguin chick . Having a go: William tried his hand at riding a fold-up Brompton bicycle . Familiar face: During his tour of the event, William came across a familiar face - a photo of the Queen . Creativity: William was introduced to British businessmen at the GREAT Festival of Creativity . Opening speech: On his first night in Shanghai, he officially opened the GREAT Festival of Creativity . The robotic legs were demonstrated by wheelchair user Sophie Morgan, 30, who suffered a car crash when she was 18. She told the Duke: 'This allows me to stand tall. It’s lovely to be at eye height. People paralysed from the neck down can walk in it. It’s designed to completely stabilise you.' William, whose day was rounded off with a speech at the British Council Global Alumni Awards at the historic Rujin Hotel in Shanghai, will travel on to Jinghong today. During the visit, his last stop in China before he flies home tonight, the Prince will visit a Dai village and an elephant sanctuary, as part of his ongoing crusade to end the ivory trade and protect wildlife. His plans were given an unexpected boost four days ago, when, on the eve of his arrival, China announced that it was imposing a ban on ivory imports from Africa for a year. Boost: The festival is a government-inspired scheme designed to boost Britain's trade with China . Showcase: The event is designed to showcase British creativity in technology and healthcare among others . Colourful: William was treated to a flamboyant display from local dancers when he arrived last night . Warm welcome: William got a warm welcome from President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People .","William toured Shanghai on his third day in China and watched a kickabout .

Wild general manager Chuck Fletcher  had no idea about the letter, which was addressed to the 'Minnesota Wild Coaches', before he made the deal, according to The Star. Jordyn wrote the letter in January when the Wild were in the middle of a bad losing streak, KFAN reported. In the letter, Jordyn identifies herself and her father before getting to her pitch. The letter reads: 'Well, my dad is very lonely without his family. 'We are living in Minnesota right now and I am lost without my dad and so is my mom, my 2 sisters and my brother. 'It has been since November and we can not take it any more. 'To get to the point, the Wild have not been winning games and you lovely coaches are most likely mad about that but your team needs some more D men so can you please, please, please ask the Jackets if you guys can get him?!' Blue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekalainen may have been aware of Jordyn's plight before the swap. He tweeted: 'It isn't always just about business…' After the deal was made, Fletcher of the Wild certainly found out about Jordyn's note because #TheLetter began trending on Twitter. He said the letter was 'tremendous' and 'very powerful'. Leopold has scored 67 goals and tallied 146 NHL assists. He  played for the US in the 2006 Winter Olympics . Blue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekalainen tweeted out a picture of the letter after dealing Leopold .

"Yet another former model has publicly accused embattled entertainer Bill Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her on at least two occasions nearly 40 years ago. Cosby's latest accuser, known only as Patricia, was one of more than a dozen women who anonymously testified against the comedian as part of a 2005 lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand - a former basketball star and Temple University employee who was among the first people to call out Cosby. The multimillionaire TV star settled the lawsuit a year later for an undisclosed amount, and his accusers were effectively 'silenced,' said Patricia. Scroll down for video . More accusations: Yet another former model, a 58-year-old California resident named Patricia, has come out accusing Bill Cosby of sexually assaulting her in the late 1970s . More than 30 women have accused the 77-year-old award-winning comedian in recent years of sexually assaulting them over the past four decades. Cosby's legal team have repeatedly said their client denies all of the allegations of sexual misconduct. Speaking in an exclusive interview with BuzzFeed this week, Patricia, now 58 years old and living in California, finally got to tell her story involving the powerful show business big-shot who allegedly lured her to his home under the guise of an acting lesson and took advantage of her after spiking her drink. Patricia said she was 22 years old in 1978 when Cosby invited her to a dinner party at his home in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts. The young model, who first met the famous comic while working as a conference planner at the University of Massachusetts - her and Cosby’s alma mater - assumed that the actor's wife, Camille, will be joining them for dinner. But when she arrived the Cosbys' house, Patrica said she found a table set just for two next to a fireplace. ‘I felt alarm bells go off because it did feel intimate, but I was trying to be so grown up and mature,' she told the site. Jane Doe: Patricia was one of more than a dozen women who anonymously testified against the comedian as part of a 2005 lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand (left and right) The young model accepted a drink from her famous host, who then proceeded to give her a set of peculiar acting directions: Patricia was asked to pretend to be a queen with oatmeal dripping down her face. 'It was so creepy,' Patricia told BuzzFeed. 'He told me to convince him that I could remain regal and queenlike no matter what I looked like.' As the odd improvisational game went on, Patricia said she started to feel strange and eventually blacked out. In a now-familiar scenario, Patricia said she later woke up naked in bed to find Cosby standing over her dressed in a robe. The comedian allegedly said that the young woman got sick and he had to remove and wash her soiled dress. She recalled that at the time, it sounded like a plausible explanation. On her way home after the disastrous dinner, Patricia got violently ill and had to pull over four times to throw up. Patricia, an aspiring singer and actress, said she felt embarrassed and was certain that Cosby would not want to help her anymore with her career in show business. But Cosby followed through on his promise to mentor her, paying for her acting lessons in New York and Los Angeles, getting her a gym membership to help her lose weight, and regularly checking up on her progress. Ideal: The last time Patricia saw Cosby in 1980, the comic allegedly requested that she style her hair like Queen Noor of Jordan (left and right) Regal: Patricia claimed  Cosby was 'obsessed' with the beautiful American-born consort of King Hussein, and that he even sent her a photo of the queen so that a hair stylist could replicate her loose bun . Patricia also accompanied the married actor to several events around the country. The last time she saw Cosby during a live taping of the Dinah Shore Show in 1980, the comedian had an odd request: Patricia was asked to style her hair like Queen Noor of Jordan. Patricia claimed that Cosby was 'obsessed' with the striking American-born consort of King Hussein, and that he even sent her a photo of the queen so that a hair stylist could replicate her loose bun. After the show taping, Patricia claimed that Cosby talked her into taking some pills to relax her. She awakened the next morning naked and knew at once that something was awry. 'I was very sick and knew that someone had penetrated me,' the ex-model told the site. Patricia then confronted Cosby, but the comedian became furious, accused her of being an ingrate and threw her out of his suite. The woman kept mum about her experiences for the next three decades, saying that she felt ashamed and partially responsible for what happened to her because she trusted the wrong person and let herself be blinded by ambition. Patricia finally broke her silence in 2005 after her therapist gave her the number of the detective investigating the allegations against Cosby. She then joined 13 other women who agreed to testify as part of Andrea Constand's five-count lawsuit against the beleaguered comic. Patricia has become the seventh Jane Doe to speak out. She hopes other alleged victims will follow her example and come out of the shadows. 'You're not alone,' she said. 'You don’t have to keep this a secret anymore.'","Woman identified as Patrica, 58, from California, was among more than a dozen of Jane Does who testified as part of 2005 lawsuit against Bill Cosby .

"A man who survived a suicide leap from the Golden Gate Bridge has told in detail how he was saved by a sea lion which kept him afloat until the coastguard arrived. Kevin Hines is now a global speaker on mental health issues and shared his remarkable story at a suicide prevention conference in New South Wales, Australia. Aged just 21, he was suffering from bipolar disorder and psychosis when he jumped from the San Francisco landmark on a chilly September day in 2000. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Mental health campaigner Kevin Hines told a conference yesterday how he survived a suicide attempt nearly 15 years ago - because a sea lion circled under him and kept him afloat until help arrived . Although he lived, Mr Hines almost lost his ability to walk and was saved only by 14 hours of surgery on his back. But immediately after the four-second fall there was another, more incredible miracle. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: 'I guess you would call it a mammal began swimming beneath me and I'm thinking, ""Oh man, a shark is about to devour me"". 'I was on a show for suicide prevention and I mentioned that I thought there was this shark on this show and a man wrote into the show and he said, ""Kevin, I'm so very glad you're alive, I was less than two feet away from you when you jumped"". 'He said: ""It haunted me until this day; it was no shark, it was a sea lion and the people above looking down believed it to be keeping you afloat until the coast guard brought a ride behind you.""' Landmark: By a stroke of luck, a witness saw Mr Hines jump from the vast bridge and alerted the coastguard . Conference: Mr Hines spoke at the New South Wales Police Force Mental Health Intervention Team conference in Sydney, Australia. The force attended nearly 50,000 mental health incidents last year . With temperatures in the bay's waters as low as 12C, Mr Hines could have died of hypothermia had a witness not seen him jump and raised the alarm. Mr Hines said he never intended to tell his story because he was 'embarrassed', but changed his mind after a life-affirming talk to 120 students, many of whom had suicidal thoughts. Now he has written a book about his experience, Cracked, Not Broken, and appears at conferences all over the world. With medication and professional help he has managed to reduce his symptoms, including the voices in his head which told him to jump on that day 14 and a half years ago. 'The message is very very simple,' he told ABC. 'You don't have to die this way.' Mr Hines says he is one of just 34 survivors of falls from the Golden Gate Bridge, which rises high above the San Francisco Bay, and the only one to become a mental health campaigner. Population: Sea lions basking on piers in San Francisco. Mr Hines said the theory was perfectly plausible . He spoke yesterday as part of the NSW Police Force Mental Health Intervention Team conference in Sydney. The force attended almost 50,000 mental health incidents in 2014 alone, and set up to conference to discuss how the often-misunderstood issue should be tackled. Mr Hines had talked about being saved by a sea lion before, including in a 2013 blog post. 'There are a large number of reporters and speculators who have claimed it was really a seal, and even those who have claimed that there was nothing but me in that water,' he wrote. 'However, I know that it was a sea lion and it is not a statistic anomaly. Marine animals (dolphins, sea lions) and other creatures have helped save humans and other animals from dangerous situations all over the world. 'I say believe it or don’t, that’s completely up to you. I know the truth, and in this case and that is all that matters.'

"It is the heartwarming film that has made fans laugh all over the world and perhaps even consider planning their own retirement escape. But the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel's hilarious comedy of errors is just the half of it, according to one couple who followed their dream of building a life in India. From monsoons to massive renovation bills, Britons Norman and Carole Steen have faced it all after exchanging the grey skies of Birmingham for the tropical paradise of Goa, where they took on a dilapidated building with hopes of turning it into their very own marigold hotel. Norman and Carole Steen, from Birmingham, moved to Goa to renovate a dilapidated building and set up their very own marigold hotel . If this sounds like the plot of the newly-released film, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, that's because it is eerily similar - right down to the hurdles that the Steens had to overcome. Mr Steen, 61, said: 'We first started visiting India in the 1990s and it took us that long to get over the Delhi belly. 'Squid is still off the menu for us to this day. 'When we took over the property in 2005, it came with a whole host of problems. 'Every room needed a facelift from top to bottom. After purchasing the run-down building in 2005, the Steens have had to contend with a host of problems and continuous maintenance . 'There was no plumbing in it at all. 'There were only two lightbulbs in the house and no bathrooms. 'It cost around £15,000 for the structural work and this involved digging a metre-deep trench round the whole house. 'Every four years we need to inject chemicals into the walls and spray every bit of timber to make sure we don't get termites.' From termite infestations to monsoon damage, it cost around £15,000 to take on all the structural work and 14 months to complete . The experiences of the Steens sounds much like the plot of 2011's hit film, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Dev Patel . When the Steens, who are both retired lecturers, took over the property, they found the roof of the building was already home to a colony of long-tailed langur monkeys. Mr Steen said: 'The langurs running around on the roof, coupled with the four-month period of monsoons and high winds, meant the roofing tiles needed constant repairs. 'The last time we had our roof done, we had to buy 1,500 new tiles. 'It took 14 long months to complete the renovation of the property and it's one of those houses which constantly requires maintenance.' Mrs Steen, 60, said: 'Moving to India comes with frustrations. 'We arrived with the intention of taking over a colonial estate which is 700 years old, and it took a lot of fixing up. 'Even before we had even moved out there, we had to get through a whole host of paperwork to overcome the legalities of buying property and setting up a business in India. 'spent 10 years planning before we finally made the move.' The pair arrived with the intention of taking over a colonial estate, but at 700 years old, it required a lot of fixing up . The sequel to the 2011 film, called The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, brings back the original stars, such as Judi Dench . This year, the Steens are celebrating ten years in India and their beloved Casa Susegad is more successful than ever . This year, the Steens are celebrating ten years in India and their property, the Casa Susegad, is currently benefitting from a wave of renewed interest in India among UK retirees, largely due to the success of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and its sequel. Carole said: 'I am a huge fan of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. 'I took my mum to see it and told her it was a bit like my life out in India. 'I loved it. I can't wait to see the new film.' In fact, the property is currently benefitting from a renewed wave of interest thanks to the release of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel . Carole also added that she was very glad that India was becoming a more attractive holiday destination for elderly British retirees . Carole said she was glad that India was becoming a more attractive holiday destination for elderly people. She said: 'While we love the country, just remember that it's very different to the UK. When we came out here, we didn't have a camera crew or a director - all the hard work was done by ourselves. 'But as a country, India is full of beautiful gems. From the Himalayan landscape to the ancient temples, I think we will be many lifetimes over before we get bored of this place. 'We have absolutely no regrets about moving over here to start our own exotic marigold hotel. It's definitely been worth it.'","Norman and Carole Steen, from Birmingham, have set up a hotel in Goa as a retirement project .

"A Canadian man says he suffered hallucinations and excruciating pain, and feared he was going to die after he was stung by a venomous scorpion on a flight from Colombia to Mexico. The plane was forced to turn around and make an emergency landing in Bogota, the Colombian capital, after Adam Young was attacked by the dangerous arachnid. It happened as Mr Young, from St John’s, Newfoundland, felt something crawling under his shirt as he tried to nap shortly after the plane departed for Mexico City. Adam Young suffered nausea, numbness, chest pains and hallucinations after being stung (file photo) He tried to flick it off, but it was too late, the CBC reported. Mr Young wrote in a Facebook post: ‘The scorpion had already done its work on me and stung me three times. ‘I jumped out of my chair in a huge commotion and it fell out of my shirt on to the chair.’ He was travelling with friend Brendan Dawson Walsh, who thought it was a prank until he saw the scorpion on the plane’s floor. After they alerted flight attendants, the scorpion was found under Mr Young's seat cushion and killed as the plane aborted its five-hour journey and returned to Bogota last Friday. Adam Young said he was stung after he felt something crawling under his shirt (file photo) The plane diverted after a doctor who happened to be on board insisted that it land as soon as possible, radio station VOCM reported. Mr Young said the venom was setting into his veins, causing ‘excruciating’ pain and a ‘burning sensation’. He wrote: ‘Even though I remained calm on the outside I was dying on the inside.’ He suffered nausea, numbness to his arm, chest pains and hallucinations during the 20 minutes that it took to return to Bogota, where paramedics met the plane on the tarmac. A fellow passenger told Mr Young that it was a highly-venomous scorpion which attacked him (file photo) Mr Young was rushed to a medical room inside the airport and given an anti-venom injection in the buttocks. While he received urgent treatment, employees did a sweep of the plane and cleared it for take-off after they failed to find additional scorpions. Still in pain, Mr Young boarded the plane and continued his journey to Mexico. A fellow passenger told him that he had been attacked by a highly-venomous scorpion which is capable of killing a human. Friday’s incident was at least the second time in as many months a passenger has been stung by a scorpion on a plane. Last month a scorpion stung a woman on the hand just before take-off on an Alaskan Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Portland. The woman was stung as the plane was taxiing on the runway, and she stomped the scorpion to death as the aircraft returned to the gate. She declined additional medical treatment after she was checked over by paramedics. The flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico.","Adam Young felt something crawling under his shirt as he tried to nap .

"Organic, free range and grain fed are some of the terms commonly found on food labels in the supermarket - but are they really what they claim to be? Consumers are becoming more aware of choosing healthy and sustainable foods after 18 people became infected by hepatitis A last month   from supermarket-bought frozen berries imported from China to Australia. But it can often be difficult to decipher the various advertising claims plastered on products and where things are actually made, so what are some of the confusing terms used on food labels and what do they really mean? Scroll down for video . There is currently no official definition for free range eggs or meat in Australia, which means the term can be open to abuse by retailers and makes it difficult for consumers to choose from . Free range . There is currently no official or legally enforceable definition for free range eggs or meat in Australia, which means the term can be open to abuse by retailers and makes it difficult for people to choose from, consumer groups warn. The terms 'free range' or 'free to roam' pop up on egg packaging in the supermarket but it doesn't all mean the same thing, according Cassie Duncan, general manager at Sustainable Table. 'In the absence of such labelling laws, it is best to look for ""certified free range"" or ""certified organic"" products, although the standards can vary between different certification bodies,' Ms Duncan told Daily Mail Australia. There are several organisations that certify egg producers, but the ease of access chickens have to the outdoors in sunlight and the number of birds housed in one area can vary. Consumer group Choice is currently campaigning for a nationally enforceable standard for free range in Australia. 'Credence claims are often used by business in a bid to get consumers to pay a premium and encourage you to buy their product ahead of a competitors,' Choice's Tom Godfrey said. 'Our research has found relying on claims such as free range when making a purchase is largely a waste of money.' The terms 'free range' or 'free to roam' pop up on egg packaging in the supermarket but it doesn't all mean the same thing, according Cassie Duncan, general manager at Sustainable Table . Organic . In similar circumstances to free range, organic is a term also abused on product labels because there are no laws or regulations in the country. 'You can only be certain that you are purchasing truly organic or biodynamic produce and products if it has been ‘certified organic’ by one of the seven recognised certification bodies that are accredited and audited by the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service,' Ms Duncan said. 'What people forget is that organic farming is actually the traditional way of farming. 'Organic farming nurtures the soil by using compost and other organic fertilisers. Conventional farming uses synthetic fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides... to protect plants from pests.' Many brands can push the organic or natural term by relying on trademarked names even if it includes preservatives, according to Choice. Consumers are warned to look out for certified logos on organic products produced in Australia. 'Some smaller producers follow organic principles but have not sought certification due to the cost involved, so always ask questions of your farmers' market producer if you are unsure,' Ms Duncan said. Organic is a term also abused on product labels because there are no laws or regulations in Australia . Grain fed . This is where animals including chicken and cattle are fed a predominately grain-based diet. The feedlot industry, which is an extensive outdoor feed environment where animals are sent to be fattened before slaughter, has grown drastically in the last 10 years due to demand. There are about 700 accredited feedlots in the country with large ones holding up to 40,000 cattle at a time. While the RSPCA doesn't oppose feedlots, the organisation has raised concerns and listed conditions that must be met to ensure good animal welfare. Grain fed animals can have a damaging effect on the environment, according to Sustainable Table, because it is resource intensive as grain has to be grown and often transported to where the animal is being housed . Sustainable Table says the process of grain feeding can be damaging. 'Grain feeding is resource intensive and can be environmentally destructive, as grain has to be grown and often transported to where the animal is being housed,' Ms Duncan said. 'Grain production is also being diverted to animals as opposed to being grown primarily for human consumption. 'It is estimated that the world's cattle consume enough food to feed 8.7 billion people, which is more than the entire human population.' Fresh . While supermarkets regularly promote fresh and natural items that seem like the next best thing to growing your own organically, Choice says beyond the packaging it's a different story. 'Fresh' may conjure up images of hand-picked produce only hours old, but in fact it may only mean it hasn't been preserved by freezing, canning, high-temperature or chemical treatment,' the consumer groups says. 'It may have been refrigerated and spent time in processing and transport, but it's still 'fresh'.' While supermarkets regularly promote fresh and natural items, it may only mean it hasn't been preserved by freezing, canning, high-temperature or chemical treatment . Pole and line caught . There are various canned tuna options on supermarket shelves, but Greenpeace says consumers should always look for the pole and line option where fish are caught one by one with a hook and line. They say fewer sharks, turtles, whales and dolphins will be killed because pole and line fishing is  selective and more fisherman are employed in the process. Former chef and host of Gourmet Farmer Afloat, Matthew Evans, has been campaigning for better labelling on things like canned tuna so people can make informed choices. 'Pretty much every can of tuna will say made in Thailand because that’s the world home of where they tin tuna,' Mr Evans said. 'But it might not come from that water. It can come from anywhere in the world. If you don’t tell us where it was caught, saying it was tinned in Thailand is just a small part.' Mr Evans said labelling laws enabled seafood in Australia to be labelled 'Made in Australia' even if it was caught somewhere else and just repackaged here. 'If more than half the value is added, it's okay,' he said. 'I bought some supermarket flathead in Melbourne, but it was actually an Argentinian stick fish. Legally it is allowed to be called that because of labelling laws.' Former chef and host of Gourmet Farmer Afloat, Matthew Evans, has been campaigning for better labelling on things like canned tuna so people can make informed choices . He says about 70 percent of seafood in Australia is imported but consumer have been kept in the dark . He says about 70 percent of seafood in Australia is imported but consumers have been kept in the dark. 'I don't have a problem with imported seafood if it's produced sustainably,' he said. Most tuna is currently caught using large-scale industrial fishing methods, which threaten fish stocks and the marine environments that support them. But pole and line fishing is a more sustainable way and most brands and supermarkets stock tuna caught in this way. 'Pole and line fishing is seen as the most sustainable way of catching Tuna because it is literally a pole with a fishing line on it,' Ms Duncan said. '(It) means total catch is easier to monitor, and it’s easier to avoid ‘by-catch’, which is when unintended fish species get caught in nets and in other destructive fishing techniques.' Mr Evans is calling on companies to better label its seafood so people know what species they're eating, where it was caught and how it was produced. Mr Evans is calling on companies to better label its seafood so people know what species they're eating, where it was caught and how it was produced . Pole and line fishing is a more sustainable way to fish for tuna and most brands and supermarkets stock tuna caught in this way . 'The only way we can make a conscious decision to choose sustainable seafood, is by knowing for a start, what we're eating,' Mr Evans said. 'I want people to know what they're eating so that they think about their seafood and they don't see the ocean as this bottomless pit that will provide seafood forever. 'Our choices can make a difference and all we need to do is ask what's on our plate. 'Some people won't care. They will always buy the lowest price. But until we have that information, we have no power to make that choice.'

"Foreign aid spending could outstrip the defence budget within 15 years, according to an analysis published last night. Research conducted by the House of Commons Library found aid spending could eclipse defence by 2030/31, assuming current spending changes continue under successive governments. According to the analysis, defence spending will be £27.1 billion by 2031, but the aid budget will be £28.3 billion, the Daily Telegraph reported. Prime Minister David Cameron, who has dismissed concerns about the impact of cuts on the capacity of the British forces . In recent years, the Department for International Development has seen its budget increase sharply as ministers try to hit the target of spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on aid. Last week the Mail revealed that the Tory manifesto will not commit to keeping defence spending at the Nato target of 2 per cent of national income. Yesterday David Cameron dismissed concerns raised by the head of the US Army about the impact of cuts on the capacity of British forces, insisting it remained a 'very strong and capable partner' for the Americans. In a sign of the pressure on the Prime Minister over the military budget, former Defence Secretary Liam Fox said he and fellow Tory MPs would find it 'hard to swallow' if Mr Cameron allowed spending to fall below the 2 per cent Nato threshold while maintaining a pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on aid. Former defence secretary Liam Fox, pictured, has said he and fellow Tory MPs would find it 'hard to swallow' if defence spending fell below the Nato threshold . Ministers are under increasing pressure from Tory MPs and senior military figures to commit Britain to meeting the Nato target after 2016. With deep cuts to Whitehall budgets to continue after May's general election, Chancellor George Osborne is reported to have warned privately that it may fall below that level. The most senior civil servant at the Ministry of Defence said that the department would 'clearly' like the Nato target to be met - although he said that it would be for ministers in the next government to decide. Giving evidence to the Commons Public Accounts Committee, Jon Thompson, the permanent secretary at the MoD, said: 'Clearly, we would like 2% of GDP but that's for the next government to decide.' He said that on current forecasts, GDP growth was expected to outstrip the growth in the defence budget, so that it would drop below 2% at some point in the next parliament. He warned that further cuts in spending could ultimately affect the capability levels of the armed forces. 'It rather depends on how deep the cut is and how much further financial efficiency we can drive. If it were to be more than the level of financial efficiency we can drive, then yes, it will impact on capability,' he said. Speaking at a campaign event in Colchester, the Prime Minister said the UK's defence budget was the fifth largest in the world and second only to the US in the Nato alliance. He said: 'In terms of spending, the promise we have made is that the equipment budget, which is £160 billion over the next decade, that will grow by 1% in real terms in each year of the next parliament. 'Also we have said we don't want to see further reductions in our regular armed forces. So we have that commitment: second largest in Nato, fifth largest in the world. 'And as for working with the Americans, I know because I spend time with President Obama and others, how much they appreciate the fact that Britain is a very strong and capable partner and able to fight with them, when it's in our national interest, anywhere in the world.'","According to analysis, defence spending by 2031 would be £27.1 billion .

"LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant has revealed he believes the stress of his rape case led his wife to miscarry their child - and he can't still can't forgive himself. Kobe has said he blames himself for wife Vanessa's miscarriage, which happened in early 2005 - the year after he faced trial for rape in Colorado. The basketball player, who has been married to Vanessa since 2001, says he believes the anxiety caused by the allegations over the 18 months before led to his wife losing what would have been their second child. Scroll down for video . Anguish: LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant says he blames himself for wife Vanessa's miscarriage in Muse, a documentary about his life. Pictured: Vanessa and Kobe at the premiere of the documentary earlier this year . Kobe had been charged with assaulting 19-year-old Katelyn Faber in 2003, but it was dropped at trial when the alleged victim refused to give evidence at trial the next year. The now 36-year-old denied the charges - but admitted an adulterous sexual encounter with his accuser after he checked into the hotel where she was working to await knee surgery. But the allegation led to him losing lucrative contracts with Nutella and McDonalds at the time, as well as causing stress for his family. However, Vanessa stood by her husband throughout the case. In a halting and emotional monologue  for his new documentary Muse, Bryant says he let his wife and family down during 'that time'. But in the two minute clip - marked '2004' - he never refers directly to the rape case which turned his world upside down. 'It is a man's job to look out for your family,' Bryant tells the camera. 'In that aspect, I failed miserably.' Halting: The star gives an emotional monologue to the camera, in which he says he let his family down . Star: The sportsman was awaiting knee surgery when he was alleged to have raped a hotel worker in 2003 . He added: 'We were expecting our second child during that time, and there was just so much stress, she actually miscarried. 'It is something I have a real hard time dealing with that, I feel like it was my fault. We should have been building our family, but because of my mistake, we lost a baby. 'We try to justify the fact its not, realise how common miscarriages are, these things happen, but the reality is it happened because of me. 'That's the reality of it, and that is something I've got to carry forever.' Kobe also seems surprised his wife did not leave him at the time, taking their young daughter with her, as well as 'half the money'. 'Things would have been really easy for her to leave,' he said in the documentary. Dropped: The charges were dropped at trial, but Kobe - who protested his innocence-  did admit he had a 'consensual' encounter with his 19-year-old accuser, a worker at the Colorado hotel where he was staying . After the case was dropped in September 2004, Kobe agreed to apologise to Faber for the incident, including his public mea culpa. 'Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did,' he said at the time. 'After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.' Faber filed a separate civil lawsuit against Bryant, which the two sides ultimately settled with the specific terms of the settlement being undisclosed to the public. It was also revealed he bought Vanessa a $4million dollar diamond ring after the scandal. The couple - who almost divorced in 2011, but decided to remain together - now have two daughters together.","LA Lakers star reveals he blames himself for wife Vanessa's miscarriage .

"An 11-year-old missed out on all the secondary schools she wanted and instead has been offered a place at an academy which was previously in special measures. Courtney Wells, of Birmingham, was one of thousands of children in England who were left disappointed after they missed out on their first choice secondary school place when they were notified yesterday. Her parents listed four schools in order of preference for their daughter but missed out on them all. Instead the 11-year-old, who is due to start year seven in September, has been offered a place at Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre. The school became an academy last November after it was placed in special measures in 2013 following a damning Ofsted report which rated it 'inadequate'. Courtney's mother Stacey Wells, 31, said: 'Courtney was really engaged in the whole process of deciding what school she wanted to go to. She went to look at all the schools. Courtney Wells, 11, missed out on all four of her choices for Birmingham secondary schools and was instead offered a place at an academy previously in special measures. Her mother Stacey is appealing the decision . 'We put a white board up in the kitchen and after each open evening she weighed up the pros and cons and gave the school a score out of ten. That's how she decided which schools she would choose. 'We are not wholly surprised that she didn't get into the university school as it looked so amazing that we were expecting it to be inundated with applicants. But we thought she would at least get one of her other choices. Birmingham was one of the worst areas where children missed out on their first choices as secondary school places were confirmed yesterday. A third of children in the city missed out on their first choice school compared to just two per cent in Cornwall. Councils notified parents of their children's fate yesterday by email or letter, meaning some families will not receive the news for several days. Courtney was rejected from her first choice University of Birmingham School (top left), which is being built, her second Shenley Academy (top right), which is closer to her home than the place she has. She was refused her third St Paul's School for Girls (bottom left) and her fourth, Colmers Senior School (bottom right) The 11-year-old applied for four schools - three of which were within 2.5 miles of her home but was rejected and given a place at Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre which was put into special measures in 2013 . 'It is such a worrying time, all we want is the best for our daughter. We are going to appeal and fight this all the way.' The decision to offer Courtney a place at the academy came despite the site being further away from her home than her second choice school. She was also rejected from Colmers School in Rednal, despite having a foster sibling already at the school. Her parents have vowed to appeal the decision. They decided to put just four choices on the form instead of take advantage of listing six options because they thought this would be enough. They listed University of Birmingham School, Selly Oak; Shenley Academy, Northfield; St Paul's School for Girls, Edgbaston and Colmers School, Rednal, as their choices. Courtney was rejected from all four of her secondary school choices, despite her second preference being closer to her home and one of her choices being at a school where one of her foster siblings is a pupil . She has been offered a place at Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre, put in special measures in 2013 . The couple's first choice for their daughter, currently a pupil at St Brigid's RC Primary School in Northfield, was the new University of Birmingham School, which is opening its doors for the first time in September. A spokeswoman for the school said it had received a staggering 1,100 applications for its 150 places, with 377 pupils putting it as their first choice. Courtney's parents have been told their daughter is currently in 177th place on the waiting list for a place at the sought-after free school, which is financially backed by the university and which has promised it will provide a private education standard without charging fees. The Year 7 intake will consist of 75 pupils living around its site in Bristol Road, Selly Oak, while another 75 will come from homes near Hall Green, Small Heath and the Jewellery Quarter railway stations. Peter Hay, Birmingham City Council's director of people, said: 'If you have applied for an academy, foundation, grammar, voluntary aided or free school and want to appeal against their decision, then you must contact that school directly for details of their appeal arrangements.' Under the admissions system, families list their school preferences and are then allocated places according to the schools’ admissions criteria. Many children living in big cities were left disappointed yesterday, and this graph shows the percentage of children who got their first choice secondary school when the places were announced on Monday . Factors can include proximity to the school, faith or ability – with some schools specifying how many bright, average and low ability pupils they will admit. A spokesman for the council said: 'The school admissions team has processed over 15,000 applications for secondary school places this year. Parents in Birmingham can submit up to six preferences, including grammar schools, and we always advise that parents are realistic when making their preferences. 'The advice from the local authority is that parents include at least one preference for a nearby school where their child would have got in under the distance criterion in the past. For the vast majority of families the reason they do not get the first preference is because other children better met the school's admission criteria than their child.' Yesterday more than half a million pupils were notified of their places and a number of appeals are expected.","Courtney Wells listed four  secondary schools she wanted to go to .

"A Spanish actress was caught faking her illustrious career by editing her face onto pictures of other celebrities before sharing them with her 22,000 Instagram followers. Anna Allen, 32, deleted her account after it was discovered that she had posted fake photos of herself supposedly attending this year's Oscars. According to Spanish outlets, she even gave an interview following the ceremony, claiming that she had spoken with host Neil Patrick Harris 'for a good while'. But that was only a small part of Anna's Oscar-worthy social media performance. Scroll down for video . Great lie: Spanish actress Anna Allen, 32, edited this image to make it look like she was posing on the red carpet at this year's Oscars . Impostor syndrome: For last year's Academy Awards, Anna (left) superimposed her face onto another woman's body (right) to make it appear as though she had attended the ceremony . Prior to the event, Anna had taken and cropped Lupita Nyong’o's snapshot of her invitation to the 87th annual Academy Awards and posed it as her own. And for last year's Oscars, she superimposed her face onto one female attendee's body, although her deception had seemingly gone unnoticed. In addition to her fake awards show appearances, Anna has edited photos to make it look as though she was guest starring on certain television series. Stolen snapshots: Anna's posted a photo of her invitation to the Oscars, which was actually a cropped version of the picture that Lupita Nyong’o had shared on her Instagram account . Imitation game: When Lupita shared this photo of her Academy Awards invitation, she wrote: 'It's official; I'm invited to the Oscars' Anna claimed to be on set of The Big Bang Theory after she shared a photo of herself with the cast, but her followers were actually seeing her face on actress Summer Glau's body. She did the same thing with actress Romola Garai's image in order to make it look like she was the one who starred alongside Jonny Lee Miller in the 2009 BBC mini-series Emma. But what what may be the most shocking is how many photos Anna had taken from actress Sophia Bush and treated as her own. She reposted numerous snapshots from Sophia's Instagram account, including pictures of the Chicago P.D. actress's shoes, work set and her travels. Group shot: Anna superimposed her face onto the body of another actress to make it look as though she was guest starring on The Big Bang Theory . Actual actress: The real photo shows that it was Summer Glau who had posed with the cast of the hit CBS series . Period piece: Anna (left) Photoshopped her face onto a photo of Romola Garai (right) to make it look as though she was the one who starred alongside Johnny Lee Miller in the 2009 BBC mini-series Emma . For one of the stolen photos, she even rewrote Sophia's picture caption, which read: 'Touchdown. Momentary sunning in my Balenciaga boots before the big day ahead.' While most celebrities are accused of Photoshopping their physical features for their Instagram photos, this may be the first time an actress has created an entire career based on the magic of picture editing. Anna has since shut down her social media accounts, but that didn't stop her from becoming an Internet meme. Online commenters have shared photos of Anna's face superimposed into other improbable situations, including scenes from Titanic and Ellen DeGeneres' A-list selfie from last year's Oscars. Stolen style: Anna posted this picture of Sophia Bush's Balenciaga boots and pretended that it was her own . Take words: She also copied Sophia's caption and posed it as her own . Big joke: Even though Anna has shut down her social media accounts after her deception was discovered, she has still inspired numerous Internet memes, including this 'invite' to the Oscars from 'Meryl Skreeps' Another Twitter user, superimposed Anna's face onto Leonardo DiCaprio's in this scene from Titanic .

"The student skydiver who suffered a seizure while free-falling at 2743 m (9000 ft) was an epilepsy sufferer who believed he had his condition under control. Incredible footage shows the terrifying moment Christopher Jones, 22, had an epileptic seizure while free-falling at 2743 m (9000 ft). Mr Jones,  from Perth, suffered the near-death experience while trying to do a left-hand turn in mid-air and was saved by his fast-acting sky diving instructor who opened his parachute with seconds to spare. Christopher Jones - with his parents Mike and Lia Jones - suffered an epileptic seizure while skydiving . Skydiving instructor Sheldon McFarlane's quick action to release Mr Jones' parachute saved his life . Skydiving instructor Sheldon McFarlane, 40, said Mr Jones had epilepsy but hadn't had a seizure in four years and had been given the all-clear by his doctor. 'He had all the documentation and had been to his doctor, he had been seizure-free for a number of years and believed he had it under control,' Mr McFarlane told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Jones said he dreamed of being a pilot but was unable to because of his condition, so he had decided to try skydiving instead. 'I'd been seizure-free for four years,' he told ABC. 'I've always wanted to have the feeling of flight, so I just thought, considering I can't fly a plane due to my condition, I thought I'd give it a go.' Footage filmed from Mr McFarlane's helmet camera shows  Mr Jones quickly lose consciousness after jumping out of a plane over Pinjarra, south of Perth, last November. The terrifying moment a skydiving student has a seizure while free-falling at 2743 m (9000 ft) Mr Jones suffered the near death experience while trying to do a left-hand turn . The 22-year-old was completing stage five of his Accelerated Free Fall program with an instructo . He can be seen flipping over and convulsing as he plummets 1524 m (5000 ft) towards the earth in 30 seconds. Mr McFarlane said he could see Mr Jones was spinning out of control but he did not realise he was having a seizure. 'He rolled over and was unconscious on his back and he started spinning,' he said. 'I thought he was having sensory overload or something, I wasn't quite sure what was going on. 'He was in the foetal positon.' Mr McFarlane said it was a tricky manoeuvre to get to Mr Jones and open his parachute, but said he was well-trained and had more than 20 years' experience as an instructor. Mr Jones pictured before jumping out of the light plane that was flying at 3658 m (12,000 ft) He quickly lost consciousness and can be seen convulsing as he plummets 1524 m in 30 seconds . 'I thought it would be better to go down and make him stop,' he said. 'I just wanted to make sure he was safe and his parachute was open sooner rather than later.' Mr Jones regained consciousness at 914 m (3000 ft) and managed to land safely on the ground. He was completing stage five of his Accelerated Free Fall program with an instructor at the WA Skydiving Academy in Jandakot, southern Perth. Mr McFarlane only found out Mr Jones had suffered a seizure once the ground, after Mr Jones entered the hangar and told him.

"Anyone who's been on a ski holiday will admit to have thinking it. 'Wouldn't this place be brilliant if we had it all to ourselves?' One way to avoid crowds on the slopes, is to hire out the whole resort exclusively - something one Utah ski village offers for $10,000. Eagle Point, in Utah, can host 200 people at its resort and while its slopes are open to the public from Thursday to Sunday, from Monday to Wednesday, skiers will have the lifts and the runs to themselves. Eagle Point in Utah can be hired out completely for almost $10,000 (£6,500) and can cater for 200 people . And while it sounds like the sort of thing that would only be exclusively accessed by the rich, royal or uber-famous, it's not. In theory, the whole place including accommodation and slopes with five lifts to access 600 acres of skiable powder, can be all yours for $50 (£32.50). Owner Shane Gadbaw, a former banker, rents out the whole resort privately for $10,000 (£6,486), which if split between 200 people works out at just $50 (£32.50) each. And because it's called the 'As You Wish Package', and the resort is run privately and not by some big, faceless corporation, it's all tailored to your group's needs. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Gadbaw says that three key virtues of an authentic ski and snowboard experience, affordable first class food service and a terrain for all levels make the resort what it is. The US resort offers stunning views out over Utah, while this luxury continues to the facilities and food on offer . Executive chef Jimmie McDowell ensures his food and his staff are of the highest standard for all the guests . 'Eagle Point resembles a ski resort of the classic era before high speed detachable lifts, luxury shopping villages and amusement park-like crowds and lines. Guests have the space to enjoy the snow and the mountains without fighting crowds. As a private, family-run operation, the culture of Eagle Point and its staff is set from the top. Our goal is simple: we want you to have an amazing time at our resort. You will find the friendliest and most helpful staff in the resort industry. 'From the personal escort to your condo at check-in, to the special attention to your kids in our ski school program, you will be treated like a special guest at our resort.' Most of the lodging is ski-in/ski-out and located within a short walk through the fresh powder from the main lodge. What better thing can there be after a testing day on the slopes than relaxing in the bar with friends and an alcoholic beverage? The resort caters for all levels of skier, and has the facilities to provide for all the family . 'Eagle Point is offering the opportunity to reserve the entire resort on an exclusive basis,' says the resort website. 'Imagine you and your friends, family, social or corporate group, enjoying exclusive access to 600 skiable acres, five lifts, the terrain park - and of course no lift lines! 'Stay in comfortable accommodations, with superb dining options and plenty of apres ski fun for everyone - all tailored to your group's priorities and interests. 'This is your chance to be king of the mountain.' The resort can be booked privately from Monday through until Wednesday, and could cost you just £35 . Clearly the package is most attractive to corporate groups and its convenient position 241 miles or a less than four-hour drive from Las Vegas doesn't hurt at all. By comparison, the much more famous Vail in Colorado is a three hours and 15 minute flight away. The Canyonside Lodges which includes The Outpost Grill restaurant dishing up American cuisine for breakfast, lunch and dinner and a bar, two fireplaces, and five televisions. The Lodge is also the hub at night-time with live music and dancing guaranteed on Saturdays with a host of acts coming over from Vegas. The accommodation is a step back in time to what we'd consider a classic ski resort, with a village feel and an array of suites, condos, cottages and holiday homes, along with lodgings in Beaver City, a Mormon-settled town of about 2,500 people. The heavy snowfall has mean Eagle Point has maintained a steady influx of customers to its slopes . The region boasts 40 feet of snow annually, and famously fun powder at that. Although this year hasn't been a good one for Eagle Point, it's turned around in the past week. After a brief closure in February it was planned that from February 21 the slopes would only be open on weekends due to a lack of snow fall and warm weather. However Mother Nature delivered and from yesterday regular service as resumed, albeit with a very generous free skiing for all on Sundays, as long as you sign up to the mailing list. The resort will cater for skiers as well as snowboarders and can provide all the equipment to make your stay memorable . Mr Gadbaw added: 'While not as large as the mega resorts of Colorado and Northern Utah, Eagle Point has 600 acres of terrain that will suit all levels. 'Our steep terrain is the most thrilling in the region and rivals the same at any of the mega resorts. The groomers will keep the casual skiers and snowboarders smiling and shushing throughout their stay. 'Also, the resort is situated like two resorts - divided by skill level - with all of the steep terrain and one side and the groomers on another. This allows a clustering of like-skilled skiers and snowboarders together.'","Eagle Point resort in Utah can be hired for what works out at £32.50 a night providing you fill capacity .

"Police in Manchester stopped a motorist who was about to remove a wheel clamp from his car using a petrol-powered saw. Officers on patrol in the Deansgate area of the city noticed the man with the powerful cutting tool at 11.45pm on Monday. The blue BMW 3-series was immobilised by the DVLA because it was understood to be untaxed. Police spoke with a motorist they observed standing near his clamped car with a petrol-powered saw . The BMW 3 series was immobilised with a clamp by the DVLA in Deansgate, Manchester City Centre . According to Greater Manchester Police no arrests were made at the scene because officers intervened before any damage was inflicted on the clamp. It is understood that the motorist had a two-stroke petrol-powered Stihl saw with a metal cutting disc. The DVLA has the power to immediately clamp or impound any car if it is not properly taxed. Car owners can notify authorities if they are not using the car and sign statutory declaration that the car is off the road. However, if they sign the declaration and continue to use the car, it can be seized. Motorists who have been clamped by the DVLA have to provide evidence that they have taxed their car before it can be released. If a car has not been taxed, the motorist will have to pay a 'surety' deposit of £700 to have it released. According to the DVLA the cost of having a clamp removed increases the longer the car is immobilised. If a driver refuses to pay, the DVLA will destroy or sell the car to recoup some of the costs. The DVLA clamped a number of cars following an inspection in Manchester City Centre last night .","The motorist was spotted by police in Deansgate, Manchester City centre .

"The mother of Ashley Johnston has revealed how she did not know her son was fighting against ISIS until he was killed in Iraq. The former Australian soldier was reportedly fighting for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in Iraq and Syria but was killed on February 24. The truck he was travelling in reportedly broke down and his group were 'outnumbered and outgunned' by ISIS fighters. A fellow fighter also recalled how Johnston died, saying the Australian 'sacrificed himself' for his comrades. This comes as Johnston said in his final interview before his death, that he was afraid of returning home because he thought he'd be treated like a terrorist. Scroll down for video . A former Australian soldier was reportedly fighting for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in Iraq and Syria but was killed on February 24 . The Lions of Rojava, a band of volunteers that help recruit soldiers to the YPG, claimed Ashley Johnston was 'outnumbered and outgunned' The Australian reportedly died on February 24 in a small village near Shingal in Iraq, close to the border with Syrian Kurdistan . Amanda Johnston, of Canberra, told The Sydney Morning Herald that she thought her son was with the Kurds because he was doing some humanitarian work. Ms Johnston said she only knew of his whereabouts from a text message sent by her son on December 30. Johnston had informed his mother that he was in the Middle East 'supporting the Kurdish people'. Ms Johnston learnt of her son's death on Thursday, saying she was shocked by the news and is in disbelief that he was killed while fighting ISIS. 'I just kept calling because I didn't believe it was true. I know in my head that it is actually Ash but the rest of me doesn't like to believe it's true,' she said. 'I just said, ""I need to talk to you. You have to ring me. I don't believe that what I've been told is true. I need you to ring me and tell me what's going on … I need to hear your voice.""' It is believed the 28-year-old's remains are in an unstable area near the Iraq and Syria border. However measures are being taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in order to bring his body back home, The Sydney Morning Herald reports. The Lions of Rojava posted this tribute to the Australian man they claim has been killed while fighting for them . It is believed the 28-year-old's remains are in an unstable area near the Iraq and Syria border . Measures are being taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in order to bring Mr Johnston's body back home . Ashley Johnston told Vanity Fair reporter James Harking he was afraid of a lengthy prison sentence back in Australia. The 28-year-old, from Queensland, served for seven years with Australia's Army Reserves before going travelling and becoming moved by struggle of ethnic Kurds against ISIS militants who have taken control of large parts of Syria of Iraq. He fought in Iraq and Syria with the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, known by the acronym YPG, under the name Heval Bagok Serhed and was reportedly killed on February 24 in a small village near Shingal in Iraq, close to the border with Syrian Kurdistan. Fellow comrades say Johnston died after a military tank was encircled by ISIS fighters, so the Australian sacrificed himself as he 'jumped out of the panzer to cover us' A fellow fighter detailed one of the final conversations she had with Johnston, who said that he fought for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) because he 'couldn't take the children and women that ISIS-thugs slaughtered' The Lions Of Rojava said in a statement: 'What we can disclose is his story of heroism and self-sacrifice for the Kurdish people. Throughout his time in Kurdistan he had a positive impact on my people's lives though his humility and kindness to everyone he met. 'He was taken from us in a heroic assault on ISIS positions in a small village near Shingal. His squad of eight fighters were in a truck which had broken down and it was critical that they dislodge ISIS from their positions so they pushed on fearlessly with little regard for their own safety. 'They were massively outnumbered and outgunned but fearless in the face of this as they knew another ISIS death meant saving the lives of countless civilians. He was a fearless and exceptional soldier as well a great man,' the Facebook statement read. Days later, a fellow fighter Bejan Dagli a YPJ fighter, told of her final moments spent with Johnston on the same Facebook page. When she asked the former Australian soldier why he was fighting for YPG he said: 'ISIS is a world's problem. I couldn't take the children and women that ISIS-thugs did slaughtered and that's why l have come to Kurdistan.' Dagli says other comrades who witnessed Johnston's death said that 'he sacrificed himself for us'. When asked how, one of the comrades responded with tears in her eyes: 'The panzer that we were inside was encircled by the ISIS-thugs and he jumped out of the panzer to cover us that we could break the encirclement and then he got martyred while trying to cover us and break the siege.' Dagli also released photos she had taken of Johnston just five days before his death and wrote about how he was picking up Kurdish. Ashley Johnston (front, second from right) has been remembered by his friends as the 'best mate' Fighter Bejan Dagli wrote about the final moments of former Australian soldier Ashley Johnston . This comes after the YPG shared the grotesque images and celebratory message on their 'Lions of Rojava' Facebook page, claiming that the murders by YPG and YPJ were in the name of Ashley Johnston, his family and for Australia. 'The YPG & YPJ has killed many ISIS terrorists pigs in Til Hemis,' they wrote. 'Our Comrade from Australia, Heval Bagok Serhed, was martyred during the liberation of Til Hemis.' They gloated that the slaughter was a form of payback for Johnston, who they refer to as a 'martyr'. In the images soldiers hug, smile and pose with the peace symbol. 'We took revenge for Heval Bagok, for his family, Australia and the world. His comrades says that it was a revenge for him and his family.' Ashley Johnston, 28, originally from Maryborough, Queensland but had most recently been living in Canberra, was remembered by friends and colleagues from an Australian army rifle brigade as 'a good man' and 'the best mate'. It is understood that Johnston is the first foreign casualty from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG). 'Defence is aware that a former Australian Army Reserve member is believed to have been killed in northern Iraq while allegedly fighting with Peshmerga forces against Daesh,' the ADF said in a statement. 'Due to the provisions of the Privacy Act, Defence will not release further information about the former member's military service or their personal details.'","Australian Ashley Johnston was killed in Iraq while fighting ISIS .

"Jihadi John  told MI5 he was a moderate Muslim as he desperately tried explain why he had been picked up in terror-plagued east Africa, new tapes reveal. Cage, the campaign group criticised for blamed the ISIS killer's actions on Britain, today released a recording of a 2009 interview they carried out with Mohammed Emwazi - unmasked as Jihadi John last week. In the recording, Emwazi tells how he was questioned by British security services after he was flown home from Tanzania  suspected of trying to join  Somali terror group al-Shabaab. The ISIS killer complained that he was being 'threatened' by MI5 and moaned that agents were 'putting words in his mouth'. Three years after his claims he wasn't an extremist, Emwazi appeared in Syria beheading Western hostages in ISIS videos. Mohammed Emwazi (pictured, left, in 2009 and, right, while a student University of Westminster) - known as Jihadi John - was recorded by campaign group Cage complaining about his treatment by MI5 in the years before he went to Syria to join terror group ISIS . In the new tapes, Emwazi said he spoke to an MI5 officer following his return from Tanzania and was questioned over his views on Islam and terrorism. In a recording released today, he told Cage: '[The MI5 agent] said: ""Mohammed, what do you think of 7/7?"" I said: ""Innocent people  have died.""' He added: 'He started telling me: ""What do you think of 9/11?"" I told him: ""This is a wrong thing. What happened was wrong. What do you want me to say?"". 'If I had the opportunity for those lives to come back then I would make those lives come back. I don’t think... I think what happened is wrong.' But the MI5 agent did not believe his views were moderate and replied: 'I still believe you are going to Somalia to train.' Emwazi moaned: 'He said: 'We are going to keep a close eye on you, Mohammed. We already have been and we are going to keep a close eye on you' - threatening me.' Cage have released the tape as part of their widely-criticised claims that Emwazi was 'harassed' by security services. They were slammed after releasing a statement entitled 'Jihadi John: 'Radicalised' By Britain' last week and tried to blame authorities for his actions. Cage's statement claimed that Emwazi 'desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation, but the system ultimately rejected him'. The reported interview with MI5 took place after Emwazi was refused entry to Tanzania because authorities suspected he was trying to get to Somalia, where terrorist organisation al-Shabaab have been known to train British militants. In the recordings, Emwazi (pictured in the ISIS beheading videos which earned him the nickname 'Jihadi John')  claims he condemned previous attacks such as 9/11 and 7/7 when he was questioned by an agent . The recordings were released by human rights group Cage, who have been widely criticised for trying to blame British authorities for Emwazi's actions . Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebolajo was picked up by the SAS and MI5 in similar fashion as he tried to enter the east African country in November 2010. Extremist Samantha Lewthwaite - known as the 'White Widow' after her bomber husband Germaine Lindsay took part in the 7/7 London attacks - is also believed to be part of the al-Shabaab. The year after his recorded conversation with Cage, Emwazi contacted Mail on Sunday Security Editor Robert Verkaik in December 2010. He told Mr Verkaik he feared MI5 were following him and wrote in an email: 'Sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking, not fearing they may kill me.' Mr Verkaik recalled: 'Like many young Muslim men at the time who I had interviewed, he appeared to have a grievance against the police and MI5. But this man was different – in him was a warped sense of injustice that could never justify the barbaric acts of murder that he has gone on to carry out in Syria.' After foiled attempts to go to his father's home country, Kuwait, and to get a teaching job in Saudi Arabia, Emwazi slipped out of Britain and later appeared in Syria. He has since gained global notoriety as the masked killer of Western hostages including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines in ISIS beheading videos which have shocked the world. Emwazi was interviewed after he was picked up by authorities in Tanzania in 2009, suspected of trying to get into Somalia to join Islamist group al-Shabaab (pictured) Other British extremists have also been linked to al-Shabaab - including Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebolajo and 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite . Cage has been widely criticised for its defence of Emwazi after he was unmasked as Jihadi John last week. Asim Qureshi, leader of campaign group, caused outrage by saying the murderer was 'beautiful' adding that he 'wouldn't hurt a fly'. Reg Henning, brother of British aid worker Alan Henning who died at Jihadi John's hands, replied saying: 'If he's a ""beautiful, kind man"", why is he killing innocent civilians? 'He's a monster. Everyone should be doing everything they can to capture him and bring him to justice - not stick up for him like he's been hard done by.' Amnesty International yesterday distanced itself from Cage, saying: 'We do not support all of Cage's views or agree with how it expresses them.' Charities who fund Cage are also under investigation by the Charity Commission, which said the group's public statement 'raises questions for a charity considering funding its activity. The moaning voice of Mohammed Emwazi in recordings of him complaining to Cage appears to sound different from that in the speeches against the West made by Jihadi John in ISIS's horrific beheading videos last year. The whining tone of Emwazi recorded in 2009 was more nasal and higher-pitched than the deeper voice that speaks over the gruesome films posted online from Syria. The difference suggests ISIS either used another militant to voice over the films or may have doctored or slowed down Emwazi's voice to make him appear more fearsome in the propaganda films. It would not be the first time the militant group have been suspected of digitally-enhancing videos to increase the appeal to their followers. A recent sickening film showing 21 Coptic Christians being beheaded on a beach in Libya is widely thought to have been photoshopped. Experts say the jihadists in the footage were altered to look much taller than their captives and a scene showing sea water stained with blood was created using special effects. Jihadi John in his own words: Full transcript of how Mohammed Emwazi tried to get off the hook amid suspicions he wanted to train with terrorists . Mohammed Emwazi went to campaign group Cage in 2009 after he was questioned by MI5 over his suspected links to terrorism. Describing the interview he said: '[The MI5 agent] said; ""I want to ask you some serious questions now"" and while I'm packing my bag, while I'm packing some of my stuff, I said yeah, go on, ask. 'He said: ""No I'd like you to sit, face to face while I ask you some questions. 'I said, these must be some serious questions. let’s get down to it, I sat and looked at him face to face now. 'He looked at men and said Mohammed, what do you think about 7/7?"" 'I said, innocent people have died. What do you think, I think this is extremism. Emwazi said he was asked on his views of the 7/7 bombings when interview and told them they were 'wrong' 'He said: ""Ok, what do you think of the war in Afghanistan?"" 'I said what do I think, we see the news. Innocent people are getting killed. 'And he starts telling me what do you think about 9/11?"" 'I told him this is a wrong thing, what happened was wrong. what do you want me to say? 'If I had an opportunity for those brother's lives to come back then I'd make those lives come back. I would. It was wrong. 'He said ""what do I think of Jews?"" They're a religion. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs. I don't force no-one. 'He wanted to know about my background, about my creed. 'I told him this is how Islam is, we don't force anyone to come into our religion. Everyone has their own right. He is said to have been questioned by intelligence officers at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, where he was flown after being refused entry to Tanzania . 'I told him everything that was happened, all bombs or whatever that happened was from extremists. 'After all this he came back and looked at me and said I still think you're going to Somalia to train. 'I said after what I just told you, after I told you that what happening is extremism you're still suggesting I'm an extremist? 'He said yeah and started going on, trying to put words in my mouth. 'And we're going to keep a close eye on you Mohammed, we already have been, and we're going to keep a close eye on you. threatening me.'","Campaign group release recording of Mohammed Emwazi speaking in 2009 .

"Hillary  Clinton used only a personal email address to conduct official government business during her four-year tenure as Secretary of State in a 'serious' breach of protocol, officials have said. The 67-year-old former first lady  did not acquire nor use a government email account while serving in the position from January 2009 to February 2013, State Department officials said. She also failed to preserve her  correspondence on the State Department's servers - something that is required of officials under the US Federal Records Act - until two months ago. And even then, her aides allegedly decided which of her tens of thousands of personal emails  to hand over to the department in Washington D.C.'s Harry S. Truman Building for the public record. They ultimately chose to release 55,000 pages of correspondence as she stepped down from the role in 2013, the New York Times reported. Scroll down for video . 'Unsecured emails': Hillary Clinton used only a personal email address to conduct government business during her four-year tenure as Secretary of State in a 'serious' breach of protocol, officials have claimed . On Monday, Jeb Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told DailyMail.com: 'Hillary Clinton should release her emails. Hopefully she hasn't already destroyed them. Governor Bush believes transparency is a critical part of public service and of governing.' The Florida governor, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president in 2016, added on Twitter: 'Transparency matters. Unclassified @HillaryClinton emails should be released. You can see mine, here. http://jebbushemails.com.' National Archives and Records Administration officials and government watchdogs have expressed concern over Mrs Clinton's 'extensive' use of a private account, deeming it 'insecure'. On Monday, Jason R Baron, ex-director of litigation at NARA, told the newspaper that such a situation was 'inconceivable' - particularly in relation to a Secretary of State's correspondence. 'It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario - short of nuclear winter - where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level-head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business,' he said. Mr Baron, now a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath, added that although Mrs Clinton is not the first official to use a personal email address for business matters, her sole use of it is unusual. Concern: The 67-year-old former first lady (right) reportedly did not acquire nor use a government email account while serving in the position from 2009 to 2013. On Monday, Jason R Baron (left), ex-director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, said such a situation was 'inconceivable' Criticism: On Monday night, Florida Governor - and possible 2016 Republican presidential candidate - Jeb Bush called upon Clinton to release her emails, saying: 'Transparency matters' Opponent: Bush, seen at a Las Vegas community center on Monday, has shared his emails with the public . 'I can recall no instance... when a high-ranking official at an executive branch agency solely used a personal email account for the transaction of government business,' he told the newspaper. Hillary Clinton's spokesperson Nick Merrill released a statement regarding the claims on Tuesday morning: . 'Like Secretaries of State before her, she used her own email account when engaging with any Department officials. For government business, she emailed them on their Department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained. When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes. Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved. As a result of State’s request for our help to make sure they in fact were, that is what happened here. As the Department stated, it is in the process of updating its record preservation policies to bring them in line with its retention responsibilities.' Mrs Clinton may have violated federal requirements involving the State Department's retention of officials' correspondence by not preserving her correspondence on its servers, the Times reported. Her aides reportedly did not take any action to have her emails recorded - only unveiling them in January after officials launched a new initiative to comply with federal record-keeping practices. 'It’s a shame it didn’t take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have,' remarked Thomas S. Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive in Washington D.C. He added: 'Personal emails are not secure. Senior officials should not be using them.' Mrs Clinton's spokesman, Nick Merrill, has defended the likely Democratic presidential candidate's use of a personal email address, saying she had complied with the 'letter and spirit of the rules'. Mr Merrill said that Mrs Clinton had expected her emails would be retained. But he declined to detail why she chose to conduct business from her personal account, instead of a government one. Under federal law, emails sent and received by officials - such as the Secretary of State - are seen as government records. They are, therefore, required to be retained by the State Department. Family: Mrs Clinton is seen with  husband, former president Bill Clinton, and their daughter Chelsea in 2000 . Several exceptions to the law include sensitive or classified material. Between 2009 and 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration also required such correspondence to be preserved. According to the Times, most experts believe that private email accounts should only be used for official government business in emergencies, for both security and in the interest of the public. Indeed, since coming into office, current Secretary of State John Kerry, has used a government email account and continues to retain his correspondence on record, according to his aides. It is unclear what security measures were in place on Mrs Clinton's personal account during her time as Secretary of State. It also unknown how many emails she exchanged while she was in office. The former Secretary of State, who has a daughter, Chelsea, with husband Bill, is widely considered the front-runner for next year's Democratic presidential nomination if she decides to enter the race. Mrs Clinton's spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment . In a statement, State Department deputy spokesman, Marie Harf, told DailyMail.com: 'The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton’s records - including emails between her and Department officials with state.gov accounts. 'Last year, the Department sent a letter to representatives of former secretaries of state requesting they submit any records in their possession for proper preservation as part of our effort to continually improve our records preservation and management. Politician: Since coming into office, current Secretary of State John Kerry (pictured on Monday), has used a government email account and continues to retain his correspondence on record, according to his aides . 'In response to our request, Secretary Clinton provided the Department with emails spanning her time at the Department. 'After the State Department reviewed those emails, last month the State Department produced about 300 emails responsive to recent requests from the Select Committee. 'The Department is in the process of updating our records preservation policies to bring them in line with recent 2013 National Archives and Records Administration guidance.' She added Mr Kerry is the first Secretary of State to 'rely primarily on a state.gov email account'. It comes as a family charity which was founded by Mr Clinton remains under scrutiny for accepting millions of dollars in donations from foreign countries while Mrs Clinton was at the State Department. Two weeks ago, the Clinton Foundation admitted to violating an ethics agreement with the U.S. government while Clinton was in the president's cabinet. It had promised to stop cashing checks from foreign governments with which it had not previously done business. But in 2010 it took $500,000 in 2010 from Algeria - a country that was lobbying State at the same time - without asking the federal government for permission.","Hillary Clinton used only personal email account to conduct business .

"The sight of an aspiring model who had bleach thrown in her face was saved by a friend splashing her eyes with Pepsi. Victoria Smith, 17, was left with raw burns and hair loss when a school bully attacked her at a party shouting: ‘Here’s your shot of bleach.’ Yesterday a judge sentenced Rebecca Morris, then also 17, to 27 months behind bars for the assault, which he described as a ‘spiteful and vengeful act’. Miss Smith, who modelled under the name Toria Melody and at the time dyed her hair bright pink, had been bullied by Morris at the college where they were studying, the court heard. Victoria Smith, 17, was left with raw burns and hair loss when a school bully attacked her at a party in Hull in August last year, while shouting: ‘Here’s your shot of bleach' Morris was suspended as a result and began threatening to attack her accuser with bleach. ‘She knew she was a model and it was designed to burn and disfigure,’ said Stephen Welch, prosecuting. But her sight was saved when a quick-thinking friend carrying some Pepsi splashed it over her burning eyes. The assault came in a carefully-planned ambush in which Miss Smith was lured to a house party in their home town of Hull last August. First aid manuals stress the vital importance of flushing out the eyes with lukewarm water if they come into contact with harmful chemicals. Ideally the eyes will be bathed for at least 15-20 minutes to dilute the substance and remove as much of it as possible before it can cause damage. If water isn’t available, alternative liquids such as soft drinks can also be suitable – making the action of Miss Smith’s friend an admirable improvisation. However, once an acid or alkali enters the eye, there is usually no specific benefit in using the opposite to try to neutralise it. She was unaware that Morris was there but became suspicious that something was wrong and left. Her tormentor then followed her down the street and flung the bleach in her face with the aim of ruining her looks. A previous hearing heard that Morris shouted: ‘Here’s your shot of bleach instead of your shot of vodka. This is for getting me thrown out of college’. She could have suffered permanent damage to her sight had it not been for ‘a friend who irrigated her eyes with the soft drink she was carrying’, Judge David Tremberg told Hull Crown Court. ‘This was an assault which was unprovoked and premeditated.’ However, Miss Smith needed treatment in hospital, continues to suffer chronic dryness in her eyes and had to wear a wig as a result of damage to her hair. She also suffered severe psychological harm – leaving her feeling unable to socialise with friends – and made a suicide attempt two months later. Writing on Facebook after the attack, Miss Smith said: ‘The outer layer of my eyes are permanently damaged and my hair has turned green from the bleach and has fallen out at the front. Miss Smith (pictured left and right arriving at court) could have suffered permanent damage to her sight had it not been for ‘a friend who irrigated her eyes with the soft drink she was carrying’, Hull Crown Court told . ‘I have burns on my body from all the chemicals inside the bleach and I am in excruciating pain in my eyes. They are red raw, it went in my mouth, up my nose and I couldn’t breathe.’ The judge added that Miss Smith – who did not attend court – ‘used to pride herself in her appearance and her hair’ but now suffers ‘flashbacks [and] panic attacks’. Rebecca Morris was sentenced to 27 months behind bars for the assault . He told Morris: ‘The emotional harm you have caused has been grave. Since the offence her life has changed. She has lost confidence, she feels unable to go out and socialise... indeed she feels barely able to go out socially at all.’ Morris was also handed a four-year restraining order against Miss Smith after pleading guilty at a previous hearing to applying a corrosive fluid, with intent to burn, maim, disfigure or disable or to do some grievous bodily harm. She will serve her sentence at a young offenders’ institution. Afterwards Detective Sergeant Chris Coupland, of Humberside Police, said Miss Smith could have been seriously injured. ‘It followed a prolonged bullying campaign by Morris which caused her victim a great deal of distress,’ he added. ‘I hope Morris’s sentence serves as a warning to others.’ The attack comes amid mounting concern over a rise in the number of acid or bleach attacks. Last year a newspaper investigation revealed there had been 21 court cases involving the throwing or sending of dangerous substances in 2013 – compared to just five the previous year. One of the most notorious cases came in 2008 when model Katie Piper sustained horrendous injuries after an ex-boyfriend arranged for acid to be thrown in her face.","Victoria Smith, 17, was left with raw burns and hair loss after attack in Hull .

And on a tablet, a music app and playback was controlled by virtually pressing the play button. A previous version, which measured gestures from 19 inches (50cm) away, was showcased at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. This demo introduced Multi Layer Interaction (MLI) which lets mobiles and tablets display different content depending on the location and distance a user’s hand is from the device. By using technology that is already inside smartphones along with software that can sit on top of existing operating systems, Elliptic Labs hopes to launch the technology in handsets later this year.

"A northeast Ohio bridal store linked to Ebola nurse Amber Vinson has put its building up for sale after announcing plans to close. Miss Vinson, 30, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio in October. The store temporarily closed and was cleaned before reopening, but its owner, Anna Younker, said there was a lingering 'stigma' and business failed to bounce back. On Friday she announced on the shop's Facebook page that the bank has now cut off the business credit line, forcing her to sell the building for $338,000. Negative press: Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio, (above) which was linked to Ebola nurse Amber Vinson, is now up for sale after business failed to bounce back . Chain of events: Miss Vinson, 30, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas (pictured), was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting the shop in October . The store, located at 1220 E. Tallmadge Ave., is listed with Cutler Real Estate. Particulars describe it as a 'great 4,000 sq ft brick retail building, built in 1996 with eye-catching curb appeal. 'The space would be ideal for beauty shop, message facility, auto parts store, doctors/dentist office, day-care center or veterinarian with plenty of parking.' Younker, who has been in business for 30 years, said her shop became known as the 'Ebola store' after news of Vinson's visit hit the press. She claims that the temporary closure and canceled orders cost the store at least $100,000. The loss wasn't covered by her insurance because the plan excludes viral illnesses. Ms Younker told NewsNet5 that Miss Vinson, who was visiting her hometown for a few days to plan for her wedding, should have been more careful. Sanitisation process: The store temporarily closed and was cleaned before reopening, but its owner, Anna Younker, said there was a lingering 'stigma' and business failed to bounce back . 'I wish that now she knew better not to travel. The impact its had on me is huge,' the store owner said. 'Never in a million years did I expect something like this to cause our business to have to close.' Ms Younker said she was particularly offended when Miss Vinson asked for a $480 refund on her bridesmaid dresses. Miss Vinson, who recovered from Ebola nine days after treatment, asked that the shop refund her bridesmaids the $479.89 they paid for their dresses, via her attorney. Ms Younker said the refund request feel like 'a slap in the face'. In January she posted a message to customers on Facebook, announcing that her business would be closing down. 'Despite our best efforts, we simply have been unable to recover,' she wrote. 'The decision for me to close was not easy for me. Anna Younker (above), who has been in business for 30 years, said her shop became known as the 'Ebola store' after news of Vinson's visit hit . 'Over the years I have met and worked with the most amazing brides, mothers of brides, bridesmaids, prom girls and many other wonderful people. 'I want to thank all our customers, the people in our community and the well wishers from afar for being so supportive. Your kind words and loyalty have been great comfort. 'I also want to thank my amazing staff for all of their hard work and dedication to our customers and our business. I appreciate your understanding and support.' One of the four staff members losing their jobs, Kayla Litz, told NewsNet5 that the Ebola scare had been particularly worrying for her because she was in her first trimester of pregnancy at the time. Ms Litz came through the quarantine period of 21 days Ebola-free along with the other employees of the store. The store is still filling orders that were made through January and plans to shut for good in May. Akron officials had considered ideas to help relocate or save the store, but its operators said they didn't plan to take the city up on that offer.","Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio announced its closure in January after it never recovered from its link with Ebola .

"Barclays today announced its annual profits were up 12 per cent to £5.5billion in 2014. CEO Antony Jenkins took a £1.1million bonus, taking his overall pay package to £5.5million, as he said the bank is in its best position since the 2008 financial crash. But Mr Jenkins also revealed Barclays has set aside another £750million to pay fines for rigging foreign currency rates, taking its total bill for the scandal to £1.25billion. His payout will prove controversial after a year in which Barclays slashed 14,000 jobs - with another 5,000 to go by 2016 - and closed a net 72 branches. This morning shares were down around 5p to £2.58 each when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning. Barclays boss: Antony Jenkins has accept his first bonus since taking the helm in 2012, as his bank enjoyed £.5.5billion profits for 2014 . The High Street bank is braced for huge penalties from UK and US regulators after refusing to reach a settlement in November. Today it was announced Barclays also added £200 million to provide for the ongoing compensation programme for customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. Antony Jenkins had assured investors that the 2014 bonus round would be 'less controversial' after a bitter row last year. Shareholders were furious that bonus payments reached £2.4billion in 2013 despite falling profits. This year, with improved results, the bonus pool is around £1.8billion. Calling his own bonus 'appropriate' he said today: 'Barclays today is a stronger business, with better prospects, than at any time since the financial crisis.' He added: 'You have to look at the very significant progress that we have made in Barclays in the two-and-a-half years that I have been chief executive. 'I completely understand that I am very well remunerated for what I do. But I think it is appropriate that I accept my bonus. 'It is not a decision I take lightly and I declined it in the previous two years. When I come to 2015, I will do the same careful thinking about whether I should accept it given the progress the bank has made.' Mr Jenkins' bonus is his first since taking the helm in 2012 and will be justified because Barclays' profits rose this year and were  around £300million better than expected. But it remains in trouble after its bankers were found to be rigging foreign currency rates. Barclays drew fire from investors last November after it declined to be part of a settlement reached between six banks – including HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland – and the Financial Conduct Authority and US watchdog the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Banks, including Barclays, face fines from a range of regulators, including the Department of Justice and the New York State Department of Financial Services, for manipulating the £3.5trillion-a-day forex market. Contrast: After a year Barclays has described as its best since 2014, it recorded a rise in pre-tax profits and reduced its bonus pot to a five-year low . But when the other five banks involved settled last, Barclays did not, so could face a higher fine as a result. It said today it was seeking a 'more general co-ordinated settlement' - with other authorities in the US still investigating the scandal. Barclays said it is reviewing its foreign exchange trading over a several-year period and continuing to co-operate with relevant bodies, and that these probes could result in 'substantial monetary penalties'. Mr Jenkins said: 'We remain focused on addressing outstanding conduct issues, including those related to foreign exchange trading. 'I regard the behaviour at the centre of these investigations as wholly incompatible with our values, and I share the frustration of colleagues and shareholders that matters like these continue to cast a shadow over our business. 'But resolving these issues is an important part of our plan for Barclays and, although it may be difficult, I expect that we will make significant progress on this issue in 2015.' Finance director Tushar Morzaria said: 'We will take action where that is required up to and including termination of employment.' Staff involved in the scandal could also see bonuses clawed back, he added. The bank has not disclosed information about employees being fired or suspended over the affair. Changes: In 2014 Barclays slashed 14,000 jobs - with another 5,000 to go by 2016 - and closed a net 72 branches . The results come after a year in which Barclays shut 89 branches while opening 17 amid an increasing push for customers to contact it via Skype or by telephone, or to use post office banking or new sites in Asda stores. Mr Morzaria said: 'We have no target for branch closures. It is really a reflection of how our customers choose to bank.' Investec analyst Ian Gordon described the statutory result after accounting for one-off charges as 'weak'. But Shore Capital's Gary Greenwood said: 'Despite the earnings shortfall versus our estimates... we believe that the company is making good progress towards reshaping the business and improving balance sheet strength.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Profits have fallen at Barclays Bank and they have had to make huge provision for fines. 'The chief executive rightly recognises that the bank's culture must change, but it is hard to have a positive view of any organisation that pays its boss £5.5 million in a single year - a sum that would take a full-time worker on the minimum wage 465 years to earn.'","Barclays' results are best since the 2008 financial crisis, bank says .

"Louise Thomas, 43, from Cheam, was convinced she was suffering panic attacks . Panic attacks are extremely common, with one in ten of us thought to suffer from them at least occasionally. Louise Thomas - and her doctors - were convinced she was one of the millions affected. A panic attack typically causes a faster heartbeat, dizziness, nausea and an overwhelming sense of anxiety. Mother-of-two Louise had experienced such episodes regularly for seven years. 'In my early 30s, I started having episodes of feeling very nervous and anxious, with butterflies in my stomach and a feeling of being on edge,' says the 43-year-old. 'This could last all day. Sometimes, I wouldn't know where the last 30 seconds had gone and would feel confused, but still nervous and agitated, wondering what had just happened.' She was prescribed antidepressants and tried talking therapies, but nothing helped. That's because Louise, from Cheam, Surrey, wasn't suffering from panic attacks at all, but epileptic seizures. Her problems were neurological rather than psychological. And her story is not uncommon. As Paul Salkovskis, professor of clinical psychology at the University of Bath, explains, the symptoms of a panic attack can overlap with an epileptic seizure. 'It's not unusual for people with panic attacks to get an incorrect preliminary diagnosis of epilepsy, and occasionally, people with epilepsy get a misdiagnosis of panic attacks. If they see a specialist, it is usually clarified,' he says. Unfortunately, Louise didn't see a specialist for years. So how can the conditions be confused? Epilepsy, which affects more than 600,000 people in the UK, is characterised by recurrent seizures or sudden bursts of intense, abnormal electrical activity in the brain that disrupt the way it works. But there are many kinds of epileptic seizure. Dr Hannah Cock, consultant neurologist at St George's Hospital, London, and the University of London, says: 'The bit of the brain where the seizure starts and the path where the electrical discharge then spreads can vary enormously between individuals - which is why there are so many different ways people can experience an epileptic seizure.' One such example is with gelastic seizures - where patients may burst out laughing for no apparent reason, because the part of the brain involved in the seizure is also involved in laughter. Other seizures may involve a feeling of deja vu, which can make diagnosis difficult, since this is 'a normal phenomenon that we all sometimes experience', says Dr Cock, who is also clinical adviser to the charity Epilepsy Action. 'As the experience is so recurrent and frequent, it usually becomes clear that something else is going on,' she says. 'Or if the laughing attack is followed by losing consciousness and having a convulsion, diagnosis is easier.' Louise struggled to understand what was happening for seven years after her first episode . But a further complication is that seizures may cause someone to panic, adds Professor Salkovskis. 'It's perfectly possible that people with epilepsy will get panicky at the prospect of having a seizure. And in panic attacks, people hyperventilate, which can trigger an epileptic attack in people who are vulnerable to it.' One key differences between them is that while a seizure can lead to loss of consciousness, a panic attack usually won't, he says. But diagnosis can be hard, as there's no definitive test for epilepsy. An MRI scan can identify possible causes such as scarring on the brain, while an electroencephalogram, where electrodes are attached to the scalp, can help detect unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy. But this can also be normal in people with epilepsy, or show minor changes in people without. After her first episode, Louise looked up her symptoms online, which suggested she'd had a panic attack. Her GP suggested it was a delayed reaction to an incident a couple of years earlier, when she found an intruder breaking in to her house. 'This seemed to make sense. I'd been a quivering wreck at the time. I was a busy mum with two young kids, so I was a bit stressed.' The next seven years were fraught as Louise struggled to understand what was happening. She became a 'nervous wreck'. 'I went back and forth to the doctor's - I must have seen ten GPs in total - but, each time, I was told it sounded like panic attacks or depression. 'I remember the terms ""post-traumatic disorder"" and ""generalised anxiety disorder"" were also used. But there was never further investigation. I was given antidepressants and, one time, a Valium-type drug to calm me down.' But the drugs didn't work, and Louise would stop taking them after a few months. Husband Vincent took Louise to the GP and explained the attacks from his perspective - and her episodes were finally diagnosed corretly . 'I was just told to take them again. I even tried cognitive behaviour therapy online and had requested counselling, but nothing helped,' she says. 'This just fuelled my stress. I became a stroppy, emotional rollercoaster. My poor husband, Vincent, had to cope with me just going through the motions.' Meanwhile, her 'panic attacks' were getting worse: she was having five a day and experiencing urinary incontinence when they occurred. 'A few times, I fell down the stairs and was badly bruised; other times, I burnt myself on the oven and the iron. I even drove into a tree with both children in the car. Fortunately, I was going slowly, but it was terrifying. At that point, I knew something was really wrong.' In 2011, seven years after the panic attacks began, Vincent took Louise to the GP and explained the attacks from his perspective. 'He said that when I had an attack, I'd involuntarily raise my arm and start tutting. I wasn't even aware of this. But despite it sounding so odd, the GP still seemed to think this could tie in with a panic attack, so we decided to see a neurologist privately for a second opinion.' The specialist diagnosed Louise with temporal lobe epilepsy, a common type affecting the part of the brain concerned with emotion and hearing, as well as language and memory. The cause, in her case, was unknown, although brain tumours, head injuries, brain infections and strokes can all cause epilepsy. Dr Cock says: 'In temporal lobe seizures, common warning signs are feelings of intense anxiety, fear and panic, so these are ones more likely to be misdiagnosed as panic attacks. Structures in and close to the temporal lobe may also cause the heart to race and the sweating that may go along with it. 'Other signs may include deja vu and some experience ""gastric rising"" - that feeling in the stomach when you go over a humpback bridge. 'During the seizure, the patient may look blank and be completely amnesiac through the episode, losing a bit of time.' People with epilepsy may also have involuntary facial or hand movements, as Louise did, which indicate the electrical discharge has spread to an area of the brain involved in movement. Epilepsy does not tend to worsen over time but, if left untreated, the continued, unexplained seizures can fuel further anxiety, which may make the seizures worse. 'Generally, if people are not diagnosed, that causes anxiety and depression and increases stress levels, which may make seizures more frequent and more serious,' says Dr Cock. 'Whether stress itself causes seizures is controversial, but it's likely that, in some individuals, it may be a trigger - perhaps because stress leads to other triggers, such as alcohol and sleep deprivation.' Louise was relieved to finally find out what was wrong with her - but the diagnosis was frightening. 'It never occurred to me that I might have epilepsy. Being told was like being told I was going to die. 'The thought of all the seizures I'd had in public - on buses, at school meetings - was humiliating.' It took several months for Louise's psychological and neurological symptoms to become untangled. Even after being diagnosed with epilepsy, one neurologist thought she was experiencing non-epileptic seizures as well - seizures that are believed to have a psychological basis and are not caused by disrupted electrical brain activity. These seizures account for up to 30 per cent of people referred to epilepsy clinics. After her diagnosis, Louise was given antidepressants - which can sometimes help with non-epileptic seizures - along with anti-epileptic medication, which works by changing levels of chemicals in the brain that conduct electrical impulses. 'The side-effects of these drugs were horrible. It was like a 24-hour hangover,' she says. 'And I was still having seizures.' Because of the seizures, she had to give up her driving licence. However, things started to look up when, in 2012, she was referred to Dr Cock. Her medication was switched to lamotrigine - a different anti-epileptic drug. And two years ago, the seizures stopped. 'It was a huge relief,' says Louise. 'I could still have one tomorrow, but I used to dread waking up in the morning. Now I can live a normal life again.'

"Yesterday, a Twitter war escalated between Danny Dyer and Katie Hopkins after the reality star criticised his girlfriend for proposing to him. Katie launched an attack on Danny's partner Joanne Mas, saying: 'no woman should ever propose to a man,' to which the EastEnders star responded: 'I agree...especially when you look like ya face should be on the side of a gothic building,' and calling her sexist. But a post-graduate English student who proposed to her boyfriend using a personalised pint glass tells FEMAIL that Katie's notions of marriage are outdated. Katy Miller, 24, and Tim O’Brien, 29, who are from Texas but currently live in Portugal, had been dating for several years before she decided to take the plunge last April. She said: 'My partner and I first met at an Irish pub in Texas. 'We both very much enjoy drinking craft beer, visiting breweries, and sampling the local beers in every city (and country) we visit.' She continued: 'I knew he would love it if I tied this common interest into a proposal, so I picked a quiet craft beer pub in a residential area of Dublin to bring things full circle. 'I was a graduate student in Manchester at the time, so Ireland wasn’t very far away. 'I had a pint glass etched with ‘Tim, after you finish this pint, I’m going to ask you a question…’ on the side, while the bottom that he’d see after downing the pint said ‘…will you marry me?’ The pint glass that Katy commissioned for her proposal to boyfriend Tim . Tim was delighted with the proposal and immediately said yes, with the pair choosing to elope just a few months later. They said their handwritten vows on a hilltop in a quiet village on the island of Mallorca, which Katy describes as, 'One of the happiest moments of our lives.' Katy is proud of her decision to propose to Tim and believes that Ms Hopkins' views on marriage are outdated. She said: 'There are things of real importance women do every day that are cause for actual celebration. 'A woman proposing to a man is not one of them, and I wish it were such an unremarkable event that we never felt the need to discuss it or to defend ourselves. 'Unfortunately, that is not the case, particularly not in the southern US where we are from.' Etched onto the bottom of the pint glass was the question 'Will you marry me?' While Katy and Tim's close friends and family were delighted at their happy news, she does admit that there was a backlash for more small minded people. She reveals: 'People asked if it was an April Fools joke (it was April 16th) and asked me if the proposal was actually for real. 'Acquaintances of my partner had a hard time understanding the concept, and we heard the phrase ‘real man’ tossed around, as if a ‘real man’ isn’t any man. 'But the main source of awkward interactions was my lack of an engagement ring.' Katie Hopkins and Danny Dyer got into a Twitter row yesterday after the reality star criticised the actor's girlfriend for proposing to him . Katy believes that in order for us to move into a fully equal society, issues like who proposes to who shouldn't even be a topic of conversation. She said: 'This narrative of men always proposing and that being the only option is incredibly dull. 'When it comes to relationships, everyone should do what is best for them; however, I refuse to believe that following a man’s lead is what’s best for every single woman. 'Perhaps some women, like me, want to make romantic gestures to their partner. 'Obviously there are far more important feminist issues in society than who is proposing to whom, but if we’re going to speak out against gender roles, then why has this antiquated tradition remained so firmly in place? 'Instead, there’s this stigma where people see a woman who proposes as someone who is tired of waiting around for the man to do it. 'The word ‘emasculation’ is often thrown around when a woman proposes, and I find this entirely ridiculous and offensive to both men and women.'","Katy Miller, 24, proposed to fellow Texan Tim O’Brien, 29, in an Irish pub .

"Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has stonewalled calls for his company and Google to be regulated in the same way as mobile networks. Mobile chiefs said on Monday that the online companies should have to obey the same sort of strict rules as mobile phone businesses, because they are also used for communications, for example via Facebook´s messaging apps. However, Mr Zuckerberg refused to engage with the discussion other than to say that the issue was 'nuanced'. Scroll down for video . Founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, who has refused to engage in discussion on whether Facebook and Google should be regulated in the same way as mobile phone networks . Instead, he used a 20-minute interview at a conference in Barcelona to insist again and again that he was 'not a regulator'. 'I don't really have much to say on that because I'm not a regulator…I'm not an operator and I'm not a regulator so I don't know what the regulatory framework should be exactly,' he said. When pushed on the point, he added: 'I don’t know. I’m still not a regulator.' Earlier that day, Tim Hoettges, the boss of Deutsche Telekom, which owns half of EE, told a conference in Barcelona that regulators need to clamp down on so-called 'over the top' companies - digital businesses like Facebook and Google which provide communications services on mobile and internet networks. 'There is a convergence between over-the-top web companies and classic telcos [telecommunications companies]. We need one level regulatory environment for us all,' he said. His call comes amid mounting concerns that internet businesses like Twitter, Facebook and Google can be used as a platform to publish pornography or hijacked by terrorist groups to radicalise new recruits. Many digital businesses have been slow to crack down on inflammatory material on their platforms, although they have vowed to get tougher in recent weeks. Google has started hiring Arabic speakers to help fight jihadi propaganda videos published on YouTube, its online video site. Speaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Mr Zuckerberg insisted again and again that he was 'not a regulator' Facebook has said it will start doing more to tackle extremist propaganda. However, it has taken some of these companies years to take action, whilst others have failed to do anything. Earlier this month, it emerged that Twitter had snubbed a meeting with a government minister called to discuss ways to tackle the proliferation of pornography on certain websites. Around 500,000 explicit photographs and videos are published on social network every day, despite the fact that it is targeted at children as young as 13. Delegates at mobile world congress were disappointed with Mr Zuckerberg´s failure to engage with the regulation issue on Monday. People had spent up to two hours queueing to get a seat in the auditorium here the Facebook founder and chief executive was speaking. However, many left his session half way through as it became clear that he would not discuss the issue.","Mark Zuckerberg refused to discuss calls for Facebook to be regulated .

"The former Maine summer home of beauty magnate Elizabeth Arden has been purchased by a nonprofit dedicated to disabled veterans. The Travis Mills Foundation - named after a former Army staff sergeant who became a quadruple amputee after a 2012 Afghanistan bomb blast  - announced the purchase Tuesday. The foundation said in a release it intends to make extensive renovations to the property and convert it 'into the nation's first fully accessible, ""smart home"" retreat dedicated to serving the recreational and reintegration needs of combat-wounded veterans and their families.' Married to wife Kelsey and father to daughter Chloe, Mills established the foundation bearing his name and is now a motivational speaker. The estate was placed on the market last summer for $765,000, but the foundation did not announce the purchase price. Purchase: The Travis Mills Foundation has  purchased a Maine home that was once Elizabeth Arden's Maine Chance Spa . Off the market: The estate was placed on the market last summer for $765,000, but the foundation did not announce the purchase price . Beauty magnate: Arden, seen left, built the main house in the town of Rome as her summer estate in the 1920s and later established the Maine Chance Spa at the site. Women are seen on the right at the spa in 1948 . New purpose: The Travis Miller Foundation is named after a former Army staff sergeant severely injured in a 2012 Afghanistan bomb blast who became a quadruple amputee. Miller is seen here with his family . Mills told The Kennebec Journal of the purchase, 'We're definitely excited,' and said that there is no opening date arranged yet. The Travis Mills Foundation is hoping to gather $1.7 million for renovations - and over $27,400 has already been raised, according to a GoFundMe page. The page says, 'On April 10, 2012, United States Army Staff Sergeant Travis Mills of the 82nd Airborne was critically injured on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan by an IED (improvised explosive device) while on patrol, losing portions of both legs and both arms.  He is one of only five quadruple amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to survive such extensive injuries.' Mills received extended treatment from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, CNN reported last year. Now, he participates in a number of physical activities, including snowboarding, according to the television station. Mills told CNN 'I'm not wounded any more. I'm just a guy living life.' Expansive: The property once covered 1,200 acres but was subdivided after Arden's 1966 death . Father: Mills, seen left with his daughter Chloe before the accident, now works as a motivational speaker . Efforts: The foundation has already raised over $27,000 in donations . In a trailer for a documentary on his life, 'Travis: A Soldier's Story,' Mills said 'You know, people call me a hero, but I'm not sure what part of it makes me a hero. I just had a normal day at work that turned ugly. 'About six seconds [after the explosion] I guess later, I woke up. My medic came running up at me. And about twenty seconds he had tourniquets on both legs and both arms. And I guess the last thing that was in my head was my baby girl. Am I ever going to see her again?' 'My goal was to let them know I keep working, I keep going hard,' he also said in the trailer. 'If I give up, I'm giving up on my family.' Arden built the main house in the town of Rome as her summer estate in the 1920s and later established the Maine Chance Spa at the site. Mamie Eisenhower, Judy Garland, and Ava Gardner were among the guests. The property once covered 1,200 acres but was subdivided after Arden's 1966 death. The Kennebec Journal reported last year that the Maine Chance Spa was primarily a weight-loss spa, but also featured a number of beauty treatments. According to the news outlet, the spa had green houses, living spaces for staff, as well as exercise spaces, treatment rooms, and guest lodgings. Stefano Tufano, whose parents purchased the spa in the 1970s, told WLBZ in 2014 'You research it and to find out it was the first spa in the history of the United States and all the famous people that stayed here, Judy Garland, the First Lady Maime Eisenhower and you know, it was quite a place. 'In today's money, it was $4,000 a week to stay here. So, it was an exclusive women's club back then, very few people could afford to come here.' Property maintenance led to Tufano wanting to sell, WLBZ reported. Changing lives: Mills poses for a snap with his daughter Chloe, wife Kelsey, and former president George W. Bush .

"Rosetta has captured a selfie of its shadow on comet 67P in what is the highest-resolution image to be taken by the probe. The image was taken during a Valentine's Day flyby when Rosetta passed within just four miles (6 km) from the surface of the icy comet. As well as the craft's shadow, an 'alien' glow is seen reflected onto the comet, which scientists believe is caused by a trick of the light from the sun. Scroll down for video . Rosetta has captured a selfie of its shadow (bottom of image) on comet 67P in what is the highest-resolution image to be taken by the probe. The image was taken during a Valentine's Day flyby when the Rosetta passed just four miles (6 km) from the surface of the icy comet. The glow causes the shadow to be fuzzy and somewhat larger than Rosetta itself, measuring approximately 65ft by 165 ft (20 by 50 metres). If the sun were farther away, the shadow would be sharp and almost exactly the same size as Rosetta, which is around 2 x 32 metres. However, even at 215 million miles (347 million km) from 67P/C-G on 14 February, the sun appeared as a disc about 0.2 degrees across. This is about 2.3 times smaller than on Earth - resulting in a fuzzy 'penumbra' around the spacecraft's shadow. With Rosetta just four miles (6km) above the surface, the penumbra effect adds roughly 65ft (20 metres) to the spacecraft's dimensions, which . This graphic shows the difference between how a sharp shadow is generated by a point source (left) and a fuzzy shadow by a diffuse source (right) The view, which shows the detail in features down to 11cm, is of a region on the bottom of the comet. The OSIRIS narrow-angle camera image from the close flyby shown here in context with a NAVCAM image . If you were standing on the surface with Rosetta high above you, there would be no place in the shadow where the entire sun would be blocked from view. The view, which shows the detail in features down to 11cm, is of a region on the bottom of the comet. Other images reveal boulders on the comet's surface, as well as 'stunning details of the contrasting terrain,' the European Space Agency said. The boulders in these images range in size from a few metres to a few tens of metres, and lay scattered across the comet's surface. Images taken from this viewpoint are of high scientific value,' says OSIRIS Principal Investigator Holger Sierks from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany. 'This kind of view is key for the study of grain sizes.' Esa's Rosetta spacecraft launched on 2 March 2004 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, on a mission to visit comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It took more than ten years to reach the comet, and on the way it flew past Mars and two asteroids. On 6 August 2014 it entered orbit around the comet, beginning a series of complex manoeuvres to get the best views possible. On 12 November 2014 Rosetta successfully released a smaller vehicle it had carried called Philae. This small probe bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest. Although Philae's landing did not go as planned, it was still able to complete more than 90 per cent of the science it was intended to do before its main batteries died, sending the probe to sleep. The location of the lander is currently unknown. It is thought to be in partial shadow near a cliff but, as the comet approaches the sun, the additional light may charge its solar panels enough for the lander to wake up. Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing its mission around the comet. 67P is approaching the sun and, by August this year, it is thought its activity will have dramatically increased. This will release much more ice, vapour and other materials from the surface - and Rosetta will be there to watch it all happen. This OSIRIS shape model is marked with the position of the narrow-angle camera field of view taken during the 14 February flyby . A four-image montage of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko comprising images taken on 14 February 2015 during the first dedicated close flyby. This image set was taken at 10:32 GMT from a distance of 7.8 miles (12.6 km) from the comet centre. Using the surface distance, the image scale is 0.9 m/pixel . The closest approach took place at 12:41 GMT over the Imhotep region on the comet's large lobe. Rosetta's parting shot following the close flyby features the comet's small lobe at the top of the image, with the larger lobe in the lower portion of the image set. As well as providing the opportunity to take close-up high-resolution images of the comet surface, flybys like this also allow Rosetta's instruments to sample the innermost parts of the comet's atmosphere, or coma. Rosetta is now moving out for a far view of the comet – it will reach a distance of about 160 miles (255km) from the comet centre tomorrow. Last month, Nasa said the structure of Comet 67P resembles ice cream. In an experiment, they found that while the exterior of a comet is encased in a hard, outer crust, the interior would mostly be fluffy ice. Rosetta's parting shot following the close flyby features the comet's small lobe at the top of the image, with the larger lobe in the lower portion of the image set . 'A comet is like deep fried ice cream,' said Dr Murthy Gudipati of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, corresponding author of a recent study appearing in the Journal of Physical Chemistry. 'The crust is made of crystalline ice, while the interior is colder and more porous. The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.' To come to the conclusion, astronomers used an icebox-like instrument nicknamed Himalaya. They showed that fluffy ice on the surface of a comet would crystallise and harden as the comet heads towards the sun and warms up. The composition of comets is important to understanding how they might have delivered water and organics to the young, hot Earth. New results from the Rosetta mission show that asteroids may have been the primary carriers of life's ingredients; however, the debate is ongoing and comets may have played a role.

"Two teachers who were arrested in January for allegedly having a beach sex party with five male students have been hit with new charges - including that they supplied cocaine to the minors. Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, from the Los Angeles suburb of Covina, were both originally only charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor over allegations that they gave booze to the students. On Monday, prosecutors hit them with a slew of new, much more serious, charges, KTLA-TV reports. Scroll down for video . Melody Lippert (left), 38, and Michelle Ghirelli (right), 30, both from Covina, were arrested in January. On Monday, they were hit with drug and sex abuse charges . 'The Covina-Valley Unified School District is shocked by the Orange County District Attorney's decision with regards to the charges filed. 'However, we recognize that the investigation is continuing and additional charges could be forthcoming,' spokesperson Michelle Van Der Linden said in a written statement. 'As teachers and administrators who work closely and in a trusted position with children, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. 'We are subject to the Education Code and our Board policies and as such, we will continue with our own investigation and have created our own draft statement of charges for dismissal, which will be delivered to both individuals.' Lippert, who allegedly organized the trip, was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse and furnishing a controlled substance to a minor, both felonies. Ghirelli now faces charges of unlawful sexual intercourse, furnishing a controlled substance to a minor and oral copulation of a minor, all of which are also felonies. Prosecutors had initially said there was not enough evidence to file sex abuse charges. Ghirelli's lawyer said the teacher intends to 'vigorously defend' against the charges, telling the Los Angeles Times: 'There's two sides to every story.' The teachers, from South Hills High School in Corona Valley, California, allegedly went on a camping trip to San Clemente Beach with five students from December 27 through 29. Lippert, who has taught as a teacher for the Covina-Valley Unified School District for 15 years, had previously met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente last November, on a trip that was not school sponsored, according to KCAL-TV. In initial reports, Lippert had reportedly given the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students, according to Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies. She then made plans to meet up with the students for a second liaison at the same spot, bringing along Ghirelli, who has been teaching for the district for five years. The pair then met up with five students of the same group on the non-school sponsored camping, spending a night on the beach.

For, it turns out, that where the former Spice Girl leads in the hairstyle stakes, so former Girls Aloud singer Cheryl follows. Whether it is a bob, a side-plait or a bun, it seems that Cheryl likes to borrow, or revisit, looks from her style mentor. Of course Victoria, now 40, did it all first — from a career in a world-beating all-girl band to marriage to an England footballer. The two women were even friends once, particularly during the 2006 World Cup football finals in Germany, when Cheryl travelled to watch her then fiance Ashley Cole and Posh was there, too, with Becks. However, relations between the two women became frosty after Ashley was accused of cheating in 2008, just two years after their wedding, and Victoria didn’t even call. Cheryl said she’d expected rather more from her fellow WAG. In an interview in 2009, Cheryl said that Victoria’s clothes were for ‘older women’, and Victoria retaliated by saying that Cheryl’s range of shoes for fashion website Stylist Pick were ‘just a PR stunt’.

Sources in both camps indicate that they have long since made up — certainly Cheryl wore a Victoria Beckham dress in May 2012 to the premiere of the film What To Expect When You’re Expecting, and it was reported that the former Spice Girl had invited Cheryl over for dinner later that year so they could properly let bygones be bygones. So what does Cheryl’s new hair mean? It seems to be a part of a complete make-under, embarked upon following her whirlwind second marriage to French restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July last year, which has taken her from tanned, blonde WAG to sophisticated fashionista — a path trodden by Posh herself. Cheryl has hired a new make-up artist and new stylist in order to embrace a more subtle, more high-fashion look. Her new image was played to great effect during her much-heralded return as a judge on The X Factor last year, and sources close to the show indicate she will be asked to come back again this year — with a £1.5 million fee dangled as an incentive. But will she do so, though, with a baby on board? Some fans firmly believe Cheryl is now pregnant, hence the less high-maintenance hair cut, and her relative lack of postings on Twitter and Instagram in recent weeks. If that’s true, she can look forward to a whole new range of copycat cuts — after all, there are four Victoria Beckham pregnancies to turn to . . .

"A fit and healthy 41-year-old man died after a routine hernia operation in which the anaesthetist was 'too proud' to ask for help when the patient suffered an anaphylactic shock, an inquest heard. Jamie Hyde, from Morchard Bishop, Devon, died after suffering a rare reaction to a general anaesthetic during the routine operation at Tiverton and District Hospital. Anaesthetist Dr Andrei Rebrov did not realise initially that he had  suffered an anaphylactic shock and so Mr Hyde went for more than one hour without being given potentially life-saving treatment. Jamie Hyde, 41, from Morchard Bishop, Devon, died after suffering an anaphylactic shock  during a routine hernia operation, in which the anaesthetist was 'too proud' too ask other doctors for help for at least one hour . Mr Hyde suffered a rare reaction to the anaesthetic during a routine hernia operation at Tiverton and District Hospital (pictured). He later went into cardiac arrest after he not being given potentially life-saving treatment . The inquest into his death in Exeter, Devon, heard how Mr Hyde's heart rate and blood pressure began rising and falling rapidly after he was given the anaesthetic. At one point his heart rate fell to 30 beats per minute and nurse Lizzie Charlton-Ann suggested calling 999. But the inquest heard that Dr Rebrov refused to do so and instead called the critical care unit at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter. He also turned down an offer of help from another doctor on site who was also an anaesthetist. Mr Hyde later went into cardiac arrest and was given CPR before being transferred to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital where he was placed on life support having suffered brain damage. His family turned off his machine on May 27, 2013, after he stopped responding to tests. Dr Rebrov said he had received training on how to deal with anaphylactic shocks but had not encountered one before. Coroner Elizabeth Earland asked Dr Michael Seymour, the surgeon who was in the operating theatre at the time, whether Dr Rebrov froze. He said: 'I don't think he froze, I think he reacted to the situation he was in but one of the problems was whatever he tried to do, worked for a while then Jamie deteriorated again.' Mr Hyde was moved to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter, Devon (pictured) and was put on life support after suffering brain damage, the inquest heard. However, he died a few days later on May 27, 2013 . The coroner heard how Mr Hyde had not been worried about the hernia operation beforehand and had expected to return home the same day. Mr Hyde's sister Catherine told the inquest that she believes Dr Rebrov was 'too proud' to ask for help when complications arose. She said: 'When I first saw Dr Rebrov at the hospital he was very upset and tearful. He said Jamie was a very nice guy. 'I felt sorry for him, but now I feel he was too proud to ask for help.' Nurse Ms Charlton- Ann said: 'I have always had it drummed into me from working on the ward to call 999 any time you think a patient's life is in danger.' Dr Earland, who delivered a narrative verdict, said strenuous efforts were made to save Mr Hyde. She said: 'At the time, the doctor who had administered the drugs did not know he was suffering an anaphylactic reaction as he was not displaying the usual symptoms.' Following the inquest, Martin Cooper, medical director at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, told MailOnline: 'We wish to express our condolences to Mr Hyde's family and recognise his death was tragic. 'The coroner concluded that his death was due to the effects of an unexpected and very rare anaphylactic reaction. 'The Trust undertook full investigation into the circumstances. 'The results of this investigation were explained to the coroner, together with the actions that the Trust had taken to improve the management of anaphylaxis in the operating theatre situation.' Mr Cooper said improvements included surgery teams receiving further training and additional drugs used in anaesthetic emergencies being made available. He said the Trust had also rolled out a programme to community theatre staff in 'critical incident' training.","Jamie Hyde went  for  hernia operation and hoped to return home same day .

"Criticism: Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured at the House of Commons yesterday) launched a blistering attack on the human rights group Cage . Theresa May last night launched a blistering attack on the human rights group Cage, saying no excuses could be made for the appalling crimes of Islamic State. In a statement to the Commons, the Home Secretary said: ‘I condemn anyone who attempts to excuse that barbarism in the way that has been done by Cage.’ Politicians have queued up to denounce the group’s research director Asim Qureshi, who has described IS killer Mohammed Emwazi as a ‘beautiful young man’ and accused the security services of radicalising him. Jacqui Smith, a Labour former Home Secretary, said yesterday: ‘We can – and should – dismiss the outrageous apologists of Cage who claimed that Emwazi was just a good lad radicalised by the actions of western authorities.’ The backlash continued with Amnesty International coming under pressure to cut its ties with Cage. A former employee urged the charity to stop treating the group as human rights defenders and heroes. Gita Sahgal, a former head of Amnesty International’s gender unit, was forced out of the organisation in 2010 after describing Cage as jihadis and questioning the championing of former Guantanamo inmates. Controversial group: Cage research director Asim Qureshi (left) speaks next to political activist John Rees (centre) and Cage spokesman Cerie Bullivant (right) during a press conference in London last Thursday . ‘Immense damage has been done to Amnesty, not least because they won’t come clean about their association with Cage,’ she told the BBC. ‘They say various things like, they don’t work with them, they have never worked with them, or they are in a loose coalition with them. ‘But the point is, whether they are in a tight embrace or a loose coalition, they have taken their research from them, they have shared logos with them, they have produced briefing papers together, they have signed letters to the Government together, that is working with the organisation.’ She described Cage’s current director, former Guantanamo Bay prisoner Moazzam Begg, as ‘Britain’s most famous supporter of the Taliban’. Jihadi John: Politicians have queued up to denounce Mr Qureshi, who has described Islamic State killer Mohammed Emwazi (above) as a ‘beautiful young man’ and accused the security services of radicalising him . Miss Sahgal said she had never argued Guantanamo prisoners ‘shouldn’t be defended’, but that they ‘shouldn’t be treated as heroes and human rights defenders’. Unimpressed: Jacqui Smith, a Labour former Home Secretary, called Cage 'outrageous apologists' She added: ‘The prisoners they were defending in this case were not prisoners of conscience ... what they did was create a narrative of innocence around them.’ Steve Crawshaw, of the office of the secretary general at Amnesty, admitted yesterday it was ‘highly unlikely’ they would work with Cage again. Asked if Amnesty had played to a ‘myth’ of victimisation, Mr Crawshaw added: ‘I don’t think we have played to anybody’s myth. I can’t condemn strongly enough anybody, in any context who seeks to find some justification somehow for how they can justify killing civilians. ‘Our colleagues there (in Iraq) are risking lives in order to document the terrible crimes of IS and therefore to hear somehow that we are turning away from those things, I do think is quite extraordinary.’ Amnesty International was forced yesterday to admit that it worked alongside Cage as recently as October. With Liberty, Justice and five other mainstream human rights groups, it joined with Cage in a ‘collective’ to make representations to an inquiry into the treatment of British Army detainees. Cage’s current director: Former Guantanamo Bay prisoner Moazzam Begg (pictured) has been described as ‘Britain’s most famous supporter of the Taliban’ by the former head of Amnesty International’s gender unit . Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said yesterday: ‘Amnesty has no formal or financial relationship with Cage. ‘Amnesty has, along with a number of others human rights organisations, worked on issues relating to Guantanamo and torture. ‘This has included being co-signatories on letters calling for an independent, judge-led inquiry into UK complicity in torture. We support the call for a torture inquiry. We do not support all of Cage’s views or agree with how it expresses them.’ Charities have been urged to stop funding Cage with politicians saying the organisation has acted reprehensibly in blaming British security services for the radicalisation of Emwazi.","Home Secretary 'condemns anyone who attempts to excuse barbarism'

"Jihadi's John's younger brother was convicted of handling stolen goods in a case just months after the older brother was acquitted of the same charge. Mohammed Emwazi's involvement with criminal gangs has emerged as a key staging post on his path to extremism and eventually to becoming the notorious executioner for the Islamic State. It has now emerged that his younger brother Omar, five years his junior, pleaded guilty to possession of stolen goods at Isleworth Crown Court in West London in August 2012. Guilty: Omar Emwazi - younger brother of Mohammed Emwazi, revealed last week as Jihadi John - pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods in 2012 . The 21-year-old received a community order for 12 months, 100 hours unpaid work and had to pay prosecution costs of £800. Emwazi's younger brother has previously posted his support online for radical preachers including Sheikh Khalid Yasin and Imran ibn Mansur, known as Dawah Man. Omar is also a member of a street preaching group called Power of Dawah, which supports the fundamentalist preacher Abdur Raheem Green, who preached to Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab, the 'Underpants Bomber'. A friend said Omar got into fights at school, and added: 'I don't think he was one of the brightest academically either, to put it politely. 'I know some of the most harmless people that are on dawah stalls. However, given his situation, I can see why that may ring some alarms.' Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempting to blow up a commercial plane on a would-be suicide mission for al-Qaeda. He was caught trying to board a plane on Christmas Day in 2009 with explosives stitched into his underwear, earning him the nickname the 'Underpants Bomber'. Dangerous: Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab (left) - better known as the Underpants Bomber - invited fundamentalist preacher Abdur Raheem Green (right) to speak at the University College London in 2005 . But the Nigerian was left badly burned when the bomb failed to detonate fully on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. He had previously invited controversial Abdur Raheem Green to speak while he was president of Islamic Society at University College London in 2005. Muslim convert Green has previously has been accused of supporting jihadism, and once proclaimed: 'Dying while fighting jihad is one of the surest ways to paradise and Allah's good pleasure' It was also revealed this week that Omar was a member of a group dubbed the 'Muslim mafia' in school and admired a controversial Islamic hate preacher. The 21-year-old is said to have supported Sheikh Khalid Yasin, who was lauded by Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale. Support: Omar Emwazi is said to have used Facebook to profess his admiration for Muslim hate preacher Sheikh Kalid Yasin (left), who inspired Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebowale (right) to convert to Islam . Omar is said to have quickly taken down his Facebook page after his brother's new identity was revealed last week. He reportedly used the site to 'like' Sheikh Yasin, a preacher who has called the Taliban his 'brothers' and denounced both Christian and Jewish beliefs as 'filth'. Yasin has also claimed that the Koran gives men permission to 'beat women lightly' and has called homosexuality an 'aberration' that should be 'punishable by death'. Michael Adebowale - who was jailed last year for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby - said Yasin's views taught him the 'purpose of life' and convinced him to convert to Islam. Mohammed Emwazi  - revealed last week as the evil executioner behind the Jihadi John mask - was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up to recruit and raise funds for Somalia-based terror group al Shabab. Security services were aware of Emwazi for six years before he appeared on a hostage video for the first time in August 2014. Evil: Mohammed Emwazi was this week revealed to be ISIS killer 'Jihadi John', seen beheading hostages in videos . It is believed The London Boys had links to the gang behind the failed July 21, 2005 attacks on London. Court documents revealed a leading member of Emwazi's network had a phone conversation on the day of the attacks with Hussein Osman, who was later jailed for life for placing an explosive at Shepherd's Bush tube station. Yesterday, it was revealed that Emwazi's mother screamed out in shock when she realised he was Jihadi John after watching a beheading video. Ghaneya Emwazi, 47, confirmed her son was the IS chief executioner when she and her husband Jasem, 51, were questioned by the Kuwaiti security services on Sunday. Other appalled relatives of Emwazi condemned his actions and said they would welcome his death. A Kuwaiti cousin, who would not give his name, said: ‘We hate him. We hope he will be killed soon. This will be good news for our family.’ It was also revealed last week that Emwazi stood trial twice, accused of having stolen bikes hidden in the family shed and twice he was acquitted. The first case only came to court after the owner of one of the stolen bikes tracked down Emwazi who had put it up for sale on Ebay. The victim contacted him posing as a prospective buyer to get his details which he then passed on to the police. Emwazi faced five charges of possession of criminal property on or before September 29 2010, 'knowing or suspecting it to represent the proceeds of criminal property.' Home: The Emwazi family have left their house in north London, which was visited by authorities investigating Mohammed last week . The items were listed as a BE1 bicycle, a Trek Elpha, a Cannondale Bad Boy Bicycle, a Brompton Bicycle, and a Cervelo Bicycle. Emwazi, who was 22 at the time, gave his address as the family home on the Mozart estate in Queen's Park, West London and his date of birth as August 17 1988. He claimed he had bought the bikes from the GumTree website and was selling them on at a profit. The judge directed the jury to find Emwazi not guilty after a two day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June 2011. Emwazi faced a second trial at Southwark Crown Court a few months later in December 2011 for a similar case where he was also acquitted.","Omar Emwazi pleaded guilty to possession of stolen bicycles in 2012 .

The system is then expected to sweep Northeast, pushing past Washington, D.C., and New York City before hitting Boston to potentially set a new snowfall record, according to AccuWeather. While less than six inches is expected in Massachusetts, the extra snow could be enough to push the city past its annual snowfall record of 107.6 inches. The total, according to local station WCVB, currently sits at 104.1 inches after a modest coating over the weekend. The current record was set in the winter of 1995-96. Higher!

"Time to say goodbye: Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Studios will close its doors in Chicago in December after 26 years, and all of the operations will be moved to the Oprah Winfrey Network's new headquarters in West Hollywood . Oprah Winfrey is getting ready to leave Windy City for good in favor of Tinsel Town. By the end of this year, Winfrey's Harpo Studios will close its doors in Chicago after 26 years, and all of the operations will be moved to the Oprah Winfrey Network's new headquarters in West Hollywood, it was announced today. The 61-year-old media mogul, ranked 603 on Forbes' 2015 list of billionaires, personally delivered the news to her staff in Chicago Tuesday morning. The Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) was founded by the former 'queen of daytime' in 2011 in Los Angeles, and Winfrey's executives have spent the past four years traveling back and forth between Chicago and Hollywood. Two months ago, OWN moved into a new three-story space called The Lot in West Hollywood, setting the stage for the shutdown of Harpo Studios in Chicago. '[Chicago has] been everything for me. I've spent more hours in this building than I have any other building on Earth,' Miss Winfrey told The Hollywood Reporter by phone. 'We were here when there was nothing but hoes and rats on the street, and now it's one of the hottest neighborhoods.' The Academy Award-nominated actress and film producer acknowledged that it would be sad for her to bid farewell to her old home base, but she felt it was the right time to consolidate her network’s operations under one roof. End of an era: After 26 years in Chicago's West Loop, Winfrey's production company will move out of the four-building campus . New home: Two months ago, the four-year-old Oprah Winfrey Network moved into a new three-story space called The Lot in West Hollywood . Harpo will stop shooting shows for OWN as of Tuesday, and the studio will officially shutter its doors in December. Miss Winfrey said in a statement Tuesday that Harpo Studios has been a 'blessing' in her life and she's now 'looking ahead' to inhabiting her California studio. Since 2011, the Chicago-based studio, which employed about 200 people, had produced 800 hours of original programming. Only a small portion of the Harpo staff will join OWN's 140 employees in LA. The move comes nearly a year after Winfrey sold the four-building Harpo Studios to the real estate development company Sterling Bay for estimated $32million. Under the agreement, the property was leased back to Harpo for two years. The lease expires in April 2016, but the studio will close at the end of 2015. Winfrey first came to Chicago in 1984 to be on the morning talk show AM Chicago. A month later, the show was No 1 in the market and was renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show.

"David Cameron reacted angrily to a Tory minister's warning against banning hate preachers . David Cameron reacted with fury after a Tory minister warned against banning radical preachers from universities during a fiery Cabinet meeting, it has been revealed. The Prime Minister 'jumped on' the universities minister Greg Clark after he spoke out against Home Office plans to force universities to ban non-violent 'extremists', sources said. Mr Cameron was backed up by the Home Secretary Theresa May and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. The extraordinary row comes after it emerged Mrs May is at loggerheads with the Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable over the issue. The Home Office wants all campuses to become no-go zones for all 'extremist' speakers to prevent students becoming radicalised. But Mr Cable insists that the move could force debates 'underground', where extreme views will go unchallenged. Last month's Cabinet row suggests the issue is dividing the Tory Party as well as the Coalition. The issue has come to the fore after the unmasking of Mohammed Emwazi – a University of Westminster graduate thought to be the ISIS executioner known as Jihadi John. Westminster was named in a 2009 report as having invited three hate preachers to give a talk in 2006, and just days before Emwazi's identity was revealed, thousands signed a petition to block an event where an anti-gay figure was due to speak. Former students at the university have claimed it is a 'hotbed of radicalism' where students 'celebrated 9/11'. Former University of Westminster pupil Raheem Kassam, who campaigns against extremism at British universities, said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like Emwazi. New laws passed by the government put a legal requirement on universities to prevent terrorism. Mrs May insists this should include barring people with extreme views from speaking on campus. But Mr Cable, who is responsible for university policy, warns a blanket ban on radical preachers could backfire. Scroll down for video . Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and the Universities Minister Greg Clark are at loggerheads over a clampdown on extremism . The Univeersity of Westminster was named in a 2009 report as having invited three hate preachers to give a talk in 2006 . A source close to the Business Secretary said: 'There are of course cases when banning is justified but as long as speakers don't invite terrorism - which is illegal - there are times when it's better to demolish extreme views through open debate and challenge. 'If the default option is to ban outright, there is a chance the debate will happen anyway outside the campus in an uncontrolled 'underground' environment, with no challenge to extreme views at all.' But Mrs May said : 'If colleges and universities didn't realise before what we are up against, they should know now. We're not talking about regulating legitimate debate — we're saying they need to do more to stop radicalisation on campus.' Since news of Emwazi's connection with ISIS in Syria broke, the Westminster University's Islamic Society has distanced itself from having any involvement. Mohammed Emwazi - the Islamic State militant known as 'Jihadi John' - studied at the University of Westminster . Tory party chairman Grant Mr Shapps accused the Lib Dems of blocking attempts to crack down on radicalisation. He said: 'Yes there is a difference of opinion. Vince Cable doesn't want to do what Conservatives want to do which is that on campus we don't want radical preachers saying things which incite violence which ultimately can lead to the radicalisation of young people. 'We have seen these three girls go off to Syria, we have seen Jihadi John, we don't want think that sort of preaching should happen in our universities. 'I'm afraid to say that Conservatives just have a simple view that people in Vince Cable's constituency of Twickenham or around the country deserve that protection and that means we have to put proper, decent, tough rules in place which don't ban free speech but do stop people from preaching death.' The University of Westminster has hit back at claims it is a fertile breeding ground for Islamic fundamentalism as arguments rage over who is to blame over Jihadi John. Kuwait-born Londoner Emwazi had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several Western hostages. Responding to claims from a fellow former student that the university allowed extremism, a spokesman for the institution said: 'We condemn the promotion of radicalisation, terrorism and violence or threats against any member of our community. 'We have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community, who come to study from over 150 nations.' There was also a renewed suggestion - from a former independent reviewer of government anti-terror laws - that Emwazi might have been prevented from joining up with IS had restrictions on suspects not been relaxed. 'Had control orders been in place, in my view there is a realistic prospect that Mohammed Emwazi, and at least two of his associates, would have been the subject of control orders with a compulsory relocation,' Lord Carlile said. 'If that had been the case, he would not have done what he's done in recent times,' the Liberal Democrat peer added.","PM 'jumped on' the universities minister Greg Clark during Cabinet meeting .

"A former uncover CIA officer has launched a $25 million lawsuit against the spy agency in federal court, claiming he was wrongly fired after a senior manager fabricated allegations to tarnish his career, have him sacked and keep him from marrying the woman he loves. The officer filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the pseudonym Mack L. Charles in January. Charles' lawsuit alleges that he had a solid record as a CIA officer, reaching the bureaucratic equivalent of a lieutenant colonel in the military. He served in a war zone, won awards and received good ratings, the lawsuit says. A former uncover CIA officer has launched a $25 million lawsuit claiming he was fired after a senior manager tarnished his record and prevented him from marrying the woman he loves . But he ran afoul of his bosses after he filed an age discrimination complaint in 2009, the lawsuit says. His complaint asserted that managers sought to impede his romantic relationship with another CIA non-official cover officer - 21 years his junior - who became his fiancee, the suit says. The pair had planned to spy overseas together as a 'tandem couple,' but haven't spoken to her since his firing, the lawsuit says. In March 2011, Charles claims that a senior manager 'took the monstrous step' of ordering the woman to cease all contact with him, threatening her with an assignment at CIA headquarters in Washington if she disobeyed, effectively an end to her career overseas, reports the Daily Beast. Charles says he is suffering depression as a result of having no contact with his fiancée who he 'thinks about [her] every day and misses her as much today as on the first day of his forced separation from her.' The suit also accuses the CIA of illegally barring the former officer from publishing his novel, tentatively titled Madhouse: A Forbidden Novel of The CIA. The CIA allocated billions of dollars to expanding the NOC program after 9/11, but the effort was largely a failure, claims Mack Charles in his lawsuit . The CIA faces occasional employment lawsuits like any other government agency, but this one is unusual because of the plaintiff's claim to have been a non-official cover officer, or NOC, in CIA parlance. Most CIA case officers work out of embassies posing as diplomats, giving them a level of protection should they be arrested while committing espionage. NOCs pose as businessmen, scholars or scientists in an effort to distance them from the U.S. government and afford them access to people who would never set foot in a U.S. embassy. If caught spying overseas, they could be jailed. The NOC program is even more secretive than traditional espionage, and officers who participate often operate using their real names instead of aliases. The CIA allocated billions of dollars to expanding the NOC program after 9/11, but the effort was largely a failure, former officers have said — a charge Charles repeats in his lawsuit. The suit says the leader of the CIA's Global Deployment Initiative — its main non-official cover program — tried to get Charles fired in 2009, but a CIA board declined to take that step. Mack Charles filed his $25 million lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in January . Charles claims that another former agent Ishmael Jones was able to publish their book about life as a NOC . After that, the lawsuit says, another senior officer, who headed the Special Activities Division — the CIA's paramilitary arm — wrote a memo alleging that Charles had in the past fudged expense accounts. That allegation is false, the lawsuit claims, but it says the allegation led to Charles' termination in December 2010. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled against Charles' discrimination complaint. The lawsuit alleges that the officer who wrote the memo, who is not identified by name, had a 'checkered career' that included a drinking problem, and was asked to retire amid sexual harassment allegations. The head of the Global Deployment Initiative was a subpar officer who also abused alcohol, the lawsuit alleges, claiming that the 'multibillion-dollar' NOC program 'was shot through with waste, fraud, and abuse.' When he submitted his novel to the CIA's Publication Review Board, the lawsuit says, Charles was told he could not publish any of it for fear his true name, which he used while working undercover for the CIA, would be revealed. The suit notes that at least one other former NOC has published a book under a pseudonym, Ishmael Jones, while keeping his true name a secret. Jones did so without seeking permission from the CIA, leading the agency to obtain a court ruling in 2012 seizing the proceeds. Charles and his supporters are asking the public for financial donations to help fund his legal battle and have setup a GoFundMe.com page.","The former uncover CIA officer claims he was fired after a senior manager tarnished his record and prevented him from marrying the woman he loves .

"Michelle Obama is taking daughters Malia and Sasha on a Spring Break trip to Japan and Cambodia in mid-March. Mrs Obama will visit Tokyo and Kyoto, Japan, from March 18-20 and end the trip with a March 21-22 stop in Siem Reap in northwestern Cambodia, the White House said on Tuesday. The White House made no mention of the girls joining their mother, but Japanese newspaper The Asahi Shimbun, quoting a Japanese official, reported last month that the teens will be part of the trip. Michelle Obama and her daughters Malia and Sasha meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan in Beijing in March 2014. The mother and daughters were reportedly returning to Asia for a Spring Break trip this year . President Obama, who was in Japan last April, will not join his wife and daughters. Last March, Mrs Obama, her mother and the girls visited China and have previously taken trips to Ireland and Germany. Malia and Sasha attend the elite DC school, Sidwell Friends, which begins Spring Break on March 20. There were so far no details on the cost of the trip but the First Lady's group spent $222,000 over two days in hotel expenses during the 2014 China visit, the Washington Examiner reported. On Valentine's weekend, the First Lady and her daughters took a weekend skiing trip to Aspen, Colorado while the President jetted to California to golf. According to the Washington Examiner, in a piece published in October 2014, the Obamas' recent vacations left taxpayers with a $6.2 million bill. The total amount billed over the family's six years in the White House has been more than $40 million. The First Lady will be promote educating girls around the world with the visit to Japan, and to Cambodia, a place where the government's record on human rights gave her husband pause during a reluctant visit a couple of years ago. Cambodia is an interesting choice for the First Lady. President Obama became the first U.S. president to visit Cambodia in late 2012 after his re-election. White House officials insisted at the time that Obama was only going because Cambodia was the host for two annual regional summits he has made a point of attending. Obama appeared visibly unhappy during the brief visit. The Cambodian government has been led since 1985 by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has a reputation for ruthlessness and a low tolerance for opposition. The southeast Asian nation also has problems with child prostitution and human trafficking. The Obamas were announcing the 'Let Girls Learn' education initiative at a White House event on Tuesday. President Obama, pictured with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen in 2012, voiced concerns about Cambodia's human rights record during his trip . The President and First Lady, the parents of two teenage girls, both say their own success would not have been possible without education, and everywhere they travel they encourage young people to finish school. In the U.S., Mrs. Obama also leads a separate initiative encouraging young people to continue their education after high school. More than 60 million girls around the world, half of them adolescents, do not attend school. Lack of education limits their economic opportunities and makes them more vulnerable to such afflictions as HIV and AIDS, early and forced marriage, and gender-based violence, said Tchen, who also directs the White House Council on Women and Girls. Educated girls and their families, meanwhile, are more likely to have a better quality of life. The administration is putting under the 'Let Girls Learn' umbrella a range of programs currently operating largely across Africa and the Middle East that focus on education, empowerment and leadership, health and nutrition, gender-based violence, and early and forced marriage. Separately, the Peace Corps and Mrs. Obama's office will work together to support community-based solutions to these issues. The Peace Corps has thousands of volunteers working in more than 60 developing countries. Its 'Let Girls Learn' program will begin in Albania, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Georgia, Ghana, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Togo and Uganda, before it is expanded to other countries. A third aspect of the initiative is designed to help kids in the U.S. understand why they should care about the issue. The Peace Corps and the U.S. Agency for International Development are already spending money on these programs. Obama is also asking Congress for $250 million in new and reallocated funding for the initiative, Tchen said. The administration anticipates getting additional support from the private sector, philanthropies, foundations and other donors. In Japan, Mrs. Obama will highlight the importance the two countries place on international girls' education. President Obama traveled to the close U.S. ally on a state visit last April, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due to make a reciprocal visit soon. Cambodia is one of 11 countries included in the first year of the 'Let Girls Learn' program to be run by the Peace Corps. In Cambodia, Mrs. Obama will see how community-driven solutions are helping girls, a focus of the Peace Corps piece of the initiative.","Mrs Obama will visit Tokyo and Kyoto in Japan, from March 18-20 and end the trip with a March 21-22 stop in Siem Reap, northwestern Cambodia .

"Ed Miliband’s flagship plan to cut university tuition fees to £6,000 will not help bright youngsters from poor homes, Britain’s biggest anti-poverty group warned last night. In a scathing assessment, the left-leaning Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the Labour leader’s vow to bring down fees from £9,000 ‘sounds progressive… but sadly it isn’t’. The charity said there were ‘better ways’ to use the £3billion-a-year cost of the policy to help the poor, such as increasing spending on sixth-form colleges in poorer areas. Coming under fire from left: The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has criticised Ed Miliband’s flagship plan to cut university tuition fees to £6,000 . It also pointed out that because low-paid graduates eventually have their fees written off, the policy would ‘mainly benefit mid to high-earning graduates who’d otherwise have been repaying all or most of their loans’. Also, there was ‘no evidence’ the rise in fees under the Coalition had hit the level of applications from poorer students, said the foundation, which added: ‘Even if poorer students are put off, there is no evidence that these students would be much less deterred by fees of £6,000 than £9,000. ‘The biggest factor preventing young people from poorer backgrounds from going to university is that the majority do not get good enough results at school to even attempt it.’ Launching the policy last week, Mr Miliband said he was determined to keep the pledge he first made in 2011. The Tories have opened a three point lead over Labour in a poll. They are up to 34 per cent with Labour on 31 in the survey from former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft. Last week’s Ashcroft poll had Labour in the lead. The new poll shows 42 per cent of voters believe Britain would be burdened with more debt under a Labour government. For the Tories it is 11 per cent. Labour is well ahead on improving the NHS. He insisted poorer students would benefit, adding: ‘The scourge of debt from tuition fees is not only holding back our young people, it is a burden on our country.’ But the proposal has been condemned as ‘financially illiterate’ by experts. University vice-chancellors are sceptical that a Labour government would make up the shortfall in fees. And many in Mr Miliband’s inner circle fear his plan for a £3billion-a-year raid on the pensions of the better-off to fund his eye-catching initiative will cost the party votes. Former Labour leadership contender Diane Abbott told LBC radio yesterday: ‘I think it’s generally understood that Ed was the person in his shadow cabinet who felt most strongly about doing something on tuition fees.’ At a People’s Question Time event in Brighton yesterday, Mr Miliband was accused of ‘electioneering’ by a member of the public, who identified herself only as Francesca. Launching the policy last week, Mr Miliband said he was determined to keep the pledge he first made in 2011 . She told him: ‘I would like to know why you are cutting the tuition fees in the light that a record number of students from poorer backgrounds are applying to university. 'And also the fact that it’s middle-class, better-off students who are going to be paying less. ‘The only conclusion I can get to is that it smacks of electioneering.’","Joseph Rowntree Foundation say Mr Miliband's plan to cut fees won't work .

"Stars of the MTV reality shows, 16 & Pregnant and Teen Mom, Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra, shared their teen pregnancy on television and had a baby, Carly, they placed for adoption. But their personal life before their reality show fame was mired in violence, drugs and sexual abuse. The Teen Mom couple announced their engagement in December after Tyler surprised his sweetheart with an diamond engagement ring. Days later, Catelynn gave birth to their second child, Nova Reign. Their first child, Carly, now five, was given up for adoption when they were 16. Besides telling their story, the reformed couple offer wayward teenagers advice on growing up and 'breaking the cycle of dysfunction' in a new book, Conquering Chaos, published by Post Hill Press. Both Tyler, 24, and Catelynn, who turns 24 on March 12, grew up in different trailer parks in Port Huron, Michigan, but they both experienced the trailer park trash life of intoxicated parents deep into drug abuse, parental jail time and violence. Scroll down for video . Catelynn Lowell and fiancée Tyler Baltierra have been open about her mother and his father's battle with addiction. But they've never revealed the hell they experienced as children as a result or the terrifying habits their parents passed onto them. In their new memoir, Conquering Chaos, the Teen Mom fan-favorites, both 23, talk about witnessing drug-related gun fights, abusing ecstasy and cocaine and more . Out of control. Catelynn and Tyler admit they didn't give birth control much thought. They were using the pull-out method, and that was it. 'I didn't wear condoms and Cate never went on birth control,' writes Tyler. The Teen Mom and her boyfriend decided to give their baby up for adoption . Oh so innocent: Catelynn's mother was a drunk often passed out on the floor, her father an alcoholic and crack addict who spent most of his time in jail. Tyler  became a daycare delinquent at age five and was drinking, smoking weed and cigarettes and taking drugs by age eight . Catelynn says her mother was 'a b****' and a drunk often passed out on the floor, her father an alcoholic and crack addict who spent most of his time in jail. 'It was chaos all the time. I didn't like it, and I didn't thrive on it, but I was familiar with it. It was normal to me,' Catelynn writes. Tyler's father was a crack addict, a con artist, who spent most of his son's younger years in jail while his supportive mother cycled through boyfriends. So the little boy became a daycare delinquent at age five and was drinking, smoking week and cigarettes and taking drugs by age eight. The young couple fell in love at age twelve and 'we both ended up on the same wild ride'. 'Our decision to have sex — and the way we handled it — brought about a consequence that changed our lives forever.' The as-yet-unmarried childhood sweethearts had their second child, Nova on January 1 this year that they are raising, and decided to write about life before the cameras were rolling when they were terrified teenagers mired in the most extreme dysfunctional families in a seedy environment. Catelynn viewed herself as a social butterfly and opted for multiple boyfriends over passing grades in school although school helped her forget how miserable life was back at the trailer. Tyler spotted her when they were both in junior high, walked up and just took her hand. 'We just walked on ahead, holding hands, and we've been together ever since', he writes. 'Her smile lights up the room and her eyes are beautiful piercing gray. Plus, she's got bigger t**s than any other girl in the seventh grade. 'Definitely my kind of chick. I think to myself, ""I have to have her."" He wrote her funny notes, cracked jokes, clowned around. He was more open than she was and he taught her to state her own opinions after years of smothering them and lying. 'So speaking my mind and sharing my feelings just wasn't at the top of my list of survival skills. It wasn't something that had gotten positive results in the past. Blowing smoke: Catelynn Lowell smokes on a bong at a gathering with friends in August 2012 . Baby joy: Catelynn gave birth to their second child, Nova Reign in January, days after they got engaged . 'For my whole life, I had a habit of telling people what I thought they wanted to hear, even if it wasn't the truth'. But they didn't start sleeping together until ten months later. Tyler was molested by an older girl, a friend of his older sister, when he was nine years old. 'One day I went over to her house with my sister and some other people, and for some reason or another, everyone else left but this older girl and me. For the next several hours, while we were alone together in her house, it was sex act after sex act after sex act. It went on all day. She had us doing everything she could think of, one thing after another. There'd be a break and then it would start up again. And when it was finally over, I didn't know what the hell had happened'. That incident left him wanting sex from girls who were only ten years old and if they didn't put out, he called them prudes and broke up with them. When Cate finally gave in to Tyler's sexual desires, it was gangbusters – 'banging in his mom's trailer'. 'Once we'd done it once, we were doing it all the time! After waiting so long we turned into crazy, horny teenagers. It was so bad,' she says. 'We would drink and party together and fool around constantly, all the time'. 'Unfortunately, we were not being safe at all', Tyler says. 'We were using the pull-out method, and that was it. I didn't wear condoms and Cate never went on birth control. 'We just didn't feel like we had to. My parents hadn't given me a real talk about it yet, and Cate's parents hadn't given her a talk. We went through sex education and everything, but I sort of thought I was an expert already. We are family: 'Nothing better than getting to spend the day with both of these amazing woman... my sister and my mother... family is EVERYTHING!,' Tyler posted on Instagram . 'We thought pulling out is good enough, and like typical dumb kids, we couldn't actually comprehend what would happen if it wasn't. 'We just approached sex like we'd taken the pills and the air duster. It was fun and it was available, so we did it, because the risks didn't really scare us. We were doing adult things with a child's level of understanding'. They were also consuming big quantities of drugs. He was smoking cigarettes and weed and drinking booze at age eight as well as 'huffin' air duster that he had stolen from CVS that make his head turn into a balloon. It caused him to have a seizure and pee all over himself. She smelled pot in her house at age ten and started getting high on the sleeping pill Unisom to trip out hallucinating, consuming five or six at a time. She snorted Ritalin – or anything else that happened to be around. 'And there was Robotrippin', where we chugged a bunch of cough syrup to get high. We did Ecstasy when we had that. Basically, anything we could get our hands on to get high with, we'd do it. 'I was a little behind on the air duster. I watched my friends do it for about a month, but I was kind of scared of it. But then I got curious to see what the big deal was, so I started doing that, too. 'We never really drank much, funny enough. We did everything else we could get, huffin', snorting pills, smoking weed, we were all about that stuff. But even our friends weren't really drinking. Why drink when you can huff air duster?' – was her thought. Happy reunion: Catelynn and Tyler's reunion with their biological daughter was filled with joy, smiles and plenty of happy tears . She was just trekking down the same drug route that generations of her relatives had traveled for years. He was in the same boat. 'It would have been better not to mess around with air duster and snort cocaine in middle school. No doubt about that', she says. 'And we can never be certain how long that phase would have lasted, if it wasn't for one little thing. Once that pregnancy test came back positive, there was no more room for drugs and alcohol in our lives. 'We dropped that stuff and didn't even have time to look back.' The teen pregnancy saved their lives from falling further into drug abuse. Now the couple are pursuing healthy, positive lives and hope to encourage teenagers in trouble with self-esteem issues or in unhealthy relationships to seek out counseling to learn self-worth. 'I put my life out there to help others', Catelynn writes. 'For the kids growing up in trailer parks, unstable homes or in the shadow of family problems and addiction – . 'Single moms. 'Pregnant teens feeling lost and scared. 'Anyone trapped in a cycle of dysfunction and wants to make something better of their lives—whatever encouragement we can offer, we offer it from the bottom of our hearts'.

"John Crawford Florey broke Russian intern Olga Grigorash's wrist when he kicked her out of bed at his flat in Notting Hill, London, for refusing to undress . A Cambridge-educated married businessman has been jailed for breaking his Russian mistress' wrist when he kicked her out of bed after she refused to have sex with him. John Crawford Florey, 48, had been having an affair with 40-year-old Russian intern Olga Grigorash for almost a year when she spurned his advances at his rented flat in Notting Hill, west London. Following a dinner out together, the pair returned to the apartment and the former public schoolboy stripped down to his boxer shorts, Iselworth Crown Court heard. However, Ms Grigorash refused to undress and instead laid down on top of the bed fully-clothed. It sent Florey, an 'Old Harrovian' who is originally from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire,  into a fit of rage. The public schoolboy-turned-entrepreneur kicked her in the back with such force she fell against the wall and fractured her wrist. Florey told police Miss Grigorash, 40, had ‘stumbled’ as they rowed at a London flat he had rented for their tryst. He later claimed he had over-reacted at being told he was ‘not rich enough’. He has now been jailed for 18 months for grievous bodily harm and handed a restraining order which bans him from having contact with Miss Grigorash. A judge told the company director he had shown ‘no remorse or concern’ by refusing to help his lover, who was forced to make her own way to hospital for treatment. Jailing him on Friday, Isleworth Crown Court Recorder Philip Shepherd QC said: 'You were trying to force yourself sexually on her and she was unwilling to have sex with you. 'You used considerable force to kick her out of bed when your advances were rejected and the injury is one she still suffers continuing effects. 'The evidence from her was that you went around the side of the bed and kicked her when she was on the floor and you made no attempt to assist her when she was obviously injured and she had to make her way to hospital alone. 'You showed no remorse or concern and did nothing at all and you put her through the trauma of a trial.' Florey, who was cautioned in 2011 for punching another Old Harrovian at a school reunion over an old playground rivalry, was also ordered to pay £6,000 compensation and £2,800 court costs following the incident in the early hours of March 4 last year. Florey, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, is a director of several educational services companies and started an affair with Miss Grigorash in 2013 after she applied for an internship. At his trial, jurors were told she knew he was married and they often met in London, sometimes at a flat in Shepherd’s Bush where Florey’s parents and sister lived. The court was also told their sex life was frequently the cause of arguments and Florey could turn ‘violent, rude and sadistic’. ‘Whenever I was late he was so rude, he was quite sadistic... and I could see he became violent,’ she said. ‘When I didn’t do it the way he wanted he got pretty aggressive.’ And when he failed to perform in bed he would ‘take it out’ on her, it was claimed. ‘(He) was quite violent with me and hurt me and was very unpleasant,’ she added. Florey, 48, (pictured above outside court), who is Cambridge-educated and originally from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, tried to force himself sexually on his unwilling mistress of one year, the judge told the court . The incident took place in March last year after the pair had dinner and drinks after attending a conference at the London School of Economics before returning to a Notting Hill flat Florey had rented for the night. Outlining the incident, prosecutor Neil Griffin told the court: 'The defendant has kicked Miss Grigorash out of bed. A kick of such force that she fell against the wall and fractured her wrist. 'It seems the defendant rubbed toothpaste into her dress as they were brushing their teeth in the bathroom and this upset her, along with him going out to smoke because she did not like smoking. 'She decided to keep her dress on and the defendant had undressed down to his boxers and tried very roughly to kiss her. 'He had a second cigarette and returned to the bedroom and forced himself onto her and she told him he was hurting her. 'Suddenly he kicked her, she says, to the back. She fell out of the bed against the wall and onto the floor and Florey shouted: ""Get out"".' Florey was jailed at Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) for 18 months for grievous bodily harm, handed a restraining order which bans him from having contact with Miss Grigorash and ordered to pay compensation . Miss Grigorash then grabbed her clothes and left the flat before flagging down a taxi to take her to St. Mary's Hospital, where her wrist was put in a cast. Florey was later arrested at Heathrow Airport returning from a business trip. Stuart Stevens, defending, said his client was ‘a respected gentleman’ and had lost his good character. He added: ‘He feels totally disgraced and ashamed and the hardest thing was telling his mother. This was out of character and was not calculated. It was an over-reaction, he says, to being told he was not rich enough. ‘He earns a decent living, but is not a rich man and with this conviction he will not be able to go to certain countries now.’ Speaking to the Evening Standard yesterday, Miss Grigorash, who has a master’s degree in art business at Kingston University and is now a PA for an artist in Chelsea, said: 'I am happy that justice has taken place and I hope he will thank me one day for that. 'He needed to be stopped I think that what happened could have happened to someone else again and who knows what the consequences would have been. 'He is a very strong man and he does not know how to control himself. I hope he has enough time [in prison] to think about it and I really hope he will not harm anyone else further. 'I want to close the door on this episode in my life and not think about it anymore.'","Married John Crawford Florey, 48, had affair with Olga Grigorash for a year .

"Former U.S. Sen. John Danforth denounced the ugly nature of American politics Tuesday while eulogizing Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich, suggesting that political bullying and an anti-Semitic whisper campaign led his friend to kill himself. Danforth expressed 'overwhelming anger that politics has gone so hideously wrong' as he spoke at a memorial services that drew many of Missouri's top elected officials and hundreds of others to the Episcopal church that Schweich had attended in suburban St. Louis. 'Words do hurt. Words can kill,' Danforth said. 'That has been proven right here in this state.' Schweich, 54, fatally shot himself last Thursday in what police say was an apparent suicide at his home in Clayton. He left behind a wife, two children and an apparently rising political career. Missouri's top elected officials and hundreds of others gathered Tuesday at The Church of St Michael and St George in Clayton for the memorial services of state Auditor Tom Schweich . Former U.S. Senator John Danforth (left) delivered the euology at the service, and said campaign bullying was to blame for Schweich's (right) suicide. Schweich was running for governor at the time of his death . He had launched a campaign for the Republican nomination for governor just a month before his death and was already locked in a contentious primary with Catherine Hanaway, a former Missouri House speaker and U.S. attorney. Danforth, who is an ordained Episcopal priest, served 18 years as a Republican senator before retiring in 1995 and remains one of the more respected elder statesmen of Missouri politics. Danforth said he had talked with Schweich two days before his death. He said Schweich was upset about a radio ad from a political action committee that mocked his physical appearance and suggested he was a pawn of Democrats who would 'quickly squash him like the little bug that he is' in a general election.

(AP Photo/St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Robert Cohen, Pool) Former Sen. Danforth leaves The Church of St. Michael and St. George in Clayton, Missouri, after delivering the eulogy at the funeral for Schweich. Even though Schweich was an ordained Episcopal priest, he was allegedly mocked for his Jewish ancestry during the race . Missouri Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder leaves  church on Tuesday, March 3, 2015, after attending Schweich's funeral . Former U.S. Sen. Christopher 'Kit' Bond  also attended the Tuesday services for Schweich . But Danforth said Schweich was particularly distraught by what he perceived to be an anti-Semitic whispering campaign by the chairman of the Missouri Republican party, who Schweich said had been telling people that Schweich was Jewish. Schweich was Christian, but had some Jewish ancestry and had said his grandfather had long-encouraged him to stand up to anti-Semitism. The party chairman, John Hancock, has denied making anti-Semitic remarks, though he has acknowledged he mistakenly believed Schweich was Jewish and may have mentioned it in an off-hand way to some people. Hancock didn't attend the memorial service and declined to comment about Danforth's remarks. 'Today is not an appropriate time to engage in political back-and-forth,' state GOP Executive Director Jonathon Prouty said on Hancock's behalf. Schweich's former spokesman, Spence Jackson, said after the service that Hancock 'should resign immediately' as Republican party chairman and that Hanaway should 'do some serious soul-searching about the race she's run so far and the people she's associated with.' Hanaway did not attend the funeral and a spokesman for her said she will not have any comment. Emergency services were called to Schweich's home (pictured) at 9:48am on Thursday morning, seven minutes after he left a voicemail with St. Louis Today reporter Tony Messenger . Danforth recited a passage from the gospel of Matthew in which Jesus describes as blessed those 'who are persecuted for righteousness sake' and against whom others 'utter all kinds of evil against you on my behalf.' He said Schweich was a 'model public servant' who 'was a person easily hurt and quickly offended' — so much so that Danforth said he had tried to discourage Schweich from entering politics six years ago because he didn't believe Schweich had the temperament for it. Danforth said he is haunted by the fact that he had advised Schweich not to personally go public last week with the allegations of the anti-Semitic whispering campaign and had suggested Schweich should have someone else supply that information to the media. 'He may have thought that I had abandoned him — left him on the high ground all alone,' Danforth said. On the morning of his death, Schweich had invited reporters for The Associated Press and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to his home for an afternoon interview, saying he was ready to go public with the allegations about the anti-Semitic campaign. He shot himself about 13 minutes after talking to the AP reporter over the phone. 'The death of Tom Schweich is the natural consequence of what politics has become,' Danforth said. 'It is now our duty — yours and mine — to turn politics into something much better than it's now so miserable state.' Schweich's coffin, draped in a Missouri flag, was placed at the front of the sanctuary, with his family seated on one side and Gov. Jay Nixon and other top officials seated on the other. The pews were packed and hundreds of people stood along the side isles. Schweich was first elected in 2010 and had easily won election to a second, four-year term in November. He previously served as Danforth's chief of staff for a 1999 federal investigation into the deadly government siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, and followed Danforth to the United Nations, where he was chief of staff for the U.S. delegation. President George W. Bush appointed Schweich to the State Department in 2005 as an international law enforcement official and picked Schweich two years later to coordinate the anti-drug and justice reform efforts in Afghanistan. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Schweich shot himself several times last Thursday at his home, just minutes after calling to schedule an interview with local reporters .

"It is said that you can learn a lot about someone from their handshake - but it appears they may be learning far more about you than we have perhaps ever realised. Scientists have discovered that the traditional sign of friendship is actually a way for us to get a good sniff of someone we have just met. They found that humans unconsciously use the touch from a handshake as a way to sample smelly chemicals from each other. Scroll down for videos of the experiments conducted by the researchers . A firm handshake may also be a way of sampling the scent of the person you have just met, say scientists . In a study using hidden cameras, researchers observed people as they greeted each other with and without handshakes. Those that grasped hands upon meeting then touched their faces and around their nose far more often afterwards compared to a greeting where there was no physical contact. A high-five or fist bump may not be the most formal way of greeing someone, but they have one advantage over a handshake, say experts - they are better for our health. A British study has found that slapping palms together at head height passes on fewer than half as many germs as the traditional greeting. For the study, two Aberystwyth University researchers donned thick rubber gloves and one dipped his hand in a bacterial soup before shaking the other’s hand. The number of bugs transmitted to the second glove was counted and the contact area measured. Then the procedure was repeated with high-fives and also with the even trendier fistbump, which involves two balled fists being gently and briefly rapped together. The high-five was more hygienic than the handshake but the fistbump was the cleanest of all, transferring around one-twentieth of the bugs of the handshake. It is thought that the brevity of the action and the smaller contact area helped slash transmission. The scientists believe that the face touching is a way of subtly sniffing the hand used in the handshake and it was particularly prevalent when greeting people of the same sex. Professor Noam Sobel, chair of neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science, who led the research, said: 'It is well-known that we emit odours that influence the behaviour and perception of others but, unlike other mammals, we don't sample those odours from each other overtly. 'Instead, our experiments reveal handshakes as a discreet way to actively search for social chemosignals.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal eLife, believe their findings may provide some hints at why handshakes first evolved to become a greeting and cementing a friendship. It has since become a way of sealing a deal and even a sign of sportsmanship. Limp and damp handshakes are often seen as being an unattractive trait. But they may also provide us with unconscious olfactory clues about the other person. Many other animals use smell as a key part of learning more about each other, such as dogs that will regularly sniff each other upon greeting. Idan Frumin, a neurologist at the Weizmann Institute who also conducted the research, said: 'It is quite possible that ""boardroom etiquette"" is actually a later explanation for an early type of behaviour that appeared in order to compensate for scarcity of physical contact between human individuals. 'As we don’t overtly sniff each other like other mammals, we needed a way to pass olfactory data between our peers. The handshake might be the best way to convey chemosignals.' The scientists secretly filmed 271 people as they greeted one of 20 members of the research team in a hospital setting. They found that subjects who shook hands with people of the same sex sniffed their right hand twice as much than if they had not shaken hands. When members of the opposite sex greeted, participants sniffed their right hand far less than before a handshake but tended to sniff their left 'non-shaking' hand more often. The participants in the study were filmed in a hospital, shown above) greeting researchers and were found to sniff their fingers and hands considerably more after shaking hands with the person they were meeting . Touching the nose after physical contact (like above) may be a way of smelling chemical signals on others . The researchers believe this may be due to participants unconsciously comparing their own scent to that of the opposite sex. In general the participants placed their hand close to their nose 22 per cent of the time after shaking hands for up to around 17 seconds at a time. They found that increased airflow through a sample of participants nostrils also accompanied the face touching, indicating that they were sniffing. When the scientists added strong artificial odours to wrists of those greeting the participants using scents associated with male or female body odour, the length of time they spent sniffing decreased. However, when they added perfume to the wrists of those greeting, the amount of sniffing , they found the amount of time participants touched their face for doubled. The researchers claim that his may be because artificial odours may mask the chemical signals from a handshake and so it requires more sniffing to detect them. It could also be because the participants found the smells more pleasing than the body odour. However, Mr Frumin said it was still unclear exactly what chemical signals were being exchanged during handshakes. He said: 'For instance, we know from research by Martha McClintock in the 70s that women tend to synchronize their menstrual cycles. 'A signal may be transferred between women to drive that effect. We also know that the choice of a mate is influenced by a person having a compatible immune system. 'Such data could potentially be transferred skin-to-skin contact via a handshake. But these are speculations and a more rigorous analysis is needed to explore these possibilities.'","Scientists at Israel's Weizmann Institute secretly filmed strangers meeting .

The feud had been simmering between the pair for the past two weeks after current Money In The Bank-title holder Rollins claimed that he could do a better job of hosting the Comedy Central show. Stewart then issued a challenge to Rollins via a cell phone clip before the two men briefly came face-to-face on The Daily Show itself last week when Rollins got Stewart in a headlock. Scroll down for videos . Daily Show host Jon Stewart took his life into his hands on Monday night when he entered the wrestling ring to spar with WWE star Seth Rollins as their feud continued .

Then as Rollins was about to hit Stewart for his insolence, WrestleMania opponent Randy Orton interrupted proceedings and gave Stewart the opportunity to hit Rollins below the belt in the groin . 'Shut your mouth and bring it,' said Rollins and on Monday night in New Jersey that is exactly what Stewart did. On Monday’s Raw the beef between the two stars had continued as Rollins staged his own version for The Daily Show and called Stewart out to face him. Stewart, a big WWE fan, walked out to the sound of his show's theme music and then confronting Rollins, calling him 'a swat team stripper with Lady Gaga’s hair.' Then as Rollins was about to hit Stewart for his insolence, WrestleMania opponent Randy Orton interrupted proceedings and gave Stewart the opportunity to hit Rollins below the belt in the groin. The pair’s beef started two weeks ago when Rollins had proudly boasted that he had aspirations beyond being 'the future of WWE'. 'Right now, I am the most talented performer in the entire world. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want,' Rollins told the crowd.

'Seth Rollins, you've made a lot of mistakes in your life: Being a turncoat to the Shield, being a toady for the Authority, not being able to choose which color your hair should be – but this is the biggest mistake you ever made,' said Stewart. 'You just stepping in a world of hurt, my friend. I'm coming for you Rollins, and you're gonna see it: 160 pounds of dynamite.' Stewart then admitted that 'my bone density is not what it used to be,' and instead declared himself '160 pounds of wood, like a soft wood. My point is you messed with the wrong guy!'

"A 22-year-old man bought a coin that he believes could date back more than 2,000 years for just £29. Coin collector Stephen Creswell snapped up what he thinks is a half shekel from Tyre - which dates back to 126BC - at an auction in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire. The coins are believed by Biblical scholars to have been the same as those used to pay Judas Iscariot his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. Lost treasure? The coin found by Stephen Creswell, 22, which he believes to be half a shekel from Tyre . Collector: Mr Creswell, pictured, bought the coin for just £29 at an auction in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire . But one expert claims the coin is unlikely to be an original and believes Mr Cresswell might have a 'mock up'. The battered coin weighs 7.7grams, half of a full shekel's weight. The earliest reference of the coin comes in 126BC and it is understood that they remained in circulation. Shekels were used for temple tax in ancient Jerusalem due to their relatively higher concentration of silver than other Roman coins. In Matthew 27:3 it is said: 'Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders...' In some translations of the bible, the word 'silver' is replaced with 'shekels'. Mr Creswell, from Dudley, West Midlands said that he bought the coin as part of a selection but quickly realised he had 'something special'. He said: 'As soon as I saw how old it was I knew I had something special on my hands. I had no idea what it was though until I typed it in to the search engine. 'I'm not really a coin collector, but I just love to grab a bargain.' But after looking at images of the coin, one expert said he does not believe it to be a shekel as Mr Cresswell had hoped. Payment: The coins are believed by Biblical scholars to have been the same as those used to pay Judas Iscariot his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus, illustrated in this image above . Professional numismatist Mike Vosper told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that this is not even a coin but either a contemporary forgery, although this is doubtful, or more like a modern mock up of a ""coin"" believed to be some kind of shekel.' Mr Vosper, who runs Mike R Vosper Coins with his partner Viv, said it was the fabric of the coin and the fact that it has half its surface missing that gives it away. Viv added: 'Some coins have surface deposits but nothing like that'. Mr Vosper added that coins such as that is not likely to be found in the UK. The coin, if real, could fetch up to £500 if it was to be sold. Mr Creswell has no intention of selling it on as it reminds me of playing with artifacts when he was younger. He said: 'We had these old coins lying around when I was a kid. They always fascinated me because of the places they have travelled and the hands they could have passed through.' Mr Cresswell started attending auctions as a teenager and said he loved their competitive nature. He said: 'Bidding against other people is part way between placing a bet and taking part in a competition. 'I hate leaving any auction empty handed. My home is full of quirky objects that I've picked up along the way. Without doubt, the half shekel is my favourite so far.'","Collector Stephen Creswell, 22, bought the coin at auction for just £29 .

"Students are being encouraged to go to summer school… at GCHQ. Britain’s spy centre is offering a £2,500 bounty to attract would-be surveillance sleuths to take a ten-week course. Intelligence chiefs at the listening post are aiming to recruit a new generation of computer wizards to tackle the growing threat of cybercrime. The 70 or so candidates who successfully apply for the course will be given a glimpse into the latest cyber-technologies as well as learning new skills including cyber-security and hacking. Britain’s spy centre )pictured above) is offering a £2,500 bounty to attract would-be surveillance sleuths to take a ten-week course . The top-secret Cheltenham-based spy agency, which provides electronic surveillance of the nation’s enemies, have taken the unprecedented step to help deliver its mission to keep the UK safe. The Government is increasingly concerned that terrorists and enemy countries could seek to mount a crippling cyber-attack to bring down Britain’s economy, energy supply and national defences at the click of a mouse. Attackers ranging from lone criminals to rogue states seek to steal industrial secrets or spread mayhem and fear. A report recently found that four in every five big firms in the UK experienced some sort of serious cyber-security breach last year. US movie giant Sony Pictures was also hacked by North Korea. But experts say there is a dire shortage of specialists able to defend Britain’ s computer systems from increasingly sophisticated assaults by hostile states and terrorists. Agents at GCHQ unveiled plans for the summer school, the first of its kind, amid mounting warnings that Britain is one of the world’s major cyber-crime targets, and needs a new type of army to wage war against its digital foes. The course, which will run from July 6 to September 11, is aimed at computer science students in their first or second year at university who have an interest in cyber beyond that of their studies and are skilled in at least one computer language. The summer school will feature lessons from GCHQ’s own cybersecurity experts, as well as guest speakers from some of the world’s leading technology companies. To qualify for a place on the Cyber Insiders Summer School, students will need advanced coding skills, as well as the ability and tenacity to solve a variety of complex problems. Intelligence chiefs at the listening post are aiming to recruit a new generation of computer wizards to tackle the growing threat of cybercrime (file image) On the course they will work with a wide range of technologies, from legacy systems that have been in use for a number of years to the most up-to-date mobile technology. They will learn new technical skills in areas such as cyber security, ethical hacking, penetration testing and security networks. They will also learn about GCHQ’s role in defending the UK against cyber threats. The programme will culminate in a ‘live’ war games-style exercise where they will be able to put the skills that they’ve learned into practice. Those who successfully complete the course could land a job at the spy agency. A GCHQ spokesman said: ‘The unique Cyber Insiders Summer School offers computer science students a fantastic opportunity to enhance their cyber skills and to discover how GCHQ use a variety of technologies to protect the UK. ‘They’ll not only enhance their cyber knowledge, but completing the programme will also look good on their CV and, if they prove their abilities, we may even offer them a job interview.’ Prospective candidates should apply through GCHQ’s careers website www.gchq-careers.co.uk. Places are limited and applications close next Monday (Mar09).","Britain's spy centre offering youths a £2,500 to train at summer school .

"Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have reached the point of no return. The two Australians are making their final journeys from the Bali prison where they have been incarcerated for 10 years to a sinister island they have only heard about called Nusakambangan. There, a firing squad awaits. The grim news that there is now no hope of escaping their fates hangs heavily over the family and friends of the two men. For Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 34, leaving the Balinese prison which has been their home for the last 10 years brings only fear and dread. Scroll down for video . Myuran Sukumaran is escorted on to a flight, en route to Nusakambangan, on Wednesday . A handcuffed Andrew Chan is led up the steps and on to the flight out of Bali to Death Island . Prison home: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been escorted out of Kerobokan prison in Bali, their home for 10 years, and have begun their finals journey, to Nusakambangan, aka Death Island . Growing up inside: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, aged about 22 and 25 years old in 2006 (left), and the men almost a decade later (right) pictured inside Kerobokan jail this week as they awaited the news about their departure from Bali for central Java where they will be executed . Chan and Sukumaran are driven out of of Kerobokan on Wednesday in an armoured vehicle. The streets were lined with police and riot officers . The ringleaders of the Bali Nine heroin drug ring were given a Hindu blessing ceremony at Kerobokan prison and said their farewells. Neither man has been outside the walls of Kerobokan since shortly after their arrest on April 17, 2005, when Chan, then a 21-year-old, was seated on a Qantas flight which was ready to depart Ngurah Rai airport. He was not carrying any drugs. Sukumaran only enjoyed a few more hours of freedom, his arrest coming later on the same day at the Melasti Beach Bungalows in Kuta Beach along with Bali Nine mules Si Yi Chen, Tan Duc Than Nguyen and Matthew Norman, who had 11.8 ounces of heroin strapped to their bodies. A set of scales were also in the room. One way trip: The two condemned men will fly to Tunggul Wulung airport in the central Javanese town of Cilacap 700km from  Denpasar airport which they have not seen for the ten years since the Bali Nine were arrested with 8.3kg of heroin in a doomed attempt to smuggle the drugs from Indonesia back to Australia .

Chan and Sukumaran left the prison never to return, escorted by 22 heavily armed men dressed in black, the members of the Brimob  special police mobile brigade. Handcuffed and walked by figures with their faces hidden by masks and balaclavas, the pair were placed into armoured personnel carriers, called Barracuda or Wolf, and driven on the 30 minute trip to Ngurah Rai airport. Unlikely to have got the chance to see the makeover the airport terminal has undergone since they flew into Bali in 2005, the men were driven across the tarmac to a small prop plane. They are being escorted every step of the way by the Brimob officers. After takeoff Chan and Sukumaran got their last glimpse of Denpasar and Kerobokan prison before the aircraft turned west on its 700km journey. The flight, expected to take two hours, took them over the mountainous terrain of eastern Java, with its volcanoes and verdant highlands, then down to the coast and tiny rundown Tunggul Wulung Airport in Cilacap, which normally opens only between 7am and 2pm and services mostly flight schools.

From the air strip to Wijaya Pura, the quay to Cilacap's port, it is a 16km drive through a sprawling industrial city, but the Indonesian police are expected to transfer the Australians to Nusakambangan in another armoured vehicle. Although the Australians will miss the bustle of Cilacap's streets, which are choked with trucks and hundreds of noisy motorbikes, their transfer into a different culture will become obvious when they hear their first Islamic call to prayer broadcast on loudspeakers.

Densely overgrown with tropical rainforest, Nusakambangan is 121 square kilometres and its seven operating prisons cannot be seen from the shore opposite. They will then be taken to Batu or 'stone' prison, one of the island's seven facilities, where prison officers have been preparing special isolation cells to separate Chan and Sukumaran and others due for execution from the remainder of the prison population. Family members will have to take the police boat to Nusakambangan to visit them. The journey takes around 30 minutes and ends at Sodong dock.

They will also be asked to make a written final request, which may be in the form of making a statement about their guilt or innocence. They will also be allowed to choose whether they are strapped to the execution post when they face the firing squad and whether they wish to be blindfolded or not. Over on the mainland in Cilacap, Chan and Sukumaran's relatives will be staying in hotels and accompanied throughout the town by Australian embassy staff from Jakarta or Denpasar.

An ambulance with the body of  executed prisoner, Dutchman Ang Kiem Soei, at Cilacap in January arrives off the police boat from Nusakambangan island in central Java to thedock of Wjaya Pura port . Meanwhile, preparations for the executions are gathering apace, with ambulances due at the Java Christian Church on Friday, where they will be marked in alphabetical order, A to J, for the ten prisoners due for execution and labelled with the condemned person's names. The ambulances will be loaded each with a coffin and taken to the island. At 10pm on Saturday, Cilacap mortician Suhendro Putra will board the police boat with the coffins and be ferried to Nusakambangan. The families of Chan and Sukumaran may also go to the island if they wish, but Mr Putra told Daily Mail Australia that they would probably remain at Sodong dock while the executions took place. Around midnight Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will each be taken to a clearing on the island to face a firing squad of twelve men armed with rifles, nine of which are loaded with blanks and three with live rounds. .","The two Bali Nine death row inmates have begun their final journey .

"The widow of a retired police officer who shot dead two of their daughters before turning the gun on himself will receive $500,000 in death benefits despite earlier fears she'd be left penniless. Former White Plains Officer Glen Hochman had filed new retirement papers removing his wife as beneficiary just 10 days before he carried out the killings in Harrison, New York on February 21. It means that the state could recognize the original form - and it has indicated it will do so, the lawyer, Warren Roth, told the newspaper. Scroll down for video . Payout: Glen Hochman, left, removed his wife Anamarie as a beneficiary of his retirement just days before he shot dead two of their daughters and took his own life. But she will likely still receive a payout . 'She would have been left with nothing had this happened two weeks later,' he said. 'They could have decided to accept the other form... but this saves everyone years of litigation. 'We appreciate the state stepping up and helping the family in this critical situation.' White Plains officials have also indicated that the city will cover health insurance for Mrs DiPietro-Hochman, 50, and her surviving 22-year-old daughter, Samantha, for 90 days, Roth said. He added that he hopes they can come to a longer-term agreement over the health insurance. Glen Hochman, 52, retired from the White Plains force after 22 years on January 30. Three weeks later, when his wife and their older daughter were in Connecticut, he gunned down 17-year-old Alissa and 13-year-old Deanna with his 40-caliber Glock as they slept. Murdered: He shot dead 17-year-old Alissa and 13-year-old Deanna (pictured) as well as the family's three dogs before taking his life on February 21. He and his wife had spoken about separating before the deaths . Left behind: His wife, Anamarie DiPietro-Hochman, second left, and their surviving daughter, 22-year-old Samantha, center, are pictured at funerals for the two slain teenagers . He then killed their three dogs, typed out a suicide note on the computer and shot himself. Mrs DiPietro-Hochman asked Alissa's teenage boyfriend to check the house because neither had been able to contact anyone there. He discovered Hochman's body in the garage. He called police who found the girls' bodies. Hochman, who had no known health or psychiatric problems, apparently carried out the killings after he and his wife had spoken about a possible separation weeks earlier. Before the murders, Mrs DiPietro-Hochman went to police to report a non-violent argument with her husband over an $80 cellphone bill because a friend had urged her to record such incidents. Authorities said the suicide note, which was addressed to his wife and which included five or six pages of instructions on getting things in order, indicated that the killings were premeditated. Scene: Alissa's boyfriend found Glen Hochman's body in the garage after Mrs DiPietro-Hochman asked them to check on her family. Police later found the bodies of the girls, who had been shot in their sleep . Interviews with people who knew him found no one had an inkling that 'Mr. Hoffman would have committed this heinous crime,' said Harrison police Chief Anthony Marraccini last week. Still, 'Harrison police investigators discovered a suicide note at the residence indicating that the killings were premeditated by Mr. Hochman,' he said. He added: 'It's difficult, especially when you see two young girls, their lives have been ripped away, brutally murdered. You can't get any rationale for that... The act is so incredibly bad.'","Former NY cop Glen Hochman filed new retirement papers that barred his wife from a payout just days before he killed their daughters and himself .

"She's the daughter of the former Olympic champion Kriss Akabusi so it's little wonder that Shakira Martin, nee Akabusi, is a keen fitness fanatic. In fact, after starting out with a career in musical theater the pretty 27-year-old is now a fitness instructor who runs her own training business, The Natural Health Company. Now Shakira, from London, has decided to share her story of how she got back into shape in just eight weeks after giving birth to her baby boy, Rio, in a bid to inspire other new mothers. Scroll down for video . Shakira Martin has revealed to Femail how she has lost her baby weight in just seven weeks by exercising when her baby boy, Rio, is asleep . Shakira has been sharing her impressive results with her Instagram followers and says she wants to inspire other women . Shakira, who lives in London with her husband, Tom, said that she was horrified to find that while she was pregnant people were constantly telling her she'd never get her shape back. She said: 'It was amazing and it shocked me that everyone was saying to me, ""You're never going to get your figure back."" 'Even a midwife - not my own - said to me, ""There's nothing you can do, your boobs will be saggy, you'll never get your stomach back."" 'And I just thought it was very demoralising for me and for that to be the message going out to other women.' Shakira says that having being made to feel like there was no hope she made it her mission to prove people wrong. She said: 'In the end it was the best thing they could have said to me. I made it my mission to get back into shape and I even posted about it on my social media, I said to people, you can follow me as I do this. Shakira poses with her adorable son Rio, who was born at the beginning of January . Shakira, who works as a fitness instructor, put on weight as her bump grew during pregnancy . Shakira shared a photograph of herself on her first day back at the gym, she has since regained her impressive abs . 'Some people commented saying, ""I can't believe you're so self obsessed"", but it's not about that, it's about being happy and healthy and for me that means being in good shape. It's important to feel good about yourself.' Shakira says she carried on teaching her exercises until just five weeks before Rio's birth, but that didn't stop her putting on weight when she was pregnant. The usually slim and toned Mother said she put on over two and a half stone. 'I was still teaching my classes up until about five or six weeks before he was born,' she said. 'I obviously wasn't lifting any heavy weights any more but I was keeping active and I have a chocolate labrador so he always needs walking. She continued: 'They say you put on about two and a half stone during the pregnancy but I had put that on by six months and you could really see it in my face. 'I would be lying if I said it never bothered me, there was one time I wanted to buy a dress and it was the kind of thing I would have always loved to wear but I just couldn't. 'But I made the choice to become a mother and I think pregnant women look beautiful.' Shakira's first run came 15 days after she gave birth, she jogged for 15 minutes and says it's important to build up your exercise regime slowly . Shakira says one of her favourite things to do is to put on her music and dance around her house . Shakira regularly shares photographs of herself enjoying her work outs on Instagram . Shakira has been showing off pictures of how her body has been changing, these pictures were taken 15 days after she gave birth to baby Rio . Shakira, who has worked with the pop singer Jessie J, revealed that when it came to getting back into shape, she found it was important to take things one step at a time. She said: 'I had to accept, you know, I'm not going to have two hours to go to the gym. But you just have to fit it in where you can. 'I do my exercise in short sharp bursts so if that baby is sleeping for an hour I might do half an hour of exercise. 'I'm lucky enough to have a garden so I'll pop outside where I will do some high knees, jumping jacks, burpees, press ups then some tricep drips and sit ups.' And she'll even dance around her house in a bid to get fit: 'One of my favourite things to do is to put some music on my headphones and just dance around my bedroom. 'I must look completely crazy to anyone if they looked in but I love dancing - I used to do musical theatre and also one of the things I missed the most when I was pregnant and having a baby was being able to go out to a club and dance.' Shakira, pictured here on her wedding day with her father, is the daughter of former Olympic athlete Kriss Akabusi . Shakira's Father Kriss gives her away at her wedding to her husband Tom Martin, they now have a son together named Rio . Shakira says she started exercising again almost as soon as Rio was born: 'I started on day two, I started walking and I went for my first jog after two weeks - it was just 15 minutes but you can build up from there. 'When my husband is home at the weekend, I'll have breakfast and sometimes go to the gym for an hour. 'I'm breastfeeding which also burns a lot of calories and I'm lucky that I can express my milk and leave it with Tom while I pop out. For me it is a priority to be healthy and I want to be an inspiration for other women. 'I don't want to be a size zero, I enjoy the feeling of exercise and doing good for my body.' Shakira says she did put on weight while she was pregnant but that it didn't bother her too much because she feels pregnant women are beautiful . Shakira gives her little boy Rio a kiss as they pose for an adorable family photograph . Shakira says she eats healthily, but unlike a lot of dieters she doesn't cut out carbs. 'I can't have white bread but I have wholemeal bread and lots of eggs and lean meat like chicken and fish. 'People always say you should avoid carbs but for me if I want to keep my muscle and burn fat I have to eat carbs so I will have rice and pasta. She adds: 'One of my tricks is to carry dry cereal around in my bag, people always laugh but I hate the feeling of being hungry and that's far better than eating a packet of crisps. 'As a new mother you know you sometimes don't have time to prepare extravagant meals so I eat a lot of fruit and veg and toast.' Shakira says she tries to do four things a week whether they be a jog or dancing around her room, fitting in her exercise when baby Rio is sleeping. And her hard work has been praised by her friends. She posts regular pictures on Instagram and Twitter with one of her pals commenting on an amazing shot of her abs: 'Omg can I please look like you after I pop this little peanut out? You look amazing!!' Shakira shared this adorable snap of her and Rio and says she likes to try and exercise when he is sleeping .","Shakira Martin has got her abs back just eight weeks after giving birth .

"In recent years the search for life beyond our planet has focused on finding places with conditions that are ‘Earth-like’, so as to emulate our own planet, which we know can support life. However, scientists have now proposed that some worlds might be able to host life ‘not as we know it’ that thrives not on water, but on other chemicals. Specifically, they looked at Saturn’s moon Titan, which has seas of liquid methane rather than water, and they it could harbour methane-based, oxygen-free forms of life. Cornell University scientists in New York have proposed a new type of life. Called an azotosome, it would survive on liquid methane rather than water - so it could live on Titan. Shown is an illustration of a nine-nanometre azotosome, the size of a virus, with a piece of the membrane cut away to show the hollow interior . The fascinating research by scientists at Cornell University in New York suggests that life in the universe may be abundant in more places than thought. The life they propose, called an azotosome, would be composed of small organic nitrogen compounds and be capable of functioning in liquid methane temperatures of -180°C (-292°F). No life on Earth is known to be able to survive in similar conditions. ‘Ours is the first concrete blueprint of life not as we know it,’ said graduate student James Stevenson, first author of the research. Life on our planet relies on a permeable water-based exterior - a vesicle or liposome - that houses the organic matter of every cell. As no life on Earth can survive without water, astronomers have been looking for alien life in habitable zones of stars where liquid water can exist - it is not too hot, and not too cold. But if cells could be based on methane, rather than water, they could survive in much colder climates, as methane has a much lower melting point. A study in November 2014 argued that alien species could exist on planets that contain an exotic substance known as 'supercritical' carbon dioxide, rather than water. This type of CO2 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds, creating a supercritical fluid that has features of both a liquid and gas. Carbon dioxide becomes supercritical when its temperature exceeds 305 degrees Kelvin (32°C) and its pressure goes beyond 72.9 the standard atmosphere at sea level. On Earth, it's increasingly used in application such as dry cleaning or to sterilise medical equipment, but astrobiologists at Washington State University believe it could also be capable of sustaining life. Study co-author Professor Schulze-Makuch and his team compared enzymes in carbon dioxide and in water, and found that they were more stable in supercritical CO2. The life proposed by the scientists would be composed of small organic nitrogen compounds and be capable of functioning in liquid methane temperatures of -180°C (-292°F). This means it could survive on the surface of Titan (illustration shown), meaning more worlds might be habitable than we thought . The theoretical azotosome life form is made from nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen molecules - all of which are known to exist in the cryogenic seas of Titan. However, it shows the same stability and flexibility as comparable life on Earth. And interestingly, to create the structures, the scientists also envision the cells could use a compound called acrylonitrile, which is a strong barrier to decomposition. Acrylonitrile is a colourless, poisonous, liquid organic compound use in the manufacture of acrylic fibres and thermoplastics on Earth - and it is also present in Titan’s atmosphere. Chemical Engineer Dr Paulette Clancy said the the next step is to try and demonstrate how these cells would behave in the methane environment. This includes how they might reproduce and metabolise with their oxygen-free, methane-based cells. From left to right are graduate student James Stevenson, astronomer Jonathan Lunine and chemical engineer Paulette Clancy, with a Cassini image of Titan in the foreground of Saturn, and an azotosome, the theorized cell membrane on Titan, shown on the right .","Cornell University scientists in New York have proposed a new type of life .

"Prosecutors plan to pursue the death penalty in the trial of Craig Hicks, 46 . The man who shot dead three Muslim students near the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill campus last month could be executed for the crime. Craig Hicks, 46, has been charged with first-degree murder in the February 10 shooting deaths of Deah Barakat, 23; his wife Yusor Abu-Salha, 21; and Yusor's sister Razan Abu-Salha, 19. Durham County District Attorney Roger Echols has expressed in court documents filed last week that the state plans to pursue capital charges in the case, which is currently being investigated as a possible hate crime by the FBI. Echols will explain his reasons for pursuing the death penalty at a hearing set for April. Prosecutors often push for the death penalty in cases where they can use execution as leverage to get the accused to agree to a plea deal, opting for a lesser sentence like life in prison for pleading guilt and avoiding trial. Hicks has reportedly already confessed to murder, though authorities still haven't revealed whether he gave a motive for his crime. His wife Karen Haggerty Hicks says he killed the three students because of an argument over parking spaces at the Finley  Forest apartments where they all lived just a few miles from the Chapel Hill campus. However,others have voiced the opinion that the shooting was a hate crime based on the students' Muslim faith. Police say they found documents on Hicks' computer that show he kept detailed notes on the parking situation at the apartment complex. Hicks stands accused of shooting dead North Carolina students Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, on February 10 . A search of Hicks' home turned up 12 firearms including four pistols and a Bushmaster AR-15. He also described himself as a 'gun toting' atheist in online posts. Hicks faces three charges of first-degree murder as well as a charge of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling. The FBI is currently investigating the shooting to see if any federal laws against crimes of religious bias were broken. Hicks remains behind bars at Central Prison in Raleight, where he is reportedly  being kept in isolation for 'safe-keeping'. He is being represented by a court-appointed public defender.

Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I try and go to the gym as much as I can,' she said. 'It could be three times a week or not at all one week, but I don't punish myself if I don't go.' Her beauty regime is pared-back and she swears by simply cleansing, toning and moisturising every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin .

"A man who dropped out of university to start his own computer gaming business has sold the company for £20million. Craig Fletcher started Multiplay in his bedroom at his parents' home in Blackfield, Hampshire, some 20 years ago. The 36-year-old has now sold the company - whose 50 employees include Mr Fletcher's mother and brother - to video game retailer Game Digital. Scroll down for video . Entrepreneur: Craig Fletcher, pictured with his girlfriend, Pippa Caygill, who started Multiplay in his bedroom at his parents' home in Langley, Hampshire, some 20 years ago, has now sold the company for £20million . Remaining modest, Mr Fletcher said he plans to use the money from the sale to buy a new house for himself and girlfriend Pippa Caygill - and to pay off his brothers' mortgages. In 1994, when competitive online gaming was in its infancy, Mr Fletcher organised his first tournament, where 20 of his friends played first-person shooter Doom II at a Southampton hotel. He continued to organise weekend events while studying medicine at Edinburgh University, but they soon attracted hundreds of people and the hobby began placing more demands on his time. Mr Fletcher said: 'I originally started it as a hobby, something that I did for fun. I got to my final year of medical school and realised it was getting silly. 'I'd fly down on a Wednesday to organise an event with hundreds of people at the weekend and then head back for exams. I had to give the company a shot.' He dropped out of university in 2001 to work on Multiplay full-time and his mother, father and brother joined the business. Family business: Craig Fletcher, centre, with parents Tom, 72, and Yvonne, 67 (left) and brother Stewart, 47 . Working out of the family's four-bedroom home in Langley, the team continued to grow the business. Now, the company has 50 members of staff at their headquarters in Southampton, Hampshire. And more than 10 million users from around the world connect to Multiplay each month to play popular games like Minecraft and the Battlefield series. Mr Fletcher's father, Tom, 72, has retired from the company, but his 67-year-old mother Yvonne continues to work as the office secretary. Modest: Mr Fletcher, pictured, said he plans to use the money from the sale to buy a new house for himself and girlfriend Pippa Caygill . Mr Fletcher said the money made from selling the business will go towards paying off the mortgages of his brothers Paul, 48, and Stewart, 47, who works for Multiplay as operations director. He added that he and his partner, Pippa Caygill, 30, a urology surgical registrar, will likely move to a new home near Romsey, Hampshire. He said: 'We're very happy. This is a reward for those of us who have risked an awful lot. It recognises the hard work that everybody puts in. 'I honestly haven't thought about how else I'll spend the money, I'm more focused on getting the business out there. I did sneak a look at a few cars, though.' Mr Fletcher, who currently drives a Jaguar Xf, has been looking at Aston Martins, his mother said. He added  that a lot of the cash will be reinvested in new equipment. 'The sky's the limit. We have had a rocket put under us and we're going to be growing very fast,' he said. 'I wouldn't be surprised if there were 150 people working here in three years' time. We've got some big ambitions.' With the business initially revolving around him playing online and establishing contacts, now he hardly has any time to play games himself as work takes over. He said: 'The last game I played quite a lot was Eve Online [an online multiplayer game set in space]. I exist so that other people can play.' He added: 'Who knew this little tech company could grow so fast and do so much? 'We have been working with Game for quite a while. They were the first exhibitor who came to one of our shows. Events: Multiplay also organises gaming events including the Insomnia festival (pictured) - labelled the 'Glastonbury of the gaming world' - which saw 67,000 people attend last year and 1.4 million participate online . In 1994, when competitive online gaming was in its infancy, Mr Fletcher organised his first tournament, where 20 of his friends played first-person shooter Doom II (scene pictured above) at a Southampton hotel . 'They approached us. It almost happened as part of a conversation and it got to point where it was actually happening. 'For the first time in my life I will have a boss.

"The 19-year-old daughter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr reportedly freaked out at staff at an upstate New York club when they refused to allow her in with a fake ID, screaming: 'I am a Kennedy, Google me!' Kyra Kennedy allegedly threw a tantrum after being turned away from club Lava at the Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona, New York last Thursday. The teen had tried to use 26-year-old Kick Kennedy's passport but couldn't remember her half-sister's birthday and was caught looking up the date of birth on Wikipedia by a security guard.

The teen reportedly used half-sister Kick Kennedy's passport (right) to try to get into a nightclub in upstate New York but couldn't remember her date-of-birth . An eagle-eyed security guard at the Lava club at the casino complex in Verona, New York spotted that the 19-year-old was using the wrong ID last Thursday . After being turned away from the club, she screamed: 'I am a Kennedy, Google me!', The New York Post reported, quoting a source. One witness said Kyra, a great-niece of JFK, then threatened: 'If you don't let me in, the governor will be calling.' When she was still refused entry to the over-21s club, she went to scream at the front desk staff that she would sue. Turning Stone Resort Casino would not comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online on Tuesday. Miss Kennedy was visiting friends for the weekend at Syracuse University. Andrew Warren posted a picture to his Instagram account of the pre-party in a hotel room where Kennedy and friends Gaia Matisse and Julia Moshy posed up in their lingerie in front of a table laden with vodka and tequila. Kyra Kennedy pictured left in Dior making her society debut at the Paris Bal des débutantes in November 2013 (pictured left) Friend Gaia Matisse told Daily Mail Online that the story had been exaggerated and blown out of proportion. Miss Matisse said she was not aware of Kyra drinking before going to the club. She added: 'I do not know the details, except the fact that after Kyra was declined she went back to the hotel room and went to sleep.' Kyra Kennedy's social media accounts reveal that she is no stranger to partying, posting shots of her attending events around the world. In 2013, the teen, daughter of RFK Jr and the late Mary Richardson Kennedy, made her society debut at the Paris Bal des débutantes in Christian Dior. She was accompanied by her father and his then girlfriend, actress Cheryl Hines. The couple married last year. Kyra is an aspiring fashion designer and has had internships at Dior and Kenneth Cole. Using a fake ID in New York (which includes borrowing someone else's real ID), can lead to penalties including fines and community service. However, altering an official ID may constitute 'possession of a forged instrument' - a class-D felony under New York State penal law. Kick Kennedy, who is RFK's daughter with his first wife Emily Black, is an actress who has been in TV shows The Newsroom, Gossip Girl and Curb Your Enthusiasm (which also stars RFK Jr's new wife Cheryl).

"Islamist campaigner: Asim Qureshi is research director of the Cage human rights pressure group . The Islamist campaigner who described Jihadi John as a ‘beautiful young man’ claims he himself was turned into an ‘anti-white racist’ at private school. Asim Qureshi, 33, said he and other ethnic minority children were ghettoised at £18,000-a-year Whitgift School in Croydon, south London. Rich white boys – particularly rugby players – apparently bullied and racially abused ‘five foot nothing Asians’. The campaigner sparked outrage last week when he made himself chief apologist for the suddenly-unmasked British Islamic State killer Mohammed Emwazi, claiming the terrorist was radicalised by security service harassment. Mr Qureshi, the research director of the controversial Cage human rights pressure group, has known Emwazi for years, and has previously been caught on camera urging Muslims to support jihad during a rally the American embassy in London. But the Daily Mail can reveal that the campaigner had previously told how he became actively ‘anti-white’ himself – and blamed it on rich white pupils at elite Whitgift. Fees for full boarders there are £35,000-a-year. Mr Qureshi, who lives in a £530,000 detached house in Surrey, was born in Britain to Pakistani parents and – thanks to his mother’s ice-cream business – was sent to 400-year-old Whitgift. He said: ‘It is a very expensive private school. It is one of those schools that has every single facility available. I did not necessarily, from an academic perspective, take the best advantage of it. Bullying claims: Mr Qureshi said he and other ethnic minority children were ghettoised at £18,000-a-year Whitgift School (pictured) in Croydon, south London . ‘Every single student who goes to that school is expected to come up with straight As. ‘But even within that school, we formed a ghetto very, very quickly amongst our ethnicities because, even though these kids came from very well-off families, they still had an intense level of racism. ‘Especially the rugby lads, who were known to be extremely racist because they were built like tanks, all of them. Us small Asians, five foot nothing, would not stand a chance against them.’ Mr Qureshi, speaking to American academics four years ago - a transcript of which has now surfaced - continued: ‘We formed cliques very quickly. ‘The Chinese, the blacks, the Pakistanis, and the Indians, we would all be together in the same crowds. We would move around in the same circles. ‘Many of the white kids would be coming from very rich areas, and we would be taking the bus. Terrorist: Mohammed Emwazi was suddenly unmasked last week as the Islamic State killer Jihadi John . ‘Their parents would be picking them up in their Bentleys, and their Rolls-Royces, and their Aston Martins from the front of the school. ‘We would be going to bus stop at the back of the school and going back down to our area, which was not so affluent. In fact, there was a bus stop in Croydon, which is on our way back home. We used to call this bus stop Terminal Three. In Heathrow Airport, Terminal Three is the terminal that all the ethnic minorities take to go back to their countries of origin.’ Mr Qureshi added: ‘Sports was one of the things that helped get me through in many ways. I played squash at a county level.’ He said that after his GCSEs his parents could no longer afford the Whitgift fees so instead sent him to grammar school Wilson’s, in nearby Wallington, Surrey. In marked contrast to the public school, he said, the races mixed freely. Mr Qureshi continued: ‘When I turned up, I came with the same kind of anti-white racist attitude that I had developed in Whitgift because I felt that all white people must be like this. Outspoken: Mr Qureshi has known Emwazi for years, and has previously been caught on camera urging Muslims to support jihad during a rally the American embassy in London (pictured) ‘What was amazing is how that was broken down completely. For the first time in my life I had white friends. For the first time in my life I could relate to white people.’ After ‘doing not very well’ at A-levels – spending much of his time listening to ‘hardcore hip hop’ - Mr Qureshi went on to study law at London Guildhall University, which he described as ‘not a great university but I did enjoy my time there’. While a student he said he ‘began to choose an Islamic identity’ for himself. The Whitgift headmaster from before Mr Qureshi started until today has been Dr Christopher Barnett – who says in his welcome to prospective pupils the school staff ‘welcome boys from a wide variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds’, and ‘regard the diversity and richness that this brings as a real strength of the school.’ He was unavailable for comment last night. The historic school was founded in 1596 by Queen Elizabeth I’s last Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift. It now educates 1,300 boys in the former stately home of Lord Howard of Effingham, who fought the Spanish Armada. The school motto is Vincit qui patitur – ‘He who perseveres, conquers’.","Asim Qureshi said he and other ethnic minority children were ghettoised .

"It has been one of the most frustrating paradoxes of modern science - that light exists both as a wave and particle at the same time but can never be seen in both states simultaneously. Albert Einstein was the first person to describe this apparent dual state of light in 1905 in an attempt to explain some of the apparently contradictory behaviour it displays. Yet when scientists attempt to observe these states, it has only ever been able to see light behave as photon particle or as an electromagnetic wave. Scroll down for video . The above image is what scientists say is the first ever snapshot of light behaving as a particle and a wave. The bottom 'slice' of the image shows the particles, while the top image shows light as a wave . But now researchers based at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), have captured the first ever snapshot of light behaving as both a wave and particle. The work shows that Einstein was right when he proposed that electromagnetic radiation could behave as both a wave and a particle at the same time. Scientists have developed a camera system that lets users see round corners using laser light. The system takes advantage of the way light is reflected and refracted to reconstruct the shape of objects outside the field of view. Researchers at the University of Bonn and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, used a laser to scatter light on a surface. is shone on a surface . In a demonstration, a laser was shone on a white wall, while a camera watches the scene. All it can see initially through the lens is a ‘spot’ of light. A computer records the image and the data is processed so the outlines of an object behind the screen gradually appear. The technique for capturing the image could be used to help open up new areas of superfast computers that exploit the quantum states of materials. He said: 'This experiment demonstrates that, for the first time ever, we can film quantum mechanics - and its paradoxical nature - directly. 'Being able to image and control quantum phenomena at the nanometer scale like this opens up a new route towards quantum computing.' The wave-like behaviour of light can be seen clearly when sunlight is refracted through a prism and splits into the different colours according to the wavelengths of the light. However, it can also be seen behaving like a particle - like photons hurled out as radiation by materials like uranium or when gas high in the atmosphere is battered by the solar wind to produce the aurora over the poles. In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, the research team conducted an experiment and then used electrons to image the light. By firing a pulse of laser light  at a tiny metal wire suspended on graphene, this added energy to the particle wire and caused them to vibrate. The Aurora Borealis (shown above) is caused by photons particles thrown out by gas atoms high in the Earth's atmosphere as they collide with high energy charged particles carried by the solar wind from the sun . White light splitting into different colours through a prism (above) shows how it behaves like a wave . Light then traveled along the wire in two possible directions. When the waves travelling in opposite directions meet each other they form a new 'standing wave' of light. By then firing a stream of electrons close to the nanowire, they were able to image this wave in an ultrafast microscope due to the way the electrons sped up or slowed down. Dr Carbone said that the resulting image produces a fingerprint of the wave-nature of light while also simultaneously demonstrating that it is a particle too. The electrons pass close to the standing wave of light, they hit the photons it contains, again affecting the resulting image.","Swiss researchers have used lasers and nanowires to capture the images .
Scientists have been attempting to image light in both states for decades .

"It's an age-old worry for the men the world over. Now, however, scientists have revealed what's considered 'normal' for penis size and length. The average length of an erect penis is 5.2 inches (13.12 cm), they found. Meanwhile, the average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches (9.16 cm) and 5.2 inches (13.24 cm) when flaccid but stretched. And when it comes to girth, the average erect circumference was 4.6 inches (11.66 cm) and 3.7 inches (9.31 cm) when flaccid. The British research also found there was a small correlation between the erect length of a penis and a man's height. The average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches (9.16 cm) and 5.2 inches (13.24 cm) when flaccid but stretched, the researchers found (file photo) The researchers say the graphs they have plotted, which show the size distributions of a penis, will help clinicians dealing with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), a serious anxiety disorder relating to body image. The study could help to counsel men worried about their size, or with investigations into how condom failure relates to penis size and girth. Some men are concerned about their penis size, and those who are preoccupied and severely distressed may even be diagnosed with BDD. The researchers created a graph (or a nomogram) depicting the size distributions of penis' among men of all ages and many races. The research included 17 studies of 15,521 men who underwent penis size measurements by health professionals using a standard procedure. Before this research, there had been no formal systematic reviews of these measurements, and no attempt to create a nomogram showing the distribution of size. Lead author Dr David Veale from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, told MailOnline: 'Men compare themselves in locker rooms and with pornography on the internet and believe they are inferior. 'Some men have been teased by sexual partners about their length. 'There are lots of men who might be worried - and we think reassuring men they are in the normal range will help. 'We will also use the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position, or what they think they should be. 'We have a specialist Body Dysmophic Clinic and some men are very worried and distressed about their size. Experts plotted graphs showing the size distribution of the length of the average penis when flaccid, flaccid and stretched and erect. The graph above shows average penis length of men - in centimetres - in each percentile . The researchers also plotted a nomogram showing the size distribution of the girth of the average penis. The graph shows the average penis girth of men in each percentile - again in centimetres . 'They are unlikely to be helped just by looking at a size distribution graph, they will need more formal treatment like Cognitive Behaviourhal Therapy or medication too.' Dr Martin Baggaley, medical director at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'BDD causes a person to have a distorted view of how they look and they can spend an obsessive amount of time worrying about their appearance. 'This can include worries over their weight, specific parts of their body and, for men, the size of their penis. 'This can take over someone's life and cause a great deal of distress. 'Hopefully this new study will help reassure those many men who are concerned with their penis size and assist clinicians dealing with BDD.' 'BDD occurs alongside Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and a person with BDD may constantly compare their looks to other people's, spend a long time in front of the mirror or avoid the mirror altogether, constantly conceal a perceived defect or feel anxious when around other people or in social situations.' The research was published in the British Journal of Urology (BJU).","Experts have created graphs showing the size distributions of a penis .

"A new video shows LA police officers dragging a homeless man from his tent just moments before they shot him dead in a street confrontation on the city's Skid Row. This latest video shows the man - who is thought to have been called Booth, but is known locally as 'Africa' and 'Cameroon' in reference to his African heritage - disappearing into his tent after apparently speaking to police. But officers swoop down on the man and drag him from his tent, which appears to collapse. A violent altercation ensues before five officers manage to pin him down - and then three officers open fire, killing the man. The CCTV, shot from the local homeless shelter, has shed yet more light on the violent midday confrontation which has left many shocked after an initial video appeared on social media on Sunday. Conversation: The homeless shelter's CCTV footage shows the man apparently talk to officers . Hiding?: The man then gets into his tent - but the officers appear to be trying to get him out . Increase: More officers arrive and begin to try to drag the man - who was known as 'Africa' - from the tent . Shot dead: A violent altercation ensued and the homeless man, circled in red, was gunned down by officers . The first footage released of the incident showed the man flailing at officers before being pinned to the floor. They try to use a Taser on him - but it seemingly has no effect. Shouts of 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!' can be heard seconds before three officers open fire on the prone man. Outraged crowds soon gathered at the scene, accusing the police of unjustly killing him. Witnesses have characterised the police response as overly aggressive, and say they should have been able to restrain a mentally-ill homeless man with non-lethal means. Pressure for the LAPD to produce evidence to vindicate their officers has been mounting ever since the video was released. A police statement on the killing said that 'the suspect and officers struggled over one of the officer's handguns' before shots were fired - a statement the LAPD say is backed up by onlooker footage. But officials claim a frame from an onlooker's video shows the man grabbing at an officer's waistband,  while a close-up of the weapon in question apparently shows damage caused by the scuffle. LAPD officials say the man was wanted in connection with a robbery, and started brawling with officers who approached him. Collapse: The video appears to show the tent collapse as the man emerges from his hiding place . Fight: The CCTV then captures the altercation which ended in the man's death at the hands of officers . Police chief Charlie Beck has called Sunday's killing an 'extreme tragedy' - and implored anybody with video evidence to submit it to police. He has also revealed two of the officers were wearing body-mounted cameras. His statement came as more information emerged about the drifter, whom friends say came from Cameroon and lived in the U.S. for a decade before coming to LA six months ago. Referring to him as 'Booth', 'Cameroon' or 'Africa' - references to his home country - fellow Skid Row vagrants say he lived in a tent on the streets and often read the Bible. Proof? Police say this frame shows the floored homeless man, circled center, reaching up for a police officer's gun during a fatal encounter yesterday in Lose Angeles . 'Damaged gun': The LAPD said this image shows the officer's pistol after the encounter. LA police chief Charlie Beck said damaged magazine and a partially-discharged bullet prove there was a struggle over it . MailOnline spoke with a close friend of Africa on Monday, who said the man moved to LA sixth months ago, and had a combination of mental illness and drug addiction problems. Nick ‘KB’ Gee said the man’s real first name is Booth, but people called him ‘Africa’ because he was originally from Cameroon. ‘Booth was trying to get back home to Africa but he didn’t have no money, that’s why he was homeless,’ Gee said. ‘‘I talked to him a lot of days, he was a very respectful, honest man. He didn’t bother nobody, he would sit in his tent reading his Bible. ‘He told me about his family and he said he had to go back home to take care of some things.’ ‘He don’t have nobody out here so I would come down and help him out, get him food, some money, a cigarette,’ he said. Killing: This is the moment police fired shots at the homeless man, who is obscured from view in the above frame by an officer. The LAPD have claimed he was trying to take an officer's gun . Fight: At the beginning of the encounter, the man is seen taking swings at several police officers on Skid Row . Confronted: He was being confronted over reports of a robbery before five shots were fired . Nick said police had responded not because of a robbery but because Booth was arguing with a neighbor who lived in a tent next to his. ‘A lot of guys who know him would have helped calm him down, the police know the man, they talk to him everyday, ask him to take his tent down,’ he said. ‘You’re dealing with a guy with a combination of mental illness and drug addiction, they used over excessive force. ‘They Tasered him and he was scared and tried to run in to the tent, they dragged him out and instead of five cops holding him down they shot him.’ One homeless man who identified by his nickname ‘Juju’ said he was friends with Africa, whom he said he last saw no more than 30 minutes before the shooting. He told the LA Times that he was also was also known as ‘Cameroon,’ for his home country. Juju said they had been chatting about politics the last time they spoke. ‘They did not have to kill my friend,’ Juju said. He said his fellow homeless friend’s problems with police were nothing new. There were arguments most days between Africa and LAPD officers over taking down his tent, Juju said. In memoriam: This carboard plaque pays tribute to the man, known as Cameroon or Africa by locals . ‘He would say, “Ticket me. Give me my day in court,”’ he said. But despite his run-ins with the law, Juju said Africa was a generally peaceful man. ‘He was generous,’ he told the LA Times. ‘He lived in a tent, but he was content.’ The LAPD has its own investigation into the killing, which will 'determine whether the use of deadly force was consistent with Department policies and procedures'. LA County's district attorney's office will also conduct its own probe. Last night, LAPD spokesman Andy Smith insisted that the shots only came after the struggle over a firearm. He told reporters: 'During the attempt to detain him, this individual resisted our officers. Theys struggled with him, they tried to tase him a couple of times.' 'That was ineffective and eventually the struggle occurred where the officers that were struggling with the individual over one of the officer's weapons. Police have not formally identified the man they killed. A spokesman told DailyMail.com that no more information would be released Monday, and that any body cam footage would be held back until after the LAPD's own investigation was over. Shooting: The attack took place in the Skid Row district of Los Angeles, which is known for its large homeless population .","New footage shows man retreating into his tent after 'speaking' to officers .

But Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has revealed that he drew on his own experience for his latest storyline for the show set in the roaring 1920s. Lord Fellowes said he used an episode of romantic rejection when he was a young man to create a plot for the show’s fifth series. His character Lady Rose, played by actress Lily James, was torn between her love interest, the son of Jewish immigrants and her family who do not approve of him. The 65-year-old told the New York Times that he too was left feeling insecure after he was rejected by one of his first loves because of his religion. 'I felt it as a Catholic when I was young. One of my first girlfriends was from a fairly senior Jewish family', he said. 'They were a very nice family – I’m still friendly, actually, with the girl and her brother. 'But her parents wanted a Jewish husband. 'And it’s a very strange feeling when you realise that people don’t like you because of what you are.’ He also told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that the rejection was 'sort of my first experience of not being desirable.' He added: 'They certainly didn’t want a Catholic in the family. ‘People always think the prejudice is one-way, but it can be two ways. I wanted to use that in the show.’ He said the 1920s was a time when: ‘People didn’t mind if you came to their house or you shot their pheasants, you ate their dinners or went to their daughter’s dances. 'But, my God, they didn’t want you to marry her.’ Lord Fellowes refused to identify the woman who spurned him, but has said she belongs to one of the 'great Jewish families'. In Downton Abbey, the character Lady Rose, played by Lily James, right, was torn between her love interest, Atticus, the son of Jewish immigrants played by Matt Barber, and her family who do not approve of him . He has now been married to his wife Emma Kitchener for 25 years. A sixth series of Downton Abbey has been commissioned and goes into production later this year. However, he has hinted that the series may be the last saying 'it is not going to go on forever'. The screenwriter admits there is no way he could continue to write it while working on his next major project, The Gilded Age. He was commissioned almost a year ago by US television network NBC to write the programme, which has been dubbed the American version of of the ITV1 show. A sixth series of Downton Abbey has been commissioned by ITV and goes into production later this year but Lord Fellowes has hinted this  series may be the last . The Gilded Age will chart 'the dizzying, brilliant ascents and calamitous falls' of New York society in late 19th century. It is being billed by NBC as ‘an epic tale of the princes of the American Renaissance and the vast fortunes made - and spent - in late 19th- century New York’. 'This was a vivid time in America,' said Lord Fellowes. 'There was record-breaking ostentation and savage rivalry, in a time when money was king.'","Julian Fellowes says he used his romantic rejection to create a storyline .

"The 'crackers' TV licence cannot survive for another decade, Boris Johnson warned today as he insisted the BBC uses it to 'demolish' its competition. The senior Conservative said changing viewing habits mean it is harder to justify the 'full whack' of the levy on every family with a television. He admitted that he now never watches TV news, although he admitted that this is in part because he struggles to turn his television on. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson admitted that he now never watches TV news, although he admitted that this is in part because he struggles to turn his television on . A committee of MPs said last week that a new tax could be imposed on every all households – not just those with televisions – to replace the £145.50-a-year licence fee which has funded the BBC for the past 69 years. BBC director general Tony Hall has said he is open to the idea, even though it would mean an estimated 500,000 extra households having to pay for a service they do not use or currently get free. But Mr Johnson today insisted the idea of funding the full slate of BBC output was now in doubt, and the BBC 'needs to think about its future'. Speaking on LBC radio, the London Mayor said: 'Many people now no longer get their news, many young people in particular, no longer get their news from TV. 'They don't listen to the Today programme. I don't watch TV news now, I'm afraid to say, I get it all on the web. So the BBC needs to think about its future.' He went on: 'I have to say I can't see how it can go on forever having a tax on TVs that not everybody uses any more. 'I can barely make my TV work. Frankly I come down and I sit at home wait shouting pathetically for some child to come and help me turn it on.' The Culture, Media and Sport select committee suggested the licence fee could continue for another decade, before being reformed in the 2020s. But Mr Johnson insisted: 'That seems to me to be too long not to be taking account of the very rapid changes. 'At the moment every house pays £150 in a levy on their television which is crackers. This thing needs to be rethought, the licence fee is plainly anachronistic. 'It needs to be trimmed, it needs to be cut but you are never going to get away from the situation in which people feel the certainty that we are supporting really, really high quality broadcasting in this country.' BBC director general Lord Tony Hall has said he believes the licence fee 'has got at least another ten years in it' He said there would be a case for some money raised from taxpayers to be used to ensure a very high standard of public broadcasting. But he said he doubted whether this meant the 'full whack of the licence fee' was necessary. 'There is going to have to be a change. I think that we are moving in that direction. 'The basic question is do you need public sector broadcasting. Should we be putting taxpayers' money into broadcasting? The argument would be we put taxpayers' money into supporting all sorts of arts, and they would die in this country if you didn't have support for the arts. 'I think you probably do need to support quality broadcasting, proper fantastic productions that the BBC specialises in. 'Whether you need to support the whole machine… The BBC can be extremely anti-competitive. They take huge sums of money from the taxpayer, from the licence payer, and use it to cross-subsidise businesses that demolish local newspapers, local websites.' A BBC spokesman said: 'We agree with Boris on supporting high quality public broadcasting in this country, and that it would be a shame to lose that, which is why it is important that the BBC is able to continue offering the high quality news, drama, and entertainment the British public loves.' The Corporation insisted that 96 per cent of people use BBC services every week. Changing viewing habits, including watching online and subscription services, mean the TV licence has become harder to justify . BBC boss Lord Hall yesterday defended the licence fee and said the corporation's opponents have to be 'honest about the consequences' of their plans for the organisation. In a speech at New Broadcasting House in central London, he said the corporation was at 'a crossroads' and the licence fee - which is not currently required to watch catch-up TV on iPlayer - must be amended to cover 'catch-up television as soon as possible'. The director general said: 'We've always said that the licence fee should be updated to reflect changing times. I welcome the committee's endorsement of our proposal to require people to pay the licence fee even if they only watch catch-up television. The committee has suggested another route to modernising the licence fee - a universal household levy. 'Both proposals have the same goal in mind: adapting the licence fee for the internet age. This is vital. Because I believe we need and we will need what the licence fee - in whatever form - makes happen - more than ever. 'In fact, I'm going to go further and argue that if we didn't have a BBC funded by a licence fee, such is the world we face, we'd have to invent it.'","London Mayor says many people no longer watch news on television TV .

"China has been rocked by a hard-hitting film made by a former state TV news anchor which links her baby's tumour to the country's terrible air pollution. Chai Jing's investigative documentary - which has already attracted unprecedented attention from the country's officials - explores the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state. In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells the story of her daughter, who was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013. The 39-year-old goes on to report how a number of newborn babies in China have contracted pneumonia without even leaving home. Scroll down for video . Young victims: Chai Jing, 39, has made a hard-hitting film, exploring the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state . Motherly love: In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells how her daughter was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013 . The film also features an interview with Wang Huiqin (pictured), 6, who lives in highly industrialised Shanxi Province and says she has never seen stars or blue skies . Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected. It has already been watched by some 200million people and has sparked a firestorm of public criticism over the government's failure to act on the issue in a timely manner. In the 144-minute film, Ms Chai, a former anchor at China Central Television, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, tells how she made the documentary to tell her daughter 'what is smog, where smog comes from and what we shall do with it'. She explains how she found herself pregnant in January 2013, when 25 provinces and cities in China were blanketed by heavy smog. She then gave birth in October 2013, when her daughter had already been diagnosed with a benign tumour. The diagnosis led to Ms Chai quitting her job  at the beginning of last year so she could focus on taking care of her daughter. It was during that period that she began making the film, entitled Under the Dome, she explains. Enveloped: Most cities in China, such as Beijing and Shanghai (pictured), face serious air pollution issues . Price for industrialisation: China burns a large amount of petroleum and coal, two major causes of pollution . The film was distributed to various video websites in China on February 28. It received 117 million views in the first 24 hours, according to Tencent. Ms Chai's daughter is no longer unwell. But she says in the film that she only took her daughter outside when air quality in Beijing was marked excellent or good. The rest of the time she had to lock her daughter at home 'like a prisoner', she claims. She adds that 175 days during 2014 were graded as polluted in Beijing. The film also includes an interview with a six-year-old girl, Wang Huiqin, who lives in Shanxi Province, a heavily industrialised area in central China. The girl tells Ms Chai in the interview how she has never seen stars, blue skies or white clouds in her life. Stardom: Ms Chai is a highly recognised anchor and investigative journalist in China. She is also a best-selling writer . Controversy: Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected . China's cities are often hit by heavy pollution – in the form of smog – caused by burning a large amount of petroleum and coal. The film has already been widely backed by the Chinese public, as well as a number of officials. Chen Jining, the newly appointed minister of environmental protection in China, was quoted in an article on People's Daily as saying: 'I want to thank her. She has wakened up the public to pay attention to the environment from a public health perspective. 'I think (she is) worth our respect.' Self-protection: A girl puts a mask on her dog in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei Province, during a smog attack . Fake sunrise: An LED screen on the Tiananmen Square shows what a sun-rise looks like in heavily polluted Beijing . And Gao Mingyong, a senior media commentator in China, wrote on ifeng.com: 'Under the Dome is the best example of self-initiated media which can represent the logic of the internet, but its significance is far more than this.' Ms Chai financed the making of the film by herself which cost $160,000. It's believed that Ms Chai gave birth to her daughter in the U.S, leading to her being branded a hypocrite and traitor by some.","Chai Jing, 39, made documentary about air pollution for her sick daughter .

"A worker plummeted five stories to his death while washing windows without a safety harness in Manhattan Tuesday. The unnamed victim was reportedly leaning out of a fifth-floor unit at the Hanover River House at 335 Greenwich Street in Tribeca when fell just before 1.10pm. The window washer landed in front of a high-end rug store, with his head coming to rest in a pile of hardened snow and the rest of his body on the concrete sidewalk. Grisly accident: A window washer was leaning out of a fifth-floor unit at the Hanover River House at 335 Greenwich Street in Tribeca when fell, landing with his head in a pile of snow and his body on the sidewalk . Horrified witnesses said the victim was still breathing and conscious by the time first responders came on the scene. As they were awaiting the paramedics’ arrival, several Good Samaritans walked over and covered the man with their coats to keep him warm against the frigid temperatures, according to the New York Post. Responding EMTs performed chest compressions on the injured worker and then rushed him to New York Downtown Hospital, where he died a short time later. 7Online reported that the window the man was washing was unhinged and swung open, causing him to fall out to his death. Witness Orie Cipollaro described the 38-year-old worker hanging out of the window backwards in the minutes before the deadly fall, while another bystander claimed he saw the man hold onto the window with one hand while washing it with the other, reported the New York Daily News. In an interview with the News, witness John Cataneo described a grisly scene on Greenwich Street this afternoon. ‘His legs were twisted his arms were bent and he was bleeding from his hands, it was very gruesome,’ Cataneo recalled. Employer: The deceased window washer worked for Aerial Window Cleaning, headquarterd in this building at 260 West 36th Street . The name of the victim has not been released as of 5pm, but he was said to be a 38-year-old man employed by Aerial Window Cleaning. According to the company's Google+ page, Aerial Window Cleaning, located at 260 West 36th Street, has been in business for more than 20 years. Daily Mail reached out to the cleaning company for comment and is awaiting a response.","Unnamed victim was leaning out of fifth-floor unit at Hanover River House at 335 Greenwich Street in Tribeca when fell .

"An executive with the supermarket giant Morrisons has been jailed for 12 months for a £203,000 insider trading crime. Paul Coyle, 50, profited from dealing in his company’s shares around the time of a £216m deal with the online retailer Ocado which sent share values soaring. Using the name of his partner he bought Morrisons shares before the lucrative tie-up was made public and sold them for a profit the day after it was announced. Paul Coyle, 50, has been jailed for a year after he used his inside knowledge at Morrisons to personally profit in shares . Coyle was the supermarket’s group treasurer and head of tax and was ‘at the heart’ of talks with Ocado over the development of their online business. He illegally used his inside knowledge for personal profit. The series of deals – in the name of 28-year-old Emma Baker – made a profit of £79,431. However, the total ‘benefit’ from his crime which he must repay was put at £203,234. This was comprised of the value of shares bought and profits from the deals. He faces a further two-and-a-half years behind bars if the money is not repaid within two months, Leeds Crown Court was told. Coyle, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, admitted two charges of insider dealing and was also ordered to pay £15,000 costs. Mr Justice Globe said while he accepted his remorse was genuine, his offending was so serious there had to be an immediate jail term. ‘You came into possession of that information by your senior position within the organisation. Your breach of trust was significant,’ he said. ‘Whatever your real motivation was, your actions were deliberate and in my judgment dishonest. You knew at the time what you were doing was illegal. Your actions continued over a three month period and involved a number of individual trades.’ The judge told him: ‘insider dealing is not a victimless crime, harm has been caused by your actions, it has an impact on the overall public confidence in the integrity of the market.’ Coyle, a former Inland Revenue inspector, was a senior and trusted member of the Morrisons executive team. Laura Mackinnon, prosecuting, said he signed documents indicating he was aware of the restrictions imposed by his ‘insider’ status. He initially made a £8,000 profit by buying company shares before the March 2013 announcement that discussions were being held with Ocado and selling them the day after. He bought around the time of a £216m deal between Morrisons and the online retailer Ocado which sent share values soaring and sold the day after it was announced . The father-of-four continued to abuse his position by buying and selling a further 100,000 shares as the company share price fluctuated amid market speculation. During that period he banked a further £11,000. Then in May, after an official announcement was made that the two firms had reached a formal agreement, he sold the rest of his shares making £60,000. Neil Hawes, QC, defending, said Coyle had not touched the money he had made. He said his client had been under stress in his job as senior staff were ‘fire- fighting’ issues in the company. ‘He accepts he had a senior and important role at Morrison, he was in the confidence of senior management, privy to confidential material and trusted.’ Coyle lost his job and has not worked since. A spokesman for Morrisons said they were ‘pleased’ the Financial Conduct Authority investigation ‘did not raise wider concerns for the company.’ ‘While this was a regrettable case of an individual acting alone we are pleased that our governance and processes were sufficiently robust to enable the authorities to achieve a successful prosecution.’","Paul Coyle, 50, illegally used his partner's name to profit from shares deals .

"A shameless shoplifter who has spent almost £2million on three breast augmentations, luxury holidays and designer outfits has blamed her criminal habit on the Government - for not providing enough in benefits. Mother-of-six Kim Farry, 54, who reportedly lives in a rent-free council house in south west London and takes home £556 in benefits every month, has made almost £50,000 a year through stealing. Appearing on ITV's This Morning, Ms Farry, who currently receives £120 every two weeks in disability living allowance for stress, £20 a week for child benefit and £58 in child tax credits claimed her 44-year shoplifting spree had been a 'necessity'. Scroll down for video . Shoplifter Kim Farry appeared on ITV's This Morning and blamed the Government for her perpetual shoplifting cycle . 'I don’t know how people can live on benefits. They must have something on the side, it’s impossible. I’m trying to do it and I went without a lot of things. I didn’t eat yesterday. 'I was just stealing to get what I needed at the time,' she said defending her behaviour. 'So if there was a birthday - I would go out and get something.' When  presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden questioned the necessity of three breast enhancements she laughed and said: 'My boobs were hanging down here after six kids.' But the presenters did not crack a smile. 'I like to live well, I eat nice food,' she said. The shoplifter, who has been jailed seven times, claimed she is now trying change her ways for the sake of 14-year-old daughter Paris. 'I don’t want my youngest to model herself on me,' she said. But she was flummoxed when presented with the hypothetical situation of having a broken TV and said she didn't know if she could refrain from stealing to fund a new one. Ms Farry, who last stole Christmas presents for her children 12 weeks ago, said her habit started at the age of nine when she saw her single mother struggle to bring her up, as well as her eight siblings: 'We didn’t have anything – my mum had a hard time, dad left her and one morning she had one egg between nine kids, she had no money and was crying so I took it upon myself to go and get some food. 'And that’s how it started. I got so involved I didn’t know anything else. 'I didn’t want to go without so I just carried on doing it. It became a habit,' she said. At her peak the mother-of-six said she was taking home almost £50,000 a year through stealing, but  is now trying to go straight for the sake of her youngest daughter, 14-year-old Paris . 'I went to prison and when I came out I got a job. Then I got sacked because they found out I’d been in prison. 'So then I’d go back out again. I had to have money and that’s the only thing I could do. 'Sometimes I would steal stuff and then get other people to exchange things and get the vouchers.Then I'd sell the vouchers. That’s how you’d get your money.' But pitching herself as modern-day Robin Hood, Ms Farry insisted: 'I've got good morals – I know it prob sounds a bit stupid me saying that but I’m not a nasty person. 'I've helped people out a bit. There are a lot of people who are hard up out there and I've helped people out with it as well – so that’s my bit of charity. 'A lot of people who know me have a lot of respect for me – even though I know it’s wrong.' But Ms Farry added: 'I do want to try and turn it round now and show people its never too late to change. Ms Farry says she has made almost £2million from a 44-year crime spree while enjoying designer clothes, exotic holidays and expensive beauty products (pictured above) 'I would do anything along as it’s a job. I don’t get a buzz stealing – but when I do buy with money I get a rush from that. 'I don’t want to be on benefits – if someone would give me a job.' In a clip showing Ms Farry in her front room, the obsessive shoplifter bragged: ‘Everything in this room I have shoplifted the money to pay for the stuff – sofas, TVs and light. 'Well I bought one and stole one,' she qualified pointing to her light fittings. In an interview with the Sunday People this week, the mother-of-six described shoplifting as her 'job'. In contrast to her claims on This Morning, she told journalists Vikki White and Gemma Aldridge: 'I will try but I'm going from ­riches to rags. Why would I give up living like an A-lister for this? 'This is the longest I've been without shoplifting since I was a child and it's unbelievably hard.' Ms Farry said she first stole aged just nine. After she went unchallenged as she took a haul of groceries from a supermarket, she said she began stealing food and toys on a weekly basis. She was arrested aged ten for stealing a badge, but no action was taken against her, the People reported. Kim Farry leaving the This Morning studios after chatting about her prolific shoplifting . At 14 she was expelled from school and despite two youth detention sentences she decided at 16 to make shoplifting her full-time job - disguising herself with wigs or make-up to avoid being caught. 'I used to nick a load of stuff then go and have a cuppa with the security guards, that's how good I was. When I had been doing it for a few years I realised it was more about attitude than anything else. I could steal anything,' she said. On one occasion she said she even managed to steal a cooker with the help of an accomplice and a van, but reportedly made much of her money by stealing from designer clothing shops and having other women return the items for vouchers or credit notes. She then sold these on for half the price, but would also make money by shoplifting to order. After she married in her 20s and started a family of her own, Ms Farry even trained up her three eldest children to help her once they turned 12, she told the newspaper. She says she was stealing items worth as much as £7,000 a month, taking home nearly £50,000 a year after paying her accomplices. But although Ms Farry said she turned to crime to support her family, it also caused the break-down of her marriage and when she was sentenced to one of her jail terms her three eldest children were sent to live with her father. According to the People, Ms Farry has more than 50 shoplifting charges to her name, but she said this accounts for only around one per cent of her exploits. She was last jailed when Paris was six weeks old, but told the newspaper that on the day she was released from the six-week sentence she went on a stealing spree. She said she is now hoping to change her ways for Paris, but does not want to give up the perks of her lifestyle. She said she does want to find legal employment, but added that if she is unable to get a job she may resort to stealing - and says the Government should give out more in handouts to prevent others from turning to crime. She said: 'There's no way I can maintain my lifestyle or anything close to it. The Government is living in denial if it thinks people are going to live on benefits and not do everything they can to top it up, illegal or not.' MailOnline has contacted the Metropolitan Police for comment.","Kim Farry, 54, lives in a rent-free council house in south west London .

"If you are easily distracted by your smartphone or long for the return of simple mobiles that don't require lots of apps, then this ‘anti-smartphone’ is for you. The round phone, described as the first personal device for the 'post-smartphone era', is modelled on an old-fashioned pocket watch. The Runcible is a pebble-shaped prototype and includes a phone and camera,  an HD circular screen and a wooden case. Scroll down for video . A round phone called the Runcible (pcictured), is described as the first personal device for the post-smartphone era and is modelled on an old-fashioned pocket watch . It’s designed ‘refocus users' attention on real people and the real world’ and is touted as being the ‘world's first heirloom electronic,’ by Monohm Inc, which created the prototype. Aubrey Anderson, CEO and co-founder of the California-based company, said: ‘People need something to let them control their digital lives in clean, quiet, simple ways. The pebble-shaped device includes a phone and camera, as well as an HD circular screen (pictured left and seen right). It’s designed ‘refocus users' attention on real people and the real world’ and is touted as being the ‘world's first heirloom electronic’ Experts predicted that this year, people will forsake gadgets, social networks and other technology in favour of the simple life. In its sixth annual Digital Trends Report, London-based communications agency Hotwire, said we are entering the era of the 'neo-Luddite' and people are working on things to help us switch off. It's thought people are growing less keen on social media ans apps because of their irritation with adverts. The report, which followed figures by Ofcom released in December, found the number of weekly UK visitors to social networks is now 56 per cent - a drop from 65 per cent this time last year. The US, China and Japan saw similar decreases - but to a lesser extent. Elsewhere, in August, a team of developers launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of its noPhone - a fake handset designed to wean people off their tech addiction. ‘Runcible is the alternative to the increasingly invasive and commodified smartphone whose app-centric approach distracts us from our lives instead of helping us live them.’ The device, which is a cross between a traditional mobile phone and a wearable device, features the ‘first’ high resolution, fully round screen in a phone, as well as a high performance camera, although it is no specified how good it is. Inspiration for the unusual shape comes from ‘devices that humans have always carried with them: the pocket watch, the compass, the magical stone that fits the palm of our hand,’ the company said. The device, which is a cross between a traditional mobile phone and a wearable device, features a camera (seen on these prototypes) The device is built on Mozilla’s Firefox operating system and will see users visiting mobile websites instead of navigating the web via dedicated apps. It also includes features designed to refocus users’ attention on real people and the real world. For example, a maps feature shows the most interesting route to a chosen destination, rather than the fastest, social media feeds are summarised and the device is silent. ‘Runcible will never beep, alert or otherwise interrupt us, enabling us to keep our attention where it has always meant to be,’ the firm said. It offers connectivity expected of a smartphone, such as LTE, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. ‘For the rest of the time, you can keep your head up, your attention on the real world and real people around you, and maintain your sense of wonder about life,’ according to the company's website. The device requires no apps or extra software and is intended to last for years, unlike other smartphones, which are typically traded in for a newer modelafter 24 months. ‘Runcible’s parts can be removed, repaired, and upgraded, enabling the device to be kept for decades,’ the firm said. It aims to build what it calls ‘new necessities,’ which are devices that combine form, function and technology that allow people to have ‘a more civilised relationship with…[their] digital life.’ The device is currently a prototype and is being unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, this week. Availability and pricing will be revealed towards the end of this year. It is likely that the phone will cost the same as a premium, unlocked smartphone, such as an iPhone 6, which is around £540 ($650). Blackout: The range is fully encrypted by default and comes with secure features that let you make calls and send texts that are impossible to track . There's now a range of 'spy' phones designed to keep users off the grid, so advertisers can;t track their every move, for example. The original Blackphone was unveiled last year and its successor - the Blackphone 2 - as well as the first ever Blacktablet have been announced at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The range is fully encrypted by default and comes with a suite of secure features that let you make calls and send texts that are impossible to eavesdrop on or track. Blackphone’s Android-based devices are built by Spanish manufacturer GeeksPhone alongside security experts Silent Circle and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). They launched the original handset at last year’s Mobile World Congress and told MailOnline that the range is for people who ‘want to stay private without compromising on the features seen on typical Android phones.’ Everything from the custom-built PrivatOS to web browsing and apps, are encrypted, or have been fitted with an extra layer of security. PrivatOS is a so-called ‘skin’ that runs on top of traditional Android software, meaning all Android apps are compatible.

"Rolls-Royce launches its most opulent bespoke limousine today – with a silk interior and £1million-plus price tag to match. For its specially commissioned one-off Phantom II Serenity, the luxury British car-maker has looked back for inspiration to the era of royal, silk-lined horse-drawn carriages which carried Kings, Emperors and other assorted potentates. It has adapted centuries-old hand-crafted skills of silk-weaving and decorating , then updated them for the super-luxury car of the 21st century. Rolls-Royce launches its most opulent bespoke limousine today – with a silk interior and £1million-plus price tag to match . Rolls-Royce said the Serenity – designed to be an oasis of calm in a hectic world – already had a buyer, unnamed, before it is officially unveiled today . It said the Serenity, shown at the Geneva Motor Show, ‘introduces a completely new level of individualised luxury’ Rolls-Royce said the Serenity – designed to be an oasis of calm in a hectic world – already had a buyer, unnamed, before it is officially unveiled today  at the Geneva Motor Show. Rolls-Royce said the Serenity ‘introduces a completely new level of individualised luxury’ applied to a Rolls-Royce Phantom whose base price starts at around £350,000. Designers were inspired by co-founder Sir Henry Royce’s maxim: ‘When it does not exist, design it.’ After more than a century of cars having leather interiors, designers decided to revert to the luxury material of a bygone age – silk. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: ‘Our bespoke design team took inspiration from the opulent interiors of Rolls-Royces that have conveyed Kings and Queens, Emperors and Empresses and world leaders.’ Added into the mix are contemporary interpretations of furniture design and Japanese Royal robe motifs. Rolls-Royce said: ‘Serenity reintroduces the finest of textiles – silk – to create the most opulent interior of any luxury car. This unique design demonstrates the levels of craftsmanship, creativity and attention to detail only Rolls-Royce Motor Cars can offer.’ Giles Taylor, director of design at Rolls-Royce said: ‘Having revisited the history of the amazing interiors of the elite Rolls-Royce’s of the early 1900’ s, we felt inspired to share this heritage with our new customers in a very contemporary way. Laser-cut Mother of Pearl petals have been hand-applied – petal by petal - onto the wooden marquetry on the rear doors . The luxury British car-maker has looked back for inspiration to the era of royal, silk-lined horse-drawn carriages which carried Kings, Emperors and other assorted potentates . ‘The choice of Phantom for this project was obvious, but creating the motif that would define this most opulent and modern of automotive interiors would require considerable new expertise. This added expertise came from Cherica Haye and Michelle Lusby, both textile arts graduates from the Royal College of Art and Plymouth University respectively, who worked on the project. Michelle Lusby said: ‘Some of the most opulent silk motifs come to us from the Orient, where imperial families’ and rich merchants’ robes were made from the finest silk materials.’ This includes a highly complex handmade ‘twelve-layer robe’ of silk worn only by female Japanese courtiers. From the 17th to 19th century Japanese merchants commissioned beautiful clothes ‘to demonstrate their wealth and good taste’ she said. They demonstrated ‘elegant chic’ focussed on subtle details: ‘Those with style and money found ways to circumvent rules that forbade the use of certain colours, such as red, by applying them to undergarments and linings.’ Added into the mix are contemporary interpretations of furniture design and Japanese Royal robe motifs . Each car has ten yard-long panels of specially woven and painted silk, each of which is the product of 600 man-hours of painstaking craftsmanship . Cherica Haye said: ‘The rear compartment of a Phantom is the most tranquil, beautiful place to be, a place where time and the outside world simply slip past. ‘This tranquillity made us think of the Oriental tradition where Emperors would take to their private gardens to reflect in solitude under the blossom trees. The blossom motif is one that is cherished in Far Eastern culture and has been beautifully applied to Royal robe design over the centuries.’ Silk for the Serenity came from the town of Suzhou in China, renowned for its creation of imperial embroidery. It was then sent to one of Britain’s oldest mills, Vanners in in Essex, to be hand-woven into just 10 metres of the fabric – enough to clothe the interior of Serenity – in a process that took two days or two hours per meter of fabric. Some 140 silk threads per centimetre were blended into the lustrous Smoke Green colour which was then hand-painted and embroidered by craftsmen from Britain and China. The Mother of Pearl petals are also hand-applied on the clock-face and instrument panel . Each car has ten yard-long panels of specially woven and painted silk, each of which is the product of 600 man-hours of painstaking craftsmanship. Each individual petal of the crimson blossom motif is hand-painted directly onto the silk. Laser-cut Mother of Pearl petals are hand-applied – petal by petal - onto the wooden marquetry on the rear doors. It is also used on the clock-face and instrument panel. And the bespoke exterior Mother of Pearl paint is ‘the most expensive one-off paint ever developed by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.’ It is added in a three-stage pearl effect and hand-polished for 12 hours at Goodwood. Even the two-colour coachline – an upmarket ‘go-faster stripe’ – was applied in a sweep by the ultra-steady hand and squirrel-hair brush of expert Mark Court. Powered by vast 6.6 litre V12 engine, the Phantom Serenity is no slouch either accelerating from rest to 60mph in around five seconds to a top speed limited to 155mph. Powered by vast 6.6 litre V12 engine, the Phantom Serenity is accelerates from rest to 60mph in around five seconds to a top speed limited to 155mph . And there’s a huge market among the super-rich. Some 85 per cent of all Rolls-Royce global sales in 2014 had some level of bespoke content – up by a third (31 per cent) in the year. Rolls-Royce design director Giles Taylor said: ‘From renaissance times to the modern day, eminent people have surrounded themselves with rare fabrics such as silk to signify their power and position in society, whether at home or on the move. ‘In the early 20th Century, as closed Rolls-Royce’s replaced luxurious carriages, these opulent fabrics began travelling with their owners in the rear compartments of the world’s finest motor cars.’ Only when automotive leather became more refined was it accepted by the super-rich of the day, and then becoming the norm. Bamboo and Smoked Cherrywood are also used in the interior, along with Arctic White leather and carpet in the luggage compartment. But he added: ‘The thought that fabrics such as silk have been discounted from use because of their delicacy only spurred us on to go further than any other car maker is capable of doing. The result is Serenity.’ Rolls-Royce Motor Cars chief executive Torsten Müller-Ötvös said: ‘Celebrating the historical role played by silk as a symbol of ultimate elegance, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Bespoke Design team has created a magnificent one-off Phantom which will set a new benchmark for luxury individualisation in the motor industry.’ Rolls-Royce sold more than £1.2billion worth of cars last year after announcing its biggest ever annual sales in its 111-year history. The BMW-owned company employing 1,5000 people near Chichester in Sussex delivered a record 4,063 cars in 2014 - up 12per cent on 2013 and boosted by sales to America, China and the Middle east.","Phantom II Serenity already had a buyer before it was officially unveiled .

"Victoria Beckham has certainly undergone an image change in the past few years but photographs of her latest collection will have fans wondering if she's taken her darker new look too far. In new pictures of her Victoria, Victoria Beckham autumn/winter 2015 collection, a model poses in a bare room lying prone on the floor with her eyes closed, while in another she lies as though unconscious on a chair with  her head falling back behind her. The shots  hark back to the controversial 'heroin chic' look of the early Nineties that launched Kate Moss. Scroll down for video . In one picture from Victoria, Victoria Beckham's new AW15 images, one model seems to play dead . In another picture she lies stretched out uncomfortably on a waiting room-style chair as though unconscious . This may be a yoga pose but there's nothing fluid about this posture in a drab claustrophobic room by a handful of tulips dangling from the letter box and in front of an old fashioned television . The label describes the sister collection as: 'Free spirited and fun - key features are made of classic fabrics such as ginghams, tweeds and leathers, which are twisted and played with to create new and modern statements.' Yet the pictures by top photographer Colin Dodgson look almost eerie, as a glum pale-faced beauty adopts a series of awkward poses in the beige, magnolia and pea soup-green room. In a number of pictures the model stretches out on the floor, with her eyes closed, her feet splayed out as though she's pretending to be unconscious. In one shot, in which she wears a lilac leather mini dress, she performs an uncomfortable-looking yogic backward bend in front of an old television with yellow tulips - said to represent cheerfulness - dangling out of the letter box. Another pose - again in front of the door - sees her adopting a listless forward slump. The label describes the AW15 Victoria, Victoria Beckham line - aimed at younger customers than the mother-of-four's main label - as 'statement dressing made easy'.

Queen Victoria Beckham is the ruler of the runway nowadays. The singer-turned-fashion extraordinaire has been perfecting her craft over the last few seasons and her latest collection only cemented her credentials further.

She strikes a pose surrouned by old electrics and an industrial old fashioned white radiator . 'Attitude is applied, stripped down and made sophisticated - creating a wearable collection that continues to evolve with its customer.' Victoria, 40, has been moving in a more serious  direction since becoming a designer, adopting darker clothes and swapping her tight outfits and heels for dark midi-skirts and flats. But the pictures showing off the clothes, which sees prices range from £225 to £1,250, seem to be her oddest style statement yet. The company describes the AW15 Victoria, Victoria Beckham collection as embodying the 'independent spirit of the VVB girl. This individual attitude imbues a broad range of dresses and an increased offer of separates.' The model throws her head back in this strange pose to show off a blue leopard print tunic dress . Looking listless and weak, the model lies prone on the  carpet, just resting an outstretched arm on the wall . Focusing on dresses, the line includes wrap skirts, crop knits, skinny stretch trousers and voluminous peplum tops. 'Fabrics are played with and re-interpreted in the inimitable VVB style - leopard print is applied to heavy crepes and blistered silks, checks are applied to angora and bonded with neoprene, gingham is weaved in to a cloque and crystal embroidery is individually shattered and then held together in delicate metallic cases,' the label says. 'Colours are vibrant and strong - shocking pink, electric blue and blood red are set against monochrome black and white - all adding to the strong yet still feminine silhouettes.' California-born Dodgson, is described as capturing 'the vitality of youth and fashion with disarming frankness' on his website. Which adds: 'His rendering of color and shrewd approach to urban, often minimal environments, produces surprising photographs of casual sophistication and sly humor.' The Victoria Beckham label told MailOnline: 'For the past four seasons we have invited a photographer to interpret the Victoria Victoria Beckham collection according to their own creative vision. 'This season we worked with Colin Dodgson, who is known for his idiosyncratic style of photography, to shoot the AW15 collection within this series.'

"Sex crazed: Dr. Arthur Zilberstein's 'preoccupation with sexual matters' caused him to lose his license . A doctor has had his license suspended after bizarre, sexually-fueled behavior at work, says the state Department of Heath. Dr. Arthur Zilberstein's 'preoccupation with sexual matters' including using medical images for sexual gratification and having sexual encounters at his workplace led to his license being suspended by the Medical Commission on June 5, 2014. Seattle Pi reports that a subsequent hearing reviewing the charges led to the indefinite suspension. Zilberstein must undergo a mental and behavioral evaluation and pay a $5,000 fine. He will be able to peitition for the reinstatement of his medical license only after he completes the mandated evaluation and recommendations. The anesthesiologist, from Seattle, Washington, also allegedly sent explicit texts while performing C-sections and naked selfies to a patient at Swedish Medical Center where he worked. The charges said some of the pictures were 'depicting himself in hospital scrubs, wearing his hospital badge and exposing his genitals'. Washington state health authorities said 47-year-old Zilberstein repeatedly compromised patient safety between at least April 2013 and August 2013. Authorities accused Zilberstein, who has been in practice since 1995, of issuing at least 29 unauthorized prescriptions for controlled substances and other drugs. Anesthesiologist also allegedly sent texts while performing operations . The charges, filed with the state Medical Quality Assurance Commission, also allege that Zilberstein prescribed unauthorized narcotics to a female patient he had sex with, NBC News reported. On one day alone, June 17, 2013, he is accused of sending 64 texts, many just minutes apart, during seven surgeries, many of which had sexual innuendos. Inappropriate behavior: Dr. Arthur Zilbertstein, an anesthesiologist, allegedly sent explicit texts while performing C-sections and naked selfies to a patient at Swedish Medical Center where he worked . One read: 'I'm hella busy with C sections.' Another read: 'Oh. And my partner walked in as I was pulling up my scrubs. I'm pretty sure he caught me.' The charges state: 'Respondent's lack of focus on patient care while providing anesthesia services for hospital-based surgical procedures routinely fell below the standard of care and put patients at unreasonable risk of harm.' Zilberstein also demonstrated 'moral turpitude' that reflected badly on the medical profession. He was contracted through Physicians Anesthesia Services with Swedish Medical Center to provide care , NBC News reported. Hospital spokesman Clay Holtzman said: 'The safety of our patients is our number one priority. Once we learned that the state had suspended this physician's medical license, the physician's medical staff membership and privileges were immediately suspended. 'We just recently learned of these allegations and are conducting our own internal review of the physician, who is not directly employed by Swedish.'

"They will certainly be treated to stunning scenes of Cornwall, but viewers may not hear a Cornish accent when they tune in to watch Poldark. Yesterday it emerged that the stars of the show, which is set in the windswept Cornish landscape, were so terrified of being accused of mumbling that many made a conscious decision to enunciate their lines. Scroll down for video . The stars of the new Poldark are terrified of being accused of mumbling so decided to enunciate their lines. Pictured, Aiden Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson as Ross Poldark and Demelza . It appears that the barrage of criticism received over the BBC’s adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s gothic novel Jamaica Inn is to blame for creating the fear factor. More than 2,000 viewers complained about poor sound quality and inaudible dialogue when Jamaica Inn was screened last April and the star of Poldark, Aidan Turner, has now confessed that he and the cast were alarmed by the backlash. Turner, 31, told the Radio Times: ‘I didn’t see Jamaica Inn but the fuss about it spooked us all a lot. ‘We started shooting a few weeks later and I can tell you all the actors were aiming for ten out of ten on enunciation. 'I’m doing posh RP [received pronunciation] anyway, so it didn’t affect me directly but I was scared, yes.’ Turner takes the role of British soldier Ross Poldark, who returns from fighting in the American War of Independence to find his fiancée Elizabeth Chenoweth, believing him to be dead, is set to marry his cousin. BBC bosses are hoping for a return of Poldark mania. Poldark is based on the novels by Winston Graham. When it was first dramatised in the 1970s, up to 15million viewers per episode tuned in to follow its passionate romances and tales of smuggling. Poldark begins on BBC1 on Sunday at 9pm.","Many of the stars made a conscious decision to enunciate their lines .

"An uninterrupted two-hour canal boat journey might not be the sort of thing you’d normally sit down to watch on TV. But it will feature with a three-hour tour of the National Gallery and half-hour shows on traditional craftsmanship in a new BBC series of programmes shot in real time, designed to relax viewers. The concept has been inspired by ‘slow TV’ in Norway, which in recent years has included a seven-hour recording of a train journey, a five-day programme on boat travel and 12 hours on knitting. Scroll down for video . Relaxing: Viewers will be able to tune in to The Canal, a two-hour canal boat journey down one of Britain’s historic waterways (file picture) The three programmes will dispense with editing, voice overs and music. Viewers will be able to tune in to The Canal, a  journey down one of Britain’s historic waterways. It will feature the sights and sounds of wildlife and the tow path as the boat passes, giving facts about the canal as captions in the landscape. National Gallery will be a three-hour behind the scenes tour of the gallery with Frederick Wiseman – again, with no voiceover, but taking viewers from board room meetings to exhibition spaces. Make presents three half-hour programmes showing traditional craftsmanship as skilled workers make items including a steel knife and a wooden chair. BBC Four channel editor Cassian Harrison said: ‘This surprising selection of programmes is the antithesis to the general direction much of television is going in. One of three programmes: National Gallery will be a three-hour behind the scenes tour of the gallery with Frederick Wiseman with no voiceover, but taking viewers from board room meetings to exhibition spaces . ‘Slowing everything right down gives us the time to really observe things as they happen, and this series of programmes celebrates the simple pleasures of life in the slow lane.’ The reaction to the announcement of the series - called BBC Four Goes Slow - today on Twitter was mixed. Producer Chuck Thomas joked: 'It's only a matter of time until ITV2 commissions Watching Paint Dry.' But Olympia Brown, science learning manager at the Royal Institution, said: 'Love that Cassian Harrison is doing slow TV on BBC 4. Including three hours of traditional craftmanship!' The idea for slow TV began in Norway in 2009 when producers decided to broadcast the whole journey of a long train line that runs from Oslo to Bergen to celebrate its 100th anniversary. Slow TV shows, which are known as ‘Sakte-TV’ in Norwegian, have also included a 134-hour boat trip from Bergen to Kirkenes, and a 24-hour broadcast of the first day of the salmon fishing season. Norway has attracted international attention for its series of ‘slow TV' programmes, including a live-broadcast of a seven-hour train journey and the knitting of a jumper. The concept was born on state broadcaster NRK (Norsk Rikskringkasting - which translates as Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) in 2009 with centenary of the Bergen railway line. Rather than commission a conventional feature programme on the line, NRK instead decided to put a camera on a train and broadcast the entire seven-hour trip from Oslo to Bergen, interweaving archive footage to liven up the programme. First example: The idea for slow TV began in Norway in 2009 when producers decided to broadcast the whole journey of a long train line that runs from Oslo to Bergen (above) to celebrate its 100th anniversary . Remarkably, it was a roaring success, with 1.2million viewers - about a quarter of the population of Norway - tuning in for at least part of the trip. Since then, the network has broadcast a cruise journey, a fire being slowly built and burned, and more recently, the making of a jumper - starting with the sheep from which the wool came. Last year, the tax-funded channel began the online broadcast of Piipshow, a live stream of birds and squirrels in a feeder that looks like a coffee shop. Also last year, British Airways announced it would make the seven-hour train journey video available to passengers on its in-flight entertainment system.","BBC Four Goes Slow series also features three-hour National Gallery tour .

"Disgraced former CIA chief David Petraeus has agreed to plead guilty to sharing classified information with his mistress, it emerged today. The former U.S. Army General will plead guilty to one felony count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, according to documents filed in Charlotte, North Carolina. The plea deal, which Petraeus signed on February 22, shows the government has agreed to recommend no prison time but will enforce a sentence of two years probation and a $40,000 fine. A judge, who is not bound by the recommendation, will make the final decision. The charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison, a $100,000 fine and five years of probation. No immediate date has been set for Petraeus to enter the plea. By striking the deal, he avoids an embarrassing trial that would detail his relationship with Paula Broadwell. He stepped down as head of the CIA after their affair emerged in November 2012. Scroll down for video . Affair: Former CIA chief David Petraeus will plead guilty to a charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified information after he handed over sensitive material to his mistress, Paula Broadwell, right . Documents filed in federal court state that between August 2011 and April 5, 2013, Petraeus did 'unlawfully and knowingly' take classified materials and retain them at 'unauthorized' locations. Prosecutors say that while Broadwell was writing Petraeus' biography, he gave her binders of the classified materials that included notes about his discussions with President Obama. The binders, known as 'black books,' were seized by the FBI in a search of Petraeus' home. He lied to FBI agents about providing them to Broadwell and said he never gave her classified material, according to court documents. In late August 2011, he took the books to the home where Broadwell was staying during a week-long trip to Washington, D.C., according to the documents. He left the books with her so she could use them as source material for the biography, prosecutors said. Days later, Petraeus brought the books back to his home in Arlington, Virginia. An attorney for Petraeus, Robert Barnett, said he had no immediate comment. Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the CIA in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing. Broadwell, now 42, met Petraeus, 62, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University, where she was working on a dissertation about him. She wrote his biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus', which afforded them considerable time together. They carried on an affair between late 2011 and the summer of 2012. But the relationship was later uncovered whiled the FBI investigated claims that one of Petraeus' friends, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, was receiving threatening emails. Hurt: Paula Broadwell remains married to husband Scott, pictured together left in 2012, while Petraeus is married to wife Holly, right, despite the affair that forced him to step down as CIA chief in 2012 . Scandal: The affair was revealed after Florida socialite Jill Kelley, pictured, contacted the FBI over threatening emails she had received. It emerged that Broadwell had sent the emails . The messages were found to have been sent by Broadwell, a married mother-of-two. As agents investigated Broadwell's email account, they uncovered the affair and learned the CIA director had shared classified information with her. Petraeus, who remains married to wife Holly, acknowledged the affair as he stepped down. In May 2013, Broadwell, who is also still married, finally issued an apology for the affair. 'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station, WSOC. 'I'm very blessed. Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will. Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.' Petraeus was a celebrated general who was credited with helping pull Iraq from the brink of an all-out civil war. President Barack Obama turned to him to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan before moving to him to the CIA in 2011.","David Petraeus has agreed to plead guilty to one charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified information, it emerged on Tuesday .

"Conservatives must show they are not driven by a desire to 'punish' people on benefits, Iain Duncan Smith warned tonight. The Work and Pensions Secretary used a speech in Washington to warn that for too long his party has addressed the poor with 'fingers wagging' instead of offering them 'hope'. He insisted the Tory pitch to voters has to be about more than tax, immigration and crime to show they are driven by 'fairness, opportunity, and compassion'. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith insists the Tory pitch to voters has to be about more than tax, immigration and crime to show they are driven by 'fairness, opportunity, and compassion' Mr Duncan Smith's remarks echo the warning in 2002 from Theresa May that the Tories had become seen as the 'nasty party'. The comments came as he reflects on the way the Conservatives have been perceived over many years in its approach to the poor. But it will be seen in the context of the forthcoming election and comes after it emerged David Cameron was privately uneasy with the tone of the current Tory election campaign. He told the American Enterprise Institute that for too long the Conservatives 'abandoned the subject of poverty to the poverty lobby and the liberal left'. It left the Tories more and more defined instead by a narrow list of policy areas including taxation, immigration, and law and order. He added: 'Historically, perhaps our main contribution to the subject was that whenever Conservative politicians did speak about poverty, they did so with fingers wagging and harsh punitive language. 'In the UK, my party, the party of Wilberforce and Shaftesbury, seemed to have forgotten that we had always had a historic mission to help people improve the quality of their lives - not just taking the easy option of sustaining people in dependency whilst looking the other way.' David Cameron is under pressure to pressure to create a more upbeat, positive tone to the Tory campaign. Theresa May, now Home Secretary, used a speech in 2002 to warn the Tories were seen as the 'nasty party' Skills minister Nick Boles criticised sanctions . A Tory minister has sparked a row after claiming the government's benefits sanctions showed 'inhuman inflexibility'. He reportedly told a meeting organised by a charity in his Grantham constituency that some of the sanctions cases he heard about were a 'worry' and 'need to be looked at'. The skills minister was forced to rush out a clarification of his views, insisting he strongly supported the use of sanctions 'in principle and in practice'. The Grantham Journal reported that Mr Boles expressed his concerns during a visit to see the work of a charity involved in helping the poor and homeless. Speaking to volunteers from Grantham Passage and its umbrella organisation, Grantham Poverty Concern, Mr Boles said: 'With some of these cases it seems to me that there is an inhuman inflexibility that is imposed on them.' He added: 'The sanctions are a worry and do need to be looked at.' Downing Street insisted David Cameron had 'full confidence' in the minister. For years Labour and the left argued that they had a 'sympathetic approach' which was to prop people up 'on slightly better incomes'. But he insisted: 'Whilst a welfare cheque might protect against hardship, it can never substitute for a loving parent, an inspirational teacher or a hard-earned pay cheque. 'Thus as Conservatives, our purpose must be to show far from wanting to punish people, our vision is one of transforming people's lives - defined not by what we oppose, but what we stand for: putting hope back where it has gone and allying aspiration with hard work, spurred on by strong moral values of fairness, opportunity, and compassion.' Reports emerged at the weekend that Mr Cameron fears the current Tory pitch to voters was boring, focussed narrowly on a long-term economic plan, welfare and jobs. The Prime Minister is said to have agreed to drop his cherished Big Society themes and National Citizen Service after advice from party strategists. Mr Duncan Smith claimed that a move to Universal Credit, combining six benefits into one, will ensure work always pays. The project has been dogged by IT problems, expensive write-offs and delays. But he insists it will 'bring an end to the something for nothing culture that trapped people for too long'. He argues welfare should be 'a journey that people are on, not a destination where they stay'. Mr Duncan Smith was invited to address the U.S. audience to share the success of reform of the British welfare system and the need to make a positive case for getting people into work. The coalition has capped benefits at average earnings, so that families on benefits 'face the same choices about where they live and what they can afford as everyone else,' Mr Duncan Smith said. Disability benefits are being reformed not just to save money but to help disabled people to 'meet the extra living costs they face, but making sure they won't lose that money if they do take up a job'. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'After five years it's clear David Cameron's plan to reform welfare has failed. 'Bungling Tory ministers have overspent on social security by £25billion since 2010. 'The housing benefit bill for working people is set to double by 2019, costing taxpayers billions, because the government had failed to tackle to root causes of rising spending: low pay and rising rents. And hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to rely on food banks. 'Labour will deliver a 'something for something' social security system that gives people the support they need to get back to work.'","Work and Pensions Secretary urges Tories to have upbeat pitch to voters .

"The horrific double-murder suicide involving a pregnant woman, her young son and her father has rocked the Queensland town west of Brisbane where it all took place. The bodies of 27-year-old Kris-Deann Sharpley, who was also heavily pregnant, and her seven-year-old son Jackson were found in the house. A 52-year-old man, believed to be her father Derek, was also found by a female relative. The scene at Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road home was so grisly it distressed first-response police officers, according to Detective Inspector David Isherwood. 'Two of the victims, both the adult male and female, had very serious wounds to their bodies,' he said. 'Both appear to have been shot in the head.' Scroll down for video .

A high-calibre weapon was found but police have not established how Jackson, discovered in a bedroom with the man, died. His mother's body lay in the bathroom. Police have said Mr Sharpley's death is not considered suspicious but DI Isherwood stopped short of confirming the tragedy was a double murder-suicide. 'I will say that they are known to police,' he said. 'At this point in time there's nothing to suggest there was any incident that occurred in terms of a disturbance.' The man's other daughter reportedly discovered all three bodies when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs. DI Isherwood earlier said that investigations indicate that there is no further threat to public safety. 'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' he said. DI Isherwood said really close members of the family haven't been able to be contacted yet. The person who found the bodies had to climb through a window to gain access to the house. 'Two people that live in the town heard three distinct gunshots,' DI Isherwood said. 'There is no evidence that the house has been broken into when the police arrived they had to force entry into the premises. It would appear that the house was secure.

"Human waste left by climbers on Mount Everest has become a problem that is causing pollution and threatening to spread disease on the world's highest peak. The more than 700 climbers and guides who spend nearly two months on Everest's slopes each climbing season leave large amounts of faeces and urine, and the issue has not been addressed, the chief of Nepal's mountaineering association, Ang Tshering, told reporters on Tuesday. 'Climbers usually dig holes in the snow for their toilet use and leave the human waste there,' Tshering said, adding that the waste has been 'piling up' for years around the four camps. Scroll down for video . Human waste left by climbers on Mount Everest has become a problem that is causing pollution and threatening to spread disease on the world's highest peak, chief of Nepal's mountaineering association said . He said Nepal's government needs to get the climbers to dispose of the waste properly so the mountain remains pristine. Hundreds of foreign climbers attempt to scale Everest during Nepal's mountaineering season, which began this week and runs through May. Last year's season was canceled after 16 local guides were killed in an avalanche in April. Climbers spend weeks acclimatizing around the four camps set up between the base camp at 5,300 meters (17,380 feet) and the 8,850-meter-high (29,035-foot-high) summit. The camps have tents and some essential equipment and supplies, but do not have toilets. At the base camp, where there are more porters, cooks and support staff during the climbing season, there are toilet tents with drums to store the waste. Once filled, the drums are carried to a lower area, where the waste is properly disposed. Hundreds of foreign climbers attempt to scale Everest during Nepal's mountaineering season, which began this week and runs through May . Dawa Steven Sherpa, who has been leading Everest cleanup expeditions since 2008, said some climbers carry disposable travel toilet bags to use in the higher camps. 'It is a health hazard and the issue needs to be addressed,' he said. Nepal's government has not come up with a plan yet to tackle the issue of human waste. But starting this season, officials stationed at the base camp will strictly monitor garbage on the mountain, said Puspa Raj Katuwal, the head of the government's Mountaineering Department. The government imposed new rules last year requiring each climber to bring down to the base camp eight kilograms (18 pounds) of rubbish — the amount it estimates a climber discards along the route. Climbing teams must leave a $4,000 (£2600) deposit that they lose if they don't comply with the regulations, Katuwal said. More than 4,000 climbers have scaled Mount Everest since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealand climber Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay. Hundreds of others have died in the attempt, while many have succeeded only with help from oxygen tanks, equipment porters and Sherpa guides.","Over 700 climbers and guides spend two months on Everest each year .

"A big debate researchers have been having about how small life on Earth can get may be over. Scientists from the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, captured photos of 'ultra-small bacteria' for the first time. The photos may end a debate which has been raging for two decades.about whether the tiny bacteria exist or not. Scientists from the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, captured photos of 'ultra-small bacteria' (pictured) Scientists say that the ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns which means that almost 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an Escherichia coli cell . The comprehensive electron microscopy images and DNA-based description of the microbes researchers were able to obtain seem to indicate the bacteria are very small - but very real. Ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns [one micron is one millionth of a meter], according to Berkeley Lab. Close to 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an Escherichia coli cell. More than 150,000 Escherichia cells could fit onto the tip of a single human hair. The bacteria were found in groundwater and are believed to be rather common. In their abstract, the scientists wrote: 'Ultrastructural features potentially related to cell and genome size minimization include tightly packed spirals inferred to be DNA, few densely packed ribosomes and a variety of pili-like structures that might enable inter-organism interactions that compensate for biosynthetic capacities inferred to be missing from genomic data. 'The results suggest that extremely small cell size is associated with these relatively common, yet little known organisms.' Since it was founded in 1931, Berkeley Lab (pictured above) has been recognized with 13 Nobel prizes . Findings about the bacteria were published in the Nature Communications journal. A UC Berkeley professor in the departments of Earth and Planetary Science and Environmental Science, Policy and Management, Jill Banfield, co-wrote the paper with Birgit Luef, a reearchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Banfield said: 'These newly described ultra-small bacteria are an example of a subset of the microbial life on earth that we know almost nothing about. 'They're enigmatic. 'These bacteria are detected in many environments and they probably play important roles in microbial communities and ecosystems. 'But we don't yet fully understand what these ultra-small bacteria do.' Luef said their research was 'a significant step in characterizing the size, shape, and internal structure of ultra-small cells'. She added: 'There isn't a consensus over how small a free-living organism can be, and what the space optimization strategies may be for a cell at the lower size limit for life.'

"The nation's system for guiding planes and other aircraft is at 'increased and unnecessary risk' of being hacked, according to a report by government watchdog released Monday. The Federal Aviation Administration has taken steps to protect the air traffic control system from cyber-based threats, but 'significant security control weaknesses remain, threatening the agency's ability to ensure the safe and uninterrupted operation,' said the report by the Government Accountability Office. One area of weakness is the ability to prevent and detect unauthorized access to the vast network of computer and communications systems the FAA uses to process and track flights around the world, the report said. A government watchdog group's new report warned that the nation's system for guiding planes and other aircraft is at 'increased and unnecessary risk' of being hacked . The FAA relies on more than 100 of these air traffic systems to direct planes. There also are inadequate protections to prevent entry into air traffic computer systems from other, less-secure computer systems not directly involved in traffic operations, the report said. Other problems identified in the report include: . -Security weaknesses identified by the FAA weren't always addressed in a timely way. -Security control assessments by the agency weren't always comprehensive enough to find weaknesses. -Shortcomings in monitoring for hacking incidents or unauthorized entries mean the FAA may not be able to 'contain, eradicate or recover from incidents.' These weaknesses put the air traffic system 'at increased and unnecessary risk of unauthorized access, use or modification that could disrupt air traffic control operations,' the report said. The accountability office made 14 recommendations to the FAA and another three to the Transportation Department. Keith Washington, a Department of Transportation acting assistant security, said in a letter to the accountability office that the FAA is aware of the importance of the matter and has achieved several milestones in improving its cybersecurity. FAA officials had no comment. The agency is part of the Transportation Department. The FAA says it is aware of the concerns and taking serious steps to shore up security . Following the report's release, the chairman and senior Democratic member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation sent a letter to FAA Administer Michael Huerta asking for a ""full accounting on the status"" of the accountability office's recommendations. ""These vulnerabilities have the potential to compromise the safety and efficiency of the national airspace system, which the traveling public relies on each and every day,"" said Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla. They called the report ""troubling.""","The Government Accountability Office warned of 'increased and unnecessary risk' in new report .

"Helsinki Airport has become the first in Europe to offer sleeping pods for worn-out travellers who are looking to catch a little shut-eye between flights. Already billed as one of the most sleep-friendly airports in the world, Finland’s largest airport has installed 19 GoSleep pods which offer privacy and peace for weary passengers. It costs €9 per hour (approximately £6.50) and pillows and blankets are available for the pods, which are located at two gates inside the terminal. Weary travellers can pay €9 per hour for access to one of Helsinki Airport's new sleeping pods . Finland’s largest airport has installed 19 GoSleep pods, which offer privacy and peace, at two gates . Each cocoon-like pod is an ergonomic seat which can be transformed into a bed, with a retractable cover designed to block light and noise. Users can store their hand luggage under the seat and charge their laptops or mobile devices by using a built-in power source. The GoSleep pods were designed and manufactured by Finnish Short Rest Solutions Ltd with the aim of taking some of the stress out of travel. Heikki Koski, Vice President at Helsinki Airport, said: ‘We wish to provide passengers with an opportunity for stress-free travel and a nap between flights. The GoSleep pods were designed and manufactured by Finnish Short Rest Solutions Ltd . Each cocoon-like pod is an ergonomic seat which can be transformed into a bed, with a retractable cover . ‘Helsinki Airport has many transit passengers, who may not have had any sleep for a day or are suffering from jet lag. I believe that the service will have genuine demand.’ While most airports offer comfortable chairs with little privacy, Helsinki Airport tested the pods in a specially-designed rest area in 2013. The pods were such a hit that the airport decided to purchase nearly a dozen of the chairs and scrap the relaxation area. Officials at Helsinki Airport said they have had positive feedback from passengers . Jussi Piispanen, CEO of Short Rest Solutions Ltd., said: ‘The pilot project showed that passengers prefer individual sleeping pods to larger rest areas. ‘Sleeping pods have aroused wide-spread interest in particular on gate 18, where they are available for testing for free during the spring. ‘Based on customer feedback, we will continue to refine the service to make it even more customer-friendly.’ Helsinki Airport tested the sleeping pods in a specially-designed relaxation area in 2013 . Officials at Helsinki Airport said they have had positive feedback from passengers since the programme quietly launched in mid-February. Last year, the website SleepinginAirports.com ranked Helsinki Airport as the world’s third most sleep-friendly hotel, behind Singapore Changi Airport and Seoul’s Incheon International Airport. In addition to individual sleeping pods in two public areas, Helsinki Airport offers a book swap for passengers, a free art gallery and free wifi. It is also planning to open 70 new or renovated shops as part of a €900million (£650million) development programme with the goal of boosting its annual passenger volume to 20million in 2020.","Finland's largest airport has installed 19 GoSleep pods at two gates .

"The Ronnie Corbett sitcom 'Sorry' that poked fun  at a middle-aged man living with their parents would be a 'documentary' today, Michael Gove claimed tonight. The Government chief whip said  it was too hard for people to get on the housing ladder today, forcing people to stay at home later in life. He said new plans to build 200,000 cheap 'starter homes' for the under 40s were needed to help a generation buy their first home. Michael Gove said the Ronnie Corbett sitcom 'Sorry' would be a 'documentary' today because of the cost of buying a first home . Mr Gove's remarks, to LBC's Iain Dale, came after it emerged more than 30,000 people have registered for the new 'starter homes' schemes within 48 hours of its launch. David Cameron yesterday announced that under a future Tory Government 200,000 new homes will be sold 20 per cent cheaper than the going rate - but only for those under 40 who haven't yet bought their own home. Mr Cameron said building cheap new homes for first time buyers would be the centre-piece of the Tory Party's house-building strategy after the election. Mr Gove tonight said the proposal was necessary to help young families get a leg onto the housing ladder. He said: ‘What David has been talking about is extending the number of what have been called ‘starter homes’. These are homes that we will make available to people under the age of 40 so they can get onto the housing ladder. ‘The right thing to do is to help those people who, traditionally, would have been able to expect to get a home before they are 40. ‘I remember when we were growing up, there was a situation comedy called “Sorry” with Ronnie Corbett. ‘It was a comedy because you had a man in his 40s living with his parents. Well, it was a comedy then – it is a documentary now. We need to make sure we have more homes for young people.’ In the sitcom 'Sorry' Ronnie Corbett plays Timothy Lumsden, who still lives at home with his parents despite being middle aged . David Cameron yesterday announced that under a future Tory Government 200,000 new homes will be sold 20 per cent cheaper than the going rate - but only for the under 40s . The Prime Minister yesterday promised the new homes for under 40s would be 'decent, well-built, homes – places to start and raise a family'. Mr Cameron also promised to keep mortgage rates low, build more homes, extend the controversial help-to-buy scheme and encourage more people to buy their own council house. Local councils will also be given more power to stop unpopular developments, Mr Cameron said. The PM said: 'There is a particular kind of security that comes with owning your own home [but] too many people have been denied that security. 'The young people in their 20s and 30s still living with their parents, desperately saving for their own place. 'The couple who want a child but can't afford to upsize – even though they both have full-on, full-time jobs. It shouldn't be this way.

"Radio Presenter Jane Garvey has revealed she was left ‘upset’ after watching  hardcore pornography in preparation for the Radio 4 show’s latest debate . AS the host of Woman’s Hour, Jane Garvey has chaired discussions on harrowing topics ranging from rape to domestic abuse. But despite her experience, the presenter has revealed she was left ‘upset’ after watching hours of hardcore pornography in preparation for the Radio 4 show’s latest debate. The mother-of-two, 50, said she may have been ‘naïve’ but was shocked by the way women were treated in the explicit clips, with many looking like they were in pain. She also raised concerns that pornography is ‘no longer limited to the top shelf’ as it was in her own childhood but has become easily accessible as ‘erotica has gone mainstream.’ Speaking during the debate ‘Can Porn Empower Women?’, Miss Garvey said: ‘I have to say I spent an informative hour or so last week watching porn at work. I don’t want to miss Call The Midwife. ‘When I watched it last week, if I am really honest with you, I am probably a bit naïve and vanilla in my taste, I don’t think upset is too strong a word, but I was upset by the expressions of some of the women. I do not want to watch women in pain. It is not sexy. I don’t get why I should be expected to get that. Why should I?’ Other members of the panel, which included sex workers, defended pornography, claiming that not all porn is the same and that it can empower both men and women. Miss Garvey, who divorced television presenter Adrian Chiles, 47, in 2009, said access to pornography has changed since her childhood and that she worries what impact this could have on society. She said: ‘When I was a child you might find a school friend’s dad’s copy of Playboy in his bedroom and have a blooming good look and be slightly amazed and a bit stunned and a bit baffled if you were me. It was not everywhere and now it is. It was not so easily accessible. Surely that has made a difference?’ Statistics published by pornographic website Pornhub suggest that pornographic influences are having on how people view sex and relationships. Since the release of the Fifty Shades of Grey film, the site has seen a spike in searches for explicit videos about ‘domination’ of 55 percent among men and 40 percent among women. Psychotherapist Susie Orbach, 68, author of books such as Fat is a Feminist Issue and What Do Women Want?, agreed that what was once seen as pornography is now mainstream. She said: ‘I think there is porn in every women’s magazine. In Vogue and Cosmopolitan, we represent girls as if though they are always ready for it. That is a very interesting way of representing femininity and women. What used to be on the top shelf is now in every magazine and it is constructing a different relationship for girls in terms of their own bodies.’ Since the release of the Fifty Shades of Grey film, Pornhub has seen a spike in searches for explicit videos about ‘domination’ of 55 percent among men and 40 percent among women . Other panellists were keen to defend pornography. Pandora Blake, 29, who describes herself as a feminist porn performer, said it is wrong to tar all explicit videos and images with the same brush. Miss Blake, who runs a website called Dreams of Spanking and posts pictures on Twitter of bare bottoms that have been caned until they are bleeding, said: ‘Porn is not a genre. It is a medium like film or television. Saying it is degrading is like saying all of TV is degrading just because you have watched Top Gear. I would say don’t throw the baby out with the bath water. There is a growing number of feminist porn directors making the porn they want to see. It is a huge business and it is happening now. ‘I have produced porn for nine years. I have a creative vision that I want to get out there. It gives me body confidence and financial independence. We should not be judging porn on whether it empowers women as capitalism is degrading as you have to exchange your labour for money.’ To those who said the internet was to full of pornography that they would rather not see, she replied: ‘You can scroll past. The internet is like that. There is an escapism. The women choose to be there. They would rather be there than washing dishes or cleaning toilets.’ However, this was not enough for sex shop founder Sam Roddick, 43, who said the modern pornography industry, and the morals it teaches are sex and relationships, is damaging for everyone. She said: ‘I am worried what is happening now. There is too much profit engineering now. I believe the porn industry is unregulated. This is not just un-powering to women but un-powering to us all.’ ‘As the industry stands I don’t believe it holds women in a safe place. I can make my own home erotica and give it to my friends freely but if there is a mechanism of money behind it lets question it and let’s change it. That is what we need to do.’ The debate, which was recorded at the weekend, will be broadcast in an edited version on Sunday March 8 to mark International Women’s Day.","Jane Garvey left ‘upset’ after watching porn in preparation for debate .

"His medals tell the story of extra-ordinary acts of gallantry and a flying career so distinguished it helped to change the course of the Second World War. Yesterday former Dambuster pilot Les Munro remained a hero to the last – by putting them up for sale in honour of his fallen comrades. The 95-year-old RAF squadron leader, now the only surviving pilot of the legendary raid, is to auction the medals to help pay for the upkeep of Britain’s recently built memorial to the 55,573 airmen killed in the war. Scroll down for video . Donation: Squadron Leader Les Munro, 95, pictured, who is the last surviving Dambusters commander, hopes to raise £50,000 for the Bomber Command Memorial in London by selling his war medals . Up for auction: Les Munro will sell his medal for New Zealand Order of Merit, above and, pictured left to right his medals for Distinguished Service Order, New Zealand Queen's Service Order, Distinguished Flying Cross, 1939-45 Star; Air Crew Europe Star with clasp France and Germany, Italy Star; Defence and War Medals 1939-45, New Zealand Service Medal 1939-45, and the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal . Among them is the Distinguished Service Order awarded for completing 41 operations and his Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in 21 sorties over Europe. Yesterday he revealed he was inspired to make the selfless gesture after being moved by a visit to the Bomber Command Memorial in London. The medals are expected to fetch around £50,000 when they are sold with his flying logs and other memorabilia this month, but Squadron Leader Munro has pledged to donate the proceeds to the RAF Benevolent Fund, the welfare charity that maintains the memorial in Green Park. He said he wanted to do so ‘out of comradeship’ for the airmen who never came home. He added it was a ‘travesty’ that the ‘magnificent memorial’ – dedicated to British and Commonwealth airmen and ground crew after a campaign led by the Daily Mail and others – was not unveiled until 2012, more than 67 years after the war ended. Squadron Leader Munro is described as ‘one of the great heroes’ of 617 Squadron, the elite air crew responsible for some of the most strategically critical bombing successes of the war. Remembered: The Bomber Command Memorial is dedicated to the 55,573 airmen and ground staff killed during the Second World War. It costs £50,000 a year to maintain, and Les Munro wants to help pay for it . Service: Les Munro leaning out of the cockpit of his Lancaster Bomber , which he flew on the Dambusters raid.

Comrades: Les Munro (centre at front) with his crew in front of the Lancaster Bomber he flew on the raid that smashed two dams . The men of Bomber Command suffered huge losses in the Second World War, with 45 out of every 100 airmen killed. But permanent memorial for Bomber Command wasn't built for 67 years due to the controversy of thousands of German civilians who died during the bombings of its cities. In 2010 German politicians called for plans for the memorial to be abandoned out of respect for the civilian casualties. Backed by Bild, their country's biggest daily newspaper, they said the idea was offensive to the 25,000 victims of the raid on Dresden in 1945. Bee Gees singer Robin Gibb, a key supporter, said at the time: 'Anyone speaking against it should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. 'The whole world, including Germany, is free today because of Bomber Command's sacrifice.' But 67 years after the war ended the £3.5million RAF memorial was created at  the Piccadilly entrance to Green Park in London. Built from Portlandstone, it is open to the sky with the entrance made from sections of a Halifax bomber shot down during the war. A sculpture inside marks the loss of the plane's seven crew. Foremost among them was the 1943 precision raid that destroyed dams in Germany’s industrial heartland, crippling armament factories along the Ruhr valley. The ‘bouncing bomb’ attack was immortalized 12 years later in the film The Dam Busters, starring Michael Redgrave. Munro, then a flight lieutenant, was piloting one of the Lancaster bombers to the dams when the aircraft was hit by flak, smashing a gaping hole into the rear fuselage, damaging equipment vital to sighting the target and wiping out all communications. The crew realised they would be ‘a menace’ to their fellow airmen without radio contact, and could jeopardise the entire mission by carrying on. Against difficult odds, Munro saved the lives of his crew by flying the plane home safely, still carrying its specially designed mine. The raid claimed the lives of 53 of the 133 crew on the mission, among them eight commanding officers. Wing Commander Guy Gibson, who led the mission and received the Victoria Cross, said he was ‘a most charming fellow – one of those types who can always be relied upon to do the right thing at the right moment’. Munro, promoted afterwards to squadron leader, went on to lead successful raids on German arms factories, rocket sites and U-boat pens all over Europe. After the war he returned to his native New Zealand, where his Glasgow-born father had emigrated in 1903 to become a shepherd and start a family. His New Zealand medals for post-war service in regional politics are being sold with his other medals and campaign stars at the auction in London on March 25. Christopher Hill, of auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, described him as ‘a remarkable man whose spirit of adventure never left him’.

"The U.S. Justice Department has concluded that the Ferguson, Missouri, police department routinely engages in racially biased practices, a law enforcement official familiar with the department's findings said on Tuesday. The investigation into the police department began in August after the shooting of unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson sparked national protests. Analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed African-Americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, the official said. Scroll down for video . A Justice Department investigation has found patterns of racial bias in the Ferguson police department and at the municipal jail and court. The full report will be publicly released March 4 . African-Americans also made up most of incidents in which officers used force and all incidents where police dogs bit citizens, said the official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. Nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of African Americans in Ferguson, New York and Cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what President BarackObama called 'simmering distrust' between police and communities. The scathing report will show that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were African-Americans, and victims of the 14 dog bites recorded by the department all were black. Justice Department staff interviewed hundreds of average citizens as part of the six-month probe, concluding that a large portion of Ferguson's population mistrusts the local police force and considers it illegitimate . Report will show that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were African-American . Black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops, compared to their white counterparts. Ferguson's black residents are also more likely than others to be charged with relatively minor offenses like 'manner of walking in roadway' or 'failure to comply. The findings are expected to be formally released as early as Wednesday, a Justice Department spokeswoman said. The department will use the findings to negotiate policy changes with Ferguson officials and enter a consent decree, or to sue the city to force change. Previous federal investigations into police departments have resulted in such changes as reporting arrest data to the Justice Department and installing federal monitors to oversee operations. Justice Department officials found from 2012 to 2014 that black motorists in Ferguson, Missouri, were more than twice as likely as whites to be searched in traffic stops, even though they were 26 per cent less likely to be found carrying contraband. African-Americans were 68 per cent less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by a municipal court judge. And from April to September of last year, 95 per cent of people kept at the city jail for more than two days were black, the six-month inquiry found. Of the cases in which the police department documented the use of force, 88 per cent involved blacks, and victims of the 14 dog bites recorded by the department all were black. Overall, African Americans make up 67 per cent of the population of Ferguson, about 10 miles north of downtown St. Louis. The report's findings vindicate critics who have cited a pattern of abuse in Ferguson. But they are unlikely to restore full trust in the Ferguson police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict Brown's killer, officer Darren Wilson. Wilson, who said he acted in self-defense, is also unlikely to face criminal charges in a separate Justice Department investigation. Mayor James Knowles said Ferguson was committed to making improvements. 'The city has always been committed to making sure we have the very best police department and any training and improvements or reforms we make to help improve service to the community, we are interested in,' Knowles said. Civil rights attorney Jerryl Christmas, who has represented people who have clashed with Ferguson police and city officials, said he was not surprised by the findings, and he hopes to see Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson fired. 'We already knew all this was going on. The problem is nobody is being prosecuted, nobody has been terminated,' Christmas said. Jackson did not respond to a request for comment. One email sent by a Ferguson police or municipal court official joked in 2008 that Obama would not stay in office long because, 'What black man holds a steady job for four years?' Another electronic missive, written in 2011, included an offensive joke: 'An African-American woman in New Orleans was admitted into the the hospital for a pregnancy termination. Two weeks later she received a check for $5,000. She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from. The hospital said, 'Crimestoppers.'' Ferguson Committeewoman Patricia Bynes said she was outraged by that and other racially tinged emails found in the investigation. Biased: The investigation found Ferguson officers  too often charged blacks with petty offenses . 'The fact that police officers and municipal court officials are using their public emails to tell racial jokes, that just reeks of arrogance and ignorance,' said Bynes. 'It's astounding. They think they are untouchable. The taxpayers have been paying for that racial bias.' The official said that in Ferguson's court system, African-Americans were less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and made up 95 percent of people held longer than two days in the Ferguson jail. The Ferguson Municipal Court, which Attorney General Eric Holder has previously criticized for unfairly penalizing the city's poor, issued the majority of its warrants for minor violations such as parking, traffic and housing code violations. The physical tussle that led to Brown's death began after Wilson told him and a friend to move from the street to the sidewalk. A separate report to be issued soon is expected to clear Darren Wilson of federal civil rights charges. Ben Crump, the attorney for the Brown family, said that if the reports about the findings are true, they 'confirm what Michael Brown's family has believed all along, and that is that the tragic killing of an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager was part of a systemic pattern of inappropriate policing of African-American citizens in the Ferguson community.' A separate report to be issued soon is expected to clear Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson of federal civil rights charges in the Brown killing . The DOJ report also will accuse the St Louis suburb of putting profit over public safety in violation of the 14th Amendment's due process clause by collecting heavy fines from low-income residents. Since 2010, according to the federal agency, Ferguson courts have raked in more than $442,000 in fines for failure to appear, which amounted to a quarter of the court's annual revenue, reported the St Louis Post Dispatch. The onerous 'failure to appear' charge, which disproportionately affected those living close to and below the poverty line, was dropped by the city in September. Justice Department staff had reviewed 35,000 pages of police records and interviewed hundreds of city officials and average citizens as part of the six-month probe, concluding that a large portion of Ferguson's population mistrusts the local police force and considers it illegitimate. In anticipation of the report's release, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III said Monday that the outcome of the investigation was predetermined, according to USA Today. 'I'm not comfortable that Eric Holder announced that there would be wholesale changes before he started collecting any evidence,'' Knowles said. 'If the DOJ has some serious findings, I hope they will provide that to us.' John Gaskin III, a St. Louis community activist, praised the findings, saying 'Ferguson police have to see the light in how they deal with people of color. 'It's quite evident that change is coming down the pike. This is encouraging,' he said. 'It's so unfortunate that Michael Brown had to be killed. But in spite of that, I feel justice is coming.'","A message in a municipal email account said Obama wouldn't be president for very long because 'what black man holds a steady job for four years'

"The Prime Minister will condemn 'warped' sense of political correctness which prevented council staff from reporting abuse for fear of appearing racist . Teachers, social workers and councillors who turn a blind eye to child sex abuse will face up to five years in jail under plans for a new criminal offence. It comes as David Cameron today vows to eradicate the ‘culture of denial’ surrounding the issue. The Government has decided to act following an official report that found at least 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. Children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted and trafficked to other cities in England. The Prime Minister will say a ‘warped’ sense of political correctness contributed to local authorities not acting. The inquiry found there were fears among council staff of being labelled racist if they focused on victims’ descriptions of the majority of abusers as Asian men. There have been separate allegations of decades of paedophile activity by powerful individuals in churches, hospitals, schools, political parties and the BBC. New measures will be unveiled at a summit in Downing Street attended by victims and survivors’ groups, police chiefs, council leaders, health and social care professionals, and child protection experts. Ministers plan to introduce a new criminal offence of ‘wilful neglect’ of children suffering abuse, and apply it to social workers, teachers and elected council members. A similar offence has recently been introduced in the health service and is punishable by up to five years in jail or an unlimited fine, and unlimited fines for organisations. As well as new sanctions for public sector workers who fail to protect children, the Government will announce a new national helpline for professionals to blow the whistle on bad practice. Child sex abuse is also to be prioritised as a ‘national threat’ by police and crime commissioners and chief constables. The Prime Minister will say: ‘We have all been appalled at the abuse suffered by so many young girls in Rotherham and elsewhere across the country. ‘Children were ignored, sometimes even blamed, and issues were swept under the carpet – often because of a warped and misguided sense of political correctness. 'That culture of denial which let them down so badly must be eradicated. Shaun Right, the former  Police and Crime Commissioner of South Yorkshire, resigned over the scandal . 'Today, I am sending an unequivocal message that professionals who fail to protect children will be held properly accountable and council bosses who preside over such catastrophic failure will not see rewards for that failure. ‘But it is not just about introducing new policies. It is about making sure that the professionals we charge with protecting our children – the council staff, police officer and social workers – do the jobs they are paid to do.’ The new offence of wilful neglect will apply when there has been a failure to act when a court concludes that a ‘moral duty’ to do so exists. It is expected to sit alongside a separate ‘mandatory reporting’ law, which would apply in schools, hospitals, churches, or sports clubs operated by a national body. Similar laws already exist in Northern Ireland, Australia, the United States and Denmark which impose a legal duty on professionals such as teachers, social workers, police and doctors to report suspicions of abuse or face legal consequences.","Government decided to act following revelations of Rotherham scandal .

"Allowing council tenants to buy their homes was one of the ‘greatest Conservative ideas of the last century’, David Cameron said last night. The Prime Minister pledged to ‘keep backing’ Margaret Thatcher’s flagship Right To Buy policy, and said its critics were hypocrites because they were usually homeowners themselves. His comments follow speculation that the Tories want to extend the policy, perhaps by including 2.5million housing association tenants. Harsh words: David Cameron has pledged to ‘keep backing’ the Right To Buy policy, and said its critics were hypocrites because they were usually homeowners themselves . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith also wants to reward social housing tenants who hold down a job for a year or more with an automatic stake in their properties. In a pre-election rally in Essex, Mr Cameron said that only his party could be trusted to safeguard the green belt because he is a ‘country man’. And he claimed that a Labour government would result in higher borrowing costs; pushing up mortgage cost for families by an extra £1,000 a year. Last night a poll found that the Conservatives have taken the lead over Labour – and that voters believe Britain would be burdened with more debt if Ed Miliband wins office. Polling from Lord Ashcroft, a former Tory Party deputy chairman, found that the Conservatives had opened up a two-point lead over Labour. In a pre-election rally in Essex, Mr Cameron said that only his party could be trusted to safeguard the green belt because he is a ‘country man’ It also found three times as many people believe a Labour government will result in more borrowing and debt than if Mr Cameron remained in office. Speaking at a property firm in Colchester yesterday, the Prime Minister said: ‘We will give more people the chance to own their home by backing the Right to Buy, and more security for those who rent. ‘Right to Buy is one of the greatest Conservative ideas of the last century – because it’s about pure, undiluted aspiration. ‘As Conservatives we don’t believe that people’s circumstances need to be stuck in one place forever. If you’re out of work – you don’t have to stay out of work. ‘If you’re in poverty – you don’t have to stay in poverty. If you had a difficult start in life – you don’t have to repeat the same patterns you were born into. All these things can be overcome with the right opportunities. ‘And that is what Right to Buy is about – people’s hard work taking them from being tenants in their home to owners of their home.’ He added that critics of Right to Buy were invariably homeowners themselves. ‘Whatever some social commentators say, people do have a deep desire to own a place of their own,’ he said. ‘And it’s interesting – often the people who criticise Right to Buy, who think it’s unnecessary, are speaking from the comfort and security of a home that they own. Rally: David Cameron applauds a speaker as he prepares to deliver a speech setting out the Conservative Party's sixth manifesto theme at ThinkBDW in Colchester . ‘As Conservatives we don’t think it’s one rule for us and one rule for them. We want to give everyone the chance of owning their own home. ‘So we extended Right to Buy. Thirty-three thousand more people have become homeowners this way, and our Conservative commitment for the next Parliament is to keep on backing this scheme.’ Mr Cameron also pledged to protect the green belt if the Conservatives win the next election – saying he wanted his children to walk on unspoilt countryside such as the North Downs. Building must take place on brownfield land as a priority, he said, but he acknowledged that building could not be restricted to such land. He said Britain is on target to build 200,000 homes a year by 2017 – bearing Labour’s target by three years. ‘When it comes to our Green Belt, I have been clear,’ he said. ‘The line remains scored in the sand – that land is precious. I am a country man. I love our countryside. ‘Put simply: the Green Belt is protected with us. And it is not just green belt that concerns people but green fields. I agree.’ The Prime Minister also said that a future Conservative government will ‘keep mortgage rates low’ so that homeowners can ‘go to bed with real peace of mind’. Pledging that maintaining low borrowing costs would be the first priority of the Tories’ housing policy, he attributed the UK’s historically low interest rates of 0.5 per cent to his government’s deficit reduction programme. He said Labour’s plan to borrow for investment would result in higher borrowing costs for home owners. ‘And do you know what that could cost people? Just a one per cent rise in market rates would add £1,000 to the average mortgage bill. ‘Britain’s home owners cannot afford that. So in the next Parliament Conservatives would see through our long-term economic plan, clear the deficit, run a budget surplus by 2018, and help keep mortgage rates low.’","David Cameron pledged to ‘keep backing’ Right To Buy policy .

"Alan Saffery, 61 (pictured), from Hereford, groomed and abused the young girl, who is now  in her 40s, over a four-year period in the 1970s and 80s while he was serving as an officer with West Mercia Police . A retired police officer who groomed a 12-year-old girl to such an extent that he could 'help himself to her' whenever he wanted, has been jailed for 12 years. Alan Saffery, 61, groomed and abused the young girl, who is now aged in her 40s, over a four-year period while he was serving as an officer with West Mercia Police. Worcester Crown Court heard how the offences only came to light after being reported to police by the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, during a separate investigation. Saffery, from Hereford, Herefordshire, has now been convicted of six counts of indecent assault and two counts of sex with a girl under the age of 13 following a trial. He was jailed for 12 years for the historical sex offences, which took place in the 1970s and 1980s while the girl was aged between 12 and 15, and shouted 'it's all lies' as he was taken to the cells following sentencing yesterday. The 'dangerous' sexual predator, who served as an officer for more than 30 years, was also convicted of two allegations of having child pornography images on his computer in 2013. He was cleared of two further charges of raping a second girl aged under 16 in 1986. During sentencing, Judge Robert Juckes QC said Saffery had helped the girl to become 'infatuated' with him and groomed her so he could 'help himself to her' whenever the opportunity arose. He added: 'Your job was to protect members of the community, not to abuse them.' The court heard Saffery groomed and repeatedly assaulted the victim while he was in his 20s and a serving police officer. In a police video played to the jury, the victim said Saffery would take 'every chance' to engage in sexual activity with her. She said: 'He would say nice things. He would tell me I was lovely and beautiful. 'A little girl would be flattered by that. 'I had a teenage crush on him. I was infatuated by him.' The jury were told they first had sex when she was 12-years-old and it stopped when she was 15-years-old with her realisation that the 'relationship' was wrong. Saffery, 61, who served as a police officer for more than 30 years, was jailed for 12 years at Worcester Crown Court (pictured) for six counts of indecent assault and two counts of sex with a girl under the age of 13 . But giving evidence, Saffery said he only had 'consensual' sex with the victim once at his home when she was aged 16. Detective Inspector Richard Rees, from West Mercia Police, said after the case: 'Outwardly, Saffery was a respected police officer and an upstanding member of the community. 'However, behind closed doors he was a dangerous sexual predator who took advantage of a young girl. 'Today his past has caught up with him.' Saffery retired as one of West Mercia Police's longest serving officers in 2002, with two commendations having tackled an armed robbery and surviving being stabbed.","Alan Saffery groomed young girl over a four-year period in 1970s and 80s .

"An American defense contractor found dead at the bottom of a Saudi Arabian hotel in January had injuries consistent with homicide, according to a medical exam carried out after his body was returned to the U.S. Christopher Cramer, 50, of New Hampshire, was found dead on January 15 outside the Sahara Makarim Hotel in the city of Tabuk. Saudi police have classified Cramer's death as suicide, but just hours before his death he had frantically texted friends in the U.S. begging for help. Scroll down for video . Christopher Cramer, 50, of New Hampshire, was found dead at the bottom of a Saudi Arabian hotel in January with injuries consistent with homicide . 'I'm at the Marakim tabuk hotel in Saudi. I think something bad is going to happen to me tonight. Please contact state dept ASAP. Bad things were said,' read the text message. Family members had disputed the Saudi's verdict and asked Dr. Michael Baden, a Fox News contributor and former chief medical examiner for New York City, to carry out an independent autopsy. 'What I could find was that there were multiple injuries that were not caused by impact alone,' Baden told FoxNews.com. 'When the fall occurs, usually injuries are consistent with the point of impact. There's more than one point of impact.' There also appeared to be a blunt force trauma to Cramer's head, something that usually does not occur in a suicide fall, said Baden. Cramer was in the country to demonstrate and sell an anti-armor missile system when his body was found three stories below his hotel room.

He would not send a text like that unless he was truly in trouble,' said Cramer's nephew, Chris Arsenault. 'We are going to continue to press for the facts, that he did not fall after committing suicide.'

Rafal Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is said to have forced the woman to have sex with him while she was a guest aboard the Endless Summer, threatening to kill her if she did not. Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki, who works on the boat, has denied these allegations. Police tell the Sun Sentinel that after a night of heavy drinking, Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki, 39, returned to the vessel at 12:40am and began banging on the door of the stateroom in which the woman was staying. When she opened the door, police claim he pushed his way in and raped the woman, pulling her hair, grabbing her throat and slapping her in the process. Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki told authorities the two did have 'rough sex,' but that is was completely consensual. He also said that the woman seemed to enjoy the encounter. The Polish born Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki was released on $15,000 bail Thursday and told he was not to leave the county, while also having no contact with the woman and staying at least 500-feet away from the Endless Summer.

"After he was pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich, Ed Miliband said there was more to politics than photo-opportunities. But the Labour leader's latest posed picture has become the subject of much intrigue after it appeared to show he had grown in height. Despite his apparent dislike of photo-opportunities, Labour MPs were invited to Mr Miliband's office to have their pictures taken with him for their election leaflets. Ed Miliband looks barely a couple of inches shorter than the Labour MP Toby Perkins, despite being almost half a foot shorter . When shadow business minister Toby Perkins proudly showed off his photo with the leader on his website though, something seemed amiss. The MP for Chesterfield, who is 6'6', has previously dwarfed Mr Miliband when they have been pictured together. Yet in the latest photograph, Mr Miliband, who just over six foot, appears to be almost the same height. It was rumoured that Mr Miliband had resorted to standing on a box or a phone book to improve his stature. But after Labour aides tonight categorically denied the suggestion, the mystery remained. Asked whether Mr Miliband been on a box, Mr Perkins told the Mail: 'No of course not.' Questioned further on what Mr Miliband had been standing on, he added, 'I want to know what you're on,' before ending the call. A spokesman for Mr Miliband later added that the only thing he had been stood on was the floor, but he refused to comment on whether Mr Perkins had been forced to crouch. He said: 'Ed was not stood on anything. He is over six foot tall and was not on a box.' At 6ft 6in Toby Perkins (pictured in yellow) is the perfect choice to keep goal for the Labour MPs' charity football team . Labour MPs were last week invited to have 'portrait photos' taken with Mr Miliband in his office, the website Guido Fawkes reported. However, it is not thought the party anticipated much demand as it only allowed 45 minutes for the pictures despite it having 256 MPs. Mr Perkins, who was elected in 2010, posted his picture with Mr Miliband with article on his website about Labour's pledge to reduce university tuition fees. After facing much ridicule for his bacon sandwich picture, Mr Miliband said in July last year: 'Here's the thing: I believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo-op. And that culture diminishes our politics.' A Labour source said that Mr Miliband is around 6'1' to 6'2' tall. In 2010 it was claimed Nicolas Sarkozy had not seen the funny side after it was claimed David Cameron and George Osborne had both made jokes about his height while they were in opposition. Mr Cameron denied an accusation that he had mocked the former French president, who is around 5'5', by making a remark about 'hidden dwarfs' while referring to a picture of himself with Mr Sarkozy. Mr Osborne provoked laughter at a conference when he removed a stool from behind the lectern at which he was about to speak and joked that it was 'the Sarkozy box'. The BBC's Newsnight reported that French officials had complained that the two incidents, which came within a few days of each other, 'failed to show sufficient respect' for the French head of state.","The Labour leader is over 6ft tall but is dwarfed by MP Toby Perkins .

"Singapore remains the world’s most expensive city to live with sky-high prices for clothes, cars and public transport, according to an annual survey which ranks the largest cities on the planet. It was followed by Paris, Oslo, Zurich and Sydney in The Economist Intelligence Unit’s worldwide cost of living survey. London, in 11th place, is now as pricy as Tokyo, which was the world’s most expensive city until it was unseated by Singapore last year, while New York ranked as the most expensive American city in 22nd spot. Scroll down for video . The Economist Intelligence Unit has named Singapore as the world's most expensive city . Basic groceries in Singapore cost 11 per cent more than in New York, according to the annual study . Melbourne, Geneva, Copenhagen, Hong Kong and Seoul rounded out the top 10 in the study, which compared prices in more than 130 cities using New York as a base for comparison. The top five is unchanged from last year’s study, while European cities hold five spots in this year’s top 10. However, the unpegging of the Swiss franc from the euro means that Zurich and Geneva would rank first and second, respectively, at today’s exchange rates. London ranked eighth overall in Europe, while Manchester was 22nd. London ranked 11th in the study, which was based on prices for things such as transport, food and clothes . Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit . The report found that the gap is growing in Western Europe between top-ranked cities and those with struggling Eurozone economies. For example, Paris has a cost of living that is 26 per cent higher than in New York, but the cost of living in Lisbon and Athens is 26 per cent lower than that of the Big Apple, said the report. The chasm is even greater in Central and Eastern Europe. Kiev, for example, was dropped 38 places amid the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. Given the slide in the Russian rouble, Moscow and St Petersburg would rank in the bottom ten under current exchange rates. Ten years ago Sydney and Melbourne were both cheaper than New York, a long-term rise in the relative cost of living in Australia, driven by the strength of the country’s dollar, has pushed them up the list. Sydney (pictured) and Melbourne have climbed the list thanks to the strength of Australia's dollar . A stronger dollar and localised inflation means New York, which jumped four places, is getting even pricier . Asia has seen a marked increase in the cost of living in the last 12 months, although Japanese cities have dropped in the ranking thanks to deflation and a devaluation of the yen. Tokyo now sits in 11th place, tied with London. In America, a stronger dollar and localised inflation means New York, which jumped four places, is getting even pricier. According to the study, the cheapest cities are found in the Asian subcontinent, Northern Africa or South America, although some are experiencing significant political or economic problems, meaning there is an element of risk.

The study compares prices in shops for more than 160 basic goods and services, including food, toiletries, clothing, domestic help, utility bills, cigarettes and wine. The report’s editor, Jon Copestake, said in a statement: ‘The situation of an unchanged top five is very rare for the worldwide cost of living survey and disguises some significant global drivers that are impacting on the cost of living everywhere. ‘In fact, a look at the data six months ago would have shown a different top five, and things are changing quickly. Rebasing the survey to today's exchange rates would put Zurich top, highlighting how fluid the global cost of living has become.'","Singapore has sky-high prices for clothes, public transport and new cars .

"This is the incredible moment a Malaysian mugger is given a taste of his own medicine. Astonishing footage has surfaced of a woman turning the tables on a bag-snatcher, riding off on his scooter after he robbed her purse in broad daylight. The CCTV vision, which was captured somewhere in Malaysia, shows the hijab-wearing woman walking down an alleyway when the mugger pulls up beside her on a moped. Scroll down for video . The hijab-wearing woman is accosted by the thief, who snatches her purse while brandishing a weapon . The mugger pounces on the woman, snatching her purse with weapon in hand and bolting away on foot. But the overhasty assailant overlooked one imperative thing: his unmanned vehicle. The quick-thinking victim swoops on the scooter, riding off as the panicking thief chases back in vain. Uploaded to Facebook this week, the clip has received over 40,000 views. Some web users have voiced their support for the act of reprisal against a widespread problem in Southeast Asia. Azlin Azhar wrote: ‘Knowing that Malaysians don’t usually carry a lot of cash, she wins!’ ‘It motivates me to learn how to ride a motorcycle’ posted Sylvia Sew . ‘Justice on the spot,’ wrote Adi Khan. The imprudent thief absconds with the bag on foot, leaving the quick-thinking victim to take off with his vehicle . Some web users have voiced their support for the act of reprisal against a widespread problem in Southeast Asia . Snatch theft is the most frequently reported crime in Malaysia, and one that’s on the rise: according to TheMalayMailOnline, the crime increased by 23.4 per cent in 2014, prompting authorities to deploy more police personnel at hotspots such as Kuala Lumpar. An apparent lack of police control has led to some victims attempting to take justice into their own hands, sometimes with tragic consequences. The theft is often committed on motorbikes, which offer thieves an escape route. But this can end fatally when victims refusing to let go of their belongings are dragged to their death. Last year, a 26-year-old woman in Slim River died after sustaining injuries to her head caused by a motorcycle riding mugger attempting to snatch her necklace.","The vision was captured somewhere in Malaysia and uploaded this week .

"An adorable video of a concerned baby crying along with his father is bound to warm the cockles of your heart. Featured in the clip, the baby named Aris initially appears quite content as he sits on his dad’s lap and listens along to him addressing the camera. His dad states: ‘I just had to get it on video so you could see that Aris is a natural sweetheart.’ So far so good: Baby Aris initially appears quite content sitting on his dad's lap, listening to him address the camera . Adding: ‘Anytime he sees me crying it makes him want to cry too.’ Getting the experiment under way, the dad mimics the sound of a cry and immediately the six-month-old baby reacts with a look of concern while shaking his head. Gazing up at his dad, Aris then proceeds to cry along with him until the pair stop in unison as if nothing ever happened. Mimicking tears, the dad influences the concerned six-month-old to cry along with him and produce actual tears . Testing his theory twice more, the dad once again turns on the taps and without fail little Aris scrunches up his face and begins bawling. Looking at his dad for reassurance, Aris momentarily settles down before crying with his dad for one last time. Shedding visible tears, Aris’ wailing becomes increasingly louder until his dad puts a halt on the proceedings and gives his son a kiss. The adorable video, which appears to have been staged at the family’s house, was filmed in Kaufman County, Texas.

"A California woman who was in New York to attend a friend's wake was critically injured when a cab hit her while she was loading her luggage into a taxi before heading to JFK to fly home. Rosemarie Mifsud, 42, became wedged between the two taxis outside 750 Seventh Avenue in Midtown Manhattan early Monday. Mifsud, who has two sons aged eight and 11, was putting luggage into the trunk of a cab in the middle lane of traffic when the second vehicle, a van, smashed into her from behind. Rosemarie Mifsud, 42, got stuck between two taxis on Seventh Avenue in Midtown Manhattan this morning . She was headed back to city of Livermore which is on the edge of the San Francisco Bay Area. Her husband, Bill Mifsud, said the taxi 'pinned her', the New York Daily News reported. He said: 'She was putting luggage in the trunk. 'So from her perspective it just came out of nowhere. 'He hit her pretty hard.' Bill plans to fly out to New York to be with Mifsud during the recovery process. The mother-of-two was critically injured after being struck 'pretty hard' said her husband Bill Mifsud (right) The Mifsuds live in Livermore, California, and have two sons together aged eight and 11 (pictured above) Mifsud, who works in software technology, was brought by ambulance to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition. She underwent extensive surgery but it seems likely there will be some permanent damage. Her legs were in really bad shape and an officer at the scene used his belt as tourniquet, the New York Post reported. Leon Mass was working at a nearby food cart and saw what happened. He said: 'The bones were sticking out of her leg. 'She was wearing jeans. 'There was a cop who wrapped the belt around her to stop the bleeding. 'She was just so calm. 'She screamed and then she was just so quiet.' The stretch of Seventh Avenue where the accident occurred (above) would have been dark early this morning . Mohamed Gendia, 34, was driving the cab that struck her. He has a clean record and has been working as a licensed driver for more than a year, according to the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). Mohamed Gendia said he didn't see Mifsud, according to DNAinfo. He told TLC investigators: 'It was dark. I braked and I slid. The brake didn't help me. 'I thought I hit the car, not her.' It is unknown if he will be charged or face any other sort of disciplinary action. A lawyer hired by the family, Brian O'Dwyer, said: 'Given the circumstances of the accident we are asking that the police department and district attorney take a very close look at pursuing charges.'","Rosemarie Mifsud was putting luggage in a cab when another taxi hit her .

"For most couples, the idea of shared interests in a middle-aged relationship are trips to the garden centre, a meal in the local pub or maybe a visit to the cinema. For Tony Williams, 58, a retired Head of Security and Debbie Dowsett, 42, a hairdresser and beautician from Hainault in Essex, their idea of a shared hobby is having affairs with other people. The couple, who have been together for the last 17 years, are both signed up to different marital affair dating websites and have relationships with several men and women, while all the while sharing a home and a life together. The couple even share their BED with their dates. Scroll down for video . Tony Williams, 58, Debbie Dowsett, 42, (pictured) have been together for 17 years but both have affairs through dating sites like Illicit Encounters . Debbie joined the website Illicit Encounters and Tony signed up to a separate site four years ago, after they decided to give an open relationship a go to spice up their own. The couple were completely open with each other from the start, taking each other’s profile pictures and recommending what to say in their information section. Since then, they have surfed each site together on a daily basis, commenting on the different men or women available. Tony told FEMAIL: ‘We go through each other's websites on the laptop together about once a day because we don't hide anything. ‘Occasionally Debbie says no to a man and I’ll ask why not, just because I'm curious about what's alright with A but not B. ‘But we don't vet. Debbie is free to choose what she likes and I'm free to choose what I like.’ Debbie is signed up to the website Illicit Encounters . From that moment on though, the way that they communicate on their individual websites is personal. In four years, they have both had several successes with the opposite sex. Tony has met up with roughly 15 women, with some extending to romances that last several months, others have been one night stands and a few have amounted to nothing at all. He said: ‘It all boils down to chemistry when you meet. Things have gone further with five or six people for me over the years. ‘I've probably met about 15 over the last four years but obviously don't seen them all long term - my longest friendship has gone on for seven months. ‘It's fairly regular, maybe once a month that you go and meet someone, or every two weeks maybe.’ Debbie has had a similar success rate with the men she has met, although she has continued to have a relationship with around six of them for roughly the last two years. She said: ‘There’s about five or six that I see on a permanent basis and one that I see every ten days or so. ‘The others I see when they can get off work, so about every couple of weeks and one of them about every four weeks. ‘They've all be around for about two years.’ Debbie and Tony on holiday as a young couple in 2001 . The couple have certain ground rules in place, like contacting the other if they are going to go home with a person for the first time, but they don’t tend to discuss the more intimate areas of each meet-up. Tony said: ‘I don't need to know what's going on - Debbie doesn't ask me the intimate details and I don't ask her the intimate details. ‘But if she's going to meet someone or I am, the other one always knows who or where and if a first date turns into an “I'm going home with them,” we always text the other person to let them know - it's a safety factor.’ It isn’t just a safety factor though, the strict rules about openness are also in place so that the trust between them never breaks down. Tony said: ‘There's one absolute golden rule - no cheating. ‘I had a wife that cheated on me and in my opinion, what breaks up the relationship isn't that you cheated but that you lied to me. I can't trust you then. ‘But at the end of the day, sex is sex. If you're not lying to me and hiding things behind my back then you're not breaking down the essential part of being a couple, which is the trust between you.’ Debbie says that she likes to meet up with men who share her interest in visiting museums . Tony and Debbie are so unfazed about the fact that each other are having intimate relationships with other members of the opposite sex, that they aren’t even bothered if one brings a date home to use their marital bed if the other is away from home. Tony said: ‘If Debbie's not at home then the woman I’m with can come back to the house, or most of the time that Debbie is there, we go back to the woman’s house, or we book into a hotel. ‘We're both happy with that. The same applies to Debbie as well, if she knows I'm not at home. ‘And we only have one bedroom, so we'd use that. ‘The way we both see it is, if you're in this particular lifestyle then there isn't that same sanctity about the bedroom and the bed that A and B have when they're married to each other and don't sleep with anyone else. 'That removes the need to worry about, “who was in my bed last night?” Or, “whose bed was he in last night if he didn't come home?”’ The couple are also open to the other one bringing a date home if they are interested in having sex with both of them. Tony said: ‘There is flexibility in that rule. ‘Occasionally things develop into threesomes, so if that's where you seem to be heading with your internet talk, then obviously the fact that the other one is at home doesn't make any difference. ‘That has happened to both of us when we’ve been on dates. ‘There's a lot more people into threesomes, foursomes or wife-swapping than you might think. ‘We’re open to threesomes or foursomes. ‘Threesomes we don't mind either way - we can have two women and me or we can have two men and Debbie, we've done both.’ Tony enjoys walks in the countryside, so often meets up with women who share this interest . But although Debbie and Tony clearly sleep with the women and men that they are dating, it is in no way just about sex. They share common interests and hobbies with the people they meet up with and their dates often revolve around these. Debbie said: ‘I go for men with the same interests as me. ‘The difference between me and Tony is I like going to museums and things, whereas if Tony's been and seen them once, he doesn't like going back and seeing them again. ‘I'm one of these people who goes back a lot - I go to the science museum as often as I can get up there. ‘The man who I see every ten days, he works in central London, so we go out there and go to the V&A museum and things like that, more cultural things.’ Tony meanwhile, is attracted to women who enjoy watching sport and who like the countryside, but also trips to the local cinema. He said: ‘One woman who used to meet once every fortnight - we went out to things like the cinema, theatre and for meals. ‘It was convenient because in that instance, her husband went away for a week every other week on business, so she had that time to do other things. ‘Her husband didn't know as far as I was aware.’ Debbie and Tony often surf the dating sites together (Picture posed by models) He continued: ‘I find that I look for someone with interests that Debbie doesn't have, like certain sports, because Debbie and I only have one sport in common - rugby union. ‘She also isn't interested in wandering in the countryside just because it's there, whereas I'm quite happy to drive to the middle of the countryside and just walk for miles. ‘I also go for women with a smaller dress size to Debbie, I mean she's not fat, don't get me wrong, she's a size 16. ‘But I'll look for a 12 or 14, different colour hair and length of hair. ‘Just so I've got something different to what I have at home, because otherwise you might as well be at home. ‘If they don't look different or have a different interests, what is the point of being there.’ While this arrangement might seem strange for some, Debbie and Tony are perfectly happy with it and both state that they don’t have feelings of jealousy when the other is out on a date. Tony said: ‘It's not that I don’t love Debbie, we have just found that it does improve our relationship - it makes you much more open with each other. ‘You're much more honest about the things you like and don't like and what you're doing. You don't keep secrets. ‘One day, when it stops working for one or the other, we won't do it anymore. ‘We always said no matter what happens, you can't end up splitting up because of it.’","Tony Williams, 58, Debbie Dowsett, 42, have affairs through dating sites .

"A heavily pregnant woman killed along with her seven-year-old son had been living with and caring for her 52-year-old father when all three were shot dead. Kris-Deann Sharpley was on maternity leave and excitedly awaiting the birth of her little girl who she’d chosen to name Amber Elizabeth Rose after her late mother when she was slain, her sister-in-law Sara Turnball told the Courier Mail. Kris-Deann’s body was found in a bathroom in her father Derek John Sharpley’s home while the body of her son Jackson was discovered tucked up in bed. Mr Sharpley’s body was found in the same bedroom and police believe he shot himself after killing his daughter and grandson. The horrific double-murder suicide has rocked the small town of Biddeston, west of Brisbane in Queensland where it took place. Kris-Deann Sharpley (left) was found dead in the bathroom while he son Jackson (right) was found in his bed . Jackson was discovered murdered while still tucked up in bed but police are not certain of how he died yet . All three bodies were found by Kris-Deann’s sister Tara on Monday evening when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs. Tara, who is also pregnant, was accompanied by her boyfriend Allan Brown and had to climb through a window to gain access to the house. Derek Jackson's body was found in the bedroom with a gunshot wound . Mr Brown told the Courier Mail that Tara screamed out: ‘They’ve been murdered, they’ve been murdered.’ The scene at Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road home was so grisly it distressed first-response police officers, according to Detective Inspector David Isherwood. 'Two of the victims, both the adult male and female, had very serious wounds to their bodies,' he said. 'Both appear to have been shot in the head.' A high-calibre weapon was found lying on a bed but police have not established how Jackson, discovered in a bedroom with Derek, died. Police have said Mr Sharpley's death is not considered suspicious but DI Isherwood stopped short of confirming the tragedy was a double murder-suicide. 'I will say that they are known to police,' he said. 'At this point in time there's nothing to suggest there was any incident that occurred in terms of a disturbance.' DI Isherwood earlier said that investigations indicate that there is no further threat to public safety. 'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' he said. 'Two people that live in the town heard three distinct gunshots,' DI Isherwood said. The gunshots were heard on Sunday night but locals presumed it was someone shotting an animal.

'There is no evidence that the house has been broken into when the police arrived they had to force entry into the premises. It would appear that the house was secure. The first person who attended the residence had to climb in to gain entry.' 'Police attended a Biddeston Southbrook Road address around 6.50pm after the bodies of a man, woman and boy were located. The three aged 52, 27 and 7 respectively, were all known to each other,' Queensland Police said. The shooting happened on the corner of Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road and Biddeston-Southbrook Road at Biddeston - more than 150 kilometres west of Brisbane. 'There are no concerns for public safety,' a police spokesman said. 'Detectives are on scene and a crime scene has been established.'

Police have described it as 'a terrible situation that has claimed the lives of a woman and her son' Local businessman Paul Farmer described the home owner as 'a quiet, friendly guy'. 'He would often come into the [my] shop and book things up like milk and bread and tobacco... but he would always pay,' he said.

"Self-esteem problems: Mohammed Emwazi was even given anger management therapy at school . Fellow secondary school pupils bullied Mohammed Emwazi - calling him ‘Little Mo’, it emerged yesterday. Emwazi - revealed last week as Jihadi John - was also said to have self-esteem problems and was even given anger management therapy at Quintin Kynaston school in north-west London. A former friend said a gang of older teenagers used to wait outside the school for Emwazi, then 14 and smaller and weaker than other boys his age. ‘They would steal his lunch money and push him around a bit,’ he said. ‘He was very quiet and a bit scrawny back then so we used to call him Little Mo.’ The St John’s Wood school is subject to a Department for Education investigation after it emerged that at least three past pupils have joined Islamist terror groups and contemporaries of Emwazi have claimed young Muslims were ‘groomed’ by radicals. Its former headmistress, Jo Shuter, said she recalled Emwazi was bullied when he was 14, but denied there had been a problem with radicalisation. She told the BBC yesterday: ‘He had some issues with being bullied, which we dealt with. Pushed around: A former friend said a gang of older teenagers used to wait outside Quintin Kynaston school (pictured) in north-west London for Emwazi, then 14 and smaller and weaker than other boys his age . ‘By the time he got into the sixth form he, to all intents and purposes, was a hard-working aspirational young man who went on to the university that he wanted. ‘There was never any sense that any of these young men as I knew them were radicalised when they were at school.’ One of Emwazi’s contemporaries at the school, Choukri Ellekhlifi, was killed in Syria after joining an Al Qaeda group and a third pupil, Mohammed Sakr, was killed in a US air strike on Al Shabaab fighters in Somalia. Emwazi’s younger brother Omar, 21, was known as a member of the ‘Muslim Mafia’ at Quintin Kynaston.

"A 10-year-old Michigan boy ran over his 9-year-old brother with a stolen car in the state's northern Lower Peninsula, authorities said. The younger boy was successfully freed and airlifted to a Flint hospital for treatment. The 9-year-old's ordeal took place after he and his older brother twice stole cars from a Village of Roscommon dealership. Investigation: A 10-year-old Michigan boy seemingly ran over his 9-year-old brother with a stolen car in the state's northern Lower Peninsula, authorities said. The two boys are believed to have used a cooler to break into a used car dealership (pictured) The Roscommon County Sheriff's Department responded at approximately 2:30am Sunday after receiving a call, Detective Sergeant John Wybraniec, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, told Daily Mail Online. The boys live with their grandparents across the street from the used car dealership, he said. Wybraniec said deputies responded to the initial break-in and saw the lights were on inside, that a northeast window had been broken, and that there was a cooler underneath it. After securing the business, deputies noticed that vehicles outside were 'askew, not in a neat line that they normally are,' Wybraniec told Daily Mail Online. The sheriff's department said in a news release that thieves swiped car keys and wreaked havoc at the dealership by driving cars and slamming them around. The boys confessed to the joyrides, according to the sheriff's department. Wybraniec told Daily Mail Online said that the boys took out a 2009 Impala and a 2012 Malibu, and that a total of six vehicles were damaged. He said that deputies collected the car keys and the Department of Human Services was contacted. Deputies received a call around 11:30am on Sunday, Wybraniec said. The two boys took the same cars out and drove along Shelley Street. One car, the 2012 Malibu, slammed into a snow bank and got stuck, he said. Wybraniec said that the 10-year-old was behind the wheel of the 2009 Impala that he seemingly drove over his brother. 'We think it's inadvertently,' he told Daily Mail Online. The boy was found underneath the car in a vacant lot next to their house. Wybraniec said that the boys' grandmother discovered the 9-year-old pinned underneath and contacted 911. Wybraniec said it didn't appear his injuries were life-threatening, but that their extent is unknown. He said that deputies do not know the motive for stealing the cars, but that it appears the pair snuck out after their grandparents went to sleep and used the cooler for the break-in. The brothers, who both have learning disabilities, spoke to police and will be interviewed this week by a Children's Assessment Center specialist, Wybraniec said. Charges are possible but unlikely, he said.

"This is the incredible moment a woodpecker was caught on camera giving a small weasel a lift on its back. The stunning photograph shows the tiny brown animal clinging to the back of the green woodpecker as it takes flight across Hornchurch Country Park in east London. Although all appears rather amicable in the incredible image, amateur photographer Martin Le-May said the small mammal had actually pounced on the bird as its next victim. Scroll down for video . The incredible photograph shows the tiny brown weasel clinging to the back of the green woodpecker as it takes flight across Hornchurch Country Park in east London. It was captured by photographer Martin Le-May, who had been enjoying a walk through the park with his wife . Although all appears rather amicable in the incredible image, Mr Le-May said the small mammal had actually pounced on the woodpecker as his next victim. However, instead of falling prey, the bird decided to take flight with the animal on its back and soared through the sky . Mr Le-May, a project manager from Essex, managed to capture the action photo during a walk with his wife Ann yesterday. He later posted the photograph on Twitter with the caption: 'Took this picture earlier today. Heard woodpecker in distress, then flew up with weasel on back.' The image has now gone viral online after thousands of users shared the 'one-in-a-million' snap on social media. The 52-year-old, who enjoys photography as a hobby, told MailOnline: 'We decided we fancied popping out yesterday afternoon and my wife has never seen a green woodpecker in the wild before and I knew of this place so we just went there for a walk. 'We had been there for about 20 minutes, and had seen some other birds, when we heard this sort of distressed squawking. 'Out of the bushes flew a woodpecker so I said to my wife: ""There's a green woodpecker"". 'It flew in front of us and we could see it through the trees. It was hopping around on the ground acting very, very strangely and still making this squawking noise. The small weasel could be seen clinging to the back of the woodpecker, with its arms wrapped around the bird's body, as it took flight . Following a tumble in the grass of the East London park, the green woodpecker managed to escape the small weasel who later ran off . 'I decided to pick my camera up to have a look and just as I picked up the camera it flew off so I just started snapping at it as it came across in front of us.' It was at that point  Mr Le-May said he noticed the small animal on the back of the bird and realised it was either a stoat or a weasel. He said: 'I said to my wife: ""It has something on its back and I think it's a stoat or weasel"". 'The bird landed about 20 metres in front of us and I said to my wife that there's a chance this weasel could eat the woodpecker. 'But as we walked towards it, I think we distracted the weasel and the woodpecker flew off back into the bushes where it had originally come from. It initially settled down on the grass but then a few seconds later it flew off into the trees. Mr Le-May, 52, (pictured) who enjoys photography as a hobby, said the response to the action photograph had been 'outstanding' and 'absolutely mind-blowing' 'We walked further up to where it had all happened and couldn't see any sign of the weasel so I assume it had ran back off into the grass, hungry.' 'It looked as good as it could have considering it had just escaped being eaten by a weasel.' Mr Le-May, who has two grown-up daughters, said he only realised how remarkable his picture was when he downloaded it from his camera onto his computer. He said he had never taken a photograph quite like the one he captured of the woodpecker and said the response had been 'absolutely mind-blowing'. He added: 'I did get quite excited, I must admit. You look at it and your first reaction is ""ooh I've taken a picture"" and then the second thought is ""I've taken a picture of a woodpecker with a weasel on its back"". It's quite outstanding. 'I think Ann was quite excited to see a woodpecker and see it in the context of being attacked by a weasel and then quite excited that my photograph has been seen by more than a million people. 'I personally think I've taken photos of better quality before, but they don't have any drama in. I've not taken anything like this before. 'For over a million people to see your work is quite mind-blowing and outstanding.' Mr Le-May  used his Canon 70D camera and his 300m f2.8L lens to take the picture and usually just takes photos of wild birds at Rainham Marshes bird reserve in Essex. He added: 'I usually go there once a week and see lots of robins, chaffinches, blue tits, grey tits, coal tits and wetland birds. 'The only weasel I had ever seen before this was when my wife were driving back from London and one ran across the road in front of us at Hackney Marshes.' Richard James, a wildlife advisor for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: 'These are an incredible set of images. 'Weasels are ferocious predators and often attack prey much larger than themselves. 'In this case the weasel appears to have targeted the woodpecker due to the fact the green woodpeckers often spend a lot of on the ground eating ants so is very susceptible to attack. 'If this had been a weaker bird I'm sure the attack would have been successful but this woodpecker was strong enough to take flight with the weasel on his back. 'It was pretty fortunate to escape. 'Green woodpeckers are relatively common but to see it in a mid-air battle like this is incredibly unusual. 'This is truly a one-in-a-million shot.' Mr James said he believed the weasel would have weighed about 190grams and been about 32cms long. Mr Le-May's image is much like the one taken by grandmother-of-four Andree Siwadi, 70, who spotted a frog clinging to the back of a goldfish in her garden pond in Winton, near Bournemouth in Dorset, in April last year. She took a photo of the incredible moment the amphibian hitched a ride from one side of the pond to the other (pictured) and said he had 'never seen anything like it before in her life' From Buzz Lightyear to the 'weasel' John Terry: Internet reacts to stunning action photo with series of hilarious memes .

"Liban Mohamed is currently in Somali custody after being named to the list of the FBI's most-wanted . A U.S. law enforcement official says a former taxi driver from northern Virginia included on the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists has been detained in Somalia. The official said 29-year-old Liban Mohamed is currently in Somali custody. He would not describe what efforts would be made to bring Mohamed to the United States for trial. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he said he is not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation. Mohamed is charged with providing material support to al-Qaeda and al-Shabab and is one of about 30 people on the terrorist list. 'Al Shabaab has claimed responsibility for many bombings in Somalia and Uganda and the 2013 attack on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya,' said Carl Ghattas, an agent in charge of the Counterterrorism Division at the time of his inclusion on the most-wanted list. The FBI believes he left the U.S. in 2012. He was placed on the list about a month ago. Mohamed was formerly a cabdriver, The Washington Post reports, and is suspected of having helped in operations in al-Shabab as well as recruiting new members. Anonymous sources told the press he was well-versed regarding potential targets in Washington. 'While living in Northern Virginia, Mohamed was a recruiter and radicalizer for al Shabaab, which historically has targeted Westerners to go to Somalia and fight for them,' Ghattas said. 'Not only did Mohamed choose to go to Somalia and fight with al Shabaab, he took a prominent role in trying to recruit people and have them train with weapons.' The former cab driver was said to have knowledge of several potential targets in Washington . He added: 'It is important for us to locate Mohamed because he has knowledge of the Washington, D.C. area’s infrastructure such as shopping areas, Metro, airports, and government buildings. This makes him an asset to his terrorist associates who might plot attacks on U.S. soil.' A $50,000 reward was put out for information leading to his capture. Attorney Gadeir Abbas has represented Mohamed's family on separate matters. He declined to comment. While the U.S. has no extradition treaty with Somalia efforts are underway to bring Mohamed back to Virginia.","29-year-old Liban Mohamed is currently in Somali custody .

"Hannah Miller (pictured) claims she was told women should 'stay at home in the kitchen' during her time working at Tonbridge School, Kent . A school lab technician claims she  was verbally abused and humiliated while working at one of the country's top boarding schools where she overheard a pupil say women should 'stay at home in the kitchen'. Hannah Miller, 38, worked as a laboratory technician in the Tonbridge School Physics Department from January 2005 to June 2014. In one instance, she said a pupil's comment that 'women shouldn't be in science, they should stay at home in the kitchen' was laughed off by another teacher. She also claims to have been left feeling isolated and was paid less than a male counterpart during her nine years in the job. The £35,000-a-year private boarding school in Kent, whose former pupils include members of the band Keane and author Frederick Forsythe, caters for 780 boys aged between 13 and 18 years. At an employment tribunal in Ashford, Kent, Miss Miller spoke of an incident on September 24, 2013. In her statement she said: 'On walking into a classroom taught by one of the physics masters I overheard the comment that ""women shouldn't be in science, they should stay at home in the kitchen"". 'I thought initially that it was the master, Dr Steven Chalk, who had said this although he told me later that it was a pupil. 'Dr Chalk tried to laugh the comment off but the class clearly enjoyed this comment which seemed to be at my expense and acted in an unruly manner. 'I felt absolutely humiliated and isolated. Dr Chalk did not appear to be disappointed in his class for their behaviour. 'The pupil was asked to apologise to me at a later date but this was not an isolated incident. Pupils would trip me up, slam doors in my face and behave in an abusive and aggressive manner toward me. 'I have been shouted at in front of pupils and told to f*** off by students. I have never witnessed this sort of behaviour toward any male member of staff.' She added in the statement that some years ago, a physics teacher stated in her presence in his classroom 'You should never have women in physics, I would never hire one'. Miss Miller added she made complaints which fell on deaf ears and was worried she was being 'over sensitive' and taking 'banter' too seriously. The technician said she felt 'insulted and bullied' by the Bursar after he declared her stress was down to her personal life and financial difficulties, which was not true. She added: 'Since leaving my job at Tonbridge School and despite my income dropping considerably I have not been suffering with stress at all and have not needed to visit the doctor or take any medication for stress. 'It is clear that my stress was caused by my work at Tonbridge School.' She claims another technician in the same role as her, Mr Matthew Newlands, received more money than her despite doing the same jobs and joining the school months after she did. But Tonbridge School said Mr Newlands was more qualified and started his job as a Qualified Technician whereas Miss Miller started as a Trainee Technician. Tonbridge School (pictured), in Kent, is one of the country's top boarding schools and commands £35,000-a-year fees . Headteacher Timothy Haynes said it was 'unfortunate' Miss Miller felt she had to resign from her position . It was also stated that Miss Miller was only working on a part-time basis, therefore receiving less money. Miss Miller received £14.50per hour and cancelled her contract on June 4 last year. Mr Newlands' salary was not heard. He stated that his relationship with Miss Miller was good and they were 'comfortable around each other in work and in social settings'. In a statement, headteacher Timothy Haynes said: 'It was unfortunate that the claimant felt she had to resign from her position and I know that the Bursar and other colleagues had been hoping to resolve the situation with her so that she could return to her role. 'Whilst I did not know her well and had not had any dealing of substance with her I was aware that she had been a valued member of the sciences team and would have been welcomed back had she not resigned.' Miss Miller is claiming sexual discrimination, constructive dismissal and equal pay. The tribunal, which is expected to last two days, continues.","Lab technician Hannah Miller says she was sexually discriminated against .

"Many wearables record your movements but one firm has developed a range designed to help you track other people. These include bands that keep tabs on your children, your elderly relatives and your pets. Each device is controlled via an app where a parent, concerned relative or pet owner can monitor and track its wearer's every move. A Chinese firm called Haier has developed a range of wearables that help you track other people. Senior bands with a leather strap have GPS technology built in so relatives can keep an eye on elderly people . The range was unveiled by Chinese tech giant Haier at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Its child and senior bands have GPS technology built-in but while the former is bright and colourful, the latter has a more classic look with a leather strap. Both are waterproof and are fitted with proximity sensors that feed location to an app where users can monitor the wearable’s movements on a map. Colourful wearables for children also track their location. They are fitted with proximity sensors that feed a child's location to an app so that parents can see their location on a map . Phone maker Doro has launched a social networking tool for seniors called Connect and Care. It connects elderly people with relatives and carers and the service can be used to call for help and assistance in an emergency. Alternatively, the firm said it can also provide help with basic everyday household tasks such as closing a window. The service is optional and comes with Doro phones, and there is an Android and iOS app for relatives to keep an eye on the user and monitor their movement and communication. It gives alerts to the family if irregularities are detected – for example loss of movement. The app will also remind them to call their relative regularly. Concerned parents and relatives can also use the app to set up safe zones, meaning if a child or elderly relative leaves a dedicated zone, the app will send them an alert. The app also stores a log of the wearable’s GPS history. Although many apps and bands track people in a similar way, Haier claims its devices differ because the microphone on each doubles up as a speaker. Similar to how a baby monitor works, the user can listen to ambient noises around the device to determine their location if there is a problem, for example. Users of the app can also talk to the wearer through the band. And for pet owners, Haier has also developed a smart collar that works in a similar way but for cats and dogs. In the future Haier said it plans to launch an SOS service that can be accessed directly from the band in the case of emergency. The company didn’t announce prices or availability for the devices. Haier has also developed a smart collar for dogs. The firm claims  its devices differ from others on the market already because the microphone on each doubles up as a speaker . The Scout5000 (pictured) - a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a dog's health, track their location and even allows owners to speak to their dogs remotely . Doting pet owners will soon be able to get a dog’s-eye-view of the world following the launch of a 'smart collar' for animals. The Scout5000 - effectively a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a canine's health, track its location and even allows owners to speak to their dog remotely. The device can also stream videos showing what pets are up to, using a state-of-the-art built-in camera. The gadget, created by Motorola and video streaming developer Hubble, uses 3G to send alerts to the owner's smartphone, while they are away from their pets. The downside is that the dog will need a data package for the collar to work, although it does come with ones year's 3G service as part of the £131 ($199) price tag.","The range was unveiled by Haier at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .

"A dementia patient has died weeks after she appeared in video footage begging for food at a scandal-hit care home. Edna Slann’s family say her health rapidly faded when she was placed at Grantley Court nursing home in Surrey. Despite a stay of just two months, she suffered an unexplained head wound, lost more than half a stone in weight and was left with a severe infection. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: In footage taken by her granddaughter, an injured Edna Slann tells of being left thirsty and starving by staff at Grantley Court nursing home just weeks before her death . The 89-year-old’s death is now the fourth linked to a care home company being investigated by police. Detectives are looking at allegations that patients suffered injuries at Grantley Court and its sister centre Merok Park in Banstead – which were forced to close after inspectors uncovered appalling conditions and shocking neglect. Surrey Police have so far made no arrests, but in the latest development officers searched a home in Cheam, Surrey, two days after Mrs Slann’s death. A spokesman said a warrant was used to enable officers to ‘gather information to ascertain the need for a criminal investigation’. Patients were moved to other homes in December following a report by the Care Quality Commission into the two centres run by millionaire owners Soondressen Cooppen and his wife Maleenee, from Cheam. Alfred Dodd, 85, died from pneumonia less than 48 hours after he was evacuated from Merok Park. The family of Jessie Collins, 91, who died this month, also believe she would still be alive had she not stayed there. Before and after: Edna Slann is pictured in the late 1990's, left, and right, in January this year . Mrs Slann was left needing stitches to the head and with severe bruising across her face while living at the home which was evacuated last year . Merok Park (above) was evacuated last year after Surrey County Council urged an investigation into standards there. It is owned by the same couple in charge of Grantley Court in Sutton, south London . Former Grantley Court resident Winnie Lake, 91, died from hypertension two weeks after she was moved out and her family blame the trauma of the sudden change. Mrs Slann featured in a heartbreaking video released by her family last month, in which she pleads to be fed. Filmed in September, she says to her granddaughter: ‘I’m hungry. Have you got anything to eat here now? I’m bloody starving. They keep you bleeding starving in here.’ The grandmother of one died at a home in Epsom on February 16 and the main cause of death was a stroke, with her foot infection and high blood pressure also believed to have had an effect. Her daughter Linda Cackett, 54, said she could have lived longer had she not been placed at Grantley Court. She said: ‘She had been left in such a weakened state by the malnutrition and the infection. She tried to rally round but she got so weak.’ Mrs Cackett, who believes Sutton Council should have inspected the home itself before sending anyone there, has now started a petition calling for an independent judge-led inquiry into Britain’s care system. She added: ‘What is effectively happening is they are putting a price on these people’s lives. ‘We have had four deaths now from this, how many more people have to die before somebody takes notice that something is desperately wrong in this care home system?’","Edna Slann was filmed begging for food at Surrey nursing home .

"The most surprising thing about New York Fashion Week this year wasn't what the models were wearing, but what they were drinking. The elixir on every fashionista's lips was bone broth, which is being sold by the cup from a hip new Manhattan shop. Aficionados claim that it is rich in amino acids - the building blocks of protein - calcium and collagen, and that drinking it will do everything from warding off illnesses to curing joint pain, and giving you healthy skin, nails and hair. And at just 86 calories per cup, it's a very slimming lunch option. It's catching on here, too - celebrity chefs Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, whose healthy cookbook The Art of Eating Well knocked Jamie Oliver and Mary Berry off the top of the Amazon charts, advocate ladlefuls of bone broth in everything from stews to scrambled eggs. Making it couldn't be easier: simply add 2-3kg of bones from any beef, lamb or chicken carcass to a pan of water with a couple of onions, leeks, carrots and celery sticks. Add a tablespoon of peppercorns, a bay leaf and a dash of cider vinegar and simmer for up to 24 hours. It may sound like old-fashioned stock, but fans claim bone broth is different because it simmers for eight hours longer, which helps break down the protein you get from the bones. But Sian Porter, spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, isn't convinced. 'Bone broth does contain nutrients, minerals and vitamins, but in pretty low quantities. You'd get far more goodness from just eating meat.' However, she says, making your own stock is 'certainly better than buying it in a cube, as you can control what goes in it'. Bone broths have traditionally been prescribed for colds, flu and digestive health, says Laura Tilt, a registered dietitian. 'The main protein in bone broth is gelatine. Gelatine supplements have been shown to improve pain and stiffness in osteoarthritis sufferers, but whether you get the same benefits from broth is unclear.' So is bone broth a magic bullet for superhuman health and supermodel looks? Probably not. But is it much better for you than a supermarket-bought stock cube? Almost certainly.","New York Fashion Week models were drinking bone broth .

"The boss of the BBC is on a collision course with MPs after he insisted the licence fee will work for at least another ten years. Last week, the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee said the £145.50-a-year charge was ‘anachronistic’ and should be scrapped within the next decade in favour of a flat-rate broadcast levy on all households. But Lord Hall, the Corporation’s director-general, insisted yesterday that the licence fee ‘has got at least another ten years in it’, adding: ‘I think it could go well beyond that.’ Not dead yet: BBC Director-general Lord Tony Hall has said he believes the licence fee ‘has got at least another ten years in it’ Even if the fee is axed, he said it should be replaced by an equivalent charge. Despite MPs painting a damning picture of the BBC – which they said had blown billions of pounds of licence fee payers’ money trying to be ‘all things to all people’ – Lord Hall was optimistic. 'I think the committee’s report should really be commended because they have raised something which says, you know what, the licence fee isn’t dead,’ he said. ‘The BBC ain’t dead. Actually, it’s got a real future.’ Auntie is watching: The BBC has unveiled plans to ask users of its news app and iPlayer catch-up service to sign up to ‘myBBC’, so it can learn about individuals’ viewing habits . MPs said last week that a blanket levy on all households – not just those with televisions – should replace the licence fee which has funded the BBC for the past 69 years. Yesterday, Lord Hall backed the proposal, but said it was simply ‘another way of the licence fee being modernised’. But he also warned that the BBC risks ‘sleepwalking into decay’ unless it reinvents itself for the internet age by collecting users’ data. Lord Hall said the Corporation is in danger of becoming ‘irrelevant’ if it does not gather information about viewers to tailor its services, in a similar way to Amazon and Netflix. His remarks came as the BBC unveiled plans to ask users of its news app and iPlayer catch-up service to sign up to ‘myBBC’, so it can learn about individuals’ viewing habits and send them recommendations for other programmes and articles.","Lord Hall believes the licence fee ‘has got at least ten years in it’

"As Prime Minister David Cameron knows he cannot please all of the people, all of the time. But he could have been forgiven for thinking he could depend on his wife's vote when asked to name her favourite David. Apparently ignoring her husband's claim to the title, Samantha confessed that Little Britain star David Walliams had won her over as the 'the funniest man she'd ever met'. David Cameron revealed he has lost out to comedian David Walliams in the battle to be Samantha Cameron's favourite David . Mr Cameron hosted a reception in Downing Street last night to mark St David's Day, the national day of Wales. He told 100 guests in Number 10 how he had been left hurt by his wife's apparent lack of loyalty. Among those attending the event were business leaders, sports stars, politicians and television personalities attended the event. They included former Paralympic athlete Baroness Tanni Grey Thompson, Songs Of Praise presenter Aled Jones, stage star Connie Fisher and Gabby Logan, whose father Terry Yorath managed and played for Wales's national football team. Mr Cameron said he was 'delighted' that staff from Welsh newspaper the Western Mail were among the guests after asking their readers to name their favourite David in a survey by Principality Building Society. 'I don't know how I'm getting on,' he said. 'All I know is that Samantha admitted to me the other day that her favourite David is David Walliams, which I thought was slightly disappointing as she's married to me. 'She sat next to him at a charity function and said he was the funniest man she'd ever met so I'm going to have to learn to live with that.' Mr Walliams and Mrs Cameron, pictured at a Burberry fashion show in 2010, also met at a charity function where he proved himself to be 'the funniest man she'd ever met' Mr Walliams has been a frequent visitor to Downing Street. In March 2012 the comic, writer and Britain's Got Talent judge posed on the steps of Number 10 with his supermodel wife Lara Stone. And in 2013 he led a UNICEF campaign with 100 schoolchildren, when he could not resist the temptation to touch the Prime Minister's hair. Mr Walliams said later: 'Because I'm taller than him, I offered to stand on a lower step so we wouldn't look odd together - he's a tall man but I'm ridiculously tall. 'He's the Prime Minister so he should be the one who is most powerful-looking. He told me not to flick my hair like my character Sebastian in, who flirted with the PM relentlessly. 'And, of course, I immediately did it. It's almost like I've got Tourette's. When I'm told not to do something, I have to do it.' When Mr Walliams met Mr Cameron in 2013 (left) he could not resit flicking his hair like his character Sebastian, an aide to the PM in Little Britain . At last night's reception Mr Cameron said he had been researching his family history and his maternal grandmother's name was Llewellyn and her grandfather was a tin plate maker from Glamorgan called Llewellyn Llewellyn. 'I think that's real Welsh heritage,' he said.","Prime Minister says that he is struggling to live with the revelation .

"The head of U.S. intelligence has warned Congress that not renewing the NSA's controversial phone snooping program will 'raise the risk' of another terror incident. James Clapper claims failing to extend part of the Patriot Act, which allows the bulk collection of telephone records, will take away a vital tool in the kit of the intelligence agency. Should Congress not renew Section 215 - due to expire on June 1 - then it must be prepared to shoulder the blame should an 'untoward incident' take place, the Director of National Intelligence added during a question and answer session in New York on Monday. Warning: Clapper told a meeting in New York that failure to renew Section 215 of the Patriot Act - which allows mass collection of phone records - would effectively raise the risk of a terrorist incident . 'In the end, Congress giveth and Congress taketh away,' Clapper told the group gathered at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'If the congress in its wisdom decides the juice is not worth the squeeze that's fine: the intelligence community will do all it can within the law to do what it can to protect the country. 'But I have to say, every time we lose another tool in our tool kit, it raises the risk. 'If that tool is taken away from us, and some untoward incident happens which could have been thwarted if we had it, I just hope that everyone involved in that decision assumes responsibility.' 'Insurance': Section 215 - revealed by Edward Snowden - has not prevented a single incident since it was brought in . Section 215 of the Patriot Act - which also allows the NSA to obtain surveillance warrants without naming the person being wiretapped, as well as allowing the surveillance of foreigners suspected of terrorist activity but not affiliated with a terrorist organisation - was one of the most controversial powers brought to light by former security contractor Edward Snowden. It has since been claimed Section 215, set up in the wake of September 11, has failed to stop one terrorist incident, leading to calls for it being reformed, or dropped altogether. Senator Patrick Leahy brought forward a bill last year, supported by Clapper, which  would have meant phone companies were in charge of keeping the records rather than the FBI or NSA. But Republicans blocked the sweeping overhaul when it came before the Senate last November. However, Clapper remains a defender of the program. 'Section 215, to me, is like my fire insurance policy,' he said on Monday. 'My house has not burned down, but every year I buy fire insurance just in case.'","Clapper said failure to renew will mean the loss of a vital 'tool' for spies .

The family of a 12-year-old girl who has undergone eight surgeries in the last 12 months to treat an aggressive bone cancer has raised over $100,000 to help get her to Germany for life changing treatment. Christina Lagogiannis, from East Bentley in Melbourne, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in January of last year. She endured more than six months of chemotherapy and a string of operations before being told that her cancer has progressed to stage four. 'The worst part is when your own child comes up to you and says: ""am I going to die, mum?"",' Christina's mother, Nayree Lagogiannis, told Daily Mail Australia.

She's not going to have any more of that poison running through her veins. 'Each time they go in they have to take out a piece of her lung, and then there's only so much of the lung they can remove and that's when they will put her on palliative care.

There is so much funding for things like breast cancer, but the smaller cancers and less common things that have also been around for many, many years - the treatment hasn't changed for more than 30 years.' It was her promise to her daughter that led Mrs Lagogiannis to research treatment options available in Germany. She came across the Medical Centre in Cologne which offers hypothermia and dendritic cell vaccinations, both of which are not available in Australia, and promises a '95 per cent chance that she would either go into full remission or 50 per cent remission,' Mrs Lagogiannis said.

"A woman whose fiancé passed away suddenly while at work has won a battle to be refunded the cost of the wedding dress she had ordered to wear during their nuptials. Fiona Mullins, 44, from Workington in Cumbria was left devastated when her factory worker boyfriend Kevin Elliott, 34, dropped dead of unknown causes in December. As Fiona was too devastated with grief to contact the various wedding companies to start cancelling her plans for the big day, her daughter Rhiannon Clark took it upon herself to call the bridal shop where the dress had been ordered. Fiona Mullins with a picture of her and her deceased fiancé Kevin Elliott . But according to Rhiannon, staff at The Wedding Warehouse in Carlisle said they were unable to refund the £1,200 deposit. Rhiannon told The Mirror: ‘They told her they could cancel the dress but the money would be held as a cancellation fee or they could carry on making it in case of a change of circumstances. ‘We could not believe what she was hearing, what was her fiancé going to do - come back from the dead?’ Rhiannon then launched an online petition to get support for the deposit to be refunded, which attracted 6,000 signatures in the first day. After the store started to receive death threats to staff, they contacted the family to say that they would be refunding the deposit in full. Rhiannon said: I’m so pleased they agreed to pay the money but the whole family are still upset this was deal with so badly.’ Bridal stores often have strict cancellation policies as many events can disrupt a wedding (picture posed by model) But the bridal store was forced to stump up the cash from their own tills though, as the designer who they had commissioned to make the dress had already started work on the garment and refused to hand back the money. Ailsa Taylor, Managing Director of The Wedding Warehouse, told MailOnline: ‘We are very sorry for her loss but we have to deal with emotional situations all the time and each situation is different. ‘We have people whose dad passes away or brides who are dying from ovarian cancer. ‘In my personal situation, I would love to give everyone their money back but I have to have a viable business to look after our existing brides, pay my staff wages at the end of the month and put a roof over my family’s head.’","Fiona Mullins, 44, from Cumbria, was engaged to marry Kevin Elliott, 34, .

"Workers in London have suffered a bigger wage squeeze since the recession than those almost anywhere else in the country, official figures have revealed. Full-time salaries in the capital have only risen by 6.9 per cent in six years since the recession, according to the Office for National Statistics. This means London workers have seen their salaries rise by just over 1 per cent a year since 2008 – way below the rate of inflation. Full-time salaries in the capital have only risen by 6.9 per cent in six years since the recession, according to the Office for National Statistics . Workers almost everywhere else in the country have seen their pay jump more quickly, with only the West Midlands and North West lagging behind. Across England as a whole, pay has jumped 7.6 per cent – with double digit wage growth in Wales, and Scotland. Pay in the North East has risen by 13.4 per cent since 2008, 8.1 per cent in the South West, 7.5 per cent in the East and East Midlands. Despite seeing their pay squeezed more than elsewhere, salaries in the capital are still far higher than anywhere else in the country. The median full-time salary in London hit £34,069 last year – up from £32,813 in 2008. In the North East, by contrast, the average worker took home £24,876 last year. The squeeze on wages in the capital has coincided with a hiring splurge and strong economic growth. Despite seeing their pay squeezed more than elsewhere, salaries in the capital are still far higher than anywhere else in the country . Wages in the North East (left) have grown almost twice as fast as those in London since the recession in 2008 . Tony Travers from the London School of Economics told the Financial Times said workers in the capital were more likely to be young, in the private sector and out of a union. He said this meat bosses found it easier to control wages while hiring more staff. Professor Travers said: 'If the story of the last five or six years has been one of flexibility in the economy, accommodating radical changes because of the recession, then you would expect that to show up in London most. 'London does have the biggest private sector economy of any region in the country, so it's likely to be the least unionised, the most flexible.' Paul Bivand, of the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion, said there had been a boom in low-paid jobs in the capital since the recession. Over the past year pay has finally started to rise above of inflation. Average earnings increased by 2.1 per cent in the year to December, 0.3 per cent up on the previous month. At the same time, inflation fell to just 0.5 per cent in December. Unemployment, meanwhile, has continued to fall down to a near seven-year low – with the jobless total dipping by 97,000 in three months to December, taking the total number of people out of work to 1.86 million. This is down by almost half a million on a year ago. The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance has also been cut – falling by 38,600 in December to 823,000, the 27th consecutive fall and the lowest since the summer of 2008. The UK now has the third lowest unemployment rate in the European Union at 5.7%, behind Austria – on 4.9 per cent – and Germany, where only 4.8 per cent are out of work, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.","Full-time salaries in the capital have only risen by 6.9% since recession .

"Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured in Downing Street today, insisted the net migration target was 'important', even though latest data shows the figure hit 300,000 last year . The Conservatives are to repeat a pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands, despite utterly failing to meet it during the last five years. Home Secretary Theresa May insisted the target was 'important', even though latest data shows the figure hit 300,000 last year - three times what David Cameron promised. The net migration target is now set to be included in the Tory manifesto for May's general election, after Mrs May and Mr Cameron rejected repeated warnings that it was a mistake. A total of 298,000 more people arrived in Britain than left in the year to September, as the numbers arriving from the rest of the EU hit a record high. Before the last election Mr Cameron pledged to cut the figure below 100,000, a promise he repeated in 2011: 'No ifs. No buts.' A record 624,000 arrived in Britain in a year, up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. At the same time, 327,000 left, a figure which has barely changed since 2010. Senior Tories including William Hague last week tried to claim the failure to meet the target was a 'problem of success' because workers from struggling European economies were flocking to booming Britain. But calls have grown for the Tories to ditch the pledge, because the government is unable to control the numbers arriving from the EU. Senior figures, including Chancellor George Osborne, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles are understood to have voiced doubts about the idea. Former home secretary Ken Clarke said globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet, while Baroness Warsi, an ex-Tory party chairwoman, said it was 'unrealistic'. Now Mrs May has signalled that she intends to include a pledge on net migration in the Conservative manifesto. 'I think we will keep the target,' she told The Times. 'It is important because it is about not just dealing with those coming into the system but also about making sure that those people who shouldn't live here actually leave.' She added: 'You will have to wait for the manifesto to see the exact words. The idea of the net migration target will still be there.' Scroll down for video . Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . Net migration from the EU hit 162,000 in the year ending September 2014, up from 130,000 in the previous year . 'We would like to see net immigration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands.' David Cameron, Jan 2010 . 'Levels of immigration can return to where they were in the 1980s and 90s. Net migration to this country will be in the order of tens of thousands each year. No ifs. No buts. That's a promise we made to the British people.' David Cameron, April 2011 . 'When we made that comment ... we were very clear that was what we wanted to do. It remains the objective towards which the Prime Minister and others are working.' Theresa May, Nov 10 . 'It is, of course, unlikely that we are going to reach the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament.' Theresa May, Nov 23 . She also sought to put pressure on other Cabinet ministers, with a warning that the impact of immigration is felt across Whitehall. Mrs May said: 'Obviously the Home Office is responsible for UK visas and immigration, the Border Force and immigration enforcement but actually immigration is an issue that touches across government departments and has a whole number of different aspects. 'It affects issues around jobs, questions of illegal working, access to housing, education, the NHS. 'It touches all government departments and I think that's the thing that's important.' Downing Street blames the increase on the number of people moving from within the EU, which the government cannot control. Ministers have argued that immigration from outside the EU has been falling as a result of tighter border restrictions. However, non-EU net migration is at its highest level since the end of December 2011. Mrs May revealed she faced a battle with officials to get them to accept that immigration could cause problems. 'There was a problem with the orthodoxy in Whitehall when we came into government in 2010,' she said. 'It was the idea that immigration by definition was good - in that automatically if you've got more people, GDP goes up. 'Of course, GDP per head doesn't necessarily go up - so they didn't look beyond that point.' Prime Minister David Cameron promised before the election to cut net immigration in the tens of thousands . Former home secretary Ken Clarke said globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet, while Baroness Warsi, an ex-Tory party chairwoman, said it was 'unrealistic' Downing Street insisted Mr Cameron's 'ambition' to reduce net migration below 100,000 remained. Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'You won't be surprised to know that he takes a different view from Ken on this one. It won't be the first time that he and Ken haven't had exactly the same views.' The spokesman said the Prime Minister's views on the need to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 had not changed since a speech in November, when he said that it remained an 'ambition', even if it was not possible to achieve it during this Parliament. When the latest figures were released last week, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today said the Tories must now 'quite rightly suffer the embarrassment' of breaking the promise. Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future think tank, said: 'If the Prime Minister remains in denial about the broken target, he is setting himself up for five more years of failure. It is already clear there is next to no chance of meeting the same target in the next Parliament either. 'It's absurd to think that anyone would believe this broken promise if it's made again. 'There is a simple political moral to this tale: careless promises cost trust.'","Home Secretary says target is 'important' despite being woefully missed .

Scarlett Johansson looked fashion forward and super cool in her Spring 2015 Preen by Thornton Bregazzi little black dress. Her take on the closet classic had a surprising twist with a beaded fringe that felt like a flapper girl's dream. The fringe detail gave the dress movement, making Scarlett's sheath seem fun and effervescent. The actress kept the focus on her bold choice of apparel by keeping the rest of her styling to a minimum. She paired her Preen dress with some simple black pumps and stayed jewelry and accessory free. Her swept back pompadour-inspired hair mimicked her youthful and effortless elegance. The overall effect was decidedly grown up and dressy, but with a laid back insouciant vibe. Scarlett's time spent living in Pairs is clearly rubbing off on her sense of style, shifting her aesthetic towards a more sophisticated, yet whimsical taste. Her Preen dress is not yet available in stores, but it will come with an equally A-list price tag. Considering what a big trend fringe was on the Spring runways, finding an alternate take on this dress should come easily.

Scarlett says it can be difficult 'trying to find time to go to the gym'. But once she's there, the 30-year-old buckles down. 'I do the same fitness routine as my big muscle-man trainer,' she says. 'A lot of it is endurance, stability and strength training. 'I like to work up a sweat. I've tried Pilates and yoga and all that, and I like to dabble in different things. But I always come back to a good old-fashioned athletic, full-body workout.' What to try: The knee drive with weights. Stand with a dumbbell or bottle of water in each hand, palms facing inwards. Make sure your feet are positioned underneath your hipbones and are facing forwards. Putting your weight on your left leg, bring your right knee up to chest level. Swing the right leg back behind the body into a lunge position, placing the foot on the floor. Then immediately drive the knee forward to chest level again. Keep the weights at your sides as you do this. Repeat 12 to 15 times before switching sides.","New mother Scarlett was showing off perfect pins recently .

"Jason Cuellar, 44, is accused of hitting a  man over the head with a bottle 'because he was black' A central Florida man faces hate crime charges after authorities say he told a man the bar they were in wasn't for blacks and hit him with a bottle. Forty-four-year-old Jason Cuellar was brought to the Volusia County Jail following the Friday night incident. Deputies say 24-year-old Kenneth Hodge was at the Hideout Lounge when Cuellar, who is white, told him 'this bar is not for blacks.' The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports Hodge ignored the comment. A Volusia County sheriff's report says Cuellar then grabbed a beer bottle and hit Hodge on the head, cutting him. The report says Hodge wrestled Cuellar to the ground but he got away. Several bar patrons tried to stop him but Cuellar allegedly used pepper spray in their eyes . Cueller managed to escape the bar at first but police caught up with him as he was riding as a passenger in a friend's car. Friend Ellis Lloyd told police he was driving Cueller home because he called him to say he had pepper sprayed multiple people at the bar. 'The aggravated battery charge was reclassified to one degree higher due to the hate crime allegation,' investigating deputies wrote in the police report.

"Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation’s borders. Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK, the Mail can reveal. Ministers hope to bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK. Tighter measures: Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation’s borders . Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade. This would disclose whether they had a clean criminal record or had committed offences. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘This power will enable us to require those applying for a visa to provide a criminal record certificate covering the last ten years – an additional tool to help stop criminals from coming to our country.’ Some 1.9million people arriving on visitor visas, or those from 56 countries and territories which do not need visas, will not need to provide their criminal histories because this would be ‘disproportionate’ in terms of time, cost and bureaucracy. The system will also exempt under-18s, asylum seekers and those people where it is not ‘reasonably practicable’.

"A convicted robber has sparked outrage after posting photos of himself on Facebook posing with fellow inmates in his jail cell. Adam Ali is just nine months into a seven year sentence for his part in a robbery on a cash-change truck at a motorway service station where the van driver was taken hostage. But last month, the 34-year-old was seen posting pictures of himself and fellow inmates from his cell at Featherstone Prison in Wolverhampton- where the use of mobile phones and social networking sites are banned. Adam Ali (pictured, centre) is just nine months into a seven year sentence for his part in a robbery on a cash-change truck at a motorway service station where the van driver was taken hostage . Jail bosses are now investigating the Facebook uploads, which were removed within hours of being made aware of the pictures. The brazen pictures show the smiling father-of-six, dressed smartly in a grey shirt, posing with his fellow convicts. Ali even made one of the images his profile picture. His posts also attracted plenty of comments from his 384 friends with one saying: 'Looks like a nice flat you got there. Is it one or two bedroom, make sure you lock the front door of a night. I've heard it's a bit rough in that area, full of criminals.' But just last month, the 34-year-old was seen posting pictures of himself and fellow inmates on Facebook (pictured) The photos were taken in his cell at Featherstone Prison in Wolverhampton- where the use of mobile phones and social networking sites are banned . But the status updates have landed the convict in deep trouble. A spokesman for the Prison Service said: 'It is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social networking sites or instruct others to do so on their behalf. 'If a prisoner breaks the rules they can be stripped of their privileges, have time added on to their sentence and may be reported to the police for further action. Facebook will close down accounts being updated by, or on behalf of, serving prisoners.' The Ministry of Justice department also confirmed it had asked Facebook to remove the pictures of the prisoner and his profile. Ali, from  Great Barr, Birmingham, was jailed last June for the robbery on the cash exchange truck. The van had been carrying £465,000 to Staffordshire's V Festival in August 2013 when Ali and his accomplices targeted the driver when he stopped at a Hopwood Service Station on the M42. Jail bosses are now investigating the Facebook uploads, which were removed within hours of being made aware of the pictures . The brazen pictures show the smiling father-of-six, dressed smartly in a grey shirt, posing with his fellow convicts . Dressed in hoods and ski masks the gang took the driver hostage, bundling him into a high-powered Audi, while Ali drove the vehicle to a field near Alvechurch, where he was due to meet his accomplices. The Government announced that phone networks could soon be compelled to block mobile phones and SIM cards being used in prisons in a proposed amendment to the Serious Crime Bill. If approved, the legislation will mean that, once a phone has been identified, the prison service will be able to apply to a court for it to be disconnected without needing to seize the phone or prove it is being used by a specific prisoner. In 2013, a total of 7,451 seizures was made of illicit mobile phones or SIM cards in prisons. Ali was jailed at Worcester Crown alongside with Leon Bell, 37, of Sheldon, and John Wall, 50, of Washwood Heath. All pleaded guilty. Bell was jailed for eight years and Wall was given seven. A fourth man, Leon Brown, 38, Hall Green, was convicted of robbery last year and jailed for 13 years. The court heard that the gang followed the low-profile cash-change truck from a depot in Oxford. Bell and Brown, wearing hoods and ski masks, grabbed the driver at the service station. Wall was to meet them in Alvechurch but was picked up by police while driving there in a van. The rest of the gang then diverted to Alvechurch railway station where the terrified cash delivery driver was forced to help empty the money from his van before being locked inside. The three were arrested after a high-speed chase involving the Audi. His brazen posts had even attracted comments from some his 384 friends who jokingly complimented Ali on his 'nice flat' Ali, from Great Barr, Birmingham, was jailed last June for the robbery on the cash exchange truck .","Adam Ali is currently serving a seven year sentence at Featherstone Prison .

"Rolling Stone Keith Richards has objected to a planned £1.5million cafe being built on a beachfront near his country mansion. The 71-year-old guitarist has lodged an objection against the new development which is near his Redlands estate where he was famously arrested with band mate Mick Jagger in 1967 in a drugs raid. Richards is opposed to the planned restaurant which is earmarked for West Wittering beach in West Sussex. Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards has lodged a planning objection against this planned restaurant . Keith Richards, right, said the planned development 'would dominate the area and degrade its character' Keith Richards, right, with band mate Mick Jagger, has objected to several developments near his home . The new restaurant is planned to replace a smaller beach cafe which burned down due to an electrical fault in October last year. However, many local residents are opposed to the new, larger development. The Rolling Stone musician has written to planning authorities to express his objection to the plan. He said: 'The second-storey restaurant overlooks and is visible from the sea and beach. It spoils the natural beauty and seclusion of the beach. It dominates the area and degrades its character. 'The restaurant threatens the environment and locals. It cannot be allowed.' Richards has objected to several other planned developments near his property, which is surrounded by its own moat. The new building would replace a cafe that was damaged by a fire caused by an electrical fault in October last year, and it has been operating from the life savers' hut since then. West Wittering Estate runs the cafe and the company are proposing the planned redevelopment. The Rolling Stones guitarist has lived in his Redlands Elizabethan mansion, pictured,  since the 1960s . Keith Richards, second right, and Mick Jagger, second left, were arrested at the mansion in 1967 . A police raid on the property, pictured, recovered cannabis resin and amphetamines . It has around 390 shareholders who purchased the land in 1952 to keep it as unspoilt and as undeveloped as possible. Peter Dawson, Mr Richards' neighbour, said he was 'gobsmacked' when he saw the plans. Shareholder Warren Tayler said he was surprised the new building had been located closer to the sea as an erosion map created by the Environment Agency showed the site 'was predicted to be eroded' by 2105. He said: 'It's an enormous development on a beach which is preserved not to have development. 'It will be visible for everybody boating or sailing and all up the Channel. Mr Tayler also said it would be 'dangerous' to have premises selling alcohol in a secluded area so close to the sea. The plans include space to sit 60 indoors and 40 outdoors in seating on a terrace which overlooks the beach. Developers want to build the new restaurant on a beach less than two miles from the musician's house . The planned beachfront restaurant is just two miles form Keith Richards' Elizabethan house . A small restaurant is planned on the upper floor during the daytime, with a self-service cafe on the ground floor, take-away windows and ice cream kiosks. Patrick Byrne, a director of the estate, said the building had been sited nearer the beach so visitors could enjoy sea views for the next 50 years, as plans had not been made for the next 100 years. He said the building's wooden exterior would help it blend into the landscape and that it would have be eco-friendly solar panels. Stephen Hammett, chairman of the estate, said: 'We believe it will provide a tasteful improvement, and it has been carefully designed to ensure the overall feel of the estate remains unspoilt and as natural as possible. 'Our aim is to provide our customers with a better service of food and drink, so that visiting West Wittering is an even better experience than before.' Following a trial in 1967, Jagger was sentenced to three months in prison for possession of amphetamines, while Richards was jailed for a year for allowing cannabis to be smoked in his home. Both sentences were overturned on appeal.","Rolling Stone Keith Richards has objected to a planned restaurant .

"Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was seen 'messing with' the security camera in his basement the day after the Odin Lloyd was killed one of his maids testified in court on Tuesday. He also exchanged text messages with the man he is charged with murdering in the hours before the killing took place according to cell phone records shown in court on Tuesday. Raymond MacDonald, a T-Mobile employee, testified that the messages from Hernandez were on the cell phone of  Lloyd, whose bullet-ridden body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, on June 17, 2013. The texts appear to have been deleted from Hernandez's phone some time after they were sent to Lloyd. Scroll down for video . A T-Mobile employee testified on Tuesday in the Aaron Hernandez trial (above) that Hernandez and the victim exchanged text messages the night he was killed . Glaucia Santos said Tuesday that she was cleaning a bathroom when she heard Hernandez enter, at which point she saw him touching the camera . Meanwhile, Glaucia Santos said Tuesday that she was cleaning a bathroom when she heard Hernandez enter, at which point she saw him touching the camera, which is located on the basement's family room ceiling. Bristol County Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg showed Lloyd's phone in Massachusetts Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts, and asked MacDonald to read text messages sent from a number identified as Hernandez's. On the night of June 16, Hernandez texted Lloyd; 'imma hit u when i'm dat way like Las time.' After midnight on June 17, Loyd texted back: 'We still on.' A few hours later, prosecutors say, Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home and drove him to the industrial park where he was later shot dead. The records also showed calls to Lloyd's phone from Wallace's number, and do not show any further calls or texts from Lloyd's phone after 3:23am on June 17. Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested for Lloyd's murder in June 2013, but was dropped him from the team hours after his arrest. Wallace and Ortiz will be tried separately. All three men have pleaded not guilty. During the testimony, Hernandez leaned over to speak with his attorney at one point . Lloyd, 27, was a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. The sister testified earlier that the men were in the early stages of a friendship and smoked marijuana together, but were not close. Defense attorneys have argued Hernandez and Lloyd were good friends, and that Hernandez would never have shot him. Defense attorneys, meanwhile, filed a motion to prevent jurors from hearing about a civil suit filed by a former friend of Hernandez, Alexander Bradley, who claimed Hernandez shot him in the face after an argument in Florida in 2013. Prosecutors want Associate Justice Susan Garsh to allow the jury to hear about that case, arguing it refutes the defense team's assertion Hernandez would not shoot a friend.","A T-Mobile employee testified on Tuesday in the Aaron Hernandez trial that Hernandez and the victim exchanged text messages the night he was killed .

"It is a powerful  connection between two mothers, captured on camera. Myleene Klass, travelling in Nepal with Save the Children, breaks down after a young Nepalese mum, Soshma, recounts the story of the tragic death of her baby son Rhythm. The emotionally-charged moment comes when the television presenter learns that baby Rhythm couldn't be saved because the cost of hospital care for the seriously ill infant was too expensive. Scroll down for video . Young Nepalese mum, Soshama, 20, (left) reduces Myleene to tears as she recounts the loss of her baby Rhythm, who died of pneumonia shortly after being born . The bereaved mother explains to Myleene how she couldn't afford the hospital care that could have saved her newborn son Rhythm's life. After his death, her father burned his body in the mountains . When Soshma, 20, asks Myleene if she has a family of her own, her thoughts clearly turn to daughters Ava, seven, and Hero, three and the star begins to weep. Many mothers in the country are forced to take expensive loans out to pay for hospital care, or like Soshma, face trying to care for desperately ill infants alone, often with tragic consequences. Myleene explains: 'Soshma gave birth at home but realised Rhythm was very unwell so she walked for hours to reach the nearest hospital. 'He had pneumonia, but in Nepal a day in hospital costs a month’s salary so after eight days Soshma had no choice but to take Rhythm home. 'A few days later, as she was breastfeeding, she looked down and realised he had gone.' Soshma's father then burned the body of the young baby in the hills, leaving Soshma to grieve. Myleene continues: 'Soshma was clearly still in shock and said this was the first time she’d really talked about it. Television star Myleene, an ambassador for Save the Children, travelled to maternity units in Nepal to raise awareness of the country's ongoing healthcare crisis . Myleene met health workers in the mountainous country; Save the Children say there is currently only one health professional to every 1,493 people in Nepal . 'Her friends and family told her to delete her photos of the baby or she wouldn’t be able to move on. But she had one tiny photo saved as the contact image next to her mum’s number. So now, every time her mum rings, Rhythm’s picture flashes up. 'As a mum myself that just broke my heart. I have so many pictures of my girls on my phone but I couldn’t bring them out and show her. I couldn’t do it.” The ambassador for the charity said of her experience travelling to the mountainous country, where there is only one health worker to every 1,493 people: 'As a mum, I know how terrifying it is to give birth, even with a trained midwife available to help. But in Nepal I heard some harrowing stories.' Myleene shot a video diary of her time at Trishuli District Hospital in Nepal and is clearly shocked by the conditions that await pregnant women in the maternity ward. She describes 'blood on the floor and blood on the walls' inside the labour rooms and compares it to her own experience of giving birth in London: 'When I think of where I gave birth, in a sterile hospital.. .sometimes you can have a water birth, you can have your baby at home...we have all of these options.' She adds: 'I met mums who had to walk on foot or were carried for up to seven hours in a wicker basket to get to a clinic because there aren't any ambulances; women who had to give birth by the side of the road without a health worker present; mothers who couldn't afford basic medical care for their children – the result was horrifying, and always the same: children dying needlessly.'

"A judge on Tuesday ordered jurors in the Jodi Arias case to keep deliberating after her lawyers said the panel had reached an impasse on whether to sentence her to death or life in prison for killing her lover in 2008. Arias, now 34, was convicted of first-degree murder in 2013 after a lengthy trial that became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with victim Travis Alexander. That jury deadlocked on her punishment. Authorities said Alexander, 30, was found dead in the shower of his Mesa home after Arias shot him in the forehead and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. On Tuesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens denied a request by Arias' attorneys for a mistrial and instead read additional jury instructions to the jury in her sentencing retrial. The jury had deliberated about 17 hours over four days. Scroll down for video . Deadlocked: A lawyer for Jodi Arias says jurors at her sentencing retrial are at an impasse over whether to sentence the convicted murderer to life in prison or death for the 2008 killing of her lover. Arias is seen here in court on February 24 . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' (pictured with defense attorney Jennifer Willmott) life during his closing arguments last Tuesday, saying she was physically and emotionally abused by Alexander . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse, though the judge and prosecutor Juan Martinez never confirmed that in open court. Jurors posed two questions to Stephens, who didn't reveal details. The judge and lawyers held closed-door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Stephens told them that she didn't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors shouldn't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors. If the current jury can't decide on a sentence, the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if Arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years. Last week, Nurmi pleaded Arias' life, saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Alexander. Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'. 'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez (pictured during closing arguments on Feb 24) displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument and called Arias a liar . If the jury reaches deadlock, the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Sherry Stephens (pictured on Feb 24) will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years . Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim. He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead. 'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.' Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed. So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation. Arias stabbed Alexander nearly 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead in an act she claimed was in self-defense. Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later. Prosecutors said Arias had planned the murder in advance because she was jealous Alexander wanted to break up with her and was planning a trip to Mexico with another woman. Arias claimed Alexander was abusive and obsessed with sex. After she was convicted of murder, Arias said during a jailhouse interview with Fox that she desired the death penalty because it was the 'ultimate freedom'. Arias was convicted of first-degree murder for the death of Alexander in 2008. She claimed she killed him in an act of self-defense, while prosecutors claimed she murdered him in a jealous rage . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later . But the trial's jury deadlocked when debating Arias ultimate fate, requiring a second sentencing phase. Arias' new trial began in October and Judge Sherry Stephens banned news organizations from live broadcasting the case. She ruled that court proceedings could only be aired after the verdict, which  can be aired live. In November, Arias pleaded for her life in front of the jury. The judge allowed her to testify in secret and sealed the testimony to the public, but transcripts were released after news organizations complained and an appeals court threw out the decision. If Arias receives the death penalty she will be only the third woman on death row in Arizona. The new jury of eight woman and four men left for the day on Wednesday without having reached a decision. If they reach deadlock the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Stephens will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.","Jury reached an impasse after 17 hours deliberation over four days .

"Pennie Davis (pictured) was stabbed to death in a bid to 'silence' her from going to police with sexual assault allegations, a court has heard . A married mother-of-five was stabbed to death in a field as she tended to her horses because the son of her former partner paid to have her 'silenced', a court heard today. Ben Carr, 22, had 'lasting hate and anger' towards Pennie Davis because she had repeatedly accused him of historical sexual offences, it was claimed. Mrs Davis, 47, who worked at a supermarket, was found dead by her husband on September 2 in a field at Leygreen Farm, Beaulieu, Hampshire. Justin Robertson, 36, of no fixed address, who denies murder and conspiracy to murder, was traced by police after he dropped a set of car keys at the murder scene, Winchester Crown Court was told. Benjamin Carr, 22, of Edward Road, Southampton, and Samantha Maclean, 28, of Beech Crescent, Hythe, are also charged with conspiracy to murder, which they deny. Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, said: 'Penelope Davis went to tend her horses in a field at a farm near Beaulieu on the edge of the New Forest. 'Whilst there and alone in a small paddock within the horse field, she was attacked and repeatedly stabbed by the defendant, Justin Robertson. 'Penelope's body was found later that same afternoon lying in the field by her husband, Peter Davis, who had left work and come to give her a hand with the horses. 'They had only been married for a matter of months.' He continued: 'The defendant, Justin Robertson, had agreed to kill Penelope Davis for money. He had agreed to kill her for the defendant Ben Carr. It was he, Ben Carr, who had the plan, Robertson and Carr carried out that plan to kill Penelope Davis with the help of their fellow defendant Samantha Maclean.' Mr Smith said Carr had wanted Mrs Davis 'silenced' because he believed she would make an allegation to police that he had indecently assaulted someone, a complaint she had previously made. He said: 'Why would Ben Carr want Penelope Davis killed? The answer to that question, which will remain at the heart of this trial, probably lies in the fact that Ben Carr believed that Mrs Davis was going to go to the police, as she had done before, and allege that he had previously indecently assaulted (someone). 'It was for that reason, principally it seems, that Ben Carr wanted Penelope Davis silenced, so he recruited others to help him.' Mr Smith said Mrs Davis knew Carr because she had been in a relationship with his father Timothy from about 2006 to 2012. He said Ben Carr had a 'lasting hate and anger' towards Mrs Davis after she made a complaint to police about the allegations of sexual assault against him when he was 14. A member of the police forensic team works at the scene of Mrs Davis' death at Leygreen Farm in the days following her death . Mr Smith said police took no further action on the complaint and added that Carr 'strenuously and consistently' denied the allegations. He said: 'The accusations left Ben Carr with a lasting sense of animosity, hatred, towards Pennie Davis. It didn't, say the Crown, wear off.' When Timothy Carr was about to marry his new love Alison Macintyre in August last year, Mrs Davis - described as a 'forthright and emotional lady' - sent messages to his new wife-to-be on Facebook at 2.20am on August 20. In it, she repeated the historical sexual allegations against Carr which she had first made back in 2006. The messages were then shown to Ben Carr and he came to learn the 'strength of feeling' Mrs Davis was expressing against him and the threat that she was to return to the police with the allegations. Mr Smith said Mrs Davis repeated the allegations against Carr in August last year after she found out that Timothy Carr was to marry his new partner, Alison Macintyre. He said Mrs Davis sent Facebook messages to Ms Macintyre saying one of the alleged victims of Carr would be making a statement to police. Mrs Davis wrote in one message: 'Good luck, you will need it,' and in another: 'I can't forgive him, all the shit he gave me, I f****** hate him and all his family.' Pennie Davis (pictured) was tending to her horses in the New Forest when she was killed, it is alleged . Mr Smith said: 'It was not just spoiling the new family that was starting with the imminent marriage, it was much more than that, she was trying to do something specifically to harm him, to throw his life in utter turmoil with the allegations that he says were falsely made against him. 'The truth of those allegations matter not a jot. When you are simply accused of something like that it touches, in the most difficult way, all parts of your life. 'Ben Carr was going potentially to be labelled. People do not look beyond the allegation - it affects your relationships, it affects your own thoughts, it affects job opportunities. The list is endless and hugely important. It goes on and on. 'Ben Carr, having said from the outset so very clearly and passionately they were not true, being falsely accused of something would have instilled in him an even greater anger and bitterness, you may think.' Mr Smith said: 'So it is that Ben Carr came to the conclusion that killing Pennie Davis was the only means by which he could bring those allegations to an end for once and for all was to have her voice silenced. 'It was not something he could do alone and he thought enough that because of his background with Pennie Davis everyone would immediately suspect him. 'He needed somebody else to plunge the knife on his behalf and that somebody would have to be close enough to him to be trusted. Police officers working at the scene where Mrs Davis body was discovered in September last year . 'That somebody was selected to be Justin Robertson.' The prosecutor said police connected Robertson to the murder scene as he dropped the keys to Maclean's car in the field which were later found by officers searching the area. Mr Smith said Robertson had a close friendship with Maclean and she would often drive him around. He added that Robertson and Carr admitted knowing each other as they had a connection through drugs. The prosecutor said Carr had promised to pay Robertson £1,500 for the killing. Mr Smith said Robertson told acquaintances that Carr had given his reason for the killing that Mrs Davis had abused him as a child. He said Robertson's reasons for agreeing to carry out the killing were 'money and a misguided sense of right and wrong'. Mr Smith said that analysis of phone records and geo-location technology showed that Robertson carried out reconnaissance missions prior to the killing which involved following Mrs Davis from her work at a Sainsbury's supermarket in her home town of Blackfield to the field near Beaulieu where she kept her horses. He said that, afterwards, the phone records showed that Robertson was in contact with Carr. Mr Smith said CCTV images which captured Mrs Davis's and Robertson's cars on September 2 showed that he followed her in a similar way to the field on the day of her death. He added that Carr provided himself with an alibi for the day of the killing but he did not account for his whereabouts when he drove past her place of work that day. The trial, in which both Carr and Robertson deny the charges, is expected to last four weeks at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) Mr Smith said: 'He wanted to be with someone, he was with a friend, went to places where there was CCTV so he would be in a position to say ""Here, have a look, I am there"". What he didn't mention was going to this specific location in his car. 'He was going to see if Pennie was there so he knew the first part of the plan was in place.' He said Mrs Davis suffered 13 stab wounds caused by 10 individual strikes which showed that her attacker had a clear intent to kill her. But during the attack, it was claimed Robertson managed to lose the keys to Maclean's Vauxhall Zafira in the field. Mr Smith said: 'Justin Robertson made a grave error. He lost the key to the car he travelled to the murder scene so he was stranded.' He said Robertson then phoned his girlfriend, Lian Doyle, who asked her friend Emily James to pick him up from close to the nearby Beaulieu Motor Museum. Robertson told police he had been in the area 'scoping out places to burgle', Mr Smith said. He later returned with a friend in a failed attempt to tow the car before returning with another friend with a tow truck who successfully recovered it for Maclean. Mr Smith said Robertson later confessed to a friend and 'justified' his actions by saying that he believed his victim was a 'nonce'. He then went to stay with friends near Salisbury before going to stay with his brother in Gloucester before he handed himself in. Maclean said in police interview that her phone, which had been used to contact Carr following the murder, had been lost and then later said she had lent it to Robertson and answered no comment to other questions. Mr Smith said that when Mrs Davis's husband found her lying in the field, he initially thought she might have been sunbathing during a 'pleasant' afternoon. He said: 'He was screaming for help and became understandably hysterically distraught. His hysteria and his distressed wailing was heard by nearby farmworkers and they came to his assistance.' Today, Mrs Davis' family - including her distraught husband and sister Nicola - watched proceedings from the public gallery. Carr, of Southampton, Hampshire, and Maclean, of Hythe, Hampshire, both deny conspiracy to murder between August 19 and September 3 last year. Robertson, of no fixed abode, denies murder and conspiracy to murder between the same dates. Security today sat between the three defendants in the dock and the trial, which is expected to last a minimum of four weeks, continues.

"It seems love might be in the air for a Scottish backpacker who managed to woo a handsome man she saw on the beach by painting him a poster that went viral. Glasgow artist Sarah Milne was relaxing at the beach in Picton - north of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island - when she spotted her mystery man 'shirtless, wearing black shorts with stars tattooed on his torso and running with a curly, bouncy and blonde dog'. She decided she had to see him again, and despite not knowing anything about him apart from how he looked, decided to create a poster which she hung next to the beach in the hope he would see it. And on Tuesday, she met the elusive gentleman, now revealed as William Chalmers, after her note went viral on social media. Scroll down for video . Love at first sight? Sarah Milne, a backpacker from Scotland, meets William Chalmers, after her note brought them together . He works at a local burger joint and the pair met for the first time on Tuesday in front of a small audience who had gathered at beach to witness the meeting. They were still on the date when they spoke to Daily Mail Australia later that night. Mr Chalmers said the date was going 'fantastically’. ‘We had a bottle of sauv blanc and sparkling pinot gris. We had a great night. Now we’re grabbing a box of cheap beers... and we’re going to have a party,' he said. When asked if there will be a second date, Mr Chalmers joked to Daily Mail Australia: 'I'm not too sure. You might have to ask me tomorrow just in case I've made an ass of myself.' He added that his and Milne's story proved the world was not such a bad place. They finally meet: Mr Chalmers met Milne just after 2pm and asked if she wanted to go somewhere quiet and have a drink . 'There's a lot of s**t in the world but there's a lot of love in the world,' he said. At 10pm local time, the couple sounded like they were still having a good time as Mr Chalmers passed his phone over to Milne who described the whole experience as 'surreal'. 'I had no idea it would go the way it has gone,' she told Daily Mail Australia. '[The date has] been going alright, we've had a few glasses of wine. 'It was overshadowed by every other person in Picton and... [this] very sweet thing it could have been has become this huge public thing. 'It was very embarrassing. I’m not someone who is used to the spotlight. Thankfully he took me away from [the attention at the meeting point].' Milne also played coy when asked if the couple would be seeing each other again. 'We haven't even finished this one because of everyone’s attention but maybe,' she said. 'We need to get over this one first. We're really struggling to find our own space.' Milne and Mr Chalmers made headlines when a hand-painted note made by the artist started doing rounds on the internet. In her note, entitled 'Is this you?', Milne  - who studied at Glasgow School of Arts before holidaying in New Zealand - invited Mr Chalmers to meet her on the same beach  on Tuesday. She said she had not been expecting the hype surrounding her handwritten note. Love note: The handmade message Milne used to launch a public appeal to find a  man after a brief encounter on Friday . With a bottle of champagne in his hand for their first meeting, Mr Chalmers walked over to where Milne was sitting and said: 'Hello, I'm William, you know you could have just asked for my number. 'Let's go somewhere and have a drink away from everyone,' he told her, as the crowd watching their date clapped and cheered. Mr Chalmers came forward on Sunday morning to reveal himself as the mystery man. On Monday, he told Daily Mail Australia he planned on heading down to the picturesque spot to ask his brunette admirer on a date for the evening. The New Zealander said he first heard of the poster when his housemate came home at 3am on Saturday night and woke him up. 'He was carrying on and telling me about a poster that two German girls had told him about that described me,' Mr Chalmers said. 'He knew it was me because I'm the only guy in Picton who has star tattoos, Johnny-Bravo hair and a labradoodle.' Mr Chalmers said he and his housemate drove down to the shore in the dark to try and find the note, and even when he saw it for himself, he had a hard time believing it was real. Milne was greeted at the picturesque meeting spot with great fanfare after their story had generated huge publicity . The Glasgow artist was greeted as she stepped off her ferry to a sign that said 'Here's to a happy ending'. The poster in question was tied to a pole down at the shorefront and was posted on Beachcomber Fun Cruises Facebook page on Saturday. 'I was sitting on the grass on Friday watching the sea... you were playing with your dog. You ran past me and smiled,' it said. 'Would you like to go for a drink/coffee/walk??? I'm in Wellington just now, my ferry arrives back in Picton on Tuesday 3rd. 'I'm in town for 1 night only... But let's see how things go... On the off-chance you are single, remember who I am and would like to meet for a drink/coffee/walk. Mr Chalmers has revealed himself as the mystery man who captured the heart of the mystery woman . He said he was looking forward to Tuesday and meeting his mystery girl . 'I'll be sitting on the grass, watching the sea from 1-1.30pm onwards on Tuesday... Maybe you'll run past again?!?' On Monday, Mr Chalmers said his mother had called him because she had been told of the sign and thought it was such a coincidence that the man described in the sign had star tattoos as well. 'When I told her that it was me, she started freaking out and telling everyone in the office,' he said. 'She's all for me going down. She told me that she didn't raise me to not show up, so that's what I'm going to do. 'It's a bit overwhelming, I've never had something like this happen before. In high school if you passed a note the teacher would just take it off you.' Mr Chalmers said while he did not know who the woman was, he remembered smiling at a particular woman that day on the beach. 'It's all a bit exciting, it's going to be a big day,' he said. The signs were posted on Beachcomber Fun Cruises Facebook page  and has sparked an online debate . 'Picton is a pretty small town and from the amount of people who have told me they're going to come down and watch what happens it sounds like everyone I know will be there.' Milne may have had some inkling of the stir the note has caused, pleading with the public to not have the sign removed from the premises. 'In the spirit of happy endings, give this sign a chance to be seen by the right eyes,' she penned. 'It may even bring a dozen or so people back on Tuesday, intrigued... who is this girl with the long brown hair and the boy with the star tattoos and the dog and will they meet for a drink? 'I will, on my return to Picton on Tuesday, remove it myself... Whatever the ending may be. Thank you!'","Glasgow artist Sarah Milne met William Chalmers for first time on Tuesday .

"The execution of the only woman on Georgia's death row , Kelly Gissendaner (pictured), was delayed because the lethal injection was 'cloudy' The execution of the only woman on Georgia's death row has been postponed at the last minute for the second time in less than a week - because the drug used in the lethal injection she was scheduled to receive was 'cloudy'. Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, was due to be given an injection of pentobarbital at a Jackson prison  at 7pm on Monday in retribution for plotting the murder of her husband in 1997. But after officials observed the drug had a 'cloudy' appearance, they postponed her death until a future, unspecified date 'out of caution', according to reports. Earlier on Monday, Gissendaner had feasted on a massive last meal of two Burger King Whoppers, two large portions of fries, cornbread, a fatty salad, popcorn and cherry-vanilla ice cream. It is the second time Gissendaner has been spared death from lethal injection. On February 25, officials postponed her execution as a winter storm was due to hit the area. It was unclear whether she received her whopping, 3.400-calorie last meal at that time. Monday's decision came as the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether or not to grant Gissendaner a stay of execution after a last-ditch appeal for clemency was denied by state officials. On Monday night, a Department of Corrections spokesman told the Gwinnett Daily Post: 'Prior to the execution the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency. 'The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits. Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the execution team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. 'The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, inmate Gissendaner’s execution has been postponed.' More than 100 protesters were gathered outside the prison where Gissendaner was  to be executed, pleading with officials to spare the mother-of-three's life. Riot police were also reportedly stationed outside the facility. Scroll down for video .

Praying: Michael Patter, senior minister at Central Congregational United Church of Christ, prays silently during a vigil for Gissendaner, who made headlines across the world with her 3,400-calorie last meal request . Murder: Gissendaner (pictured, left, in her arrest mugshot from 1997) is due to be executed for plotting the murder of her husband, Douglas. However, her boyfriend Gregory Owen (right) who carried out the deed, will be eligible for parole in eight years after accepting a life sentence and testifying against Gissendaner in trial . Gissendaner, who made headlines globally with her 3,400-calorie last meal request, would have become the first female to be executed in Georgia in 70 years if the injection had gone ahead. Her attorneys had recently launched a final attempt to persuade the state's Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute her death sentence to life without parole. They were backed by a petition, which had gained over 70,000 signatures by Monday evening, saying Gissendaner has turned her life around, even earning a theology degree behind bars. Nearly 400 clergy members, who signed the petition, had highlighted Gissendaner's acceptance of 'full responsibility' for her crime, as well as her graduation from the program for incarcerated women at the Candler School of Theology at Emory University, through which she became a teacher. However, on Monday afternoon, the board announced it was standing by its February 25 decision to deny clemency to Gissendaner, whose last meal included a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing. It said it had voted to abide by its earlier decision after 'careful consideration' of her case. The Supreme Court was still deciding whether to grant a stay of execution on Monday night. Gissendaner had been denied clemency at a hearing last week, but her lawyers had argued that extra witnesses from within the prison system could help persuade the board to change their minds. Previous attempts have rested on the inmate's remorse and new-found faith. In a statement ten years ago, Gissendaner herself said: 'I deserve to be here, but I don't deserve to die.' She has also drawn attention to the fact that, while she did not kill her husband, the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing the death penalty - and will, in fact, be eligible for parole in eight years. Indeed, although her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, stabbed her husband, Douglas, at her urging, he could be freed in just eight years after accepting a life sentence and testifying against her. Gissendaner's death via lethal injection was previously scheduled to take place last week. However, it was canceled after a 'rare'  storm caused disruption in the area, closing schools and businesses. Monster meal: Gissendaner (pictured, above, eating a regular prison meal) requested an enormous spread for her last meal, including two cheeseburger meals, two large orders of fries, cornbread, popcorn and ice cream . Locked away: Gissendaner (pictured  in 2004) has been locked up for the past 17 years after her conviction . If executed, she would have become the first woman executed in Georgia since 1945 and only the 16th put to death nationwide since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976. In their motion, Gissendaner's lawyers noted that the parole board had already heard from many people testifying about her faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency. But, her lawyers argued, the board did not hear from many Department of Corrections employees whose perspective 'would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case.' The most important witness the board did not hear from is Kathy Seabolt, who served as her warden for six years, first at Metro State Prison and then at Lee Arrendale State Prison. Seabolt could testify that former parole board chair James Donald promised Gissendaner would receive clemency, her lawyers wrote. Each time the topic came up in conversations between Donald and Seabolt, 'Donald reiterated his statement that Ms. Gissendaner did not need to worry about clemency as it was a foregone conclusion,' they wrote. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation. Although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings, the reality is less clear, Gissendaner's lawyers wrote. Some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on her behalf, but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden, who succeeded Seabolt last year. Petition: Gissendaner's attorneys were backed by a petition , which had gained more than 70,000 signatures by this evening, saying Gissendaner has turned her life around, even earning a theology degree behind bars . 'Under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside the institution. Staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed,' Kathleen Kennedy wrote on January 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial, she had been offered the same plea deal as Owen - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years. 'At one time, therefore, all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for Ms. Gissendaner,' her lawyers wrote. Owen, who is the one who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death, took the deal and testified for the prosecution. Gissendaner balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer's advice to go to trial. The parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants, her lawyers wrote. 'In fact, this Board has on at least four occasions in the past commuted a death sentence of a co-defendant who was not the actual killer of the victim,' the lawyers wrote. Douglas Gissendaner's parents and sisters wanted her to be executed, but two of Kelly and Douglas' three children asked the parole board to spare her life, the lawyers wrote. In statements submitted with their mother's clemency application, Kayla and Dakota Gissendaner described a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness. 'We also believe that Kelly's death will not restore them or make them whole,' Gissendaner's lawyers wrote of the entire Gissendaner family. Saying a prayer: On Monday evening, a Twitter user named Rachel wrote: 'Praying for #KellyGissendaner, may she find the love and mercy our broken systems could not find for her. #kellyonmymind' Angry: User Kir Alexandra questioned reports of police in riot gear being dispatched to the prison in Jackson . The petition for Gissendaner's clemency, which was launched by Jeania Ree Moore, described the inmate as a 'powerful voice for good' who has 'lived a life of purpose' since her incarceration. 'While incarcerated, she has been a pastoral presence to many, teaching, preaching and living a life of purpose,"" the document stated. 'Kelly is a living testament to the possibility of change and the power of hope. She is an extraordinary example of the rehabilitation that the corrections system aims to produce.' It urged members of the public: 'Do not let this travesty of justice happen on your watch.' On Monday evening, the hashtag #KellyOnMyMind was going viral on social media.","Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, was due to be executed  at 7pm on Monday .

"An unusual row has broken out in Thailand after a Buddhist monk was pictured fondling a topless worshipper's breasts. The image was posted on Facebook last week and has since been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people - many of whom were angry at the celibate monk breaking a key vow. But the woman in the photo has now come forward to say she was born a man, and therefore believes the monk is completely innocent. Furore: The image of a monk fondling a worshipper's breasts in Thailand was seen by hundreds of thousands of people online - and prompted a debate over whether transgender people count as women in Buddhism . She was interviewed by Thailand's Morning News, where she was quoted as saying she had undergone hormone therapy which enlarged her breasts. She had not undergone gender reassignment surgery or received breast implants. A person born in a woman's body would never have been able to get so close to a monk in Buddhist culture and would never dream of doing so, she told the news channel. According to her account the monk, from a temple in Cambodia, had led a blessing ceremony at her family home in Bangkok which involved writing messages on the bodies of the faithful. The men reportedly had the messages inscribed on their chests, while the women had the same symbols written on their foreheads. Because the worshipper considered it acceptable to present her gender as male, she was happy to join the rest of the men for the ritual. But that was not enough for many commenters online - who insisted the ritual was inappropriate no matter what the gender of the worshipper. Identified only as Thanradaporn, the worshipper said she felt guilty about the reaction the photo had, saying: 'I feel that I've damaged the monk’s reputation'. Different culture: Thailand has a tradition of kathoeys, also known as ladyboys - the definition of which varies hugely. Kathoeys are often considered a 'third gender' and are due to receive legal protection (file photo) The monk was reportedly from a temple in Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province, where he and others follow a strict doctrine in which they avoid all contact with women. Monks swear a vow of celibacy in order to learn more about themselves and come closer to enlightenment. Ideas about gender have historically been more fluid than other countries in Thailand, where there is a long tradition of kathoeys, also known as ladyboys. The broad term can describe effeminate men, those who dress as women, those who define themselves as women or those who have undergone a sex change. Kathoeys are also seen by many as a third gender, not simple enough to class simply as 'male' or 'female'. Despite being popular in cabaret shows kathoeys have very few legal rights, and Thai politicians proposed earlier this year to recognise people with alternative sexualities legally for the first time. If approved it is thought the draft constitution will ban discrimination on the basis of gender and sexuality - putting Thailand ahead of more than 30 U.S. states and much of the rest of the world.","Unusual row broke out online after blessing ceremony in Bangkok .

Jaime who represented Team GB at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, described the birth as 'the most amazing, yet surreal experience of my life, and I loved every minute.' She added: 'I felt so overwhelmed, I had heard each one cry and been able to see them it was just the best feeling ever.' Eden Rose was the first to arrive into the world at 3.53pm, weighing 3lb 8oz. She was closely followed by Amber Joy at 3.54pm, weighing in at 3lb 1oz. Then at 3.55pm Erin Aila was born, and weighed 2lb 13oz. Earlier this year Jaime, who coaches trampolining and runs a cake-making business from home, spoke of her determination to deliver all three babies. She said: 'Other people have triplets and I wasn't prepared to abort two healthy babies just to make life easier. 'My initial emotional reaction was 'I can't do that, I will keep them all and carry on with the pregnancy whatever'. 'Collectively we made the decision we would give the three babies the best opportunity we possibly could to come into the world. 'As sport has taught us both, all you need is a chance, positivity and the faith of others in your ability to be a success.' Jamie and her rugby star husband Steve (left) already have one child - two-year-old daughter Flo (right) Jaime Halsey and her rugby star husband Steve, both 35, refused to terminate two of their unborn babies despite doctors advice . Steve Halsey, a former London Welsh rugby player, and Jamie pictured on their wedding day in 2009 . Jaime was Team GB's first female trampolinist at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and after some time out recovering from injuries, she earned the team their place in the Beijing Games in 2008 and was then a reserve . Former London Welsh and Bedford Blues rugby player Steve, who is now a PE teacher also, also wrote of his delight on the couple's blog. He said: 'We would proudly like to welcome into the world our beautiful daughters, middle names Rose and Joy after our Mum's and Aila meaning 'from a strong place'. 'Now our journey really begins. 'I was allowed the opportunity to tell and show Jaime how immensely proud of her I am for growing and housing three beautiful little girls to complement our beautiful daughter Florence.' The couple had their first daughter Flo in 2012 and began trying for another baby in spring last year after the two-year-old started asking for a sister. After falling pregnant scans revealed she had two monozygotic identical twins and one 'singleton' in her womb. Consultants told them twins sharing a placenta are at risk of twin-to-twin syndrome of IUGR (Intrauterine Growth Restriction). Doctors said adding another baby into the equation has made her pregnancy particularly high-risk and even more rare and complicated. The triplets will now be transferred to Northampton General Hospital to further monitoring but should be able to return home next week.","Jaime Halsey and husband were told they were having triplets in October .

"Thought the black and blue dress was an optical illusion? It's nothing compared to these mind-boggling pictures by a Swedish photographer, artist, and Photoshop genius. Erik Johansson, 30, who is based in Berlin, Germany, says he doesn’t capture moments, but instead captures ideas. He takes mundane scenarios, including houses, cars and streets and transforms them into optical illusions, which he describes as, 'surreal ideas realised in a realistic way with a touch of humour'. Scroll down for video . Swedish photographer, artist, and Photoshop genius, Erik Johansson, has created mind-boggling photos like this inside-out house that look different on each glance. In this image called The Architect the subject seems to be both inside and outside the house . Erik, born in Gotene, Sweden, who aims to challenge and perplex the viewer, uses his artistry to confuse people who look at his work. From  cars seemingly driving upside-down on bridges to spaces that, at a glance, appear to be a bedroom and then suddenly look like a field, his work is challenging, clever and full of subtle detail. Erik explains that he wants his work to evoke a problem-solving approach. Although one photo can consist of hundreds of different images merged into one, he always wants it to look like it could have snapped by a camera. He said: 'It’s the challenge: can I put this very weird idea in a photograph and make it look like it was just captured?' In a series of behind-the-scenes videos he gives an insight into his painstaking method. To make Landfall, a work of visual trickery that looks as though green fields - rather than water - are pouring over a cliff edge, he layered  235 separate images. He photographed the fields to provide the backdrop, then built a scale model of a house and landscape out of cardboard, which he covered in gloopy green paint and shot. He takes mundane scenarios and gives them a more interesting edge by flipping them on their head, like in Landfall . In Brain Games, a man is seen pulling aside the night sky as he would a curtain to reveal the dawn and green landscape before him . Using Photoshop, he turned the running paint into rolling fields and superimposed a photograph of a house on to the cardboard model, adding a photo of a water wheel to complete the fantastical and dramatic shot of a dreamy, bucolic landscape that seems to be falling over a cliff. On his website he writes: 'I get inspiration from all things around me. Anything from things I see in my daily life to other artist’s work and photography. I think it’s a lot about looking at the world from a different perspective. 'I think I get more inspiration from paintings rather than photos. But there are tons of inspiration online. Here are some websites and blogs I visit for inspiration.' He cites Rene Magritte, Salvador Dali and MC Escher as artistic influences. Each image can anything from a few weeks to years to create. Erik says each idea starts with a sketch and if he thinks it's good enough he will start planning how to do it. This image, entitled Don't Look Back, shows a woman walking down a winding road that's crumbling behind her every step . Is it a bedroom or a field? In Closing Out, interiors and exterior meld as one in this seemingly simple tableau . In the optical illusion Cover Up, a man is hiding his real view with a better, more idealised image on wallpaper which he hangs on a line . He said: 'Once I’ve come up with an idea that I think is good enough to realise I need to find the places I need to shoot to put the photo together. This can take anywhere between a few days to several months, sometimes years. 'This is the most important step as it defines the look and feel of the photo, it’s my raw material. This step also includes problem solving, how to make the reflections, materials etc realistic.' He then sets about collecting or creating all the aspects he needs to bring his vision to life. 'The final part is putting the photos together. This takes anything from a few days to several weeks. This is actually the easiest step, if I did a good job in the first and second step. 'This part is like a puzzle, I have all the pieces, I just need to put them together.' he said. Reverse Opposite is mind-bendig as, with an MC Escher drawing, the car seems both on and under the bridge at the same time . In Erik's description of this picture, called Cutting light, he describes it as 'the strongest light bulb there is. Cutting through wood, concrete and stone in just moments' This image is called Dreamwalking and  captures the state between dream world and reality . Although one photo can consist of lots of different images merged into one, he always wants it to look like it could have been captured as a whole picture. In Helping Fall, a woman is seen hoovering leaves off the tree to help the process along .","Swedish photographer, Erik Johansson, spends months photographing images to build up to the finished picture .

"A new mum who once tipped the scales at 18 stone is feeling in a league of her own after losing eight stone to become a world championship bodybuilder. Jenny Clark, from Bournemouth, Dorset, ballooned to a size 18 when she was pregnant with her son Mason and once he was born, decided to join a gym to lose the weight. When a gym instructor told Jenny, 36, that she looked very symmetrical and should consider bodybuilding, she tried pumping iron as a way to shift the baby-weight and found she was a natural at it. Mother's love: Four-year-old Mason is Jenny Clark's biggest fan and enjoys watching her compete . Flashback: Jenny before she lost the weight (left) and displaying her winning ways . In just 18 months, the new mother lost five stone in fat and built up her impressive muscles with gruelling weight and cardio sessions. Although she came last in the first weight-lifting competition she entered, Jenny didn't give up and after a few more disappointments she started winning. She qualified her for the International Bodybuilding and Fitness Association (IBFA) British Championships last year which she won and has now gone on to win the World Championships. Now Jenny weighs 10st 9lb and her body fat is down to just nine per cent. And her son Mason, now aged four, has become her biggest fan and loves going to 'mummy's muscle shows'. Jenny shows off her bodybuilding prowess competing in the IBFA World Championships in Rome . Jenny piled on the pounds during pregnancy but began losing teh weight once she joined the gym. Jenny spends three hours a day training in the gym and is aiming to compete in the Miss Universe competition in Italy this summer. The mother-of-one said: 'I ate for three the whole time I was pregnant and I put on a lot of weight. 'I really struggled to lose the weight afterwards for about three years and I was really unhappy. 'Through exercise and diet I'd managed to lose a bit of weight. I was doing a gym class and I was the only one who turned up. 'My gym instructor must have been watching me more closely because it was just me and she said I was really symmetrical and had I ever tried bodybuilding.' Weigh to go: Mason tries lifting the weights for himself while mum Jenny trains . Young Mason loves nothing more than seeing his mother in action . Jenny, who is a tattoo artist, said her husband, Dominic, used to be a bodybuilder and encouraged her to give it a go. She said: 'We went along to a show and I decided I wanted to do it. 'In my first competition I came last out of five people in my category and I was absolutely mortified. 'I'd put in so much work and I was just gutted but I signed up for another competition two weeks later and came fourth out of five. Jenny's husband Dominic takes a closer look at his wife's bodybuilding trophy . In safe hands: Using to lifting heavy weights, Mason is as light as a feather by comparison . 'Doing that first competition I never imagined I would now be world champion. 'I like the way I look on stage. You have to learn how to pose properly so it shows your physique off to its best. 'Even when I'm not at competitions I still get a lot of positive comments about the way I look. 'I'm not as lean as I am during competitions, but I still have quite a bit of muscle definition. 'At the beach it's usually guys that comment, saying things like ""check out how big her muscles are"", I think they're probably jealous! 'I don't take anything to heart because everyone has different ideas of what's attractive.'","Binge-eating during pregnancy say the new mum tip scales at 18 stone .

"Anthea Harding, 41, was suspended from the Subway store in Harrods she worked at after she was accused of stealing because she tried to take her lunch - part of her food allowance - home . A Harrods worker was suspended after she was accused of stealing when she tried to take her half-eaten lunch home. Anthea Harding, a mother of one, has worked as a team leader at a Subway outlet in the food court in Harrods in Knightsbridge, London, for almost a year and a half. When the 41-year-old only managed a few mouthfuls of her lunch - which she gets as part of a staff allowance - because she worked through her break in the busy Subway outlet in the staff restaurant, she wrapped up the rest to take home at the end of her shift. But as Ms Harding, of Bloomsbury, tried to leave the store she was stopped by security guards who told her she was not allowed to take food off the premises, and it was considered stealing. She was suspended on February 3 and is still waiting to find out from her employer, Eurest, whether she will lose her £7.50 an hour job. 'They took all my cards away, my Harrods card, my ID store card,' Ms Harding told the Evening Standard. Ms Harding, who has worked at the Subway outlet for 14 months, said she was not aware of the company policy that free lunches must be eaten on the premises and said she was desperate to get back to work. On the day of the incident she had chosen a chicken and mushroom pie, mashed potatoes and baked beans. But after taking a couple of bites she returned to work and wrapped up the box in her apron, which she took with her as she left to go home. She added: 'I got to the ground floor and there were plain-clothes security doing checks. They said I wasn't allowed to take food out - it's considered theft and I would be contacted by the manager.' Ms Harding said she received a letter from Harrods, which explained it had been alleged she concealed a box of food in her apron. Ms Harding claims all her ID cards and Harrods cards have been taken away from her since she was accused . The mother-of-one said she is desperate to get back to her job as a team leader at the Subway outlet . It added: 'You did not declare this item and did not pay for it.' Eurest said a formal disciplinary process is currently taking place following the incident. A Harrods spokesman told MailOnline: ‘While Ms Harding has worked within the Knightsbridge store, she is employed by our contractor, Eurest, which operates Harrods’ staff restaurant. ‘We referred this matter to Eurest for their investigation, and they are handling it in line with their procedures. 'As part of our company policy, Harrods notified Ms Harding that her store approval has been removed pending this investigation.’","Anthea Harding was a team leader at Subway in Harrods, Knightsbridge .
