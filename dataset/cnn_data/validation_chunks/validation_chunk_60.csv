"A New Mexico State police officer who was fired after shooting at a minivan full of children has got his badge back. Taos Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe announced this week that Elias Montoya was one of two new deputies hired out of a pool of 17. The 12-year veteran was fired in December 2013 after an internal investigation into his use of force during an October 2013 shooting. Video footage showed Montoya firing into a van with five children, aged six to 16, inside during a chaotic traffic stop involving their mother in Taos, New Mexico. Scroll down for video . Elias Montoya fired into a van with five children, aged six to 16, inside during a chaotic traffic stop in Taos, New Mexico in 2013 while he worked for the New Mexico State Police. It was announced this week he has a new law enforcement job . The driver of the minivan, mother-of-five Oriana Farrell, of Memphis, Tennessee, faced a number of charges, including aggravated fleeing. Montoya was later offered his job back at New Mexico State Police but chose to resign instead. Hogrefe says Montoya's record remains clean and he deserved another chance. Ms Farrell, 39, spoke last September about the terrifying moment she and her children were shot at. She told GMA in September: 'I started thinking about children who have been shot, families who have been shot. I started thinking about Trayvon Martin.' The highway shootout happened after Farrell earlier had been stopped by a separate state police officer for speeding. Montoya, pictured while serving with the state police, is now a sheriff's deputy in Taos County . She said that she was unclear that the cop was giving her a ticket when he walked away from her car window and so she drove off. The cop then chased her down in his patrol vehicle and when she stopped for the second time, she refused to get out of the van. When she finally agreed, she jumped back inside as an officer attempted to restrain her. With her younger children screaming and her eldest son Zeke leaving the car to defend his mother, the officer called for back-up cars. As Farrell pulled away in terror, dramatic dash-cam video revealed the moment that Officer Elias Montoya fired three shots at the vehicle. Farrell told ABC: 'Even if I was speeding, that doesn’t require being shot at any point.' Farrell and her teenage son were arrested after police brought them to a stop. She faced charges of child abuse, fleeing and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia for marijuana pipes allegedly found in the van. Montoya said his 'heart sank' when he realized there were children inside after the shooting. The father-of-three, said that tinted windows in the van kept him from seeing the children inside. 'My heart sank when they finally stopped and I was at the passenger side at that time seeing them get out at gunpoint again,' he said. 'I couldn't believe it that there were that many children in there.' Oriana Farrell, pictured with her five children in September last year, said there was no excuse for police to open fire on her and her kids in their minivan when a routine traffic stop went awry in 2013 in New Mexico .","Elias Montoya was one of two new deputies hired out of a pool of 17 in Taos County, New Mexico .

"Mental health checks in the civil aviation industry lack the rigour needed, a former BA pilot has claimed in the wake of this week's Germanwings disaster. Alastair Rosenschein, now an aviation consultant, made the comments after it was revealed co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid an illness from his employers and crashed the plane into a mountain killing 149 people on board. 'This recent accident demonstrates that the mental health checks lack the rigour that is specifically required in a safety sensitive industry like civil aviation,' he said. Scroll down for video . Killer in the cockpit: Andreas Lubitz - pictured competing in a half-marathon in 2013 - was reportedly in the middle of a 'relationship crisis' when he crashed the Germanwings airliner into the Alps, killing himself and 149 others . German detectives were also pictured carrying computer equipment from Lubitz's family home in the small town north of Frankfurt . Potential breakthrough: German detectives carry evidence boxes from the 28-year-old's apartment on the outskirts of Dusseldorf on Thursday . Yesterday, the boss of Germanwings admitted Lubitz had slipped through the 'safety net' and should never have been flying. And today it was discovered the co-pilot hid an illness from his employers. Following a search of his Dusseldorf apartment, investigators revealed they had found torn-up sick leave notes - current ones and one issued for the day of the disaster. Lubitz locked the pilot out of the Airbus A320's cockpit before setting the plane's controls to descend into a rocky valley, French prosecutors said yesterday. He had previously been signed off from training with depression in 2008 and was reportedly receiving mental health support up until Tuesday's crash. The 28-year-old was also in the middle of the 'relationship crisis' with his girlfriend in the weeks before the crash and may have been struggling to cope with a break-up, German newspaper Bild reported. It was  claimed this morning that the couple may have previously been engaged to be married next year. Mr Rosenschein, who was previously a researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, added: 'The safety net has a very wide mesh and that mesh needs to be narrowed. 'Athough suicide among pilots is not uncommon, murder-suicide is extremely rare.' Slipped through the net: Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had suffered from depression and ‘burnout’ which had held up his career . Investigators enter Lubitz's house on the outskirts of Dusseldorf yesterday as the probe into the crash continues . In a blunt admission, Carsten Spohr, the head of Lufthansa, which owns the budget airline, admitted Lubitz had slipped through the safety net. ‘The pilot had passed all his tests, all his medical exams,’ he said. ‘He was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions. 'We have at Lufthansa, a reporting system where crew can report – without being punished – their own problems, or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment. 'All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.’ Lubitz passed one of the most rigorous assessments when he was accepted for flight training by Lufthansa, according to The Telegraph. The airline said Lubitz trained at the Lufthansa Flight Training School in Bremen. An assessment required by Germany's civil aviation authority, the DLR, plus standards imposed by Lufthansa were needed before he was accepted. However, although the process includes psychometric testing of the candidate's ability to work under pressure and handle stress, they do not examine personality or lifestyle more closely, The Telegraph reported. Lufthansa, like other airlines, does not operate a formal vetting process for aspiring pilots. Investigation:  French prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for what appears to be a case of suicide involving mass murder . Search: Teams working in the difficult Alpine terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings . Debris from the jet, operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline, was found near Barcelonnette . New information about Lubitz's life emerged just hours after police investigating the disaster began a four-hour search of his flat, which he is said to have shared with a girlfriend. Officers  found 'evidence of mental illness' but no suicide note, Der Spiegel reported. It is understood detectives have found significant material on Lubitz's computer, which they are now carefully examining for any explanation for his terrible actions. He reportedly received a year and half of psychiatric treatment and was at one point recommended to be examined by a doctor before flying. However, he passed his psychological assessments and was later considered fit to fly. Germany’s Federal Aviation Office confirmed this morning that Lubitz had a medical condition noted in his pilot’s records which required him to have a regular examination. Doctors giving pilots their regular medical checks assess their psychological soundness at the same time, according to the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority. This is done before they first fly and at regular intervals after that – once a year for under-40s and every six months for those over that age. Pilots are not made to sit detailed psychological tests, but the doctors are qualified to spot problems including signs of stress, fatigue and drug or alcohol abuse. CAA standards state: ‘During assessment of the applicant’s history, the doctor should make a general inquiry about mental health, which may include mood, sleep and alcohol use. ‘The doctor should observe the applicant during the process of the examination and assess the mental state of the applicant.’ A CAA spokesman said: ‘There is a psychological element to the pilots’ medical assessments. It forms part of the medical examination which pilots have to undergo to get their medical certificate without which they can’t fly.","Claims made after it was revealed Airbus A320 co-pilot crashed deliberately .

"A British Airways plane bound for Seattle from London Heathrow declared an emergency just 60 minutes into the flight today and was forced to turn back. As the Boeing 777 was in airspace over Scotland, the pilot reportedly found a problem with the oxygen supply in the cabin, and declared their intent to return to its airport of origin. After the plane took a detour over the Irish Sea to 'dump fuel' it returned to London safely with all 218 passengers and 14 crew unharmed. The plane bound for Seattle was snapped over Coventry during its return to London Heathrow . The plane was given priority to land at Heathrow forcing other incoming flights into a holding pattern during one of the airport's busiest periods. A spokesperson for British Airways told MailOnline Travel that the aircraft returned to Heathrow 'as a precaution due to a suspected technical problem.' 'Our pilots are highly trained to deal with these scenarios,' said the spokesperson. The plane was around an hour into the flight to Seattle when it declared an emergency over Scotland . A diversion then took place over the Irish Sea as the plane was forced to dump fuel . With regards to being forced to dump fuel, BA added: 'This is standard procedure. The aircraft has to dump fuel before landing to make sure it is not too heavy.' One Twitter user spoke of how he had picked up on his radio scanner that 'the crew were on oxygen masks while another report claimed the pilot was wearing a mask. A replacement flight is to be prepared to take off tonight at approximately 9pm, with passengers expected to arrive in Seattle about seven hour after they'd originally expected.

"Islamic State have released a shocking new video, featuring the execution of three Kurdish prisoners in Iraq. Dressed in orange boiler suits with their hands bound behind his back, the Kurdish soldiers are each marched through the ruins of a bombed out building by an ISIS fighter. All three prisoners are then beheaded in front of a large crowd of local residents, including a number of children. Scroll down for video . The slickly made video shows the graphic beheading of three Kurdish soldiers, who were captured in the Iraqi province of Nineveh. Each time the prisoners are individually shown being forced to  knees. They have all had their heads shaved and dressed in matching uniforms. The footage briefly stops to reveal the names of each prisoner,revealing their rank and background in the Peshmerga. A bearded ISIS fighter gives a speech, promising greater attacks on the Kurds if their government do not stand down in their fight against the extremist group. A variety of close up shots from different camera angles are used to show the prisoners waiting to be executed. All three prisoners were beheaded in front of a large crowd of local residents, including a number of children. Dressed in an orange boiler suits and with their hands bound behind his back, the Kurdish soldiers are each marched through the ruins of a bombed out building by an ISIS fighter. Each prisoner has had his head shaved by an ISIS militant and was forced to confess their names and rank within the Peshmerga army. A number of heavily ISIS soldiers with their faces covered in black balaclavas are shown as the camera pans away during the dreary speech. Some of the fighters appear to be standing on top of a wall, hoping to get a better view of the execution.

"Snow over the weekend shattered records to make this winter Boston's snowiest ever - but Mother Nature might not be done yet. The city awoke Monday yet again to its accustomed blanket of white - but this time it had a special significance, as the latest 2.9 inches pushed the city into unprecedented territory of 108.6 inches in one season. But, though temperatures in Massachusetts are regularly above freezing now, there could still be new flurries to take the record even higher before spring sets in. Snowy: In this  photo, a car remains buried in snow February 23, 2015 along a residential street in South Boston. Boston's miserable winter is now also its snowiest season going back to 1872 . Relentless: People use umbrellas to protect themselves from falling snow as they cross a street in Boston's North End neighborhood, Sunday, March 15, 2015 . According to the Weather Channel, Friday night could bring an extra fraction of an inch. Meanwhile predictions from AccuWeather note the chance of snow around 7am Wednesday, and a vaguer prediction of a snow/slush downfall on Saturday night. The previous record was 107.9 inches, which was set in the winter of 1995-96. The records cover more than a century, going back to 1872. Boston's official total is measured at Logan airport, by an anonymous figure who heads outside with a ruler, takes an average of four measurements and submits his totals to the National Weather Service. Celebration: The Boston branch of the National Weather Service posted this celebratory image 'congratulating' the city on months of unrelenting snow . The final 2.9 inches came in a snowstorm that was relatively tame after a record-setting monthly snowfall of 64.9 inches in February. The worst previous single month was January 2005 when 43.3 inches fell. This official winter snowfall, measured from December through February this year, was 99.4 inches. That was the snowiest for the winter period, beating 91.5 inches in 1993-94. The season snowfall record is measured from July 1 through June 30, and takes in autumn and spring. Forecasters note snow can still mount up this year. March 1993 had 38.9 inches, and March 1916 had 33. Misery: Steven Watson, a dog trainer and walker, navigates a six-strong pack of dogs over a snow-cleared path at the Boston Common . At the height of the relentless snow storms, residents of Boston were left wondering when the weather would calm down. Last month,  Boston's transport system ground to a halt as authorities struggled to cope with the bad weather. At one point, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) public transport was not running at all and had no subways or buses. Meanwhile, flights to and from Boston's Logan Airport were canceled. It's been a brutal winter for many people across the East Coast of the United States with non-stop snow storms. However, Boston's residents have begun to recover from the plummeting temperatures which fell to around zero. Matt Doody, a meteorologist at the weather service told The Boston Globe the record-breaking figures were 'pretty impressive.' Foot upon foot of unrelenting snow did little to brighten the spirits of Boston's residents - but it did have one silver lining. In the wake of blizzard season, a costumed joker who dubbed himself the Boston Yeti started cropping up around the blanketed city. And now the figure, whose @BostonYeti2015 Twitter account has amassed 8,500 followers, has received his just reward. King of winter: The so-called Boston Yeti, who was pictured around the city amidst relentless snowstorms, was jokingly made mayor on St Patrick's day . In the midst of the city's St Patrick's day parade on Sunday, mayor Marty Walsh invited the masked figure to pose in front of a City of Boston backdrop and declared him 'interim mayor'. However, Walsh did feel compelled to step in moments after the prank and clarify 'I love Boston and am here to stay'. Only kidding: Boston's actual mayor Marty Walsh, left, soon stepped in to clarify that he wasn't being replaced by a mythical figure .

"Jenny Ramage, 35, had nine organs removed in an operation dubbed the 'mother of all surgeries' after doctors discovered she was suffering a rare form of cancer . Over the course of a gruelling nine-hour operation, surgeons meticulously removed 10 organs from Jenny Ramage's cancer-ravaged body. One by one they worked to rid the then 32-year-old's abdomen of a rare and aggressive cancer invading her stomach cavity. Her right colon, spleen, gall bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes, appendix and umbilicus or belly button were removed in their entirety. Parts of her liver and diaphragm followed. The drastic operation, dubbed the 'mother of all surgeries', left Ms Ramage with a 14-inch scar running down the centre of her body - her 'survival trophy'. She repeatedly consulted doctors complaining of painful stomach cramps. And she was repeatedly dismissed, the finger pointed at period pains, bloating, appendicitis and irritable bowel syndrome. But the true diagnosis was a grave one - a rare and aggressive cancer was invading Ms Ramage's body. A doctor finally noticed a tumour on her appendix, which had burst, and covered her internal organs with jelly-like cancerous cells. Experts diagnosed the rare disease pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) - the same disease which claimed the life of Hollywood icon Audrey Hepburn. She spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics, after making a full recovery. Ms Ramage, now 35, and from Bristol, said: 'The scar doesn't really bother me - I see it as a survival trophy. 'I have been very lucky, I have made a full recovery. 'There's nothing I can't do, nothing I can't eat or drink. 'But obviously my fertility was compromised, but I still hope to have children someday with the eggs that were frozen just in time.' Ms Ramage's ordeal began in the spring of 2011 when her periods became very irregular. In late summer of that year, she became very constipated and had a constant feeling like trapped wind on her right side, around her appendix. She later discovered this was the tumour on her appendix pressing against her insides. Surgeons removed her colon, spleen, gall bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes, appendix and umbilicus or belly button as well as part of her liver, kidney and diaphragm . She spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics, after making a full recovery . She went to see a doctor several times but was given a range of different diagnosis - including trapped wind and bad digestion. 'I kept on being fobbed off and told it was IBS, they didn't really know what was wrong with me,' she said. 'One day I took myself to A&E, because I thought I might have appendicitis. 'They said it was probably just wind, and so I felt silly, as if I was a hypochondriac.' The cancer was finally discovered after a doctor noticed dozens of abnormal white spots covering her insides during a keyhole investigative test. She said: 'Then doctors thought my pains were caused by ovarian cysts, so I had scans which showed I did have cysts on my ovaries. 'But it turns out that's part and parcel of the disease. 'Then they inserted cameras into either side of my tummy to see what was in there. 'When I came around after the procedure, I saw little white spots on the pictures, all over my bladder, uterus and bowel. They were everywhere in my body. Hollywood icon Audrey Hepburn died from the rare disease in Switzerland in January 1993 . 'But after that, I didn't hear anything, so I thought it had just been the ovarian cysts, which were removed. 'I was still feeling funny and not well, but I thought it must be nothing. 'I went to the follow up appointment months later and the doctor said it was nothing, but about 30 minutes later I got a frantic call from him. 'He said nurses had been chasing me down the corridor to catch me before I left. 'He had spotted the photographs and noticed the white spots, luckily he'd seen them. 'For noticing them, I owe him my life really. It all happened very quickly after that.' Ms Ramage went under the knife at Basingstoke Hospital, one of only two hospitals in the country that specialise in treating PMP. 'They discovered when they opened me up that the extent of my disease was much greater than the CT scan had suggested - the tumour was scattered everywhere, from my diaphragm, right down to my bladder,' she said. The 35-year-old now lives a normal life. But she faces the prospect of not being able to have children, after her fallopian tubes were removed . 'They removed all the visible tumour along with the worst-affected organs including my spleen, half my large bowel, my appendix, gall bladder, ovaries and fallopian tubes, the peritoneum, a bit of my liver and they stripped the surface of my diaphragm. 'They scraped some bits of disease off my bladder and uterus. 'They then pumped a heated chemotherapy solution into my abdominal cavity to kill of any remaining microscopic cancer cells.' The organs removed in their entirety are not essential to sustain life. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare cancer, affecting around one in 500,000 people a year. It typically begins in the appendix, presenting as a small growth, known as a polyp. In more rare cases it is first detected in other parts of the bowel, the ovary or bladder. The polyp eventually spreads through the wall of the organ from where it has orginated. The disease spreads cancerous cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity - the peritoneum. The cancerous cells produce mucus, which collects in the abdomen as a jelly-like fluid called mucin. That fluid invades the abdominal cavity, causing tumours to spread. There are a number of possible origins of PMP, but the most common source is appendix cancer. There is no known underlying cause of PMP. Many patients lack clearly defined symptoms, making the disease difficult to spot until the later stages. The most common symptoms are: . Source: PMP Research Foundation . And from the critical and affected organs, the liver, kidney and diaphragm, doctors only removed what was absolutely necessary. Following the surgery, Ms Ramage underwent another radical procedure, a chemotherapy bath. This is where the stomach cavity is filled with hot chemotherapy liquid for around 90 minutes, while the patient remains under anaesthetic. Bathing the inside of the stomach with the heated chemotherapy increases the chances of the cancer cells being killed. Heat at 42°C kills cancer cells without affecting normal, healthy cells. The 35-year-old has made a full-recovery and now lives a normal life. But she faces the prospect of not being able to have children, after her fallopian tubes were removed. As a precaution she did have two sets of eggs frozen a few weeks before her life-changing surgery. Determined to help others afflicted by the rare disease, Ms Ramage has now turned her focus to raising awareness of the condition. She warned the bloating of the abdomen that is one of the symptoms caused as the tumour spreads can be mistaken for 'middle-aged spread'. 'The more people who know about PMP the more lives can be saved, the more people can be diagnosed and get treatment. It's all down to a lack of awareness,' she said. 'If I hadn't been diagnosed, it would have suffocated my organs and I would have died. It can be a slow growing cancer or it can kill quite quickly, it depends person to person.' Ms Ramage is releasing a music video which she has filmed with other PMP survivors and supporters of the condition. Her creation is a 21st-century version of Billy Joel's We Didn't Start the Fire. The video will be released on YouTube next week and her story can be followed on Twitter with the hashtag #PMPoneinamillion.

"Pay: Dr Angela Bhan is one of around 70 executives earning more than the recommended £125,000. She takes home £175,000 . NHS bosses are awarding themselves six-figure salaries far in excess of the pay they are entitled to, it emerged last night. Some 70 executives of new regional bodies earn more than the £125,000 maximum recommended by the NHS. Twenty of the bosses, including nine specialist doctors and GPs, earn more than the £142,000 paid to the Prime Minister. One took home £280,000 last year, although this included the fees of the recruitment agency that headhunted him. MPs said the huge salaries were ‘shocking and obscene’ given the increasingly tight constraints on the NHS budget. Many of the trusts these executives run are trying to save money by rationing routine procedures such as cataract surgery, hip and knee replacements and IVF. The salaries were uncovered by e-reward, an online pay research service, which analysed the pay of more than 2,500 managers at the 211 clinical commissioning groups in England. These regional health bodies replaced primary care trusts in 2013 to control local NHS budgets. E-reward said 56 per cent of the 225 top executives – chief officers and chief finance officers – were paying themselves more than that recommended by NHS England, which runs the Health Service. The approved salary range is £95,000 to £125,000 a year, depending on the size of the clinical commissioning group. The biggest was paid to Martin Sheldon, chief financial officer for Redbridge CCG in Essex, at £280,000, including the cost of his recruitment. Dr Angela Bhan, chief executive of Bromley CCG in Kent and a doctor specialising in public health, earns £175,000. To make matters worse, some of the executives received generous redundancy payoffs when primary care trusts were abolished – before walking straight into almost identical roles at CCGs weeks later. MPs said the huge salaries were ‘shocking and obscene’ given the increasingly tight constraints on the NHS budget (file image) Figures published at the weekend showed the NHS has spent £225million on the so-called revolving-door payoffs on 5,200 staff since 2013. The average was £43,000, although some received more than £500,000. Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who sits on the Commons Health Select Committee, said: ‘It is incredible that senior managers are getting paid this kind of money when the NHS is struggling for funds to meet soaring demand. ‘Not only are they raking in obscene salaries, they are also unaccountable, with no regulatory body like doctors and nurses have. Tory MP Charlotte Leslie said the salaries were 'obscene' ‘If executives think it is okay to accept this kind of pay, it suggests they either don’t understand the financial pressures on NHS finances, or they don’t care. Either way, most people will find this utterly shocking.’ Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘The NHS needs good managers, especially in an environment of perpetual change. ‘However, it is galling and disheartening for many frontline nursing staff, who have been dealing with the realities of austerity year on year, to see the disproportionate rewards being given to bosses. ‘Besides the disparity of this for hard-pressed staff enduring a pay squeeze, this is also strong evidence of the high cost of reorganising the NHS. To meet the demands on the service, NHS funds should be going to the front line, not spent on managers or restructures.’ The NHS budget is under increasing pressure from the demands of a growing and ageing population. Last year, its chief executive Simon Stevens said an extra investment of £8billion was needed over five years merely to maintain standards. Steve Glenn, head of executive remuneration research at e-reward, said bosses were paid a lot to ensure they did not take lucrative private-sector jobs. He added: ‘There is already quite a bit of activity in the labour market for CCG executives, even though it is only a couple of years since their establishment.’","One executive took home £280,000 last year - double the Prime Minister .

"Standing in front of a blue wall with beaming smiles, they appear relaxed, untroubled and happy. But these 32 men and women have been arrested on suspicion of being part of a multimillion-dollar scheme to grow massive quantities of marijuana illegally in Colorado and smuggle it out of state. The suspects, aged 25 to 71, were rounded up following an investigation that authorities have called 'Colorado's largest marijuana bust' since the drug was  legalized for medical use in November 2000. They allegedly posed as medical marijuana patient caregivers and small business owners over a four-year period while trafficking tens of thousands of pounds of pot out of state, according to 9 News.

They are believed to have netted more than a whopping $12million in total by smuggling heaps of marijuana trim, concentrate, and butane hash to Texas, Minnesota and other states, it is said. During the Denver-based inquiry, 4,600 pounds of pot, 2,000 plants and 10 pounds of hash oil were seized by police, the Houston Chronicle reported. Almost $1.5million in cash was also recovered. This month, Colorado authorities won indictments against the 32 suspects, including Tri Trong Nguyen, his wife, his three sisters and dozens of others. Each is now facing 52 felony counts. In a statement Thursday, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman said the inquiry had 'shut down one of the largest and most sophisticated criminal enterprises uncovered' since the 2000 law passage. Coffman added: 'Nguyen’s drug ring is further evidence of Colorado’s thriving black market. Illegal drug dealers are simply hiding in plain sight, attempting to use the legalized market as a cover.'

In its statement, the Attorney General's Office said: 'In an arrangement with Nguyen, marijuana was harvested, packaged, and then shipped from Boulder to Minnesota aboard Johnson’s planes.' During the ring’s operation, Nguyen controlled the illegal cultivation and distribution of marijuana at 13 warehouses throughout Denver, with the help of his wife, Kristine Root, according to police. Root, alongside Nguyan's sisters Josie Phuong Farrow, Shelia Thi Kieu Lorenz, and Oanh Tran, are accused of laundering the proceeds from the marijuana and deliberately avoiding paying taxes.

On Friday, Colorado argued in a filing to the U.S. Supreme Court that states are free to legalize marijuana following a lawsuit from neighboring states asking the court to shut down its pot law. The filing marks the first time Colorado has defended legal marijuana in writing. The federal government did not sue to block the state's 2012 vote to legalize pot for all adults over 21. Colorado said that Nebraska and Oklahoma should sue the federal government for not enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, not other states. Colorado said the states' 'quarrel is not with Colorado but with the federal government's' approach to letting states experiment with pot law. 'Nebraska and Oklahoma filed this case in an attempt to reach across their borders and selectively invalidate state laws with which they disagree,' Colorado argued. Because federal drug law bans marijuana for any purpose, including medical, Colorado argues that blocking recreational pot would also block pot for medical use in 23 states and Washington, D.C. The court has not said whether it will hear the challenge. It has no deadline for doing so. The 32 suspects' charges include violating the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act, illegal marijuana distribution, money laundering, tax evasion, and attempts to influence public servants. They are all now awaiting trial dates in Denver District Court.","32 suspects accused of being a part of multimillion-dollar drugs scheme .

"The 1,000 mile Iditarod dog sled race - widely considered the toughest contest on earth - has come to an end, with a 28-year-old musher claiming victory for the third time in the last four years. Dallas Seavey managed to beat his 55-year-old father to the finish line in Nome, Alaska, early Wednesday morning with a time of eight days, 18 hours, 13 minutes and six seconds - five hours slower than his record-setting performance last year. In reward for his win, the married father-of-one scored a check for $70,000 and a brand new Dodge SUV valued at $40,000. During the race, Seavey's dogs traveled an average of 7.6mph in temperatures as low as 50 below zero. Apparently the musher had frost in his beard when he pulled up to the finish line, with a windburned face to match. Iditarod winner: Dallas Seavey beat his 55-year-old father to the finish line in Nome, Alaska, early Wednesday morning with a time of eight days, 18 hours, 13 minutes and six seconds . Zapped by the cold: Apparently the musher had frost in his beard when he pulled up to the finish line, with a windburned face to match . An exhausted Seavey, who also won the Iditarod  in 2012 and 2014, petted and hugged his dogs after their victory. 'It takes a whole team to get any of us here,' he told reporters at a finish line ceremony, which was broadcast and live-streamed. Later, he hoisted two of his dogs onto his lap and officials draped the animals with garlands of yellow flowers. 'As long as you take care of the dog team (and) make good decisions, good things will happen. Wins are a result of doing what we love,' Seavey said, adding that he tried to keep the race fun. He said he and his father, Mitch Seavey, who won titles in 2013 and 2004, encouraged each other along the way. The elder Seavey was in second place. Coming up with the goods: In reward for his win, the married father-of-one scored a check for $70,000 and a brand new Dodge Ram truck valued at $40,000 . Team effort: The younger Seavey said he and his father, Mitch (pictured above), who won titles in 2013 and 2004, encouraged each other along the way . Pit stop: Seavey tends to his lead dogs shortly after arriving at the Koyuk, Alaska, checkpoint during the Iditarod race on Monday, March 16 . Dallas Seavey increasingly put distance between himself and the rest of the field during the latter part of the race. He held a 25-mile advantage early Tuesday - a far cry from how he won the race last year. He was running third in the 2014 Iditarod when a freak snowstorm blew the leaders out of the race, and Seavey didn't know he had won the race until a cameraman broke the news to him. The winner's purse increased this year, and the top prize was $19,600 more than what he pocketed for last year's race. 'I'm pretty tired right about now - it's been a tough race,' he said. 'The cold zaps you. The dogs, they're very lively, but it takes a lot of effort to keep them well-fed, keep them rocking and rolling. This is a hard dog team to keep up with.' Aaron Burmeister was running in third place, while Jessie Royer and Aliy Zirkle were battling for fourth. Royer and Zirkle each had attempted to become the first woman to win the race since the late Susan Butcher won her fourth title in 1990. Poor weather south of the Alaska Range this year forced the official start farther north to Fairbanks, on the northern side of the mountains. Not much snow fell south of the range, and officials said the conditions in the normally treacherous Dalzell Gorge were made even more dangerous by a lack of snow. That's the location where many mushers crashed their sleds in 2014, causing many to scratch. Dinner is served: Seavey makes food for his dogs - the canines burn thousands of calories a day on the race .

Other comptetitors: Aaron Burmeister was running in third place (pictured), while Jessie Royer and Aliy Zirkle were battling for fourth . A new race route also was created, with much of it run on river ice. The new route allowed new communities to serve as checkpoints, including the Athabascan community of Huslia, famed for its sprint sled dog races. The ceremonial start in Anchorage went on as planned on March 7. Snow had to be trucked in so mushers could navigate paved streets, but there was little snow elsewhere in the city. The snow brought in for the race barely lasted the few hours it was needed because of temperatures nearing 40 degrees and rain. A total of 78 mushers began the race March 9 in Fairbanks. Eight scratched, and one was disqualified. Two dogs have died in this year's race, including one that was hit by a car after getting loose during the ceremonial start. The other dog that died was on the team of four-time champion Lance Mackey.","Dallas Seavey beat his 55-year-old father to the finish line in Nome, Alaska, early Wednesday morning .

"Celebrities yesterday backed a charity over its funding of controversial campaign group Cage. The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust was forced to halt further donations to Cage – the organisation that came under fire after a senior figure praised Islamic State butcher Mohammed Emwazi. Its links with the 'warped' group – and six-figure donations – highlighted by the Mail, prompted outrage from Westminster and the threat of a Charity Commission inquiry. Vanessa Redgrave (right) and Joanna Lumley (left) yesterday praised the leading Quaker charity . But actresses Vanessa Redgrave, Joanna Lumley and Dame Janet Suzman yesterday praised the leading Quaker charity. The actresses said the trust has made 'vital contributions' to the Northern Ireland peace process and the transition to democracy in South Africa. They wrote that charities such as the trust frequently work in 'complex and difficult environments' to promote peace, justice and equality. Their co-signatories included Sir Christopher Bland, a former chairman of the BBC, and former Labour leader Lord Kinnock. 'At times its work has been risky or controversial, but in our experience it has always acted with the greatest integrity,' they said in a letter to The Times. The trust, along with the Roddick Foundation, was investigated by the Charity Commission over support for Cage. The trust reluctantly agreed to stop bankrolling Cage after Charity Commission officials threatened it with a statutory inquiry. Asim Qureshi, its research director, described one of the world's most wanted terrorists as a 'beautiful young man' and 'extremely gentle' Cage caused outrage over its attempts to justify the killings meted out by Kuwaiti-born Briton Emwazi, because he had claimed to have been harassed by MI5. The campaign group gave an extraordinary press briefing about Emwazi – carried live at length on the BBC and Sky – after he was identified as the man behind the mask of Jihadi John. Asim Qureshi, its research director, described one of the world's most wanted terrorists as a 'beautiful young man' and 'extremely gentle'. The 32-year-old blamed British security services for the radicalisation of Emwazi. The group has been propped up largely by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust since 2007, with grants making a combined total of £305,000.","Celebrities backed charity over its funding of controversial group Cage .

"A jury awarded Marvin Gaye's children $7.4million on Tuesday after determining singers Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams copied their father's music to create Blurred Lines, the biggest hit song of 2013. Marvin Gaye's daughter Nona Gaye wept as the verdict was being read and was hugged by her attorney, Richard Busch. The verdict could tarnish the legacy of Williams, a reliable hit-maker who has won Grammy Awards and appears on NBC's music competition show The Voice. It was previously revealed that the song had made a staggering $16million for Pharrell, Thicke, rapper T.I. and the record company, though T.I. and various record and music companies had previously been cleared of copyright infringement charges. The jury decided that the family should receive $4million in damages and $3.4 million in profits from the song, with Thicke forced to pay $1.7million from his own pocket and Pharrell $1.6million. Scroll down for videos . Robin Thicke (left) and Pharrell Williams (right) are seen leaving court last week during the trial . 'I feel free, free from...Pharrell Williams’ & Robin Thicke’s chains,' said Nona Gaye in an emotional statement outside the courtroom following the verdict . An attorney for Thicke and Pharrell has said a decision in favor of Gaye's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist's sound. All three later released a statement, saying; 'While we respect the judicial process, we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today, which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward. 'Blurred Lines’ was created from the heart and minds of Pharrell, Robin and T.I. and not taken from anyone or anywhere else. We are reviewing the decision, considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter.' 'Right now, I feel free,' an emotional Nona said after the verdict. 'Free from ... Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told.' This was no doubt in response to the fact that Pharrell and Thicke had filed a lawsuit against Gaye's estate back in August 2013 in an attempt to stop his family from suing them for copyright infringement. 'Plaintiffs, who have the utmost respect for and admiration of Marvin Gaye, Funkadelic and their musical legacies, reluctantly file this action in the face of multiple adverse claims from alleged successors in interest to those artists. Defendants continue to insist that plaintiffs' massively successful composition, 'Blurred Lines,' copies 'their' compositions,' read the suit. This suit however was thrown out in October of that year, when a judge ruled that the family had made a sufficient showing that the two songs were similar. 'We did not start this fight… Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke started this lawsuit,” Busch said outside of the courthouse. 'We fought this fight with one arm tied behind our back.' Gaye, best known for such classics as Sexual Healing, I Heard It Through the Grapevine and How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You), was tragically murdered by his father when he was just 44-years-old . Nona Gaye (second from left), daughter of late singer Marvin Gaye, and her lawyer Richard Busch (front right) speak to the media following the verdict . The Gayes' lawyer branded Pharrell and Thicke liars who went beyond trying to emulate the sound of Gaye's late-1970s music and copied the R&B legend's hit Got to Give It Up outright. He also brought up the fact after the verdict that the defense's legal team did everything they could to stop the jury from hearing Gaye's song during the proceedings, allowing them to just listen to certain snippets of the music. For this reason the infringement charge only applied to the sheet music for the two songs, making the case against Thicke and Pharrell that much more difficult for the Gaye family. Busch however pointed out during his argument that Thicke said in interviews while promoting the single that he and Pharrell were trying to write something like Gaye's Got to Give It Up. Thicke told jurors he didn't write Blurred Lines, which Pharrell testified he crafted in about an hour in mid-2012, as he was too high on painkillers and alcohol. 'The biggest hit of my career was written by somebody else, and I was jealous and wanted credit,' said Thicke. He also took time on the stand to play a variety of songs that sound similar in music and tone in an attempt to strengthen his case . Pharrell told jurors that Gaye's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth, but the seven-time Grammy winner said he didn't use any of it to create Blurred Lines and that the songs were alike in genre only. The pair's lawyer maintained their innocence even after the verdict, saying; 'They're unwavering in their absolute conviction that they wrote this song independently.' Busch, far left, walks with the late singer, Marvin Gaye's family members, from left, daughter, Nona, ex-wife, Jan, and son, Frankie . According to the Los Angeles Times, he song brought in $5.6 million for Thicke, $5.2 million for Pharrell and another $5 million to $6 million for the record company, as well as an additional $8 million in publishing revenue . Gaye's children - Nona, Frankie and Marvin Gaye III - sued the singers in 2013 and were present when the verdict was read. The family had initially asked for $40million in damages, but later lowered that number to $25million. This was based on the amount of money they believed Gaye would have been paid had he signed off on the rights to his song. Gaye's ex-wife Janis testified that as soon as she heard the song she recognized the similarities and was thrilled thinking that this would introduce the music of her late husband to a new generation of music lovers. That quickly turned to anger however when she learned the rights to Gaye's song had not been licensed. Sales of the 2013 song, which has already sold 7.3million copies in the United States alone, are still going strong too, and have seen a drastic increase over the course of the trial this past few weeks. Gaye, best known for such classics as Sexual Healing, I Heard It Through the Grapevine and How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You), was tragically murdered by his father as he tried to break up a fight between his parents and protect his mother in 1984. The singer, just 44-years-old at the time, had been nominated for 14 Grammys at that point over the course of his brilliant but all too brief career, and left the rights to all his music to his three children. An appeal of the ruling is already being considered by Pharrell and Thicke's lawyer. Tom Petty Vs. Sam Smith: Smith's monster hit Stay With Me, a song which earned him three Grammys at this year's ceremony while also contributing to his Best New Artist victory, sounded a little to similar to the Petty classic I Won't Back Down, something the latter's lawyers picked up on and took to court. The two settled the entire thing like gentlemen however, coming to an agreement out of court that gives Petty and composer Jeff Lynne a writing credit on the track and 12.5% of the royalties. The Rolling Stones Vs. The Verve: The Verve became one of the biggest bands of 1999 thanks to their hit Bittersweet Symphony, a song which sampled strings from The Rolling Stone's The Last Time. The band however was told they could only use a five-note sample, and once they song was released were accused of breaking their promise and using more. As a result, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were given writing credits for the track alongside The Verve's Richard Ashcroft, and the group had to relinquish all royalties they received for the song. Queen and David Bowie Vs. Vanilla Ice: While Vanilla Ice remains a one-hit wonder, that hit, Ice Ice Baby, still receives massive play over 20 years after it was released by the rapper. The song clearly borrowed however from the David Bowie and Queen tune Under Pressure, something the rapper initially denied. The case was eventually settled out of court, and the details of the settlement were never revealed, though it is known that Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon and Bowie all now have songwriting credits. Bright Tunes Vs. George Harrison: In the biggest copyright infringement case prior to Tuesday's ruling, Harrison was accused of using the Ronnie Mack song He's So Fine in creating his solo song My Sweet Lord. The case dragged on for five years, ultimately making its way to a United States federal court, where Harrison lost and was forced to pay $1,599,987, a staggering amount at the time. Isley Brothers Vs. Michael Bolton: Bolton used elements of the Isley Brothers song Love Is a Wonderful Thing in his song of the same name, and as a result ended up having to pay $5.4million, when the case went to court, which before Tuesday was the largest amount ever awarded in a copyright infringement case.","A jury awarded the family of Marvin Gaye $7.4million in their lawsuit against Pharrell and Robin Thicke .

"The BBC has been accused of ‘exploitation’ after it allowed an apparently drunk Charles Kennedy to take part in Question Time. The former Liberal Democrat leader, who has a history of problems with alcohol, slurred during the discussion show on Thursday and appeared to be struggling to follow the arguments of other guests on the panel. He gave confused and disjointed answers, misinterpreted comments from fellow panellists and wagged his finger. Mr Kennedy resigned as party leader in 2006 after losing the support of MPs in the wake of his public admission that he had a drink problem. Scroll down for video . Viewers criticised the BBC after Charles Kennedy gave confusing answers to some questions he was asked . The former Lib Dem leader, who is a recovering alcoholic, represented his party on the show last night . Mr Kennedy, MP for home seat of Ross, Skye and Lochaber, was on the panel last night alongside Conservative minister Anna Soubry, Labour's Lucy Powell MP, Green leader Natalie Bennett and Private Eye editor Ian Hislop for the debate filmed in Leeds. He spoke about defence spending, predicted a minority government after the election and gave his views on intelligence gathering on terror suspects. He later shared an anecdote about Jeremy Clarkson throwing a Biro at Ian Hislop, saying: 'I was there. It's true. I saw Mr Hislop give forth blood.' Asked what he thought of Clarkson's suspension, he said: 'Jeremy Clarkson, the future, this is very politically incorrect of me, but, end of Gone With The Wind, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.' It is understood Mr Kennedy agreed to appear on the programme after being approached by the BBC directly and was not put forward as a spokesman by Lib Dem HQ. A Lib Dem source said: ‘It was quite clear that he was not his usual self last night.’ Many of those watching the show took to Twitter to suggest he was a poor choice of panellist by the programme's makers. The children’s writer and poet Michael Rosen said: ‘I don’t think the BBC is safeguarding the safety of Charles Kennedy.’ Davey Stewart tweeted: 'Charles Kennedy on #bbcqt was very uncomfortable viewing. A visibly broken soul! Shame on #BBC for allowing him onto the panel #DutyOfCare' A website user called fenwench added: 'Charles Kennedy has admitted to alcoholism. It was very clear to 1000s watching tonight that his fight is ongoing. BBC should be ashamed.' And Robert Richard wrote: 'Irresponsible of the BBC to let Charles Kennedy on in that state. Hope the man finds the help, care, and peace which he needs.' John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the BBC had taken advantage of Mr Kennedy. ‘The BBC has been exploitative here,’ he added. ‘What is the duty of care of the broadcaster to the people who appear on television? Is it to exploit them? The BBC doesn’t seem to be setting out to inform people, but to entertain people. ‘My question is whether they provided booze in the green room [where TV guests sit before appearances].’ The appearance prompted concern among viewers as well as criticism of the BBC for inviting him to speak . Other Twitter users rounded of those appearing to make fun of Mr Kennedy. Former footballer Stan Collymore tweeted: 'Seeing a lot of mocking towards Charles Kennedy. A good man who needs a little help. Like many people do now and again.' And Sarah Raad added: I don't know if Charles Kennedy is drunk or not but I wish some tweeters would have some bloody humanity & stop being so spiteful. #bbcqt' Mr Kennedy became the youngest sitting member of parliament when he won the Scottish seat of Ross, Cromarty and Skye at the age of 23. He has been an MP ever since and is currently battling for re-election, though one poll has suggested he could lose his 37% majority to the SNP in the May General Election. He has recently campaigned on issues of fuel poverty and spoken in support of taxes on banks and is currently visiting schools in his constituency to encourage youngsters to take an interest in politics. Mr Kennedy was Lib Dem leader from 1999 to 2006, when a leadership contest was called after he admitted battling drink. Mr Kennedy (pictured, left, when he became the youngest sitting MP in 1983 and, right, speaking at the Lib Dem conference two years ago) is currently running for re-election . It came after he was questioned about his drinking habits by Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman in 2002. Speaking in 2006, he said: 'Over the past 18 months I've been coming to terms with and seeking to cope with a drink problem, and I've come to learn through that process that a drink problem is a serious problem indeed. 'It's serious for yourself and it's serious for those around you. I've sought professional help and I believe today that this issue is essentially resolved.' In March 2008 he was due to take part in Radio 4’s Any Questions but missed a train from London’s Euston Station, again raising questions over his health. In 2010, he split from his wife Sarah after eight years. The couple have a son together who is called Donald. Mr Kennedy's office have yet to comment on the appearance. The BBC declined to comment. A source close to the show said the green room was usually stocked with wine and beer, but that Mr Kennedy arrived late for his appearance, suggesting he might not have had time to drink. The reason for his late arrival is not known. Last Thursday was not the first time Mr Kennedy has appeared drunk on TV. A BBC source said he had a reputation for doing a good job even when the worse for wear, although this was not in evidence on Question Time. Charles Kennedy: 'Did I miss something here? Did the Defence Secretary say that it was a terrible mistake that the House of Commons did not vote to invade Syria?' Anna Soubry: 'No I didn't say that. I said it was a terrible mistake that we didn't keep our options open.' David Dimbleby: 'What about the issue raised in the question of committing to a real terms increase in defence spending?' Charles Kennedy: 'I'm sorry?' David Dimbleby: 'What about the issue of committing to a real terms increase in defence spending?' Charles Kennedy: 'I'm committed to two per cent.' Asked about a potential coalition between Labout and the SNP... Charles Kennedy: 'Do you know folks I don't know where to begin. I'm speaking as a Scot. Erm, the er, and I've heard an awful lot of claptrap in the last few minutes, it has to be said. The question was would the Labour Party go into... what were the words exactly?' After Ian Hislop told how Jeremy Clarkson threw a pen at him... Charles Kennedy: 'I was there. It's a true story, I saw Mr Hislop give forth blood.' David Dimbleby: 'Charles Kennedy, in or out for Clarkson?' Charles Kennedy: 'In or out? Jeremy Clarkson, the future, this is very politically incorrect of me, but, end of Gone With The Wind, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.'","Scottish MP gives disjointed answers to questions posed in TV debate .

"An unlicenced cosmetic surgeon accused of performing a botched black-market cosmetic procedure that resulted in the death of a woman in Dallas has surrendered to the police. Denise Rochelle 'Wewe' Ross, 43, was arrested on Wednesday for practicing medicine without a license. Her bond was set at $50,000. Ross was booked into the Dallas County jail but online jail records Thursday show she has been released. Warrants were issued for Ross and alleged accomplice Alicia 'Jimmy Joe' Clarke, 31, after the body of Wykesha Reid, 34, was found on a massage table at the Deep Ellum salon on February 19. Denise Rochelle 'Wewe' Ross, 43, was arrested on Wednesday for practicing medicine without a license. Her bond was set at $50,000 . Following the arrest of Ross (left), police are still searching for Jimmy Joe Clarke - also known as 'Alicia' - (right) who is also linked to Wykesha Reid's botched butt injection . Reid was found with her pants partially pulled down and a blood-stained gauze on her butt. Patricia Kelley, 70, who had raised Reid since she was a baby, said the victim had always 'wanted a big booty.' The nursing home staffer had already gone to the salon three times for the injections without experiencing any problems before she decided to go back a fourth time. 'Your butt's getting too big,' Kelley recalled telling her. 'But she got hooked on them booty shots,' she told the Dallas News. Reid's fourth visit took place on February 18 and police found her body inside the business at 7am the next morning. The building had been cleaned out and her purse and cellphone were missing. Police believe the victim suffered a medical emergency while having injections in her buttocks. Wykesha Reid, 34, was found dead on a massage table at the Deep Ellum salon in Dallas on February 19, with her pants partially pulled down and a blood-stained gauze on her butt . Reid's body was found by Clarke at 7.50 a.m. and the dead woman's daughter, Keira, told police that her mother had booked a session to have 'butt injections' and that a woman who goes by the name of 'WeWe' and a transgender person were going to carry out the procedure. Clarke told police that she had no idea how Reid had died. She claims that Reid arrived at the business on February 18 complaining that she 'was not well and wanted to lay down', so she locked her in the building overnight and discovered her body when she returned in the morning. The Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office reported that it found injection marks and a silicone-type substance on Reid's buttocks, according to Wfaa.com. Reid's family are calling for the pair to be brought to justice. 'I want to see them on trial for murder,' said Keaira Reid, 20. 'I'm very mad because anybody could have called 911.' Wykesha Reid had always 'wanted a big booty' and the nursing home staffer had already gone to the salon three times for the injections without experiencing any problems before she decided to go back a fourth time . The death follows a complaint to police by a 27-year-old woman who said that she visited the salon on February 9 and paid $520 to have buttock injections, but ended up screaming in agony when 'unknown' substances were used on her. The holes were then closed with superglue, she said. She later identified Ross and Clarke as the people who carried out the operation. Neither is registered with the Texas Medical Board. Dallas County court records show Clarke has convictions for prostitution, lewd public conduct and possession of cocaine. Ross has previous convictions for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, assault, possession of drugs and theft.","Denise 'Wewe' Ross, 43, was arrested Wednesday for practicing medicine without a license .

"Parents who publicly revealed they were traumatised when they were handed the wrong baby by maternity ward nurses after their son was born, have been slammed on social media. Samantha Stuhlener gave birth to baby Levi at St Vincent's Private Hospital in the inner city Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy in January, but was handed another child to hold before nurses noticed the mix-up 45 minutes later. She and husband Chris revealed her story to Seven News on Tuesday night, but social media has since been flooded with comments accusing Mrs Stuhlener of overreacting. While some commenters have sided with the upset parents of the young boy - who have complained they have struggled to bond with their son who they say is often unsettled - others had harsh words for Mrs Stuhlener. Scroll down for video . Levi was born on January 6 this year to proud parents Samantha and Nick Stuhlener at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Fitzroy . His mother, Samantha Stuhlener, has had trouble bonding with her cherished baby after a mix up at the hospital which saw her mistakenly spend 45 minutes with someone else's child . 'Nurses are overworked and underpaid. It was an honest accident. Get over it,' wrote one woman. 'He was unsettled for 7 weeks after birth?! Oh my! That sounds... LIKE A NEWBORN', another posted. Others told the parents they should 'get some perspective' and mentioned those who were not so fortunate as to have a healthy child. 'While this shouldn't happen and is far from ideal, I don't think it is the end of the world. The babies weren't harmed and weren't left alone. Sad for the mum, yes. I would choose this over my son being still born any day,' one posted. Commenters have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the situation . Many posts have criticised the reaction of the parents . One woman wrote that while it was a bad thing that happened, other situations could be worse . 'Last week all we heard about was a young couple losing their 4 week old bub to whooping cough. THAT is traumatic. This is not. It happens more than you realise. Perhaps the reason the child was not settling is because the mother wasn't focussing on him, instead of focussing on what she didn't have - a measly 45 minutes. Get a little perspective', another wrote. 'I just think of all the poor mums who have to wait a week or more to hold their babies because they were born too early or are sick,' one more posted. However some commenters were more sympathetic towards the Stuhlener's, agreeing that the first moments with a child are precious, and they were robbed of sharing those with Levi. Some have asked the parents to be grateful for the fact they have a healthy happy child . Quite a few posts related to the fact that the Stuhlener family were lucky to have a well little boy . But others were much more sympathetic to the experience of the new parents . 'Some of the comments on here are heartless... this is a once in a lifetime precious moment. She can't get that back now. That first moment you get to bond with your child is magical, nothing comes close,' one viewer wrote. On Tuesday the Stuhlener family told their story, revealing that the proud parents were horrified to discover that they spent 45 minutes with another couple's baby, after a nurse mistakenly brought another child to them from the 'settling room'. 'I said what's happened, what's going on?' Ms Stuhlener told 7News. 'And she said, you didn't have Levi, you had somebody else's baby.' The two babies had been together in the overnight settling room at St Vincent's Private Hospital . The error happened despite both infants wearing the correct identification wristbands in the settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross-check the tags and mistakenly brought Mr and Mrs Stuhlener someone else's child. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff. 'It is extremely regrettable and our staff and myself feel gutted by the incident. We unreservedly apologise and take full responsibility for the incident,' he told 7News. He emphasised that throughout the stay the babies were only touched, fed and changed by their parents. 'While both babies had correct identification name tags attached at all times and both babies remained in their correctly named cots at all times, the staff member did not disturb the parents and check their name bands,' Mr Grisold said. Both children were wearing the correct ID wrist bands in the overnight settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross check the wristbands and mistakenly brought the Stuhleners someone else's child . 'The second baby remained in the night nursery. 'When it was realised by staff that there was a baby in the incorrect room, the still sleeping baby was instantly removed from that room and returned to its parents. 'At no time was either baby picked up, held or fed by anyone other than their parents.' The hospital has told the distraught parents that Levi remained in the settling room during the 45 minutes period that they were with another infant. However, the Stuhleners are demanding the truth. 'I don't believe that,' Ms Stuhlener told 7News, unable to hold back tears. 'I don't know, was he (Levi) with another mother?' They have become suspicious as St Vincent's Hospital staff allegedly refuse to show the couple the incident report, which details where their baby was throughout the incident. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff . 'That's all we've wanted, to actually see what's written in the incident report and what actually happened,' said Mr Stuhlener. To make matters worse, the hospital's attempt to apologise resulted in another embarrassing mix-up. Mr and Mrs Stuhlener received a letter of apology and $500 worth of vouchers to try and make up for the error. However, the hospital sent them the wrong letter. They received a package addressed to the other couple involved in the mishap – the parents of the infant they mistakenly had in their care for 45 minutes. 'I acknowledge that we made an administration error in sending the wrong correspondence to the wrong family,' Mr Griswold confirmed. The Stuhleners claim to have been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised' The Stuhleners say they've been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised'. The couple insists the incident has had repercussions on their family. Ms Stuhlener says she has had more difficulty bonding with Levi than she did with her firstborn. Their son, now almost three months old, was 'unsettled' for the first several weeks of his life and did not take to breastfeeding. St Vincent's Private Hospital have changed their procedures to try ensure the error is not repeated. Two staff members are now required to cross check both the mother and baby's name tags when moving babies to and from the settling room.","The Stuhleners were handed the wrong baby in a maternity ward mix-up .

"A New York elementary school principal has come under fire from parents after banning her teachers from assigning their pupils any homework. According to local news site DNAinfo, Jane Hsu, who is the principal at P.S. 116 in Kips Bay, Manhattan, sent a letter home to the parents of all Pre-K through fifth grade students informing them that the school's teachers would no longer be assigning work for the children to do outside of school hours. She suggested that her students' time would be better spent focusing on other, more enjoyable, activities such as playing video games, watching TV or spending time outside. Scroll down for video . Putting her foot down: P.S. 116 principal Jane Hsu (left), pictured with assistant principal Gary Shevell, has banned homework for pupils at her school . 'The topic of homework has received a lot of attention lately, and the negative effects of homework have been well established,' Ms Hsu explained to parents in the letter. 'They include: children's frustration and exhaustion, lack of time for other activities and family time and, sadly for many, loss of interest in learning.' Ms Hsu added that she was 'excited that we are redefining the landscape of homework', before going on to explain that she didn't believe she was 'eliminating' homework, but rather adjusting the expectations of both her parents and her pupils in terms of what that phrase means. But while her students are no doubt delighted at the news, their parents are less enthused by the school's decision. 'I was just thinking maybe I'll keep my daughter here for another year, but this pushed me over the edge,' Daniel Tasman, the father of a second grade pupil at the school, told DNAinfo. 'This is their time to learn now, when they have good memory,' said Stanley, the parent of a third grade pupil at P.S. 116. 'I give him extra work, though. I go to Barnes and Nobles and give him my own homework.' Ironically, the school's mission statement - which available on its website - states clearly that pupils are expected to 'achieve high academic standards' and to 'take responsibility for their own learning'. Homework-free zone: Parents of the school's students are angry at Ms Hsu's decision, with one father going as far as to say he would pull his daughter from her class . 'Our school, P.S. 116, is a community of learners in which all children are encouraged to achieve high academic standards and social success, to enjoy learning, to celebrate diversity, to develop analytical skills, and to model exemplary behavior,' the website explains. 'We empower our students to take responsibility for their own learning by recognizing that effort leads to academic success. 'They are active participants and every child has a responsibility not just to perform a task, but to do it to the best of her or his ability.' But despite the anger and frustration being voiced by many parents however, Ms Hsu is adamant that she has made the best decision possible for pupils and added that she is 'looking forward' to seeing what 'positive impact' the school's new homework options will have on both the students - and their parents. And according to Peter Pizzolongo, associate executive director at National Association for the Education of Young Children, Ms Hsu's theory is actually not as bizarre as some of the school parents might think. Speaking to Yahoo Parenting about P.S. 116's new homework policy, Mr Pizzolongo explained that, while children need 'the opportunity to apply what they have learned after they leave the school environment', that additional education time doesn't necessarily have to take the more traditional form of worksheets and book-based assignments. 'When kids engage in rough and tumble play outdoors, ""big body play"" we call it, they're not only enhancing their physical development, they're learning how to set limits in a social-emotional context, problem solve, and make decisions,' he added. 'These skills hit all the domains of learning.'","Jane Hsu, the principal of Manhattan-based P.S. 116, informed parents last month that children would no longer be assigned any homework .

"Unhappy: School headteacher Dan Philpotts has criticised the sweet shop for opening at 7.30am . A headmaster today criticised a sweet shop which opens at 7.30am on weekdays - because it is leaving his pupils ‘hyperactive’ in class. Parents have been asked to stop their children visiting the shop in Radcliffe-on-Trent on the way to school after it emerged some students were spending their dinner money on sweets. South Nottinghamshire Academy principal Dan Philpotts, 40, hit out after the Sweet Cottage opened 1,300ft (400m) from the school gates less than two weeks ago on February 28. The married father-of-two said the shop - which opens from 7.30am to 4.30pm on Monday to Friday - is causing some pupils to become ‘disruptive’ because they are high on sugar. Mr Philpotts added: ‘This has escalated out of control. It’s crazy. I am just looking out for what is best for our pupils. There hasn’t been one specific incident that sparked this. ‘But students have been coming in late, and just generally becoming hyperactive and causing disruption. The shop is not prepared to acknowledge the effect it is having.’ The headmaster, a former Wolverhampton Wanderers youth footballer, insisted that he wanted to continue working with the shop, but it would carry on opening at 7.30am each day. He continued: ‘We are asking parents to speak with their children about being sensible with their sugar intake and how they spend their dinner money. Opening hours: The shop is said to be causing pupils to become ‘disruptive’ because they are high on sugar . Letter: Mr Philpotts wrote to parents of South Nottinghamshire Academy pupils to warn them about the shop . ‘We will continue to inform and work with parents to avoid any unnecessary disruption during school hours which impacts on pupils’ behaviours and learning.’ Since the shop opened, teachers have reported pupils coming in with stained mouths and hands from the sweets they were buying and then eating. But the owner of the Sweet Cottage hit back, saying children have always taken sweets to school. He said: ‘When I was a kid I always took a bag of sweets to school. The headteacher was not invited to come to the shop, he came of his own accord and he upset customers. Local shop: The Sweet Cottage (in red) opened just 1,300ft from the school (in blue) less than two weeks ago . 'Working with parents': The school caters for 520 pupils aged 11 to 18 and has been rated 'good' by Ofsted . ‘It is just a coincidence that we open at 7.30am. We are not trying to entice schoolchildren in - and we will be opening at the same time during school holidays.’ In his letter to parents, which was sent out last Friday, Mr Philpotts urged parents to back the school’s unofficial boycott. It stated: ‘It is important to note that, as an academy, and in our role in loco parentis to your children, we do not object to sweets per se. ‘But we do object to students filling up on sweets before the school day has even started.’ The school caters for 520 pupils aged 11 to 18 and was rated ‘good’ by watchdog Ofsted in its last inspection two years ago.","Parents told to stop their children visiting shop in Radcliffe-on-Trent .

"A convicted killer and a rapist are among ten of Britain's most wanted fugitives who are believed to be on the run in Spain. The list was published today as part of Operation Captura, a scheme to trace wanted criminals and suspects who are thought to have fled to Spain. The ten men are wanted in connection with crimes including rape, indecent assault of a child and drug trafficking, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Killer and rapist: (L-R) Shane Walford killed father-of-two Paul Gibbons with a single punch outside a bar in Coventry while Mohammed Jahangir Alam was sentenced to 14 years in jail in his absence for rape . One of the fugitives is ex-soldier Shane Walford who was jailed in 2010 for the manslaughter of an off-duty fireman while on leave from the Army. Walford, a former boxer, killed father-of-two Paul Gibbons with a single punch outside a bar in Coventry. He was jailed for four and a half years but was recalled to prison in August 2013 after breaking the terms of his licence. Another of the fugitives is Mohammed Jahangir Alam, 32, who was sentenced to 14 years in his absence in March 2010 for rape and sexual assault by penetration. Alam, who is originally from Bangladesh, arrived in the UK on a temporary visa in October 2007 and moved to Cheltenham the following year, when he physically and sexually abused his victim, the NCA said. On the run: (L-R) Carlo Dawson is south London, who is accused of indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl and making indecent photos of a child. Jayson McDonald is a suspected drug trafficker . Also on list: (L-R) David McDermott, believed to be a member of a drug-dealing organised crime gang in Liverpool,  and youthful-looking Michael Roden, nicknamed 'Dodge and suspected of importing cannabis . Also on the wanted list is 52-year-old Carlo Dawson, from Croydon, south London, who is accused of indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl and making indecent photographs of a child. An operation was launched last week to arrest one of the fugitives, suspected drugs trafficker Jayson McDonald, who is believed to have been living in Spain. More than a dozen armed officers along with detectives from the Metropolitan Police carried out a dawn raid on a luxury villa in Coin near Malaga but McDonald was not found. It is the ninth appeal of its kind since Captura was launched by the NCA and Crimestoppers in 2006, and so far 65 out of 76 named suspects have been caught. One of the latest to be found in Tenerife was drugs lord Stephen Blundell, 36, from Merseyside, who fled the UK before being sentenced for a £1 million heroin plot, the NCA said. Hank Cole, the NCA's head of international operations, said: 'Spain is not a safe haven for British fugitives. The NCA and its partners will continue to pursue these individuals relentlessly and return them to the UK to face justice. Wanted: (L-R) Paul Buchanan, wanted for attempted rape, and suspected drug tafficker Anthony Dennis are also National Crime Agency targets . Hiding: (L-R) Suspected drug dealers Paul Monk and Scott Hughes are also on the wanted list . 'The exceptional level of collaboration and intelligence sharing with the Spanish authorities has been vital to these arrests. However, we still need the support of the public. 'Be our eyes and ears and tell us if you have any information on the whereabouts of our targets.' Lord Ashcroft, founder of Crimestoppers, said: 'Operation Captura has proved a huge success since it was launched in 2006 and the majority of individuals on our most wanted list have been captured. 'However, there are still a number of criminals who are evading arrest. We must ensure these individuals are brought to justice. We are confident that we can successfully hunt them down with support from the Spanish authorities, as well as the Spanish and UK public.' Spanish authorities are heavily backing the operation and a leading policewoman has claimed the country is no longer a 'safe place' for British criminals to hide. As part of Operation Captura, the National Crime Agency today published a list of ten of Britain's most wanted fugitives thought to have fled to Spain. They are: . 1. Shane Walford: 38, is wanted by West Midlands Police for manslaughter. The former soldier and boxer was jailed for 54 months in July 2010 after he killed firefighter Paul Gibbons at a bar in Coventry. He was recalled to prison in August 2013 after breaking the terms of his licence. 2. Mohammed Jahangir Alam: 32, is wanted by Gloucestershire Police for rape and sexual assault. He was convicted in March 2010 and sentenced to 14 years in his absence. 3. Carlo Dawson: 52, is wanted by the Met Police on suspicion of indecent assault and making indecent photographs of a child. Dawson, from south London, is believed to have indecently assaulted a 12-year-old girl between October 1996 and October 1997. 4. Paul Buchanan: 29, is wanted by West Mercia Police on suspicion of attempted rape. Buchanan, originally from New York, is alleged to have attacked a woman near his flat in Worcestershire by pulling her down a driveway, pushing her over a car and attempting to rape her. 5. Paul Monk: 54, of Romford, Essex, is wanted by the Met Police on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and conspiracy to supply cannabis. 6. Anthony Dennis: 47, is wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to commit drug trafficking offences outside the UK and conspiracy to import class A drugs. Dennis, originally of Hackney, is believed to be the leader of an organised crime group involved in high-level international drug trafficking. 7. David McDermott: 41, is wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and conspiracy to blackmail. McDermott, from Ormskirk, is believed to be a member of a Liverpool-based organised crime group. 8. Scott Hughes: 34, is wanted by Merseyside Police on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to launder money. 9. Michael Roden: 25, is wanted by West Midlands police on suspicion of conspiracy to import cannabis. Nicknamed 'Dodge', he was allegedly involved in 70 kilos of cannabis being imported into the UK from Spain between April 2013 and September 2013. 10. Jayson McDonald: 37, is wanted by the Met Police on suspicion of conspiracies to import and supply heroin and cocaine. McDonald, originally from Bristol, is believed to be part of a Europe-wide organised crime network responsible for importing Class A drugs into the UK. Speaking at Malaga's police headquarters, Inspector Olga Lizana, head of the Spanish National Police Fugitives Unit, said British criminals living in Spain should 'leave the country' because they will be found. She added: 'This is not a good place (for them) to come any more. This is not a safe place for criminals any more. 'I think we are doing a great job with the British authorities. They have to be aware we are working together.' Warning: Hank Cole, NCA's head of international operations, says Spain is no longer a safe haven for British criminals . Spain's Costa del Sol - once dubbed 'Costa del Crime' - has been known as a hideaway for British criminals in the past, particularly in the late 1970s and 80s when there were no extradition agreements with the UK. Infamous British criminals to have fled to the region included Great Train robber Charlie Wilson, who was shot dead in Marbella in 1990, and Freddie Foreman, an associate of the Kray twins. Inspector Lizana said, like most British expatriates, criminals were attracted to Spain by the 'good weather and good food.' She added: 'There is a huge British community living here. For them, it is easy to hide. For us sometimes it is really difficult to find them. 'Also, it's a cheap country compared to the UK.' The launch of Operation Captura in 2006 has seen an increasing number of British fugitives being captured in Spain. The high-profile initiative between the NCA, Crimestoppers and the Spanish authorities has seen 65 out of 76 wanted British suspects detained. Last year alone, 54 fugitives were arrested in Spain and brought back to the UK, the NCA said. Commenting on the police's failure to apprehend suspected British drug trafficker Jayson McDonald, the inspector said she was 'disappointed' but added: 'He is not going to be back in the UK so we'll arrest him here.' Anyone with information on the whereabouts of the fugitives is asked to call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or go online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. Caught: Drug trafficker Christopher Mealey . For years, Spain has been an appealing hideaway for British criminals evading capture, with dozens disappearing in what's been dubbed the Costa del Crime. But the launch of Operation Captura in 2006 has seen an increasing number of UK fugitives captured in the country. The high-profile initiative between the NCA, Crimestoppers and the Spanish authorities has seen 65 out of 76 wanted British suspects detained so far. Last year alone, 54 fugitives were arrested in Spain and brought back to the UK. This year's top ten list is the ninth appeal of its kind since Captura was launched. One of the operation's most high-profile arrests came last June when a British drug trafficker behind a £25 million a year cocaine ring was caught in Marbella. Christopher Mealey, 38, was arrested by armed officers from the Spanish National Police as he walked along the Paseo Maritimo, a Spanish beachfront tourist hotspot.","List published today as part of scheme to trace criminals on run in Spain .

"University of Houston officials have suspended the university's Sigma Chi fraternity chapter and five members following allegations of hazing. UH President Renu Khator said in a statement that she is 'shocked, dismayed, and deeply disappointed' at the allegations surrounding the Epsilon Xi chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity. No details of the alleged hazing have been made public, but Khator called them 'disturbing.' Suspended: University of Houston officials have suspended the university's Sigma Chi fraternity chapter and five members following allegations of hazing (photographed is the Epsilon Xi chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity house) Five of the fraternity's members have been placed on immediate suspension pending investigation into the accusations. If the hazing allegations prove to be true, Khator said those responsible will face disciplinary action up to, and including, expulsion from the university. The statement reads in part: 'Let me be clear, hazing is a criminal act, and consent is not a defense. Failure to report hazing also is a criminal offense and a violation of university policy. 'Those who engage in such reckless and immature behavior will be punished to the full extent of the law and in accordance with University policies.' Five Guys: Five of the fraternity's members have been placed on immediate suspension pending investigation into the accusations . The national headquarters of Sigma Chi released its ownstatement on the matter Tuesday saying the organization received word of the allegations at the end of January and commenced to launch an investigation. However, after becoming aware of the UH Police Department's investigation, the organization, on February 19, put its investigation on hold until the UHPD's was complete. Additionally, the organization said that the alleged 'inappropriate pledging activities' were 'inconsistent with Sigma Chi's values.' On Tuesday, the university turned its investigation over to the Harris County District Attorney’s Office which will decide if charges will be filed, KHOU reports. Values: The national organization of Sigma Chi released its own statement on the matter Tuesday saying that the alleged 'inappropriate pledging activities' were 'inconsistent with Sigma Chi's values' Hazing is a class B misdemeanor under Texas law, the Houston Chronicle reports. The offense is punishable by six months in jail. But if the offense causes serious bodily injury, the maximum penalty would double. If the hazing were to result in a death, a suspect could face a state jail felony charge and spend up to two years behind bars. The suspension comes amid questions about Greek culture in U.S. campuses after members of a University of Oklahoma fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, were captured on video singing a racist chant.","University of Houston officials have suspended the university's Sigma Chi fraternity chapter and five members following allegations of hazing .

"The Missouri auditor's spokesperson who killed himself this weekend wrote in his suicide note: 'I'm sorry. I just can't take being unemployed again.' Spence Jackson, 44, had served as the media director for Tom Schweich, who took his own life in February amid claims he was the target of an in-party bullying campaign. Following Schweich's death, Jackson had been an outspoken critic of fellow Republicans accused of spreading rumors about him. Jackson's body was found in his Jefferson City apartment at 7pm on Sunday during a well-being check by police after they received a call from his mother, who had been unable to reach him. Scroll down for video . Double tragedy: Spence Jackson, left, was found dead on Sunday - just a month after his boss, Missouri state auditor Tom Schweich, right, took his life amid rumors he was the victim of a bullying campaign . He died of a single self-inflicted bullet wound to the head and was found in his bedroom beside a a .357 Magnum revolver and a spent cartridge, authorities said. On Tuesday, Jefferson City Police Captain Doug Schoemaker released Jackson's suicide brief note, which was found on the living room table, at the request of his family. The note was dated March 27, which coincides with other indications of when he took his life. Colleagues told the St Louis Post Dispatch that Jackson failed to come back to work after taking lunch that day. 'This is being handled strictly as a suicide,' Schoemaker said. 'There is no reason, anything at all, to the contrary.' Also on Tuesday, Jackson's family released a statement thanking people for the 'overwhelming outpouring of love and support we have received'. 'Spence was a loving son, brother, uncle and friend to many,' the statement continued. 'He was a kind, caring and loyal person. Spence was passionate about his career and for the elected officials, candidates and causes he represented.' They added that they encourage anyone who might need help to seek it. Questions: Jefferson City Police Department Captain Doug Shoemaker answers questions during a news conference on Monday, hours after Jackson was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gun wound . His death comes weeks after his boss, Tom Schweich, shot himself dead minutes after telling a reporter he wanted to go public with allegations he was being bullied by fellow Republicans. Schweich, who launched his Republican gubernatorial campaign in January and was considered a frontrunner, was targeted by state GOP Chairman John Hancock, according to his supporters. Hancock allegedly told people that Schweich - who was Christian but had Jewish ancestry - was Jewish with the implication that it was a negative attribute in a gubernatorial campaign. The auditor had expressed angst to friends that he believed he was the victim of 'an anti-Semitic whispering campaign'. On February 26, he shot himself at his Clayton home just minutes after telling an Associated Press reporter about the tactics. Schweich, 54, left behind his wife Kathleen and their two young children, Emilie and Thomas. At his funeral days later, former U.S. Sen. John Danforth, an Episcopal priest, suggested during his eulogy that Schweich had been driven to kill himself by political bullying. Scrutiny: Schweich supporters accused state GOP Chairman John Hancock, pictured, of falsely claiming he was Jewish to damage his gubernatorial campaign. Police have found no evidence of the bullying . Heartbroken: Schweich's relatives comfort each other outside his funeral on March 3, a week after he shot himself dead. Just moments earlier, he told reporters he wanted to go public with the bullying claims . Some Schweich supporters called on Hancock to resign or for the Republican state committee to remove him. Jackson was among those who had called for Hancock's resignation. But a week ago, Clayton Police Detective Lt. Don Bass said Schweich left behind no suicide note and that detectives have found no evidence that he was the target of political bullying. 'I think everybody's looking for a rational reason for an irrational act ... but right now we're not finding anything,' Bass said, adding that based on 'the leads and sources that we have heard from, we have not been able to prove that there was a whispering campaign'. Hancock has also denied the allegation and said that he has received support from the state committee to continue in his role. After the death of his boss, Jackson continued to work as the auditor's spokesperson. He had started working as Schweich's media director in May 2011 after holding several key Republican jobs in state government. In the early 2000s, he was communications director for then-Secretary of State Matt Blunt, and then worked for Blunt's campaign committee in 2004 as Blunt ran for governor. At work: Jackson, pictured in January 2002, had several key Republican jobs in state government . Loss: 44-year-old Jackson, pictured, had worked with state officials for more than a decade and was remembered by former Secretary of State Matt Blunt as 'hard-working, well-liked and quick-witted' Following news of Jackson's death, Blunt released a statement about his 'hard-working, well-liked and quick-witted' friend and former colleague. 'Melanie and I are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Spence Jackson who was a good friend for many years,' it read. 'Spence was a gifted communicator who dedicated his talents in public affairs to public service...He will truly be missed. We mourn his passing and offer our prayers to his family and friends.' After working for Blunt, Jackson moved to the Missouri Department of Economic Development, where he worked for just over two years. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Spence Jackson, 44, was found dead inside his apartment from a self-inflicted gun wound on Sunday during a well-being check by police .

"She was just 15 years old when she and her brother were offered their own TV show, but Marie Osmond reveals the pressures placed on her were immense. 'I had producers take me out into the parking lot when I was 103 pounds and tell me that I was obese, disgusting and a disgrace to my family. That I needed to keep food out of my fat face,' the 55-year-old Dancing With The Stars vet told Closer Weekly. She was told The Donny & Marie Show would be canceled if she didn't lose weight and so she starved herself down to 97 pounds. Scroll down for video . In the spotlight: Marie Osmond revealed to the new issue of Closer Weekly that she was told she was 'disgusting' for weighing 103 pounds when she was  just 15-years-old on The Donny & Marie Show . Too fat?: Marie, pictured on stage with Donny in 1975, was hauled over the coals by TV producers who said she was obese and disgusting  and The Donny & Marie Show would be axed unless she lost weight . Surviving stardom: Now 55 and a grandmother, Marie has come through battles with weight and with depression and credits her faith and her family for helping her deal with the pressures of fame; her she is pictured in April 2014 . Lasting stars: Donny and Marie talked to Closer Weekly for the 40th anniversary of their show . The producers knew just what buttons to push for the teen raised in the strict Mormon faith. The thought not only of being fat but of being responsible for everyone involved in the show weighed heavily. 'This sent me on a head trip - that 250 people could lose their jobs because of me,' she told Closer. The pressure to be thin continued long after The Donny & Marie Show ended in 1979 after four years, and plunged the star into a life-long battle with her weight. 'I was very young': The only girl in the Osmond family, Marie, pictured in 1974,  topped the charts in 1973 with Paper Roses but described her first recording session two years earlier as 'a terrifying experience' In the spotlight: Donny was 17 and Marie was 15 when their weekly variety show began airing in 1976 and the only Osmond girl starved herself to lose weight, dropping down to 97 pounds . There were other demands, too, placed on Marie and her brother Donny, who was 17 when the show started in 1976. The youngsters often worked  20-hour days and each week they had to learn new songs and dance routines and memorize scripts. They also hosted celebrity guests and that brought other problems with it for the pretty Osmond sister. 'I was very young and I remember Groucho Marx pinching my butt,' Marie said. 'He was a dirty old man.' Marie and Donny, who have been selling out shows at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas since 2008, sat down with Closer to mark the 40th anniversary of being offered their ABC show. At 15, the Paper Roses singer was already a showbiz veteran. She was 12 when she was taken to her first recording session, something she says was 'the most terrifying experience.' 'It was a full orchestra and rhythm section. I was the only Osmond girl, what if I failed?' she said. 'So I threw up! Then I went in and sang.' A brother-and-sister act: The Osmonds were famous around the globe for their dazzling white smiles, and also for the Mormon faith that helped protect them from the temptations that came their way after finding fame . Mutual support: The pair have helped each other through the ups and downs of life after The Donny & Marie Show ended and Donny told Closer his sister has 'been through some horrific times' Marie, the only girl in a family with eight boys, found fame in the wake of her brothers' worldwide success. Her older brothers Alan, Wayne, Merril and Jay had been performing since they were children and appeared regularly on TV's The Andy Williams Show throughout the 1960s. They were later joined by Donny and youngest brother Jimmy and enjoyed a successful pop career in the early 1970s, including performing backup for Donny's solo hits Go Away Little Girl and Puppy Love. After being convinced to join the Osmonds bandwagon, Marie recorded the song Paper Roses when she was 14 and it soared to the top of the country music charts and made number five on the Billboard charts. Still performing: 40 years on, the Donny and Marie show is going strong and they continue to entertain their legions of fans with their Las Vegas revue at the Flamingo Hotel that's been selling out since 2008 . Today she is sanguine about finding fame at such a young age. 'I didn't have a childhood because I had a different kind of life,' she said. 'I didn't have a normal dating life or friends, but I don't know that anyone's life is perfect.' There's no question that Marie's life has been a tumultuous one with perhaps more than her fair share of ups and downs. She's had two husbands, one she married twice, and given birth to three children. In 1999, she revealed her struggles with severe post-natal depression. She also adopted five children with her second husband Brian Blosil, whom she has since divorced. Her son Michael committed suicide in 2010 after a lifelong battle with depression. Showbiz veterans: Marie, 55, and Donny, 57, continue to pursue solo careers and the Puppy Love singer and teen heartthrob  said that looking back, it's the good times that he remembers, and not the bad . Now 55 and a grandmother, Marie credits her religion and her family for helping her get through the tough times and ultimately surviving the perils of becoming famous so young. 'It all boils down to keeping God first, then family. It's a formula that has helped us through a lot of things,' she said. 'A lot of people think I was naive, but you're not naive growing up in this business. I grew up fast.' Her brother Donny agrees that there is satisfaction in surviving and indeed thriving as the pair continue to entertain their many fans today. 'I look back at my life as all these peaks and valleys, and Donny & Marie happens to be a peak, Donny told Closer. 'The bad times dissipate and you only remember the good.'","Marie started working on her TV series at the age of 15 with brother Donny .

"A fifth student at Wesleyan University has been arrested in connection with a 'bad batch' of party drug Molly that resulted in the hospitalization of 12 people, including two in a critical condition. Abhimanyu Janamanchi, 21, was among those treated at Hartford Hospital, 20 miles north of the college's campus in Middletown, Connecticut, on February 22 after taking the popular stimulant. He surrendered to police Friday morning on a warrant for drug charges relating to the particular batch of Molly, which officials believe may have included a mix of various designer drug chemicals. Now, he has been charged with distribution of a hallucinogen, possession of a hallucinogen and possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell, among other counts. Fifth suspect: Abhimanyu Janamanchi (pictured in his mug shot), 21, has been arrested in connection with a 'bad batch' of drug Molly that resulted in the hospitalization of 12 people, including two in a critical condition .

He has also been suspended from Wesleyan. 'Given the nature of the charges, we immediately suspended this student pending a formal hearing,' college spokesman Lauren Rubenstein said. 'Wesleyan takes very seriously allegations concerning the distribution of dangerous drugs.' Janamanchi, from Rockville, Maryland, is the fifth student to be arrested over the on-campus drug overdoses, which affected ten students at the private liberal arts school, as well as two visitors. Some of the victims had attended a rave music show on the night of February 21. The calls for medical attention began the next morning. Four students were transported to Hartford Hospital. One student was found unresponsive with no vital signs and was revived by paramedics who used six defibrillator shocks and numerous chest compressions, according to court affidavits. The student and another victim were described as being in a 'critical condition'. Last week, the family of the only person who remained in the hospital said that 'against all odds', they would survive.

This happened shortly after she had moved to the home around June 2014. The young girl finally told her grandmother that Guider had been 'messing with her' in December, but the woman did not believe her. Then, in January, the grandmother took the young girl to the pediatrician, who told her she needed to take the girl to the hospital, which the grandmother did not do for reasons that are not known at this time. Finally, in March, the girl's mother realized she looked pregnant and took her to the hospital where it was revealed she was due at the end of May.

"A mother and her three-year-old son died after she tried to rescue him from an Ohio pond. Maurissa Bickford, 39, was able to pull her son Noah out of the water and atop the ice, but was then unable to lift herself out of the water. They were found unresponsive on Thursday by two county highway garage employees who were working nearby the pond, which was almost completely frozen over. Maurissa Bickford, 39, and her son Noah, 3, died after she tried to rescue him from a Sidney, Ohio pond. She was able to pull her son out of the water and atop the ice, but was then unable to lift herself out of the water . The 10ft-deep pond is on the residential property of the family's next-door-neighbor John Moeller who said the neighborhood had agreed  that kids were allowed in the pond as long as they were supervised by an adult . Zachery Rogers and Samuel Deatherage pulled Noah to a bank and administrated CPR. Maurissa was pulled out of the water by fire department workers, according to WHIO. They were both sent to nearby hospitals where they later died of their injuries. It is unclear how long either of them had been in the water. Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart said Noah had gotten away from his mother and ran onto the ice. 'She did what all moms and dad do: tried to rescue the child,' he said. The 10ft-deep pond is on the residential property of the family's next-door-neighbor John Moeller, who returned to his home just moments after the workers discovered Maurissa and Noah. The neighborhood had agreed that the pond could be used for recreation and fishing and that kids were allowed in the pond as long as they were supervised by an adult, according to Moeller. But Moeller told WHIO he had never seen Noah by the water before, and that the tragedy had him 'shook up'. 'Realize that life can be very, very brief,' he said. Moeller said the community was banding together to help Maurissa's husband and daughter.

"An active woman who has shed four stone to fulfil her desire to have children has been told that she's still too fat to adopt. Donna Adams, 42, who suffers from a hormone condition that makes losing weight harder than normal, was left reeling when her local council said her BMI of 38 exceeds their criteria for adoption. The civil servant from East Grinstead attends belly dancing classes, goes on long country walks and swims 30 lengths each week yet officials don't  deem slim her enough to become a mum. Donna Adams has shed four stone, reaching 15st and a BMI of 38 in her bid to become a mother . Donna goes belly dancing once a week, she swims and she takes long walks and says she's fit and healthy . Donna  claims that West Sussex County Council said she exceeds their guidelines which require substitute carers to have a BMI of 35. The council states that it has a 'responsibility to identify and address obesity in substitute carers' and that with a body mass index of 38, she fails to meet its guidelines. Donna said: 'I understand they need to think about people's lifestyles and the welfare of children, but I can't believe you need to be a certain size to be a good parent. 'I just want people to know what's going on because I'm definitely somebody who is fit and healthy enough to be a mother. 'There are plenty of children in care who need a loving home and loving parents, and I feel bad for them.' However at despite her activity levels and slimmer body, Donna's BMI is still considered to be in the 'very obese' range on the calculation chart, and just two figures below the 'morbidly obese' range. Donna, pictured with her husband Jeremy, managed to reduce her BMI from 48 to 38 thanks to a strict diet . Donna and husband Jeremy, 41, have struggled to conceive themselves because she suffers from called polycystic ovarian syndrome. She said: 'My body makes too much testosterone and insulin - it causes problems with fertility and makes you bulk up and have a chunky figure. It is incredibly hard to lose weight. The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a way of seeing if someone's weight is appropriate for their height. BMI can be divided into several categories and generally the higher your BMI, the greater your risk of a large range of medical problems. Inaccuracies can occur for people who are very muscular as it will result in a higher BMI even if there's a healthy level of body fat. 'It affects about one in ten women, but most of them don't realise they have it until they try for a baby and it doesn't work.' But thanks to a strict diet and active lifestyle, Donna managed to shed the pounds and went from a whopping 19 stone to 15 stone and is now a much slimmer size 14. She also reduced her BMI from 48 to 38. The couple then gave themselves another year in the hope that Donna would fall pregnant after reducing her BMI, before they explored adoption. But their hopes were soon dashed. Donna said: 'I received a letter from West Sussex County Council, which says we can't adopt because I don't meet their guidelines. 'I was so angry about it, I just couldn't believe it. The council has never actually met me. This is all based on a number, which I find to be really insulting. 'I feel like my husband and I have fantastic qualities to become parents. We have six nieces and nephews and we are very much a part of their lives, and the minute we got married all our friends and family started asking when we were going to have kids.' Donna has pledged to lose another two stone before the end of the summer in a bid to further reduce her BMI. And the hopeful couple will then apply for adoption again to a local authority or an agency - but have ruled out applying to West Sussex County Council. A council spokeswoman for West Sussex County Council said: 'There are a combination of factors taken into account before any advice is given to potential adoptive parents. The civil servant's weight hit 19st but by watching her diet and exercising she managed to slim to 15st . 'The health of prospective adopters, including any weight issues, are factors we consider in relation to their capacity to successfully parent children who have already lost their birth family, through to adulthood and beyond. 'There are often a broad range of factors that are discussed with the prospective parents before they apply to adopt and areas they may need to consider changing before starting the adoption process. 'We regret this was not made clear in the letter that was sent and the Adoption Team will be making contact to offer an initial home visit to discuss this inquiry further.' Now a healthy size 14, Donna's BMI means she's still considered 'obese' and outside adoption guidelines .","Donna Adams, 42, shed four stone, slimming to 15st, to start a family .

"This real life big bad wolf forced the residents of one Dutch town to keep their doors firmly shut. In a scene that could have come straight out of one of the Grimm fairytales the large grey animal was spotted peering into gardens as it stalked the streets. But instead of threatening to huff and puff and blow their homes down the hungry animal was looking for scraps of food after travelling over 300km. Scroll down for video . This huge grey wolf was captured on camera running along a residential street in Kolham in the Netherlands . The wolf sauntered down a busy residential street and was witnessed peering into gardens looking for its next meal . The huge grey wolf was caught on camera running along a residential street in the northern city of Kolham, which is normally packed with children and family pets. Eyewitnesses told how it strutted along the road for around 30 meters, stopping from time to time to look into gardens. Although running at a brisk pace, those who saw it said it did not seem dangerous and was possibly looking for a new home. Wolves have not been seen in the Netherlands for more than 150 years. Local experts believe it may have travelled to the city from Germany - up to 300km away. Oguz Acioz, 35, who spotted the animal while driving to work called the police. The salesman said: 'The last wolf was seen here about 150 years ago. 'I was about a meter behind it. I could see the mouth and the teeth and I knew it wasn't a dog so I started filming straight away. 'I was so surprised. You never see one of these on a street. It's not a normal sight. Wolves have not been seen in the country for more than 150 years, according to animal experts . The animal was believed to have travelled into the country from Germany . 'Luckily, there was nobody on the street as everyone had gone to work. Normally there are lots of children around and chickens in back gardens. 'I looked at it in the eyes. It seemed hungry. 'I wasn't scared. I wanted to see him. I thought he might need help. 'It was seen crossing the boarder [with Germany] on Friday. There is a picture of it and it is the same wolf. 'People think it might have been looking for a new home or mate. It ran a long way.'

"Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is quite a mouthful. Which is why locals refer to this region of lakes, castles, and beaches in the North-east of Germany as MV, or Meck-Pom. The Pom refers to Pomerania, now mostly in Poland. It has a long coastline on the Baltic and is the third largest of Germany's 16 Laender - but the least populated. So you can walk for miles on a sandy strand or drive all day on the autobahn and not see a sausage, except in your lunch. Back in focus: 'Meck-Pom' offers blissful beaches along Germany's Baltic Sea coastline . After World War II, Meck-Pom was part of Communist East Germany, which might account for its low profile. The regime concentrated on the cities and neglected the countryside, so castles and seaside resorts deteriorated. Since reunification 25 years ago, all that has changed. The result is a clutch of wonderful hotels and beautifully-run resorts. The sea accounts for the region's ancient wealth and the cities along the coast - Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund and Greifswald - were part of the 13th-century trading confederation, the Hanseatic League, which did business with Scandinavians and Slavs around the Baltic. Two of the cities, Wismar and Stralsund, are World Heritage Sites. Towering medieval cathedrals and customs houses on market squares as big as football pitches are built of ancient revolutionary red-brick, moulded and baked from the sodden clay. The harbour has bars, cafes and shops for windsurfers, anglers and bucket-and-spaders. On the road, go-kart tracks and wildlife parks fill gaps between the farms and forests. A day's fishing off a boat costs €39 (£27), including lunch from a stewpot. At the beach resorts of Boltenhagen and Warnemunde, holidaymakers on hire bikes (£6.50 a day) pedal through pine-filled parks to the sea-front. A steam train called Molli plies a coastal route to Heiligendamm, location of the five-star Grand Hotel. It has a sanatorium, a Michelin-star chef, a castle (for weddings) and a children's house with games. Quietly charming: The pretty Alte Markt square in Stralsund sums up the region's appeal . Meck-Pom is a refuge in peace and war. Forewarned of the Allied bombing, citizens of Hamburg, Berlin and Dresden fled here. 'The castles were full of refugees,' says Freiherr Helmuth von Maltzahn, proprietor of 16th-century Schloss Ulrichshusen, which his ancestor Ulrich built among the inland lakes. Helmuth, born in 1949, bought back his burnt-out family home and turned it into a 40-room hotel. At sunset, cranes fly over the lakes in their thousands in what looks, for a moment, like an intricate, interweaving MV-formation. British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Hamburg from £79 return. Double rooms at the Grand Hotel Heiligendamm (www.grandhotel-heiligendamm.de/en) cost from £136, on a B&B basis.

"A single mother-of-three who is on benefits says she would love to work but employers won't give her a chance as she's overweight. Vicky Benson, 33, from Gateshead, tipped the scales at 28st and said she has struggled to lose weight despite her efforts to diet. 'I am well and truly overweight. This big tummy doesn't seem to budge,' she said on the latest edition of Channel 5 documentary Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole. Vicky, pictured on Channel 5 documentary Benefits Britain, says she would like to work but employers won't give a chance because she's 'well and truly overweight' 'I have tried to lose weight, I have tried everything. It's hard to diet, what's right for you, what not to eat, what to have in place of the rubbish. The temptation of just saying, ""I'm just going for a kebab"".' She said she has tried to find work but hasn't been successful and is angry that, as a result, her handouts have been sanctioned. She used to get £270 a week benefits but this was cut to £200 a week when she failed to apply for enough jobs. 'It's terrible living on benefits, it's not what I want. I have looked at a lot of cleaning jobs, coffee shops, shoe shops, everything but I never hear anything back,' she said. 'If there are two people standing for the same job and one is big and one is slim, they will take the slim one.' As a single mother to twins Lexi and Levi, five, and daughter Chloe, 13, as well as looking after a dog, Vicky says she's no stranger to hard work. The single mother has been on the dole for eight years and is angry her benefits have been cut recently because she hasn't applied for enough jobs . 'It's a full-time job looking after three kids, in fact it's probably harder,' she pointed out. She has been living off handouts for eight years after quitting a job she had as a cleaner. She said: 'I last worked in 2007. I had a job cleaning in sheltered accommodation. I did it for eight weeks. It didn't work out so I just gave it in. Maybe I should have stuck at it and tried harder.' After her twins started at school, Vicky was warned her benefits would be sanctioned if she didn't demonstrate she was actively seeking work. But she said she struggled to find a job because of her size, lack of qualifications and the fact she would have to fit it in around childcare. Vicky, pictured applying for jobs with her daughter, said she is trying to find work . She said it's not fair her benefits have been cut as a result of her not applying for enough jobs. 'I applied for four jobs as they were the only ones suitable for me to do. As a result, my benefits have been sanctioned as they said it wasn't enough,' she explained. 'I'm really angry at the fact they can put the sanction on me when I have kids. There are others who don't have kids and lie through their teeth and still get their money,' she said. Vicky's sister, Paula, said she didn't believe the job centre have done enough to help dyslexic Vicky find work. She said: 'It's wrong she was sanctioned for something she had done, but not done enough of. It's not like she hadn't done anything. Vicky's three children and her dog, pictured, keep her busy and she hated having to visit a food bank recently in order to feed them thanks to her benefits being sanctioned . 'She's a nice person, she's honest. she's reliable. I definitely think she could work given the chance.' Vicky added that she attended a course in order to keep her benefits but it wasn't helpful. 'The course was rubbish, it was on how to set up your own business - that's never going to happen to me. I couldn't wait to get home, it was a waste of time,' she said. As a result of her benefits cut, the single mother had to go to a food bank in order to feed her children, something she said made her feel like a 'scrounger' and that she doesn't want to do again. She said she intends to join a local slimming group so she can get the support she needs to lose weight and she hopes once she's slimmer, she will get be given the opportunity to work.

"It is known as one of the happiest countries in the world, but Vietnam's population is somewhat shy about smiling for the camera. As French photographer, Réhahn, was travelling through the South East Asian country, he observed that many people conceal their smile with their hand, as a mark of modesty or politeness. He decided that the shy gesture would make an interesting subject for to focus on and travelled through the country snapping portrait photos for a series he called Hidden Smiles. Scroll down for video . French photographer Rehah, 35, left behind his busy life in France to explore the happiest country in the world, Vietnam. He has been travelling round on a motorbike there since 2001 . He noticed that a lot of people cover their mouths when they smile, either out of shyness, or elegance, if there was a lack of teeth . He noticed the effect the smile has on the whole face, when the mouth is concealed from view. His portraits focus on the eyes and lines of the face caused by the happy emotion . Since giving up his hectic life in France, the photographer has spent three years in Hoi An, Vietnam, ranked the happiest country in the world, and says he has discovered their true meaning of happiness through his pictures. In particular, Réhahn was keen to highlight how the smile is translated throughout every inch of the face, even when the mouth is covered. Born in 1979 in Normandy, the photographer has enjoyed life travelling around Vietnam on his motorbike and has so far taken over 40,000 pictures. For Réhahn, a smile is more than mere muscle twitching and his Hidden Smiles project aims to celebrate the corners of the face etched by a lifetime of happy emotion. 'Vietnamese people are the most positive and optimistic people I've ever met in my life. It gives me a good energy everyday, just when I cross the small village where I live and meet many smiles. It's Feng Shui: only good energy!' he said. Looking past old age, or the wearing of poverty, the photographs reveal an energy and life behind the eyes of the individuals, through their concealed smiles. When asked why many subjects cover their mouths Rehahn said young girls do it out of embarrassment, and old women tend to do it out of elegance to cover their lack of teeth. 'I think a good photography is when you can capture the soul, read a story in the eyes. Capture emotion is not an easy thing, Time is the key! Spending time with people always gave me better photos!' he said. Rehahn states he has only travelled to a quarter of the country, despite being a permanent resident there since 2011. Of the many photographs he has taken, 145 have made it to his first photo-book 'Vietnam – Mosaic of Contrasts,' which aims to show Vietnam in a natural and spontaneous light. 'I  tried to understand why people covered their mouth. When they cover the mouth, we focus on their eyes and wrinkles. It's photogenic!' Rehahn said . The photographer uses Canon 5d Mark III to capture his subjects, and spends time talking to the individuals to put them at ease . The photographer has gained much recognition since publishing his book in January 2014. The 35-year-old has been featured in numerous newspapers and magazines, and has gained over 182,000 fans in one year on his facebook page. Rehahn is travelling to India in April to complete the collection and then will go to Mongolia in June. His heart, however, lies in the happy nation of Vietnam. 'Every month I am travelling in Vietnam by motorbike, to record the vanishing culture of ethnic minorities,' he said. 'I have 45 000 photos, 45 000 stories! One of my secrets is when I ask them ""Khong Co Rang"" which translates as ""you don't have teeth."" The Vietnamese are very direct and like to joke,' he commented . 'Vietnamese people are the most positive and optimistic people I've ever met in my life. It gives me a good energy everyday, just when I cross the small village where I live and meet many smiles.

"Is your libido flagging? If so, then a lack of sleep may be the reason why, researchers claim. A study has found a direct relationship between how much sleep a person gets and their level of desire the next day. The amount of shut-eye also affects how aroused they will become. The study, involving 171 women, showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent. Poor sex drive? Getting more sleep is directly linked with an increase in libido, new research has shown . Sleep was also important for genital arousal, according to the research, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. Specifically, women who slept longer experienced fewer problems with vaginal arousal than those who obtained less sleep. 'The influence of sleep on sexual desire and arousal has received little attention in the field,' said Dr David Kalmbach, of the University of Michigan. 'But these findings indicate that insufficient sleep can decrease sexual desire and arousal for women. He added: 'I think the take-home message should not be that more sleep is better, but that it is important to allow ourselves to obtain the sleep that our mind and body needs.' And it's not just women - previous research found men with poor sleep patterns have significantly lower levels of testosterone, which results in a lack of sex drive. Experts say that reduced levels of the hormone can bring a host of other negative consequences for young men, including reduced libido and poor reproduction. They can fail to build enough strength through muscle mass and bone density, leading to low energy levels, poor concentration and fatigue. Low testosterone levels are also linked to the metabolic syndrome - a cluster of metabolic risk factors that increase the chances of developing heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Scientists from the University of Chicago found men who get less than five hours sleep a night for a week or longer suffer have far less levels of testosterone than those who get a good night's rest. The study showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent - and increased levels of arousal . Their study found that the levels of the hormone are reduced dramatically to levels more akin to someone 15 years older. 'Low testosterone levels are associated with reduced wellbeing and vigour, which may also occur as a consequence of sleep loss,' said Professor Eve Van Cauter, who led the study. Other reasons for low libido include poor diet, being overweight and low iron levels. An estimated one in four British women doesn’t get enough iron from their diet, and iron deficiency is known to leave your libido lagging, says Dr Radha Modgil, a GP in West London with a special interest in sexual health. ‘Low iron levels are thought to reduce the quality of blood flow and so sap energy,’ she explains. ‘If you’re exhausted, sex is obviously the last thing you feel like doing.’ ‘The best source of easily absorbable iron is a nice juicy steak,’ adds dietitian Helen Bond. ‘Red meat like steak helps release key amino acids from the brain which are important for good mood.’ Other reasons for low libido include poor diet, being overweight and low iron levels. Dietitians say red meat such as steak is a good, easy-absorbed form of iron . ‘Red meat is also a good source of B vitamins, which help convert the carbohydrates we eat into energy. It’s also a rich source of zinc, important for the production of the sex hormone testosterone, which women also need for sexual desire. Other good sources of zinc include beans, nuts and oysters.’ Eating too much white bread and other refined carbohydrates can sap your sex drive, says Helen Bond. ‘Foods such as white bread release the sugar more quickly than their wholegrain counterparts — and too much sugar is associated with energy slumps, which mean you won’t have the energy for sex,’ she adds. Too much sugar also makes you fat, raising the level of oestrogen in the body, in turn reducing testosterone levels in men, says gynaecologist Peter Bowen-Simpkins, . ‘If you’re obese, you feel less attractive. You also have reduced blood flow to the sex organs.’","Each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent, say University of Michigan researchers .

"A fraternity at North Carolina State University was placed on interim suspension after it was linked to a pledge book containing jokes about rape and lynching. Pi Kappa Phi suspended its chapter at NC State until an investigation about a green book that was found at a restaurant near the school's Raleigh campus is complete. The school is cracking down on more than 20 other fraternities by temporarily suspending social events that involve alcohol. Pi Kappa Phi suspended its chapter at North Carolina State University after a book containing jokes about rape and lynching was found by a female student at a restaurant near the school's campus in Raleigh. The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like: 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching' Besides the lynching line, the book contained the phrase: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' The contents of the Pi Kappa Phi notebook were first broadcast by television station WRAL. The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like 'If she's hot enough, she doesn't need a pulse.' and 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching.' It also contained the comments: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' and 'I like little girls.' The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant. She said: 'The contents were horrible. 'I wanted to make sure everybody knew this was going on so it could be corrected. 'Frats are looked up to, but this is what they are doing. 'I hope other fraternities are disgusted. 'I hope that if they do have this sort of thing going on in theirs, that they'll realize, whether they want to or not, that they should change, that they shouldn't promote this kind of behavior.' Frat said: 'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated' The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant . Pi Kappa Phi chief executive officer Mark Timmes called the quotes 'reprehensible and unacceptable'. He said: 'We have sent staff to Raleigh to investigate the circumstances of the situation. 'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated. 'We are working closely with the university and have instructed our students to cooperate fully with all investigation efforts. 'We appreciate the university's collaboration in quickly addressing the situation.' NC State's alcohol ban doesn't apply to historically black Greek organizations or the Multicultural Greek Council . It was issued after new details about a drug paraphernalia seizure surfaced in a search warrant related to a sexual assault allegation at Alpha Tau Omega, which was suspended earlier this month. The chapter will be suspended until an investigation about the 'reprehensible' quotes in the book is complete . The details came out not long after shocking behavior at the University of Oklahoma, Penn State and other schools put fraternities in the spotlight. In announcing the alcohol crackdown, NC. State said the school also plans training on diversity for chapters and other measures to increase accountability. In the Alpha Tau Omega investigation, a woman called police March 1 to say she was sexually assaulted at the fraternity house. She also told officers drugs - including cocaine, ecstasy and prescription pills - were being sold out of the house. Alpha Tau Omega's NC State chapter was suspended earlier this month amid allegations of sexual assault . Campus police Sgt. J.P. Dye seized drug paraphernalia, a scale and white powder in a small bag during a search of the empty house. Wynn Smiley, Alpha Tau Omega's national chief executive officer, said the fraternity had kicked out a pledge who had white powder and other drug paraphernalia in his room. The student had been associated with the organization for less than a month, Smiley said. He said the national organization conducted its own investigation with a lawyer and other alumni advisers, and the organization believes the woman was exaggerating about drugs being sold and the level of drug activity. He also questioned her credibility on the sexual assault allegation. Smiley said: 'It just didn't line up with what we were finding out.' Kayle Graham, a junior psychology major at NC State, said racism and sexism among students is sad because the younger generation's attitude indicates where the country is heading. She said: 'It's unfortunate that at a college level, students aren't as mature and socially aware as one would like them to be.'","Pi Kappa Phi suspended its chapter at North Carolina State University .

Alex's life-saving PD-L1 immunotherapy treatment it isn't available on the NHS and costs £25,000 per session . Alex, who is married to husband Nathan, said: 'All I want is to see her grow up, be there to celebrate her birthdays, walk her to school and be the Mummy she needs me to be. 'But without treatment, I won't survive. The cancer will kill me and my daughter will grow up without a Mummy.' Alex was first diagnosed with cervical cancer last April. She underwent intensive courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But she was told three weeks ago by doctors at Weston Park Hospital in Sheffield, where she was treated, that there is nothing more they can do. Determined not to just give in, Alex researched alternative treatments to help battle the cruel disease. Her quest took her to London's Harley Street where she saw a leading cancer specialist Professor. He told her about a treatment which is being used in the United States known as PD-L1 immunotherapy. It helps a person's body fight cancer cells by recognising those cells as impostors. However, it isn't available on the NHS and costs £25,000 per session. Alex will need 10 to 12 sessions. The treatment is Alex's only hope to win the battle which has left her exhausted, confused and unable to sit and play with her young daughter Willow Mae . Initially the council information officer was given the good news that the company developing the treatment are looking for patients to try it on Britain - and they were willing to treat them for free. But then came a cruel twist. Because Alex had a tube inserted directly into her kidneys as part of a previous course of treatment, she was deemed not suitable for the trial. It was then that the family decided the only course of action open to them was to pay. So they launched Quest For Life appeal in a desperate attempt to save Alex's life. The treatment is Alex's only hope to win the battle which has left her exhausted, confused and unable to sit and play with her young daughter. Her husband, Nathan, 25, a self-employed plumber said: 'It has been the worst year of our lives. 'It's been an awful emotional roller coaster as we have watched Alex fight this cruel and horrible disease.' Six months after Alex was initially diagnosed, she was given the all clear. Nathan said: 'We were so pleased – we couldn't have wished for anything more. It was like all our Christmas's had come at once. 'But very quickly we knew something wasn't right. Alex was still in a lot of pain. She told her doctors and they carried out more tests. Initially they all came back clear and doctors thought the pain may have been caused by the radiotherapy.' Alex,  with Nathan and Willow Mae above, says: 'I desperately want to watch Alex ride her first bike, take her to school on her first day, make all her birthday cakes, so I have to do everything I can to make that possible.' Alex and self-employed plumber Nathan on their wedding day, left, and Alex and Willow Mae, right . But earlier this month, medics told Alex the cancer had, as she had expected, returned. Nathan said: 'Alex had been in a lot of pain and she knew in her heart of hearts something was very wrong. Initially tests came back clear, but earlier this month we were given the devastating blow that the cancer was back. 'Only this time it was more aggressive and we were given the horrendous news that there was nothing more the doctors could do. 'We were all absolutely heartbroken. Alex was crushed. All she has ever wanted was to be a Mum and watch our little girl grow up. 'Like any parents she wants to be there for our daughter and see those very special days.' Alex said: 'I desperately want to watch Alex ride her first bike, take her to school on her first day, make all her birthday cakes, so I have to do everything I can to make that possible.' This week Alex and Nathan travelled to London for her first session of treatment which has been paid for by her parents. Alex's anxious family are setting up a charity and have raised £3,500 and are making a heartfelt plea for people to help pay for the costly treatment . And her anxious family are setting up a charity and making a heartfelt plea for people to help pay for the costly treatment. Up to now they have raised £3,500, but still have a very long way to go. An emotional Alex, who says she is in constant excruciating pain, said she is desperate to live if only for Willow's sake. But sometimes the pain is so intense she feels she just can't face life as it is. She adds: 'The pain is so bad that there isn't a minute that goes by when I don't feel in excruciating agony.' It is only through the help of her friends and family that she is able to carry on. She said: 'People I haven¹t seen or spoken to for years have been in touch and I¹m overwhelmed by their support. It really does keep me going. 'Everyone is doing so much but I feel so low and in so much pain I can't do anything, I can't even walk further than a few yards. 'There are times when I feel like pulling the duvet up over my head and just giving in. But then I think about Willow, how much I love her, and how much she needs her Mummy. 'I have to fight this for her sake. I need to be here when she comes home from her first day at school to feel me about her day. I can't leave her so young and miss out on so much of her life. I have to keep fighting and do everything I can to battle this horrible illness.'

"A baby boy born without a nose, a condition so rare it only has a one in 197 million chance of happening, is finally going home to his parents in Alabama after three weeks in the hospital. Timothy Eli Thompson was born premature on March 4 without any nasal passages or sinus cavities. He is one of only 37 people who have been born with complete congenital arhinia. He had to undergo a tracheotomy at only five days old. His mother Brandi McGlathery was expecting 'a perfectly healthy baby boy' after every ultrasound came back normal during her pregnancy. Timothy Eli Thompson was born without a nose, a condition so rare it only has a one in 10 billion chance of happening, on March 4 in Alabama . Eli, who does not have any nasal passages or sinus cavities, had to undergo a tracheotomy at  five days old . McGlathery, 23, has since been diligently tracking the ups and downs of her baby's progress on a Facebook page titled 'Eli's Journey,' which already has over 4,000 likes. Eli  has been treated at the USA Children's and Women's Hospital in Mobile for three weeks. McGlathery has shared the good news of his test results, including an eye exam and cranial scan that came back normal, as well as the 'hard blow' the family was dealt when they found out Eli didn't have nasal passages. This means that even though Eli can have a nose built for him, doctors are still unsure at this point 'if it will actually be functional,' she wrote. The mother-of-three has also shared the emotional joys she's had with Eli, including his first successful bath and bottle feeding, and the first time she saw his face without an oral respirator. Eli's parents, Brandi McGlathery and Troy Thompson, give their child his very first bath . McGlathery, 23, has been diligently tracking the ups and downs of her baby's journey on a Facebook page titled 'Eli's Journey,' which already has over 4,000 likes . Both of Eli's parents and his grandmas have learned the proper way to suction, clean and change his tracheostomy tube. 'Who knew someone so tiny could change so many people's lives in such a short time? Our perfect miracle baby,' McGlathery wrote on her Facebook page. McGlathery also shared one of the first emotional moments she got to share with Eli while he was still in the neonatal intensive-care unit, the first time she had him to herself for more than 15 minutes since he'd been born. 'We sat and rocked for two hours until my baby fell asleep,' she wrote. Both of Eli's parents and his grandmas have learned the proper way to suction, clean and change his tracheostomy tube. McGlathery calls Eli ‘the most beautiful boy I’ve ever laid eyes on’ 'The nurses told me that was the deepest sleep they've seen him in since he arrived in NICU and that he was so calm when I was around.' 'That made my heart melt all over. I've been so worried that he'd get more used to the nurses than he did me.' And McGlathery has also shared concerns of what Eli will have to experience as he grows up, and whether children and the world will be cruel to him. 'My biggest fear for Eli is that the world won't see him as the beautiful, brave little boy that I see him as.' But no matter what Eli will always have his mother, who calls him ‘the most beautiful boy I’ve ever laid eyes on’.","Timothy Eli Thompson was born without nasal passages or sinus cavities .

"He counts a who's who of showbiz and fashion among his biggest fans, but will we catch Kanye West, Katy Perry and Kim Kardashian wearing the boned corsets and face jewellery unveiled by Riccardo Tisci at his Paris fashion week show? The Givenchy head honcho, known for setting trends and dressing the most esteemed stars, unveiled his autumn/winter 2015 collection before his famous fans in the French capital on Sunday - and it was a dark story. Inspired by the Chola girl gangs in South America, his collection also had a hint of Victoriana (a trend we've seen in all four fashion capitals this season). Scroll down for video . Riccardo Tisci's models at his Givenchy show took inspiration from Chola girl gangs in South America . Tisci's models donned boned corsets over fitted jackets and feminine, bustier dresses with peek-a-boo cut outs. Skirts were velvet and voluminous and came in moody hues of brown and black.

Design duo Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker exhibited an affinity towards the dark side at their AW15 show in London. The relentlessly alluring theme of Gothic romanticism seeped throughout the collection - named Persephone - thanks to delicate fabrics and feminine details nostalgic of the Victorian age. Frills were rife, dominating the collars or lining the dress, and even made their mark on footwear. Silk blouses and sheer fabrics flowed down the runway, followed by luxurious felt wool coats that embraced winter’s charm and highlighted the feminine silhouette. There were similar scenes at Giles, with models sent down the runway with black lips, pale complexions and ruffled collars with silk bows galore.

"A luxury apartment where Harrods once prepared and wrapped their Easter eggs has gone on the market for £5.35 million. The two-bedroom flat is based within the 19th century Harrods Depository building at Trevor Square- now regarded as one of the most prestigious addresses in Knightsbridge, London. It would have housed some of London's finest products such as chocolate, wine and clothing, which could not be kept in the store due to lack of space, while staff would use the centre for packaging luxury goods.

The separate, high-end kitchen in the unusual apartment which is complimented with the latest technology including comfort cooling and a Creston home automation system . Easter eggs are made by employees at the Harrods Depository Building in 1929 (pictured) which has since been transformed into a luxury block of flats . And twelve years ago, the depository was transformed into one of London's most exclusive block of flats. Located on the second floor, the flat has a large reception room with separate kitchen and breakfast area, featuring the latest technology including comfort cooling and a Creston home automation system. The address also features two bedrooms with a generous ensuite bathroom.

It is around 30 times more expensive than the £180,000 paid for the average home last month, with stamp duty alone likely to set back the buyer £555,750. Only a small number of two-bedroom apartments attract a more expensive price-tag. Shirley Humphrey, director at Harrods Estates, said: 'Trevor Square is a highly desirable residential address and this is a rare opportunity to own a home here.

"A leaked internal email written by a casting agent at American Apparel said that from now on they'll only be hiring 'real models’ and not ‘Instagram hoes or THOTS'  in an attempt to rebrand their image. Former CEO Dov Charney who created the concept behind the company's diverse ads was fired last year following the brand's willful misconduct claims that he 'acted inappropriately' and 'harassed employees.' The New York Post obtained the the email written on March 18 by model caster Phira Luon that read, '“[The] company is going through a rebranding image, so we will be shooting models moving forward.' Leaked email: A leaked email written by model casting agent Phira Luon said the company would only be hiring 'real models' not 'Instagram hoes' 'Real models. Not Instagram hoes or THOTs,' he continued in the email meant for employee eyes only. THOTS is an acronym for the saying, 'That ho over there.' After the email surfaced, Luon replied with an apology for what he wrote and said it 'was just an inappropriate off colour joke that was not intended to defame the clients name or philosophy/views in anyway,’ reports News.com.au. News.com.au also reported that just last week, American Apparel’s new senior vice president of marketing, Cynthia Erland, allegedly told employees that they would not hire models who were 'too short and round,' three sources who were at the meeting told News.com.au. “It’s become a running joke around the office — like, ""I can’t do this, I’m too short and round,'  said one employee who alleges they heard heard the remark. 'I’ve never felt marginalised or unattractive working for this company until his past week or so,' that employee added. Real women: American Apparel has been known to accept model submissions from around the globe and have featured models of all shapes and all sizes . Erland responded toNews.com.au in a statement that said, 'This is completely false. American Apparel embraces body types of all shapes, ethnicities and sizes, and our model casting has and will continue to reflect this.' American Apparel is notorious for their ads of scantily clad 'amateur models' of all sizes and the company was known to accept model submissions from 'real women' around the globe. Despite the company's public attempt to distance themselves from their old image, the American Apparel website still says nothing about their desire to use more conventional models. ‘We find our models all over the world, through online submissions, word of mouth, and in retail stores, where we've been known to do an impromptu test shoot or two. Our ads have always been indicative of a time and place in American Apparel's identity, which has evolved into a 12,000 employee worldwide collaboration. Explore the online ad archives for a closer look at our ads featuring models, factory inner-workings and the global vernacular that inspires us,’ the website states. One rebranding change made obvious on the website last week is the company’s choice to airbrush out some of the models' exposed nipples and body hair making them look more like plastic mannequins. Nip no nip: The model on the left in see through white lingerie once had her nipples and pubic hair in full display more like the model in the back lingerie on the right . Animal first reported that the changes could be seen on the company's lingerie page in the 'new' section and a brunette model in translucent lingerie who once had more showing was edited to be much less exposed. Charney's replacement CEO Paula Schneider has said she is attempting to make the brand 'relevant to millennials' without it bordering on 'pornographic.' 'This is an edgy brand and it’s always going to be an edgy brand, and it’s about social commentary, it’s about gay rights, and it’s about immigration reform. It’s about the things millennials care about,' Schneider told The New York Times in January. While many may welcome the company's attempt to shave away their previous image, some activists think showing nipple is perfectly fine and empowers women in what otherwise may be a mannequin's world. Michelle Lytle, co-founder of the nipple printed bikini line TaTa Top thinks that by censoring women and making them look like mannequins or dolls, the company is actually taking power away from women who should not feel ashamed of their bodies. Fired: Former CEO Dov Charney was fired after the company accused him of willful misconduct . Lytle told Animal that American Apparel has tried to reach out to diverse audiences by coming out with t-shirts that say 'legalize gay' and 'legalize LA' but have very little to comment on women's equality. 'To see them taking a strong stance on those issues but not on women’s equality is disappointing,' said Lytle who runs the feminist clothing line with her partner Robyn. 'This is a company that is clearly trying to distance themselves from their founder,' she continued. 'It’s kind of laughable for them to think that removing nipples from their images of their sheer lingerie is the best way to do this considering their questionable ad choices in recent years. This is a step in the wrong direction and is contributing to the sexualisation of a woman’s body at a time where there is a large and growing movement for equality.' The clothing company has a tab on their website dedicated to political activism and they offer a stance on gay rights and immigration reform. 'As a company, we have certain resources that individual activists do not. We try to use that special ability to support political causes that need help. American Apparel regularly uses its billboards, advertisements, press contacts and even printed t-shirts to speak out about important issues. Our two biggest issues have been Immigration Reform and Gay Rights,' says their website. The company's female CEO has yet to comment on women's sexuality and empowerment and the company's choice to airbrush out nipples and pubic hair. The models of American Apparel may soon have a new look altogether as the company attempts to truncate their old image.","The leaked email written on March 18 by casting agent Phira Luon said the company would  be hiring real models not 'THOTS or Instagram Hoes'

"A giant semi-fossilised egg that is almost 100 times larger than a chicken's egg and still has the tiny skeleton of a bird inside is to go on sale for more than £50,000. The rare egg, which is 12 inches long and more than eight inches in diametre, belonged to the now extinct elephant bird that lived on Madagascar. The flightless birds, which stood nearly 10 feet (three metres) tall and weighted half a tonne, died out in the 17th century after heavy hunting. Scroll down for video . This 12 inch long elephant bird egg - just one of 25 known to remain intact around the world - is going on sale . There are thought to be just 25 preserved intact elephant bird eggs left in existence, with most in museums. Now one owned by a German marine biologist Professor Hubert Caspers, who worked at the Institute for Hydrobiology and Fisheries Science before his death in 1998, is to go on sale in Bruges, Belgium. Genetic material has been extracted from the shells of ancient elephant bird eggs. It has raised hopes that it may be possible to use cloning techniques to resurrect the extinct species. By injecting the genetic material into the unfertilised eggs of other large flightless birds like the ostrich, it may be possible to recreate the elephant bird. However, scientists face significant challenges that need to be overcome before this is possible. Cloning birds is considered to be particularly challenging. Extracting enough DNA from eggshells is also thought to be another limiting factor. Finally much of the habitat the the elephant birds once inhabited has now changed, so there may be few places where such a large species could now live. Scans taken of the egg, which is at least 400 years old, have also revealed the tiny bones of an embryo that had started to grow inside along with dehydrated organic material. Scientists were recently able to extract DNA from a similar egg, raising hopes that it may be possible to bring the elephant bird back to life using cloning techniques. Auctioneers Rob Michiels, who is selling the egg along with other items from Dr Caspers collection, said the egg appeared to be older than other eggs that have been sold recently. He said: 'The eggs of elephant birds are extremely rare - there are probably 25 of them in the world. 'This once comes from the collection of Dr Caspers and we have been asked to sell it by his children who thought it was a dinosaur egg. 'The children didn't know a lot about their father's collection. 'I was invited to Hamburg to look at a collection of antique tiles that he owned and I spotted the egg. It was just sat in a box. 'We have had a CT scan of the egg and it showed there is still organic, dehydrated material inside in the form of fetal bones. 'Technically, you could extract DNA from it and if you have a very large ostrich you could re-create a form of an elephant bird. 'The mother either ran away from the nest or was killed.' A CT scan of the elephant bird egg revealed dehydrated organic matter, shown as pink in the image above, and fragments of fetal bone still preserved inside the egg, shown by the small white mark in the pink material . The egg that has come up for sale (left) is one of the largest in the world and was laid by the now extinct elephant bird (right) which grew to around ten feet tall and lived in Madagascar until the 17th Century . The elephant bird, or Aepyornis maximus, was one of the largest birds to have ever lived. They are thought to have been common in Madagascar until they wre hunted into extinction during the 17th century. Fossilised egg fragments can still be found on the ground in some parts of Madagascar. David Attenborough, the natural history broadcaster, owns an almost complete eggshell that he pieced together from fragments collected by locals while he filmed Zoo Quest to Madagasar in 1961. The CT scans took slices through the egg and revealed dehydrated organic material and bone fragments inside . Another elephant bird egg was sold in 2013 for £66,675 - more than twice its expected value. Douglas G. D. Russell, senior curator of birds, eggs and nests at the Natural History Museum in London, said the elephant bird eggs were now very rare. He said: 'The export of their eggs from Madagascar is now strictly forbidden by the country’s legislation and complete eggs are relatively rare. 'As a rare, complete egg of an extinct species with some, albeit minimal, foetal bone it is noteworthy and all additional information on this enormous enigmatic bird is exciting.' Broadcaster David Attenborough is one of the few people to won a giant elephant bird egg after he pieced one together from fragments brought to him by locals while he was filming in Madagascar for the BBC in 1961 . This fossilised elephant bird egg, shown next to a hen's egg, sold for £66,000 during an auction in 2013 .","The egg, which belonged to a German biologist, has an eight inch diametre .

"A former Democratic Party PR chief who sparked fury by posing for a selfie at the scene of the East Village gas explosion has made a grovelling apology. Christina Freundlich posted a picture of herself on Instagram smiling and showing a peace sign at the site of last Thursday's blast which  killed two men, injured 25 people and set four buildings ablaze. Freundlich who only stepped down from her job as the Iowa Democrat's communications director on March 6, took down the photo after fellow Instagram users branded it 'dumb', 'disgusting' and 'horrible'. Scroll down for video . Apology: Christina Freundlich, a former communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, has expressed remorse for posting this picture at the site of the East Village fire on Friday . One social media user said: 'Disgraceful. Unprofessional. No place for a selfie in face of disaster.' Freundlich told the Des Moines Register: 'I am deeply sorry for my careless and distasteful post. 'It was inconsiderate to those hurt in the crash and to the city of New York. What happened last week in the East Village is not to be taken lightly and I regret my course of action.' Reaction: Freundlich was heavily criticised by other social media users . Ben Foecke, Executive Director of the Iowa Democratic Party, told the Daily Mail Online: 'Christina Freundlich left employment with the Iowa Democratic Party over thee weeks ago. March 6th was her last day on payroll. 'Her actions since then are completely outside our control and oversight.' Freundlich reportedly resigned to 'seek opportunities elsewhere.' She was also a field organizer for Barack Obama's Florida Campaign for Change in 2008. Freundlich was one of three people singled out on social media after posting insensitive selfies at the scene of the disaster. Professional photographer Jon Gurinsky posted a picture on twitter of a group of women standing in front of emergency vehicles as one help up a selfie stick to take a group shot. The photograph was posted to the Twitter accountEventsPhotosNYC and drew a barrage of criticism. One commenter said: 'Everything that's wrong with NYC summed up in one photo.' Mr Gurinsky, who works for EventPhotosNYC said he had been taking pictures of street scenes in East Village for some time and the picture as part was part of a series. He told the New York Daily News: 'In addition to an event photographer, I am a street photographer. 'One of the areas that I cover is my neighborhood. I have lived in the East Village for ten years and have captured the daily changing scene here over that time. 'In my street photography I take an objective journalistic approach, simply capturing the culture of the street as it is.' Disaster: The explosion last Thursday killed two men, injured 25 people and set four buildings ablaze. Caught in the act: One man decides to take a self-portrait from the top of a nearby building as the thick smoke rises from the scene . The blast, which reduced three building to rubble, is believed to have been caused by a natural gas explosion . Luis Gomez, a reporter from Spanish-language channel Univision was spotted taking a selfie of the scene as he attended a Mayoral press conference that was taking place a block away. A spokesman for the channel insisted he had only been trying to give viewers a sense of the scene. Other Instagram users who had taken the selfies quickly took them down when they realized their error in judgement. Searchers yesterday confirmed one of the victims killed in the East Village explosion was missing male model Nicholas Figueroa. Tragic: Investigators have confirmed one of the victims killed in the blast was male model Nicholas Figueroa . The 23-year-old was settling the check at the sushi restaurant after a second date with his Bowlmor Lanes colleague when the building erupted. He was one of two people, alongside 26-year-old busboy Moises Ismael Locón Yac, delcared missing after the blast. Officials have yet to identify the second body pulled from the debris on Sunday. Figueroa's family endured an agonizing wait for information on Thursday after searching every hospital in the city. His date, 22-year-old Theresa Galarza, was pictured at the scene being fitted with a neck brace after she was reportedly hurled across the street by the force of the suspected gas explosion. She was later admitted to Bellevue Hospital with a broken nose and punctured lung. Found: Searchers found a body Sunday in the rubble from Thursday's massive fire in East Village, the identity of the body is unknown . Looking: Emergency workers have been looking through the rubble for signs of the two men who have been missing since Thursday's blast, the explosion and subsequent fire leveled three buildings . Explosion: Theresa Galarza, 22,  was with Figueroa in the restaurant when the blast occurred, she was propelled to the other side of Second Avenue . Injured: Four of the 22 people injured in the incident remain in critical condition; eighteen of the 22 suffered non-life threatening injuries . Debris Already Removed: The official says upper layers of debris have already been removed and workers have reached the basement level . Initial reports suggest the Figueroa and Locón, a delivery boy for the restaurant on Second Avenue, may have been standing next to each other at the time of the explosion and may have been blown upward toward the restaurant's cellar - causing them to be buried in the rubble. Locón's family also rushed to the scene and scoured local hospitals after hearing news of the blast, CBS reports. His older brother, Alfredo, told CBS on Friday that he is devastated about Locón's disappearance. Meanwhile, some debris from the explosion and fire is being taken to a secure site where it will be examined again for any human remains.","Christina Freundlich posted smiling selfie from the site of the blast .

"In custody: Justin Jarrard Oliver is said to have attacked the victim while they were driving away from the fast food restaurant in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Wednesday morning . A Florida man has been arrested for allegedly beating up a woman who refused him sex after he bought her a McDonald's breakfast. Justin Jarrard Oliver is said to have attacked the victim while they were driving away from the fast food restaurant in West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning. The 26-year-old was picked up by the woman, who was driving with her boyfriend, and went to place an order. Oliver then paid the bill and the trio drove off. But the suspect then demanded sex' because he bought the food, the Palm Beach Post reported. She refused so Oliver allegedly grabbed her arm and tried to drag her into the back seat. The woman held onto the steering wheel and stopped the car, but then Oliver got out and tried to pull her from the vehicle, still demanding sex. He allegedly punched the woman causing 'severe injuries' that included a one-and-a-half inch laceration above her left eye and numerous other cuts and abrasions, a police report stated. In response, the woman's boyfriend jumped on Oliver's back, allowing the victim to move the car along the road. Her partner jumped back in and they managed to drive to St. Mary’s Medical Center where hospital staff alerted the police. Oliver is facing charges of felony battery and false imprisonment. He is being held on $75,000 bail. In 2012 he was arrested for beating up a man after his debit card had been stolen - while he was having dinner at McDonald's . The 24-year-old victim tried to take justice into his own hands by tracking down those responsible himself. He asked a woman about the lost card and followed her into a house when she gave him a suspicious response. A man told him to leave but when he refused a trio, including Oliver, allegedly beat the man up.

"Ageist comments about Madonna's fall at the BRITs could deter firms from hiring older women, a government adviser claims today. Older workers' tsar Ros Altmann said the reaction to the 56-year-old's dramatic tumble on stage at the awards ceremony 'encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate'. It comes ahead of a new report which reveals how unconscious bias or outright age discrimination stops some employers from hiring the over-50s. Scroll down for video . Madonna, 56, was pulled off the stage as she performed at the BRIT Awards in London last month . Madonna looked shocked - and briefly stopped singing - after she fell down a set of stairs at the BRIT Awards last month. She failed to untie her cape in time for her dancers to rip it away as she took to the stage at London's 02 Arena. Some onlookers praised her at the time for continuing to sing her new song, Living For Love, as proof of her professionalism after more than three decades in the business. But others argued that the embarrassing incident was proof that she should rethink her stage persona. Mrs Altmann said the media coverage after the fall was typical of the way age is treated. She told MailOnline: 'Much is often made of achievement with a reference to age. 'It's not uncommon to hear that 'despite' someone being a certain age they have achieved something commendable. 'The recent example of ageist comments after Madonna fell off the stage at the Brits encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate. 'Falling was nothing to do with her age and could have happened to any performer of any age.' The pop superstar was dragged to the ground as she attempted to undo her Armani cape which was pulled by a dancer . Madonna later laughed off the incident and said her Armani cape was simply tied 'too tight'. She wrote: 'Armani hooked me up! My beautiful cape was tied too tight! But nothing can stop me and love really lifted me up! Thanks for your good wishes! I'm fine!' Ironically her new song referenced a fall. She later told ITV's Jonathan Ross: 'I'm never writing lyrics like that again! The universe was trying to teach me a lesson I guess.' Older workers' tsar Ros Altmann said the reaction to the 56-year-old's dramatic tumble on stage at the awards ceremony 'encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate' Mrs Altmann's report, expected to be released tomorrow, will call for urgent action to improve the chances of older workers. It argues that the way in which the media often portrays older people adds to the bias which can put employers off taking on older staff. It includes using pictures of the very elderly and frail to illustrate stories about people in their 50s or 60s. Ministers are also warned that older women are more likely to lose their roles as main newsreaders than men. Mrs Altmann added: 'The majority of people in their 50s and 60s are not old. 'But media stories about older people often use clips or stock images representing much more elderly and frail people. 'Wizened hands and walking sticks are not appropriate depictions of older people and merely reinforce negative discriminatory stereotypes.' Minister for Pensions Steve Webb said: 'Beyond the age of fifty, people start falling out of the workplace at dramatic rates – but there is a compelling economic and business case for overcoming these obstacles to access this vast untapped talent in the UK labour market. 'The Government has made a good start by abolishing the default retirement age and extending the right to request flexible working. But it is clear that old-fashioned and outdated perceptions still persist. 'From next month, we will be trialling targeted and intensive support for older jobseekers, including rolling out an 'older workers' champion scheme across every part of the UK, and we are seeing more firms open apprenticeships up for people of all ages. 'I'd like to thank Dr Ros Altmann for report as a clear call to Government, business and individuals to encourage more older people into employment.'","56-year-old superstar fell down stairs after failing to untie Armani cape .

"Going to the cinema once or twice a week could hold the key to preventing dementia, researchers claim. Watching a funny film with a good plot helps to stimulate the brain and prevent the build-up of harmful deposits, they believe. Crucially, discussing the film with friends afterwards helps to keep the mind active and guards against the formation of the plaques that cause Alzheimer’s. In a bid to prove their thesis, academics from Southampton University are launching a study involving 40 elderly patients - half of whom will go to the cinema once or twice a week. Scroll down for video . Researchers say watching a funny film with a good plot helps to stimulate the brain and could be the key to preventing dementia. Stock photo . They will then have a detailed discussion about the plot, the characters and what they made of the film overall over a cup of coffee or tea afterwards. Dr Roxana Carare, who is leading the research, believes this intellectual stimulation can prevent the build-up of toxins in the brain, called Amyloid-β, which lead to Alzheimer’s disease. ‘In order to keep the elimination of these toxins efficient, you need to keep the walls of the blood vessels healthy,’ she said. ‘You can do this by exercising of the brain or stimulation. ‘The films will stimulate the brain because of what you see and hear and crucially because of the discussions afterwards. ‘The bottom line is we’re trying to prevent these toxins accumulating in the brain by keeping the blood vessels pumping and brain active.’ Dr Carare, an Associate Professor in Cerebrovascular Ageing, cited the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Dame Judi Dench and Bill Nighy, as an ideal film. It tells the story of seven pensioners spending their retirement in a hotel in India Patients would easily be able to relate the characters who are not dissimilar in age and it is both funny and intellectually stimulating. However, she said sci fi films were not ideal, as patients may lose concentration and find them difficult to believe. Amyloid plaques start to form as the walls of the blood vessels in the brain start to stiffen and lose their ability to get rid of toxins. To prove their thesis, academics from Southampton University are launching a study involving 40 elderly patients and will send half of them to the cinema once or twice a week. Stock photo . Some patients have weaker blood vessel walls - possibly due to their genes - and gradually, the toxins build up. They create deposits called plaques which damage the surrounding cells and cause Alzheimer’s Disease, the most common form of dementia. Dr Carare’s study is due to begin this summer and will involve 40 elderly patients who have mild memory and concentration problems, but have not been diagnosed with dementia. Half will go to the cinema or watch an older film together on a large screen once or twice a week and have a discussion for about an hour afterwards. All patients will also undergo memory and concentration assessments once or twice a month to see if the films are improving the function of their brains. An estimated 850,000 people in Britain have dementia and 1 in 3 of us will develop the illness during our lifetime. But drug companies have failed to find a cure despite millions being invested in research over the past few decades. Last month a major report warned that the search for effective treatments had been hampered by ‘funding fatigue’. The World Innovation Research Summit said drugs companies were less willing to pay for trials following a series of expensive failures.","Researchers say watching a funny film with good plot stimulates the brain .

"Sensational footage has emerged showing the father of one of the three schoolgirl 'jihadi brides' at the head of an Islamist rally led by hate preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Michael Adebowale, the killer of soldier Lee Rigby. The video shows Abase Hussen marching at the front of the demonstrators, behind a banner reading: 'The followers of Mohammed will conquer America'. He was filmed chanting 'Allahu Akbar' amid dozens of protesters and standing just yards away as the American flag is burned. Scroll down for video . Vicious: In 2012, Abase Hussen (left) marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London, taking part in the burning of an American flag . Cuddly: Hussen appealing for the return of his 'jihadi daughter' a few weeks ago after she ran off . Earlier this month, Mr Hussen blamed police for placing a 'heavy burden' on his daughter by handing her the letter about their inquiry - and the police apologised. Yesterday, a Government report on foreign fighters was released containing testimony from Mr Hussen. But at no time has he mentioned his own passion for militant Islam or attendance at one of the most notorious rallies of the last few years. Hannah Stuart, domestic extremism expert at the Henry Jackson Society, said: . 'We saw Mr Hussen on TV looking very innocent, holding a teddy bear. But he was linked with individuals who espouse an extremist ideology. 'The impression given was that Islamic extremism was an alien world to his daughter. This footage suggests it wasn't.' Mr Hussen's daughter, Amira Abase, 15, fled the UK with two of her closest friends to join Islamic State last month sparking a national outcry. Mr Hussen, who is originally from Ethiopia, led public appeals for her return as their families blamed the authorities for failing to stop them. He addressed MPs at the Home Affairs Select Committee and was filmed appealing for help while clutching his daughter's teddy bear. Last night, Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage to see if any criminal offences had been committed. Sinister: Also at the rally was Michael Adebowale who went on to murder soldier Lee Rigby the following year . Respectable: Abase Hussen, pictured far right, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee following his daughter's disappearance. The report was released this week . A spokesman said: 'We will review any material brought to our attention which purports to show any criminal offence taking place.' Radical: Amira Abase, 15, daughter of Abase Hussen, travelled to Syria with two other girls . Mr Hussen was caught on camera in one of a wave of terrifying demonstrations that took place across the world in September 2012. Two men were arrested as the angry mob called for shariah law to be imposed across the UK. Amira Abase fled the UK with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Khadiza Sultana, 16, last month. The trio were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, Bethnal Green Academy, in East London, who left for Syria in December. Their decision to throw themselves into the hands of the brutal Islamic State terrorist group sparked a national outcry. Prime Minister David Cameron led calls for everyone to examine what is motivating our young people to join the barbaric organisation. Earlier this week Mr Hussen travelled to Turkey with relatives of the other two girls. He has since returned to the flat he shares with his wife in East London but could not be contacted last night. Speaking while in Turkey, he said: 'I don't know how to explain. I can't describe my feelings. 'I feel like my girl is next to me when I find someone that's on their last journey who saw them. I feel like my daughter is next to me – that's the feelings I have.' Thousands took to the streets to protest against an obscure film called Innocence of Muslims, which was criticised for ridiculing Islam. In London, more than 150 clashed with police outside the U.S. Embassy in Mayfair as they chanted 'burn, burn USA' and 'Allahu Akbar' (God is great). Images posted online show Mr Hussen at the head of the march, reaching towards an Israeli flag as it is burned. A U.S. stars and stripes was also set on fire. His distinctive face can also be seen as the march moves along the street beside a line of police carriers and officers. Among the rabble-rousers at the march was notorious hate preacher Choudary, with Adebowale at his side. Chilling: A CCTV image of 15-year-old Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana,16, and Shamima Begum,15 at Gatwick Airport before they caught their flight to Turkey . Fanaticism: Footage of the controversial rally showed Mr Hussen chanting among the crowds of protesters. The demonstration, held in 2012, was led by firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Lee Rigby's killer . Extremist: The protest was led by the hate preacher and notorious rabble rouser Anjem Choudary, who made a speech saying that Sharia would take over the entire world, including America and the UK . Shocking: Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage (pictured) to see if any criminal offences had been committed . Their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said: 'Of course they feel responsible for their own children that goes without saying. 'But the fact is these girls were school children and much of what took place clearly took place at school.'","Father of one of three schoolgirl 'jihadi brides' captured on camera at rally .

"Fans of the British boozer are concerned that pubs could become a thing of the past as thousands close each year due to spiralling production costs. But a new machine could help landlords feeling the pinch, because it can produce pints that cost just 35 pence (53 cents) each. The Truebrew Technobrewery  can make 280 pints of beer in just two hours at the touch of a button. Revolutionary? The Truebrew Technobrewery (pictured) may look unassuming, but it could save ailing pubs and bars by making 280 pints of beer in just two hours, costing just 35 pence (53 cents) each . A similar size to an industrial oven, the machine is intended for business use and will cost around £25,000 ($38,000). The machine allows landlords to brew their own beer for a quarter of the price of buying it in from a brewery. The British Beer & Pub Association refused to comment on how much it typically costs larger breweries to brew a pint 'for competition reasons.' But Dave Bailey, the founder of Hardknott Brewery in Cumbria told The Guardian in 2011 that it cost 90p to make a pint of beer, including 3p for malt, 2p for hops, 20p for labour and 20p for duty and 12p for transport. Cheap and unique: The machine allows people to brew their own beer for a fraction of the price of buying it in and they can create their own unique brews to impress friends and attract customers . A serious business: A similar size to an industrial oven, the machine (pictured) is not intended to be stored in the kitchen and costs around £25,000 ($38,000) Regularly drinking beer could help slow dementia, research suggests. Scientists have discovered an ingredient in hops which they think could slow the progression of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In laboratory experiments they found that the chemical, called xanthohumol or Xn, could help protect brain cells from oxidative damage associated with dementia. The research, published in December in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, suggested that people who regularly drink beer might be better able to ward off the progression of neurological diseases. Taking inflation into account - but not any increases in duties - this means that a pint costs just over £1 to make. Pubs brewing their own beer was an age-old tradition until the mid-1800’s when the introduction of duty killed it off, but now that tradition is being revived with bars launching their own microbreweries. Beer industry experts Robert McLauchlan and Graham Steele have spent the last 10 years developing the Truebrew Technobrewery. The machine is filled it with water, and then ingredients including hops are placed inside. It's then switched on for two hours. The machine is self-cleaning and the beer is ready to drink seven days later. After fermentation, it can be put into casks or bottles and sold directly from a pub, which the company says guarantees its freshness and wipes out transportation costs. While it costs a considerable amount, the new machine is estimated to cost a quarter of price of setting up a regular £100,000 ($152,000) microbrewery. Some drinkers may be worried that beer brewed on site is not as uniform as that made at huge breweries, but Robert McLauchlan, director of Brewers World, told MailOnline that the beer is controlled by computer software. 'For the novice brewer we supply ready made ingredients to enable them to ensure repeatability. 'Unlike large scale breweries the measurements are far more accurate, both for ingredients and for the quantity of water. 'The system is sealed and so is free from risk of infection. Brews are fresh and so no additives, colouring agents or preservatives are required. Beer industry experts Robert McLauchlan and Graham Steele have spent the last 10 years developing the Truebrew Technobrewery.Users have to fill it with water, add ingredients including hops and switch it on for two hours. Instructions and  readings such as the temperature are shown on an attached tablet (pictured) Inventor Mr McLauchlan, 67, from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warkwickshire, said: ‘Craft ale is the story of the moment and major brands are being shunned by consumers who now seek interesting and really good beers with local provenance. ‘Pubs can benefit enormously from this by brewing their own beer and that’s where Truebrew comes in.’ Landlords can create unique beers to attract customers. ‘And because they brew the beer onsite, pubs can guarantee it is fresh and there is no need for chemicals or preservatives or other additives that the public have no idea about,’ Mr McLauchlan said. The machine has just gone on general sale in the UK and will launch in the US in 'the next couple of months'.","Truebrew Technobrewery is designed for bars and pubs, not the home .

Making the most of the Spring sunshine, the 33-year-old was all smiles as she strolled through the vast crowds with friends before taking a seat in a private box.

The mother-of-one is a regular sight at Cheltenham and attended the races on all four days of the festival last year. This year has an added incentive for Zara, whose Grand National horse Monbeg Dude is due to run later this week. Purchased by husband Mike Tindall for £12,000, the horse finished in a respectable seventh place at Aintree last year - all the better given that Zara initially thought the animal was a dud.

She has also helped to train the horse and has been building a career as a racehorse trainer, with several of her animals entered in National Hunt races this season. Today, though, it was all about enjoying the races with the mother-of-one spotted laughing and joking from her perch in the box. First to run were the competitors entered for the Sky Bet Supreme Novices Hurdle, which saw jockey Ruby Walsh triumph aboard Duveen. Other highlights on day one included the Racing Post Arkle Challenge Trophy Chase and the big race of the day, the Stan James Champion Hurdle Challenge Trophy which was won by hot favourite Faugheen.

ODDS: 11/10 . He's called Faugheen the machine for a reason and it's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on Tuesday, despite the impressive field. Usual jockey, Ruby Walsh, is yet to decide his mount for the race, with stablemate and dual Champion Hurdle winner Hurricane Fly also lining up, but with fingers pointing towards Faugheen it's just another reason to back him. WEDNESDAY - QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE . HORSE: Dodging Bullets . ODDS: 4/1 . All eyes might be on Sprinter Sacre and Sire de Grugy, but Dodging Bullets has easily had the most impressive route to this year's Festival, and although a short price the Clarence House Chase winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting. THURSDAY: LADBROKES WORLD HURDLE . HORSE: Saphir du Rheu . ODDS: 9/2 . Paul Nicholls' stranglehold at the top of the World Hurdle betting has tightened again following Rock on Ruby's withdrawal. It's going to be very hard to pick which of the stablemates will be sent off as favourite, but with Saphir Du Rheu back over hurdles it can only be a good thing. He gallops and jumps well, and his Cleeve Hurdle win shows he can do it at Cheltenham . FRIDAY - GOLD CUP . HORSE: Carlingford Lough . ODDS: 10/1 . It's impossible to not back AP McCoy's last ever ride in the Gold Cup - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20-time champion jockey. There's still doubts whether favourite Silviniaco Conti can finally make it third time lucky at Cheltenham, but for the old romantics there's only one man that can win this year's Gold Cup, and it's AP McCoy.

"Iraq's government is investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Khorsabad in northern Iraq has become the latest to be attacked by Islamic State. Adel Shirshab, the country's tourism and antiquities minister, said there are concerns the militants had removed artefacts and blown up the site, located nine miles north-east of Mosul. Saeed Mamuzini, a Kurdish official from Mosul, said militants had already begun demolishing the Khorsabad site on Sunday, citing multiple witnesses. On Friday, the group razed 3,000-year-old Nimrud and on Saturday, they bulldozed 2,000-year old Hatra - both Unesco world heritage sites. Scroll down for video .

Other statues of winged bulls from Khorsabad can be found in the Louvre museum in Paris . UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has called the destruction a 'war crime'. A statement by his spokesman on Sunday night said Mr Ban was 'outraged by the continuing destruction of cultural heritage in Iraq' by ISIS. Khorsabad was constructed as a new capital of Assyria by King Sargon II shortly after he came to power in 721BC and abandoned after his death in 705BC. It features a city wall with a stone foundation and seven gates. Since it was a single-era capital, few objects linked to Sargon II himself were found. However, the site is renowned for shedding light on Assyrian art and architecture. The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls are now displayed in museums in Baghdad, Paris, London and Chicago. ISIS currently controls about a third of Iraq and Syria. Officials in the northern city of Mosul confirmed militants with the terror group have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. A file photo shows the temple to the Shamash sun god in Hatra . Iraq's minister of tourism and antiquities said the government was also investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Hatra in north west Iraq is being demolished by militants from the Islamic State group . The Sunni extremist group has been campaigning to purge ancient relics they say promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. Yesterday, officials officials  reported the jihadists have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. It comes after fanatics went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. A video released last week also showed them smashing artefacts in the Mosul museum. In January, the group also burned hundreds of books from the Mosul library and Mosul University, including many rare manuscripts. At a press conference earlier yesterday, Mr Shirshab said they have called for an extraordinary session of the UN Security Council to address the crisis in Iraq. 'The world should bear the responsibility and put an end to the atrocities of the militants, otherwise I think the terrorist groups will continue with their violent acts,' he said. ISIS extremists targeted a museum in Mosul using power drills and sledge hammers to destroy artefacts .","Witnesses say militants began demolishing ancient ruins at the weekend .

"Alexandra 'Al' Capone (pictured) was handed a two-year anti-social behaviour order after waging an alcohol-fuelled 'reign of terror' in Worthing . A woman called Al Capone who  waged an alcohol-fuelled 'reign of terror' in her seaside town has been accused of breaching her ASBO just days after being handed it. Alexandra 'Al' Capone, 40, from Worthing, West Sussex, was arrested after allegedly playing music so loudly it could be heard outside her £369,500 bright pink house -  just 11 days after being handed the two-year anti-social behaviour order. The average monthly rent for the four-bedroom house, which was once a lifeboat station, is around £1,400. It is unclear if Capone rents or owns the property. Brighton Magistrates' Court heard previously that her alcohol-fuelled behaviour led to late-night drunken arguments and Capone shouting and swearing at her neighbours. The ASBO bans Capone from 'causing a nuisance, alarm or distress to the public, using or threatening violence towards the public, being in possession of alcohol in a public place except on a licensed premises and being drunk in a public place.' She is also not allowed to make a noise within her home which is loud enough to be heard outside and is banned from having more than two visitors entering her home between 10pm and 8am. But officers have now arrested and charged her for breaching the ASBO imposed by magistrates for allegedly blaring out loud music which could be heard on the street outside her bright pink home. She has been bailed to appear at Worthing Magistrates' Court on March 24. A Sussex Police spokeswoman said: 'Alexandra Capone has been charged with breaching an anti-social behaviour order imposed by Brighton magistrates on February 24.

"Positive message: The Chancellor, pictured today in Tilbury, has portrayed Britain as ‘the comeback country’ with better times ahead . George Osborne yesterday used his final Budget before the election to help savers, low earners and homebuyers. Seizing on a run of excellent economic news, the Chancellor portrayed Britain as ‘the comeback country’ with better times ahead. He sought to blunt Labour’s lines of attack – notably on living standards – by declaring that families will be £900 better off this year than they were in 2010. By easing back his austerity plans to match the level of state spending under Tony Blair in 2000, he rubbished the Opposition’s apocalyptic warnings of a return to the 1930s. Tax cuts will be paid for in part by a £5billion double strike on the banks. Mr Osborne put thrift and home ownership at the heart of his nakedly political statement and said the ‘sun is starting to shine’. He delighted Tory MPs with a surprise announcement that 95 per cent of savers – many of them pensioners punished by years of low interest rates – are to be freed from paying tax on their life savings. A new personal savings allowance will mean they can earn up to £1,000 in interest without paying tax. With most accounts paying around 1 per cent, this would mean nest-eggs of up to £100,000 would be exempt. Other measures in Mr Osborne’s sixth Budget included: . Mr Osborne also sought to dispel perceptions that the Tories were friends of the rich by cutting pension tax relief for the best-off. With just 50 days to go to the election, he allowed himself a pat on the back for ‘historic’ jobs figures, published ahead of the Budget. There are now 30.9million people in work – an all-time high – with the coalition overseeing the creation of 1,600 jobs a day over the past year. Revealed: Mail analysis of the budget reveals how tax and National Insurance changes from April will affect your income from April . Debate: Sky News host Eamonn Holmes took the Chancellor to task in a series of post-Budget interviews given this morning . The public sector payroll is down to 5.4million, or 17 per cent of the workforce, a record low. But in a significant rebalancing of the economy, there are 2.3million more in private sector jobs than 2010. While Labour’s Ed Miliband had wanted the UK to follow the policy measures of socialist France, the British economy was now growing at seven times its rate, Mr Osborne said.Scroll down for video . And though Labour had claimed austerity measures would mean a million more unemployed, the ‘great county’ of Yorkshire had created more jobs than the whole of France on its own. ‘The sun is starting to shine – and we are fixing the roof,’ the Chancellor told MPs. ‘We took difficult decisions in the teeth of opposition and it worked. Britain is walking tall again. ‘Five years ago, our economy had suffered a collapse greater than almost any country. Today, I can confirm: in the last year we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world. ‘The critical choice facing the country now is this: do we return to the chaos of the past? Or do we say to the British people, let’s work through the plan that is delivering for you? ‘We choose the future. Our goal is for Britain to become the most prosperous economy in the world.’ George Osborne, pictured holding up his Budget briefcase for the cameras outside 11 Downing Street, yesterday used his final Budget before the election to help savers, low earners and homebuyers . Labour leader Mr Miliband said Mr Osborne had ‘failed working families’ and stuck to his claim that households are on average £1,600 a year worse off . Mr Osborne hailed better than expected growth figures, which suggest the economy will expand by 2.5 per cent this year. He also announced that the Government had met its target set in 2010 to see national debt falling as a share of national income by the time of the next election. The Chancellor said the beneficial effect on the public finances of lower inflation, plus a sell-off of a chunk of mortgage debts nationalised in the financial crisis, meant he could pay down some of Britain’s vast debt pile. He also said he would end the squeeze on public spending a year earlier than planned. By 2019, public spending would be growing again in line with the economy. Acknowledging the pain of years of austerity, the Chancellor said ‘the hard work and sacrifice of the British people has paid off’. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said public spending faces a ‘rollercoaster’ ride, with tough cuts between 2016 and 2018 followed by a surge in spending at the end of the decade. Labour leader Mr Miliband said Mr Osborne had ‘failed working families’ and stuck to his claim that households are on average £1,600 a year worse off. ‘This is a Budget that people won’t believe from a government that is not on their side,’ Mr Miliband told MPs. ‘Five years ago, what did the Chancellor say – “we will balance the books in five years”. No ifs, no buts – just like the immigration pledge. The only thing long term about his plan is that it will take twice as long to balance the books. That is the reality.’ Though the Tories have vowed to maintain protection for the NHS budget, Mr Miliband claimed they must have a ‘secret plan’ to cut it because ‘colossal’ cuts to other areas of spending would not otherwise be deliverable. The Lib Dems, who will today set out alternative plans for the years after 2016, claimed credit for the hikes in the personal income tax allowance.","George Osborne had portrayed Britain as ‘comeback country’ with better times ahead in his sixth budget .

"Electric vehicles are a useful tool for fighting sweaty city summers, according to a study published on Thursday. Switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug-in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island, it said. The term describes what happens when city temperatures are driven higher by heat from traffic and air conditioners and by warmth, stored during the day in roads and buildings, which is released at night. Switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug-in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island, researchers said. The term describes what happens when city temperatures are driven higher by heat from traffic and air conditioners and by warmth, stored during the day in roads and buildings, which is released at night. In some places, the buildup combines with a summer heatwave to inflict sweltering discomfort and heat stress. In some places, the buildup combines with a summer heatwave to inflict sweltering discomfort and heat stress. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, specialists in China and the United States said urban heat island creates a vicious circle. The hotter it is, the more people crank up their air conditioning, which in turn disgorges more heat into the street, and so on. The team calculated what would happen in Beijing if petrol- and diesel-powered cars and light trucks were replaced by their electric equivalent. Their simulation was based on the weather in the Chinese capital in the summer of 2012, when the city was three degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the surrounding countryside. Switching vehicles would have caused this to fall by 0.94 C (1.7 F), according to their model. 'Heatwaves kill, and in terms of climate change, even one degree can make a difference,' said Jianguo Liu of Michigan State University, who took part in the study. The theoretical switch would also save the city 14.4 million Kilowatt-hours in electricity each day -- the daily equivalent of 10,686 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The calculation took into account heat from the extra fossil fuel that would have had to be burned at local power plants to charge the electric cars. Electric vehicles emit only about a fifth of the heat of conventional cars. Electric vehicles emit only about a fifth of the heat of conventional cars. The team calculated what would happen in Beijing if petrol- and diesel-powered cars and light trucks were replaced by their electric equivalent. 'The replacement can mitigate heat island intensity, which can reduce the amount of electricity consumed daily by air conditions, benefitting the local and global climate,' the study said. The researchers sounded a note of caution, pointing out that urban heat island has a basket of factors, some of which are sketchy. Particulate pollution, city layout, building design, energy efficiency and parks are also believed to play a part in worsening or mitigating it. The computer simulation focused only temperature change and energy savings. It was not designed to factor in the cost of introducing electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure, nor did it estimate the health benefits from less pollution.

"A mother-of-three whose sex life was ruined after a negligent delay in spinal surgery has won £2.4million in damages from the NHS. Heather Tait was in tears yesterday when the award was announced at London’s High Court. The 34-year-old photographer had told an earlier hearing in Birmingham that her ‘passionate’ sex life with her husband Russel had been ruined by the complications she continues to suffer from. Heather Tait (left) was suffering from acute back pain when medics sent her home without carrying out an MRI scan . Judge Martin McKenna, who made the award, said Mrs Tait had told doctors that she ‘now feels that to a degree there is no point in having intercourse’. She also felt her closeness with her husband had been ‘jeopardised’ by her lack of enjoyment in sex. Mrs Tait, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, said as she left court: ‘I’m pleased that it is finally over.’ She was the boss of her own company and winning respect as a professional photographer before she went into Cheltenham General Hospital in July 2009, suffering from severe back pain. Judge McKenna – who only had to decide the amount of damages after a judgment was entered for Mrs Tait against the Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust in 2012 – said although it was suspected she had a prolapsed disc, she was sent home without an MRI scan. By the next day, Mrs Tait’s condition had deteriorated. She returned to hospital and a scan revealed a massive prolapsed disc. She had emergency spinal surgery at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham on July 8, 2009. The 34-year-old developed a devastating back condition after delays in emergency scans and treatment while being treated at Cheltenham General Hospital . The hospital's negligence left Mrs Tait 'doubly incontinent, with a loss of sexual sensation and some psychiatric damage,' London's High Court (pictured) heard . Judge McKenna said the trust had admitted if she had had the scan and surgery earlier, she would not have developed the severe injuries she now suffers from. Mrs Tait has been left doubly incontinent and ‘has suffered a loss of sexual sensation and some psychiatric damage’, the judge said. Cauda equina syndrome is a serious condition where the nerves at the very bottom of the spinal cord become compressed. Symptoms include: . Doctors advise seeking medical assistance immediately if a person develops these symptoms. They should visit their GP or the accident and emergency (A&E) department of the nearest hospital. If cauda equina syndrome is not promptly treated, the nerves to the bladder and bowel can become permanently damaged. Source: NHS Choices . She continues to suffer from back pain. As well as helping her husband to run a conferencing organising business – Crystal Clear Productions (CCP) – Mrs Tait ran her own photography business, Heather Tait Photography. Judge McKenna said she was not a person who would exaggerate her symptoms for profit. ‘She is a high achiever who has worked extremely hard throughout her life,’ he said. ‘She left school at 17 with ten GCSEs to pursue a career in theatre lighting and media, and she is, plainly, a capable, driven and ambitious woman with proven business skills, and a talented photographer who has been the driving force behind the success of CCP.’ He said that despite the effect of the delayed surgery, Mrs Tait had tried to continue her photographic business and complete the first year of a Masters degree at Birmingham City University. ‘To my mind these are not the character traits or indeed the actions of a malingerer or someone who is out to exaggerate her claim for financial gain,’ he said. Judge McKenna awarded Mrs Tait £140,000 for her pain and suffering and loss of amenity, with the balance made up of past and future care and loss of earnings. As well as paying £2.4million in damages, the trust must also pay legal costs estimated at £1.2million. The trust’s counsel, Robert Seabrook QC, said ‘continuous efforts’ were made to improve procedures and standards at its hospitals. He also expressed the trust’s ‘deep sympathy’ to Mrs Tait for the ‘terrible injuries she has suffered’. Mrs Tait said as she left court: 'I'm pleased that it is finally over.'","Heather Tait, 34, ran a thriving photography business and has 3 children .

"Friday’s solar eclipse across Europe could signal darker times and the ‘day of judgement,’ a pastor has warned. The timing of the eclipse, which comes a few weeks before a lunar eclipse, is apparently significant. Coinciding also with the spring equinox, the rare 'once in 100,000-year' event could indicate that trouble is brewing in Europe, according to the pastor. On Friday morning, Europe will be treated to a partial solar eclipse (1999 eclipse shown). But a pastor has warned that it coincides with a so-called 'blood moon'. This lunar eclipse, when the moon appears red, occurs a few weeks later. He said the chance alignment could be a sign of the end of times . The claim was made by pastor Mark Blitz for the Christian website Root Source in an interview with WorldNetDaily (WND). The partial solar eclipse on Friday 20 March is itself fairly rare, as the last solar eclipse in Europe occurred back in 1999. However, a few weeks later on 4 April, the third of four ‘blood moon’ lunar eclipses will take place, while it is also the first day of spring and the first day of the Jewish religious calendar. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth, and appears red due to light refracting differently and hitting its surface. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. ‘An event of this magnitude at the very beginning of the religious new year demands attention,’ Mr Blitz told WND. ‘As the Bible tells us, there will be signs in the heavens on the feast days, and this is a very significant sign on a critical day. ‘It’s the same day that there was the grand-opening ceremony of the tabernacle of Moses, with fire from heaven lighting the altar. Historically, this is a day of judgment.’ He also said it was ‘likely a message from God to the entire world.’ There will also be a partial solar eclipse on 13 September 2015, followed by the last of the four blood moons - known as a tetrad - on 28 September. The previous two occurred on 15 April and 8 October 2014. The so-called ‘blood moon prophecy’ is apparently a sign that the world is coming to an end. Mr Blitz said the last time there were four blood moons in a row, in 1967, Israel captured Jerusalem. A few weeks after Friday's eclipse, on 4 April, the third of four ‘blood moon’ lunar eclipses will take place, while it is also the first day of spring and the first day of the Jewish religious calendar. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth . ‘An event of this magnitude at the very beginning of the religious new year demands attention,’ Mr Blitz told WND.‘ As the Bible tells us, there will be signs in the heavens on the feast days, and this is a very significant sign on a critical day.' Shown is an illustration of the sun, Earth and moon in line . Back in the world of science, the eclipse on Friday marks a fascinating opportunity for observers to see the amazing mathematical coincidence take place in the solar system. This chart shows what times the eclipse will occur in the UK on Friday 20 March . Experts have warned, however, that no one should attempt to look directly at the sun without specialised solar glasses. Others have also said that the two-hour event could pose problems for solar power stations across Europe. About three per cent of the total European energy consumption comes from solar power, and scientists have warned that the risk of blackouts is greater than ever. The effects of a momentary dip in output has not been studied before, leading to the suggestion there could be a 'cascade of electricity blackouts' as power grids struggle to cope. Meanwhile, scientists will also be using the event to study one of the sun's biggest mysteries. A team based in Svalbard, north of Norway, will be hoping to use the event to find out why the sun's corona - its outer atmosphere - is hotter than its surface. The plasma of the sun is only visible during a total eclipse, so the scientists will use this unique opportunity to try and solve the puzzling phenomena. And in an amazing coincidence, the eclipse will occur over the North Pole on the same day the sun comes into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years.","On Friday morning, Europe will be treated to a partial solar eclipse .

"Allies of George Osborne last night denied he has given up hope of succeeding David Cameron – just as the Chancellor launched a new charm offensive. Just ten days before he is due to unveil a multi-billion-pound giveaway budget which could decide the result of the Election, Mr Osborne is working hard to boost his image. He took part in a magazine interview with the Financial Times which included ‘man of the people’ images of him building a dry stone wall. Dreams: Allies of George Osborne last night denied he has given up hope of succeeding David Cameron . The newspaper suggested Mr Osborne’s behaviour was at odds with a recent claim that he had abandoned hope of becoming Tory leader.

A burglar with a guilty conscience returned to a family's home to give them £400 in cash and apologise for breaking into their home while they slept, almost a year after the crime. Lee Bowen, 27, turned up at the house in Merthyr Tydfil in south Wales with a wad of bank notes to apologise for stealing mobile phones, a laptop and cash cards while they slept on New Year's Eve. But the astonished family decided his apology was not enough and reported him to police, with Bowen being promptly arrested. Jason Williams said the money was 'no compensation' for what Bowen had put his family through. The 'habitual criminal' had broken into the family home on New Year's Eve 2013 as they slept, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard. But plagued by a guilty conscience, he returned to the house in November and said 'I burgled your house last year.. I'm very sorry. Here's £400.' The family reported him to police and Bowen was arrested the following day. He admitted everything to officer, even taking them to the street and pointing out the house he had targeted. The court heard Bowen has appeared in court 19 times for 45 offences including six previous house burglaries. Andrew Davies, defending, said: 'Although a habitual criminal he is trying to get his life on track. He is attempting to turn his life around.' A judge let Bowen walk free from Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court because he is trying to 'turn his life around'. Recorder Paul Hopkins QC told him: 'I am satisfied that the time is right to give you the opportunity to make a life for yourself.' Bowen offered the family £400 in cash by way of apology but they reported him to the police over the burglary . Bowen, of Merthyr Tydfil, was given a 12-month community order with supervision after he admitted burglary. He was warned that if he breached it he could be looking at at least four years in jail. Bowen was also told to pay the family £700 compensation - £300 more than he offered on their doorstep.","Lee Bowen burgled a house on New Year's Eve 2013 as the family slept .

"A former mayor and her daughter have been banned from owning animals after they kept almost 70 pets in squalid conditions at their home. Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard, 63, and her daughter Maria, 24, kept a menagerie at their cramped semi-detached property in Horncastle, Lincolnshire. Their pets included 15 rabbits, a golden pheasant, two guinea pigs, five mice, two rats, a cat, two dogs, four domestic ducks, a goose and 22 chickens, a parrot and two ferrets. Squalid conditions: Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard (left), 63, and her daughter Maria (right), 24, kept a menagerie . Investigation: Neighbours contacted the RSPCA in January last year over concerns about the animals . Variety: Their pets included 15 rabbits, a golden pheasant, two guinea pigs,  a goose and 22 chickens . Neighbours contacted the RSPCA in January last year over concerns about the animals and officers discovered they were living in appalling conditions. Their home was in such a state that welfare officers said it was ‘knee-deep’ in faeces. The duo were found guilty of six animal welfare charges at Skegness Magistrates' Court in December last year. Yesterday they were banned from keeping animals for life and given an 18-month conditional discharge at the same court. Pamela Crisp-Beard - who was Mayor of Horncastle between May 1997 and May 1998 - was also ordered to pay £10,000 towards the costs of the RSPCA prosecution. Home: The mother and daughter kept the animals at their cramped semi-detached property in Lincolnshire . Dog's breakfast: Their home was in such a state that welfare officers found it was ‘knee-deep’ in faeces . Conditional discharge: The duo were found guilty of animal welfare charges at Skegness Magistrates' Court . Magistrates said they took into account that the offences were caused by ‘neglect rather than downright cruelty’ after the pair told the court they loved their pets. Pamela Crisp-Beard, who also served as a councillor between 2003 and 2011, told the court: ‘We love our animals. We always have done. All we have tried to do is look after them.’ The court heard the pair kept some of their animals indoors, including in a bedroom, at their home, while others were left in the back garden. RSPCA inspector Deborah Scotcher told the court when she visited the house her feet squelched on the hall carpets because they were sodden with urine. Caged: Magistrates said they took into account that the offences were caused by ‘neglect rather than downright cruelty’ after the pair told the court they loved their pets . Dirty: An RSPCA inspector said when she visited the house her feet squelched on the hall carpets because they were sodden with urine . Last straw: Shockingly, the rabbits had become so desperate to escape they had ‘created a network of tunnels’ through knee deep compacted faeces . Shocking mess: The court heard the pair kept some of their animals indoors, including in a bedroom, at their home, while others were left in the back garden . Shockingly, the rabbits had become so desperate to escape they had ‘created a network of tunnels’ through knee deep compacted faeces. Days gone by: Pamela Crisp-Beard in 1997 as Mayor of Horncastle with her daughter Maria, then seven . She gave the pair three days to improve the situation but when she returned there was no improvement. So the inspector came back a third time with two police officers and a vet on January 29 last year, and took the animals away. Pamela Crisp-Beard also pleaded guilty to two further charges of having a dog dangerously out of control in a public place. Jim Clare, prosecuting, said the first offence took place when a man was walking his poodle which was attacked by a lurcher-type dog owned by the Crisp-Beards. He added: ‘The lurcher had sunk its teeth into the poodle which was yelping and defenceless.’ The second incident involved a 13-year-old daschund which was also attacked by the lurcher while Pamela Crisp-Beard walked her two dogs. For these offences she was also given an 18-month conditional discharge and will also have to pay vet costs of £330 and a victim surcharge of £15. Ruth Harrop, defending, said both mother and daughter had suffered from mental and physical distress because of the case. She added: ‘Their inability to cope was neglect rather than cruelty. ‘They struggled to cope because of the sheer number of animals, many of which had been handed to them as rescues. They were not just pets but family members.’","Pamela Ann and Maria Crisp-Beard kept a menagerie at cramped home .

"The man was seized In Syria in February of 2013 . A Syrian man who was held hostage by a group which was absorbed into ISIS in 2013 has shared the story of his five-month ordeal. The anonymous man, who is Christian and works as a superintendent at a building outside of Beirut, Lebanon, was taken by a group called the Muhajadeen Shura Council in February of 2013. He had passed through 15 Syrian Army checkpoints after entering the country from Lebanon when the militants took him and another man who was also Christian. The men were handcuffed, put in a truck and driven to a location about eight hours away, the man told New York Magazine. Once they arrived, the men were blindfolded and chained to a wall. The militia members informed the second man they were going to kill him and told the first man something even more frightening. They said: 'We know everything about you. We know where your family lives, what their names are.' Scroll down for video . The Muhajadeen Shura Council (pictured) took the man and then joined up with ISIS while he was being held . Members of the Muhajadeen Shura Council would torture the man by beating, electrocuting and starving him . The men were tortured, beaten and starved. On one occasion, the man was forced to speak with his family on the phone while being electrocuted so they would hear him scream and feel more compelled to pay a ransom. Another time, they told the man if his family didn't pay in two days, 'We will make you call your family and tell them it's their fault you are going to die.' Later that day, group members took the second man into an adjacent room and shot him. A Christian man from Aleppo, Syria, was brought in and took his place. At some point the Muhajadeen Shura Council was absorbed by ISIS. When ISIS took over, they removed the blindfolds on the hostages. The man's family  paid ISIS about $80,000 to get him out and he was released in Aleppo, Syria (pictured) The man said the soldiers serving his new captors were 'brainwashed' and they hailed from countries including France, Belgium, Germany, Russia, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Tunisia. The ISIS soldiers continued to torture the men both physically and mentally, but they did not try to convert them to Islam. The man's family eventually paid ISIS about $80,000 to get him out and he was released into the streets of Aleppo. He estimated there were over 100 people being held during the course of his confinement, the majority of whom were Christian, and that 37 people were killed. The man said 'It is a hard life, being a hostage', and called his release 'The most wonderful feeling I've ever had'. ISIS held at least 23 foreign hostages in the same prison, including Americans Kayla Mueller and James Foley, the New York Times reported. Mueller and Foley are now dead, . British journalist John Cantlie, who was seized at the same time as Foley, is still being held.","Anonymous man was taken by group called the Mujahideen Shura Council .

"A mobile phone found at the scene of a brutal axe murder in which three members of the same family were killed was used to search details of an infamous U.S. axe killing. Parents Teresa van Breda, 54, and Martin, 55, and their eldest son Rudi, 22, were found dead at the family home in Stellenbosch, 50 kilometres east of Cape Town, in January. Henri van Breda, 20, suffered what police sources reportedly said were 'self-inflicted' wounds following the bloodbath at his family home. His sister Marli, 16, was the only other survivor of the horrific attack, but is still in no fit state to talk about the slaughter which left her with a slashed jugular vein and severe head injuries. Forensic police officers reportedly analysed the search histories of phones and computers in the house and found one mobile had been used to look up an axe attack carried out by a U.S. man on his parents in 2004, news24 reported. Scroll down for video . Henri van Breda (back left) and his sister Marli , 16, (front left) stand to inherit a slice of their parents' reported £10million fortune after their father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed in an axe attack in their home that left Marli with severe head and throat injuries . Chris Porco (left) was convicted of killing his father and severely disfiguring his mother Joan (right) with and axe in an attack in 2004. A phone found at the scene of the Van Breda murders was used to search information on the Porco attack . The phone was used to look up information about the attack on Peter and Joan Porco by their then-21-year-old son Christopher, which left Peter dead and Joan severely wounded. It was not said whose mobile phone was used to make the search. Porco is serving a prison sentence of 50 years to life . Porco was convicted of murder and attempted murder and is serving a prison sentence of 50 years to life. The case attracted a high level of media attention due to the fact Joan maintained her son's innocence during the trial and refused to testify against him. The story was the subject of a Lifetime movie titled 'Romeo Killer: The Chris Porco Story', which aired in 2013 and portrayed Porco as a wannabe playboy who attacked his parents after they complained about his bad college grades and wasteful spending. This comes after it emerged  both surviving Van Breda children have lawyers representing them in the division of their parents' ten million pound ($A19 million) fortune, South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper reported. Henri, who has been cared for by relatives since the attack, has a legal team led by Pieter Botha, who successfully fought to have his client Shrien Dewani cleared of the murder of his new bride, Anni. A lawyer has also been appointed for Marli, who is under police guard while she recovers at an exclusive rehabilitation unit. The attack, which took place in the early hours of the morning in the family's upstairs bedrooms seven weeks ago, claimed the lives of the children's mother Teresa, 54, father Martin, 55, and older brother Rudi, 22 . The van Breda family lived on the estate of the De Zalze Golf Club (pictured) about 50km east of Cape Town . Forensic evidence gathered at the scene, including the murder weapon, bloodied footprints and handprints is already with state prosecutors who believe they have sufficient material to make an arrest, even without Marli's eye witness account. Mr van Breda was a successful businessman who had enterprises in South Africa and Australia, where the family lived in Perth for seven years before returning to Cape Town last year. The home where the attack took place, on De Zalze secure golf estate in the winelands outside Cape Town, is among the assets to be sold off. Neighbours expressed shock that a killer unknown to the family could have entered and left the highly-guarded compound undetected by security guards and cameras. Physics student Henri, who called for help more than three hours after the brutal attack, claimed a man wielding an axe had set upon his loved ones while he was in a bathroom. When he emerged from the bathroom he killer hurled the murder weapon at him and knocked him unconscious. A recording of the call was leaked to the media. In it, Henri is heard to giggle as he is quizzed by the operator about the details of the attack. Henri van Breda, 20, was left with minor injuries following the slaying of his parents and older brother . The attackers left Marli (pictured) with a cut throat and 'severe' head injuries on the balcony of her home . When asked if his family were unconscious, he replied, 'yes and bleeding from the head' before what sounds like a quiet laugh can be heard. According to South Africa's YOU magazine, Henri has returned once to the scene of the killing, to collect some clothes and other belongings. However, he has not been allowed to see his sister since the incident, and she has been informed that her parents and brother Rudi are dead. A teenager living in a shack near the family's home also told the Sunday Times how he had been paid by Henri as a drug runner – and regularly delivered crystal meth to him, or 'tik' as it is known in South Africa. According to some reports, Henri had spent some time in an exclusive rehabilitation clinic, and had had his allowance cut by his parents shortly before the murders. A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family', they had previously lived in Perth . Mrs van Breda's brother, Andre du Toit is the guardian to both surviving children and Henri is being cared for by him and his wife at their home. A spokesman for the family, Ben Rootman, confirmed that, 'a joint Will drawn up in South Africa determines that a trust and the children born from the marriage inherit the South African estate. The family also had assets in Australia and these have been left to the South African families and to the trustees of the trust. These assets have not yet been fully determined.' According to South African law, the process of settling an estate is halted if an heir is arrested on a charge of murder and will only resume after court proceedings have been finalized. An heir is disqualified from inheriting if found guilty of murder.","Parents and brother were killed in brutal axe attack at Cape Town home .

"From babywear to wedding rings, ISIS supporters have been showing off their appalling taste in fashion on social media. Most ISIS merchandises appear to be cheaply made and poor quality, always adorned with the ISIS badge. The uninspiring fashion pieces have been seen being worn by fighters, mothers and babies living in ISIS territory in Syria and Iraq. ISIS Infant: Jihadi mothers have regularly posted pictures of their babies wrapped up in an assortment of terrible fashion creations. Indoctrinated: Young babies have been pictured, miserably wrapped in Islamic State flags and an assortment of ill fitting hats. Naturally nearly all the merchandises are based around the dull colour scheme of black and white. The uninspiring colours embody the values of the extremist group’s flag, the famous black banner long associated with Islamic State and radical Islam. Any other colour could be a hint of apostasy, or worse interest in the tight fitting world of Western clothes. From schoolbags to berets, ISIS's vile taste in fashion and merchandises knows no limits. Jihadi mothers in Syria and Iraq obsessively show off their little darlings, decked out in Islamic State’s latest naff fashion pieces. Young babies have been pictured, miserably wrapped in Islamic State rugs, highlighting the extremist group’s obsession with indoctrinating children from a young age. Oblivious to their unexplained allegiance to the group, their heads have been covered with an itchy looking hats with the ISIS logo emblazoned on in Arabic. Unaware of their fashion faux pas, some kids have been forced to wear mini ISIS military uniforms and t-shirts. Oblivious to their unexplained allegiance to the group, this ISIS child's head has been covered with an itchy looking hat, emblazoned with 'God is Great' in Arabic. Other children have been kitted out in ill-fitting military uniforms, struggling to hold onto the rifle which has been thrusted into their arms for the photo. School children have been photographed, proudly wearing ISIS branded school bags as they walk to school. One young girl is pictured posing from behind to show off her own ISIS draw string bag. Wearing a thick quilted pink coat, matching gloves and a niqab, the seven old is dwarfed by the heavy bag.

Cheap rings and watches seem to always be on show, with jihadists desperate to show off their appalling taste in fashion. For the fighters, one of the essential fashion items  is the wrist watch, specifically cheap, digit time pieces, easily found in Syria and Iraq. Casio watches are one of the most popular brand in Syria and Iraq, appealing to many fighters due to their durability and low cost. In contrast, Senior ISIS figures seem to prefer more expensive tastes in watches. ISIS’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was spotted wearing an expensive Omega watch when he declared the creation of the caliphate in July 2014. Fashion statement: One jihadi fighter proudly shows off his oversized watch, cheap ring and silver pistol. Bling ring: Ridiculous wedding rings, overloaded with nasty cheap stones and coated in imitation silver are also highly popular in Islamic State territory. Suspect style icon: A fashion conscious South African jihadi shows off his latest accessory, an Islamic State ring. Rings are another accessory which many fighters seem to buy the moment they join ISIS. With weddings happening on regular basis, fighters are always keen to show off their latest tacky assessory, cheaply made from a plastic mould. Some wealthier fighters have posted pictures of their ridiculous wedding rings, overloaded with nasty cheap stones and coated in imitation silver. The ring box appears to be of better quality than some of the rings being sold in Islamic State. Nasty looking hats and oversized t-shirts are considered stylish by some fighters in Syria and Iraq. The balaclava and martyrs headband are a popular purchase among ISIS fighters. Uninspiring black T-shirts and uncomfortable looking headbands have also been mass produced by the radical terror group. Dodgy Western style baseball caps, complete with a large ISIS logo on the front, are also popular sellers for sun conscious fighters. Likewise, the snood is another atrocious fashion piece, regularly spotted being worn by ignorant ISIS fighters on the battlefield in Iraq. Once a fashion piece worn by Premier League footballers, the snood is another atrocious style icon regularly spotted being worn by ignorant ISIS fighters on the battlefield in Iraq.

An array of unflattering sunglasses are also regularly shown off by jihadis on social media. Despite their hatred of the West, ISIS fighters love to show off their latest pair of western branded trainers. Nike is always a favourite brand, popular for their style and comfort. However not all ISIS supporters like jihadi fighters wearing the Western brands. One fighter Abu Sarayah, was embarrassingly criticised by another radical ISIS supporter on social media user, who called him a disbeliever for wearing the trainers. ""Wearing Nike is the same thing as wearing clothes with crosses"", commented the disgruntled user. Another ISIS supporter waded into the argument and insisted Nike trainers were fine because they were comfy and good quality 'unlike crosses.'

The wreckage was brought back to the Netherlands, where civil and criminal investigations are underway to establish the cause of the disaster and attempt to prosecute those responsible. Since the horror, Moscow has repeatedly claimed that MH17 was shot down by a Ukrainian warplane in the skies close to the Malaysian plane, while also vigorously denying the West's analysis that it was hit by a BUK missile fired by pro-Moscow rebels.

"Robert Durst spent the night before his arrest wandering around New Orleans' French Quarter with a loaded .38-caliber revolver in his pocket, claims a nightclub doorman who accosted him. The millionaire real-estate heir and murder defendant was arrested on Saturday at the JW Marriott hotel, where cops found the gun and marijuana stashed in his room. John Phillips, 32, a doorman at the Mahogany Jazz Hall Burlesque and Absinthe House said Durst approached him just before midnight on Friday. Robert Durst spent the night before his arrest wandering around New Orleans' French Quarter with his loaded .38-caliber revolver in his pocket, claims a nightclub doorman . 'I asked him to come into the club, but he said in a female-ish soft voice, ""I would like to come in, but I can't right now,""' Phillips told the New York Post. Durst, 71, then pulled open his brown-tweed suit jacket to reveal the butt of the gun in a belt holster, Phillips said. 'I thought to myself, I hope this old guy with a gun doesn't do anything stupid.' Phillips said that 'the whole exchange took less than a minute' outside the club and Durst 'just stumbled a little as he walked down the block.' 'I just thought he was an old man who was a little bit off. I kept thinking this old guy is on too much prescription medication.' Durst, 71, was arrested on the eve of Sunday's final episode of 'The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst,' and he agreed on Monday to face trial for the murder of Susan Berman, who had vouched for him in public after his wife vanished. The final episode ended with the whispered words of Durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom. 'There it is. You're caught!' Durst whispered before the sound of water running can be heard. 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' John Phillips, 32, a doorman at the Mahogany Jazz Hall Burlesque and Absinthe House said Durst revealed to him that he was carrying a weapon . The whispered words of Durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom could come back to haunt him - or help him - as he faces a murder charge . Now those words could come back to haunt him — or help him — as he faces his murder charge. A possible move by prosecutors to introduce the incriminating material from a six-part documentary on his strange life and connection to three killings could backfire as interview footage did in the Michael Jackson molestation trial and the Robert Blake murder case. In both cases, the defense was allowed under the 'doctrine of completeness' to provide segments of interviews that presented their clients favorably without subjecting them to tough cross-examination. 'I submit that Blake didn't have to testify and Michael Jackson didn't have to testify because the prosecution foolishly wanted to introduce portions of their interviews,' said attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr., who represented both men. 'They just got greedy. They were mesmerized by portions they thought could help them.' In the Jackson case, the defense used unaired footage to counter damage done by Living With Michael Jackson, a damning documentary in which Jackson held hands with his accuser and spoke of letting children into his bed. 'I'd slit my wrists before I'd hurt a child,' Jackson said in one outtake shown by the defense, according to Mesereau, who won the performer's acquittal 10 years ago. Michael Jackson's lead defense attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr. said the so-called incriminating material from the Durst documentary could backfire as interview footage did in the Jackson molestation trial in 2005 . In the Durst case, prosecutors could seek to play portions from The Jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay. Actor Robert Blake, left, talks with his attorney, M. Gerald Schwartzbach: Prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence . While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing. 'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.' In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview. 'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person. In this video, he came across as a very sympathetic person.' Prosecutors are not commenting on the Berman case while Durst is still held in Louisiana, where he also faces firearms charges.","Durst spent the night before his arrest wandering around New Orleans' French Quarter with his loaded .38-caliber revolver in his pocket .

"Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself in 2012 after she was sexually assaulted at a party . One of three teenagers who admitted that they sexually assaulted a 15-year-old Northern California girl who later committed suicide has settled a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by her parents - because he said sorry. In 2012, Audrie Pott fell asleep after drinking Gatorade laced with alcohol at a friend's party in their hometown of Saratoga. She awoke to find her pants off and lewd comments scribbled over her body. Her family says she hanged herself days later after learning cellphone photos were taken of her during the assault and shared through text messages. Three of Audrie's teenage classmates were prosecuted in private juvenile proceedings and sentenced to between 30 and 45 days in juvenile hall. Two continue to attend Saratoga High, while the third transferred to high school about an hour south in Gilroy. Audrie's parents, Lawrence and Sheila Pott, filed a civil lawsuit against the boys to hold them more accountable for their actions. Their attorney, Bob Allard, said the parents decided to settle with one of the teens because he showed remorse and 'told the truth' about what happened to Audrie. 'He's accepted responsibility. He's told us the truth of what happened in that room. The others have not,' Allard said. 'They're still standing by their claim that Audrie was awake and consented to their acts.' Anger: Larry Pott and and Audrie's stepmother and his second wife Lisa, are continuing their lawsuit against two of their daughter's attackers after one admitted and apologized . Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012 . Tormentors: The three teenagers (pictured with their faces obscured) pleaded guilty to sexual assault last year and were sentenced to 30-45 days in a juvenile detention facility . Allard said that had the two other teens apologized, they might not have been sued. 'If they had simply knocked on the door of the Pott household, apologized, accepted responsibility and jumped headfirst into our quest to educate our youth by, for example, speaking at high schools about the mistakes they made and how this can be prevented, there would be no civil lawsuit,' Allard said. Audrie's parents led the campaign to pass a California law which allows prosecutors to seek harsher sentences for juvenile sex offenders who take pictures of their crimes and use them to bully the victims. The trio of teenagers whom Daily Mail Online is not identifying because they are minors, pleaded guilty in January 2014 and were sentenced to 30 to 45 days each in a juvenile detention facility. Pott, from Saratoga, California, hung herself September 10, 2012 - just eight days after the teens digitally penetrated her at an alcohol-fueled Labor Day party and took pictures of her in a compromised state. The 15-year-old girl felt humiliated after she discovered that the cellphone photos showing her naked body covered in lewd comments written in marker had been shared with students at her school. In February, Pott's parents tried to get all three expelled from their schools - which they returned to after their sentences. Cruel: Pott, right, was assaulted after a night of drinking and boys spread photos of the attack . They launched a petition on the site Change.org calling on the principals of Saratoga High School and Christopher High School to expel the three perpetrators responsible for Audrie’s 'slut-shaming.’ At a party in early September 2012, Audrie Pott drank alcohol-laced Gatorade and woke up without her shorts on, with her face painted black and with mocking comments written in indelible marker all over her body. Over the course of the next week, Audrie learned that cellphone photos had been taken of her during the assault, which involved digital penetration, and shared with students at the school she attended with the three attackers. 'My life is over...I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' Audrie said to a classmate in the days following the incident. She then pleaded with the boys to delete the photos. 'I swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.' Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' Left behind: Audrie is pictured left with her father, step mother and half brother and sisters . Eight days after the attack, on September 12, 2012, Audrie hanged herself in a bathroom at her mother's house. In police interviews, the teenagers admitted to coloring half of her face black with marker, then pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals. They photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days later, scores of students had seen the images. Rolling Stone magazine has revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom she had known since middle school. She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images. 'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.' 'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body. She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her. 'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.' She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.'","Parents of Audrie Pott reach financial settlement with one of three teens .

"Isolated, labelled as freaks and facing a life of begging and prostitution - meet India's transgender women who have been ostracised from their communities but cling to the dream of finding love. In India, there are up to 1.2million transgender people, also known as hijras. Earlier this year, the country's first transgender mayor was elected and less than 12 months ago the Supreme Court granted legal recognition to the community as a third gender. To an outsider, it might be assumed that these hijras - described as 'men minus maleness' - are able to lead peaceful lives without fear of discrimination, but this could not be further from the truth for some. Scroll down for video . Isolated: In India, there are up to 1.2million transgender people, also known as hijras. They are ostracised from their communities . Change: Less than 12 months ago the Supreme Court granted legal recognition to the community as a third gender . Hijras live together in houses where a chief or godmother acts as leader. There are no men and they adopt a combination of Hindu and Muslim cultures . Hidden: Aside from going to work, hijras usually don't go out in public and most restaurants will not let them dine there . Her parents had high hopes for their first son, but from a young age Saranya was different from other little boys. Showing her femininity resulted in severe punishment and by the age of 16 she felt exhausted, suppressed and judged. Saranya fled her home in the western city of Pune and took refuge with her new transgender family in Bangalore in the south of the country. Hijras live together in houses where a chief or godmother acts as leader. There are no men and they adopt a combination of Hindu and Muslim cultures. They refer to each other as mothers, sisters, aunts, grandmothers and great-grandmothers. When Saranya was accepted into her transgender family, she underwent her toughest challenge - her physical transformation. The painful operation - known as Nivran, or rebirth - involves the removal of the penis and testicles and is carried out at home while the patient is awake. Traditional: They have maintained a traditional Indian style, in contrast to many middle and upper class women who have cut their hair and wear western clothing . The hijras wear traditional Indian clothing and apply makeup in their transgender homes - which are often small, dark and damp . Religion: They adopt a combination of Hindu and Muslim cultures and  refer to each other as mothers, sisters, aunts, grandmothers and great-grandmothers . Prostitution: Many are encouraged to become prostitutes due to the financial benefits as well as beg in return for blessings . Now 58 years old, Saranya has lost contact with all but one member of her family - her sister. Aside from going to work, hijras usually don't go out in public and most restaurants will not let them dine there. Instead, many prefer to stay within the safety of their transgender homes, giving each other companionship and dreaming of finding husbands. Even if they do marry, some hijras do not live with their husbands - perhaps seeing them monthly or as little as once a year - and often the marriages have unhappy endings. For work, hijras traditionally beg and give blessings in return, as well as dance and entertain. Many are also encouraged to become prostitutes due to the financial benefits. Even if they do marry, some hijras do not live with their husbands - perhaps seeing them monthly or as little as once a year - and often the marriages have unhappy endings . Aside from going to work, hijras usually don't go out in public and most restaurants will not let them dine there . The rights of transgender people may be changing, but even the country's first mayor has admitted to being a former beggar . Beauty: They have maintained a traditional Indian style, in contrast to many middle and upper class women . Hijras often live in poverty - in damp, dark homes with no beds or furniture. Yet, there is an obsession with keeping them clean and neat. They have maintained a traditional Indian style by wearing saris and bindis, in contrast to many middle and upper class women who have cut their hair and wear western clothing. But Saranya's hands are covered in wounds and scars - each of which has its own painful story. One angry customer attacked her with a knife instead of paying, another scar is the result of abuse from two drunk men. Saranya's story may be painful but it is certainly not unique. The rights of transgender people may be changing, but it seems discrimination is still rife. Even the country's first transgender mayor is a former beggar. Friendship: They often prefer to stay within the safety of their transgender homes, giving each other companionship . Hijras are described as 'men minus maleness' and face a life of Isolation, begging and prostitution . New lifes: Some hijras flee their homes and find refuge with her new transgender families where they start new lives . Employment: Traditionally, hijras beg and give blessings in return, as well as dance and entertain . Just months ago she was scratching out a living singing and dancing on trains for a few rupees from commuters. But in January, Madhu Bai Kinnar began leading her community as India's first transgender mayor - a dramatic election result that upends cultural mores in the traditionally conservative country. Kinnar won the election in Raigarh in the central state of Chhattisgarh, beating her rival from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by more than 4,500 votes. Madhu Bai Kinnar, centre, has become India's first-ever transgender mayor after abandoning her life of singing and dancing for change to put herself forward to represent her community . Television pictures showed the 35-year-old draped in a saree and with a large red bindi on her forehead, folding her hands and greeting supporters who placed marigold garlands around her neck amid strobing camera flashes. Kinnar, a member of the Dalit caste previously known as the 'untouchables', put herself forward for election when she was asked to represent her community. 'People have shown faith in me. I consider this win as love and blessings of people for me. I’ll put in my best efforts to accomplish their dreams,' Kinnar said. 'It was the public support that encouraged me to enter the poll fray for the first time and because of their support only, I emerged as the winner.' Kinnar's win comes nine months after India's top court ruled that transgenders be legally recognised as gender-neutral. Often known as 'hijras' in South Asia, transgenders are classified as people who have had sex change operations or who regard themselves as the opposite of their born gender. Activists say there are hundreds of thousands of transgender people in India, but because they were not legally recognised, they faced ostracism, discrimination, abuse and forced prostitution.","There are up to 1.2million transgender people, known as hijras, in India .

"A woman conned her husband into thinking that he was the father of her son after undergoing IVF treatment using her ex-boyfriend's sperm, a court heard. The husband, who has not been named to protect the identity of the child, said that in 2004, he and his wife travelled to a clinic in Barcelona, Spain, where he gave a sample of his sperm. But he claims a few months later the woman returned to the clinic without him and was impregnated with her ex-boyfriends sperm instead. The couple have since divorced. The man, a lecturer in his 60s, claims that he paid more than £80,000 in maintenance towards the child over a number of years and is now seeking more than £100,000 in damages. A woman conned her husband into thinking that he was the father of her son after undergoing IVF using her ex-boyfriend's sperm, a court heard. Above, image of embryos being selected as part of the process . The businesswoman, who is representing herself at the hearing, says there is 'no merit' in her ex-husband’s claim. Barrister Thomas Brudenell, who represented the man at Central London County Court, said his client was claiming damages for 'deceit'. He said the man did not know at the time that his wife, who is in her 50s, had used her ex-boyfriend's sperm, although it was 'now quite clear what had happened'. Mr Brudenell said the little boy was born in late 2005 and when he was around six months old the couple separated. Divorce proceedings began and their divorce was finalised in 2008. He addded the man looked after the child when the woman was working and paid more than £80,000 in maintenance over the following few years .

"A talented designer has come up with a real 'floating palace' that is sure to catch the eye of superyacht owners. Lujac Desautel's SALT concept is very much a luxury item. But it is no celebrity-style motoryacht; it is a 180ft yacht, complete with two masts and huge sails. The living quarters resemble a glass box, offering stunning views 24/7 and the glass area can be folded away so as to open up the yacht and take in the sea air. There are also steps that can be folded down into the sea giving you your very own swimming pool. Scroll down for video . Lujac Desautel's SALT concept is a 180-foot vessel with sails instead of a motor that is very much a luxury item . The downstairs area resembled more like a pool-side lounging section, with easy access for a quick dip in the sea . Included on board is a dining area that can cater for 12 people, a cocktail bar and even an interior garden. There is one master cabin, two VIP cabins and two twin-bed residences. The yacht is a progression from Desautel's GLASS structure which was inspired by skyscrapers and Lego and resembles a gleaming block rising from the sea. Instead, this sailing yacht is a somewhat more dreamy offering. 'The world is a laboratory of ideas that can be borrowed,' Desautel writes on his website. 'Certain typologies can evolve because they have adoptive features. SALT could be thought of as an evolution of these preconceived ideas.' A walk down to the lower deck offers a stunning balcony view that can also act as a sun trap . The yacht is a progression from Desautel's GLASS structure which was inspired by skyscrapers and Lego . For any crew employed there are also four twin-bed cabins in a separate part of the yacht. On his website Desautel describes how he believes 'great design offers an authentic beauty that invites people to consider experiencing the world in a different way; perhaps a way they never imagined.' Desautel was last year nominated for Young Designer of the Year by Boat International Media and is a Bachelor of Architecture Student at California College of the Arts in the US. Although the ideas are only at the 'design' stage, it is hoped the innovative and futuristic superyacht may well be just what one millionaire is after. The upper deck offers relaxing space, and despite the choppy seas there are plenty of facilities to keep you relaxed on board . Benjamin Maltby, Principal Consultant at MatrixLloyd – the worldwide authority on superyacht purchase and construction – gave MailOnline Travel his views on the SALT concept. 'I really like many of SALT's features. Sure, it's been created by a young designer – and this shows – but with a little further investment it could be turned into a glorious, ground-breaking vessel. 'The great thing about superyachts is that no planning permission is needed to build one – there are just some common sense safety regulations to be met. So buyers can make a floating space that's truly a reflection of their personalities and aspirations. The superyacht is very much a futuristic design, the brainchild of talented yacht lover Lujac Desautel . 'I love the water-yacht interfaces. For years, too many designers viewed superyachts as floating houses. It took a long time for the ‘beach club’ concept to be accepted (this is where hinged parts of the hull fold outwards to create platforms down by the water’s edge) – now they’re de rigueur for engine-driven superyachts. 'SALT’s beach club at the back is an idea that’s not been tried as yet, but it’d be great as it offers a shady area that’s also surrounded by water on three sides. 'The steps on the side are wonderful, but some thought would be needed as how and where they would be stored when not in use as weight on a sailing superyacht must always be carried as centrally and low as possible to counteract the action of the wind on those sails.'","SALT is the latest superyacht concept by US based designer Lujac Desautel .

"An Adelaide hospital has been named the third most expensive building in the world, putting it ahead of glitzy skyscrapers in Dubai, London and Singapore. The Royal Adelaide Hospital was named on a list of the world's most expensive buildings compiled by building data company Emporis, beaten only by New York's One World Trade Centre and the Palace of Parliament in Bucharest, Romania. The revamped hospital, which is currently under construction, will cost a staggering $US2.1 billion ($A2.7 billion) compared with the One World Trade Centre which cost $US3.9 billion ($A5.04 billion) to build and the Palace of Parliament which cost $US3 billion ($A3.9 billion). The New Royal Adelaide Hospital was named on a list of the world's most expensive buildings . The revamped hospital, currently under construction, will cost a staggering $US2.1 billion ($A2.7 billion) The South Australian government said the State Budget would need to account for an extra $177 million in funding for the hospital in December last year . The 800-bed hospital due to open in April 2016 but an independent review has concluded the project won't be finished until the second half of that year . The top 10 was rounded out by Las Vegas resort The Palazzo and London's The Shard, both at $US1.9 billion, the Taipei 101 at $US1.76 billion, Dubai's Burj Khalifa (the tallest building in the world) at $US1.5 billion, Singapore's CapitaGreen at $US1.5 billion, Kyoto Station at $US1.25 billion and Hamburg's Elbphilharmonie at $US1.03 billion. Another Adelaide building - Myer Centre – was the next Australian construction on the list at number 13, costing $US1 billion. The next most expensive Australian buildings were Sydney's Chifley Tower at number 16, costing $US1 billion, and Sydney's ANZ Bank Centre, costing $US800 billion. The list has been adjusted to take currency movements into account and considers both buildings under construction and existing buildings that were built after 1976. Construction economics expert Timothy O'Leary said the Royal Adelaide Hospital would be the most expensive building ever built in South Australia. The world's most expensive building is the One World Trade Centre in New York which cost $A5.04 billion . Second on the list was Romania's Palace of Parliament which cost $US3 billion ($A3.9 billion) 1. One World Trade Center, New York City - completed in 2014 for $US3.9 billion . 2. Palace of the Parliament, Bucharest - completed in 1988 $US3 billion . 3. Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide - completed by 2016 for $US2.1 billion . 4. The Palazzo, Las Vegas - completed in 2007 $US1.9 billion . 5. The Shard, London - completed in 2013 for $US1.9 billion . 6. Taipei 101, Taipei - completed in 2004 for $US1.76 billion . 7. Burj Khalifa, Dubai - completed in 2010 for $US1.5 billion . 8. CapitaGreen, Singapore - completed in 2014 for $US1.4 billion . 9. Kyoto Station, Kyoto - completed in 1997 for $US1.25 billion . 10. Elbphilharmonie, Hamburg - completed by 2016 for $US1.03 billion . 'And it's the type of building that costs a lot of money – it's a number one hospital that will service the health needs of the state for decades to come,' said Mr O'Leary, from the University of South Australia. 'It's certainly a big deal for Adelaide because it's being funded by taxpayers.' Mr O'Leary said it was difficult to assess costs of the project and how they would pay off in future. 'There's no way to know if it's value for money without comparing it to other similar projects,' he said. 'Probably what's missing from that list is there must be other big hospital projects in the pipeline around the world that are quite expensive.' 'The list does not seem to be comprehensive, as similarly priced hospitals such as the Gold Coast Hospital in Queensland and the Fiona Stanley Hospital in Western Australia have been omitted, as have other high profile buildings from around the world, such as the Westfield London shopping centre (cost approx. $3bn),' said a statement from South Australian Health. 'Upon completion the new Royal Adelaide Hospital will deliver state of the art care in one of the most advanced hospitals in the world,' the statement said. Other recently built Australian hospitals missing from the list include the Fiona Stanley in Perth, which opened in 2014 and cost $A2 billion and the Gold Coast University Hospital which opened in 2013 and cost $A1.76 billion. On Wednesday the former Gold Coast University Hospital project director was appointed temporary manager of the Adelaide project after program director Andrew Nielsen stepped down. This comes after the South Australian government said the State Budget would need to account for an extra $177 million in funding in December last year. The Palazzo - a luxury resort on the casino strip in Las Vegas - was completed in 2007 and cost $US1.9 billion . The Shard skyscraper in London was completed in 2013 for $US1.9 billion . The 800-bed hospital due to open in April 2016 but an independent review has concluded the project won't be finished until the second half of that year.

"The Archbishop of Adelaide has been charged with covering up child sex abuse. It is alleged Philip Wilson tried to hide abuse carried out by another priest in the 1970s, The Australian reported. Wilson was appointed archbishop for the South Australian capital in 2011. Philip Wilson has been charged with covering up child sex abuse carried out by a priest in the 1970s . The charge comes after it was revealed the senior figure in the Catholic Church did not report priest Jim Fletcher who was accused of paedophilia while they were working in the Maitland region, north of Sydney in New South Wales. Fletcher ended up serving prison time from 1989 to 1991 after he was convicted of raping a 13-year-old boy. Five years later, the convicted paedophile died. A Special Commission of Inquiry conducted last year handed down that Fletcher 'had an extensive history of perpetrating child sexual abuse in the diocese, exclusively abusing young males, particularly altar boys'. Philip Wilson arrives to give evidence during the Royal Commision into child abuse at the Federal Court in Adelaide last year . It is thought Wilson is the most senior Catholic official in the world to face charges of this nature (pictured above is St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican) Wilson is thought to be the most senior Catholic official in the world to face charges of this nature and if sentenced, could face up to two years behind bars, News Corp reported. NSW police said a 64-year-old man was charged after allegedly concealing 'a serious offence regarding child sexual abuse' in the Hunter region. The charge is the result of an investigation by Strike Force Lantle, which since 2010 has probed allegations of concealment of child abuse by former and current clergy attached to the Maitland-Newcastle Diocese of the Catholic Church. Police said a future court attendance notice related to the matter was served in South Australia on Tuesday. It comes as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse continues in Sydney. Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Sydney's Knox Grammar School, gave evidence . A former Roseville College student, Lucy Perry, accused Dr Paterson of touching her on the buttocks, which he denies . The matter is listed for Newcastle Local Court on April 30. This charge comes as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse continues in Sydney. Explosive claims have been made during the hearing, including allegations of extensive abuse carried out at Knox Grammar School on Sydney's North Shore. Dr Ian Paterson, the school's headmaster from 1969 to 1998, admitted to impeding a police investigation into allegations of paedophilia from teachers while he was giving evidence earlier this month. While a former Roseville College student, Lucy Perry, told the inquiry about an incident where she claims Dr Paterson touched her on the buttocks during a joint rehearsal of a musical with Knox. But the former headmaster has vehemently denied the allegation, saying he 'absolutely not' touch Ms Perry in 1989 when she was 15.

"A former bodybuilder given just weeks to live after being diagnosed with cancer today blamed his 10,000-calorie a day diet and energy drink addiction for triggering the disease. Dean Wharmby was told he had just weeks to live in November after a large tumour was found on his liver. But he is still battling the disease five-and-a-half months later, thanks, he believes, to cutting out sugar and relying on natural remedies. It is a huge turn-around for the 39-year-old, who told MailOnline he turned to a diet of burgers, pizzas and bacon sandwiches - washed down with seven to eight cans of energy drink - to create the 'perfect' bodybuilder's physique. Scroll down for video . The former bodybuilder from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, ate 10,000 calories a day as he tried to get bigger . But Dean Wharmby now believes his high-protein, high-fat diet may be 'a contributing factor' which cause his illness. Pictured: Mr Wharmby before he go sick (left), and afterwards (right) Mr Wharmby was given three weeks to live by doctors in November but - after committing to a healthy diet, which completely cuts out sugar - he has lived for a further five-and-a-half months . But he now believes the high-protein, fatty diet he lived on for four to five years may have led to his illness, first diagnosed in 2010. 'It was because I was trying to be as big as possible,' Mr Wharmby told MailOnline. 'I can't say it was the diet for sure, but things like the energy drinks could be contributing factors. Red meats - all things we have found out have so many impurities in them now. 'I think it was a combination of it all.' Mr Wharmby had been a  bodybuilder for 20 years before he became ill. In the beginning, he admits to taking steroids for about a year to create his physique because 'everybody did it'. But he soon turned his back on them, as he began to build his personal training business. It was then his diet took a turn for the worse. 'I could train seven clients in a day, back-to-back,' he said. 'Then I would have to have the energy to train myself.' He added: 'I was constantly on the go.' Dean Wharmby was on a high-calorie diet for four to five years, as he tried to get make his body as big as possible. Here, he reveals what he ate during an average day. Breakfast: An entire pack of bacon, made into eight sandwiches and a protein shake 2,500 calories . Snack: A steak muffin (sandwich) 225 calories . Snack: Two sweet potatoes and a full chicken 1,190 calories . Snack: A protein shake 262 calories . Snack: Two protein bars 580 calories . Snack: Large McDonalds Quarter Pounder meal with a diet Coke 855 calories . Snack: Supermarket bought pizza - normally pepperoni 888 calories . Dinner: Chips or rice with three chicken breasts or a steak 783 calories . Snack: 400g of beef on its own 1,000 calories . Supper: 15 boiled eggs 1,170 calories . Snack: Protein shake 262 calories . Total: 9,715 calories a day . But that is not all: . Overnight, Dean used to wake up every two hours to eat either a full pack of Jaffa Cakes, a jar of peanut butter, or more protein bars - pushing him over the 10,000 calorie-a-day mark . Mr Wharmby said his hectic lifestyle meant he turned to fast food to get the calories he needed . Some days, he would see seven clients back-to-back - and would fit eating every two hours around them . Mr Wharmby found the energy from seven to eight cans of energy drink while eating every two hours. And while some of it was typical bodybuilder fare - protein shakes, eggs and chicken - other bits were less conventional. Mr Wharmby would grab a McDonalds for a snack, and a pizza on the way home - which he would eat while his girlfriend of five years cooked dinner. At his biggest, he was 20 stone. But then the personal trainer from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, became unwell five-and-a-half years ago, and doctors discovered a growth. Mr Wharmby and partner Charlotte Rigby (pictured) started to research natural medicine after his diagnosis . He was offered chemotherapy and a liver transplant, but he decided to turn both down in favour of natural remedies. 'I refused it from day one,' he said. 'The main reason why I chose to do natural instead of artificial was because I wanted to live. I didn't want to die.' But that meant he needed to completely rethink his diet, which was full of things like acids - which he believes help cancers thrive. And for a year, it was successful: Mr Wharmby's tumour disappeared. 'But I got complacent,' he admitted. 'The old lifestyle crept in again.' In 2013, he collapsed outside the gym where he was working as a trainer, and rushed to hospital. For the majority of the next year, he returned to his healthy regime. But then things started to go wrong: he broke up with his girlfriend briefly, and found himself homeless - making it hard to concentrate on getting better. By November, he was in hospital 'hooked up to every machine you could think of'. Doctors said he had just three weeks to live. The tumour had got too big to operate, and there was little the doctors felt they could do. 'I was offered chemotherapy, but doctors basically said there was no point,' Mr Wharmby said. Mr Wharmby, at his heaviest, weighed 20 stone - something he admits was also not good for his body . Mr Wharmby and Miss Rigby, who have been together for five years, hope to inspire others with his new diet . It is not known exactly what causes liver cancer, but research has suggested diet could be a factor. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease - which is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes - has been linked to cases of liver cancer. The disease occurs when small deposits of fat build up in the tissue. But while it is a common condition, in some cases, with people who have high levels of fat the liver can become inflamed. This can scar the liver over time - causing cirrhosis, which is linked to many cases of liver cancer. Energy drinks, meanwhile, have been linked to cases of bowel cancer by scientists in Scotland, according to The Scotsman.  It was also reported earlier this year that some energy drinks have as many as 20 teaspoons of sugar in them. Sources: NHS Choices . So he and girlfriend Charlotte Rigby - his 'rock' - began his healthy regime once more. They also began fundraising to help pay for the treatment costs and have attracted more than 2,000 likes on Facebook by regularly posting videos of his progress. He has also visited a doctor in London - and is hoping to shrink his tumour by using natural medicine. Mr Wharmby is also hoping to inspire others through social media to live more healthily. Ms Rigby, 27, said: 'There are lots of examples out there of people beating cancer naturally, even when they've been told there's nothing conventional medicine can do for them. 'The support Dean has received has really lifted him. People have been so positive and it has really made a difference to his attitude. 'Now he's determined to inspire others to live more healthily.' Mr Wharmby added: 'It has been very difficult but I'm 100 per cent determined to beat this. 'And five-and-a-half months later, I'm doing something right.'

"A fearsome nine-foot-long crocodile that hunted by running on its hind legs was one of the world's top predators before the arrival of the dinosaurs. Carnufex carolinensis, which means 'Carolina Butcher' due to its ferocious appearance, was an early ancestor of modern crocodiles. Paleontologists believe it roamed the warm, wet rainforests of what is now North Carolina around 231 million years ago, preying upon small armoured reptiles and early mammals with its powerful jaws. Carnufex carolinensis, shown in the artists impression above, would have chased down prey on its hind legs and probably crunched its way though small armoured reptiles and early mammals with its long powerful jaws . Researchers discovered fossilised parts of the ferocious crocodilian's skull, spine and forelimbs in a rock formation in Chatham County, close to Sanford, North Carolina. Dr Lindsay Zanno, assistant research professor at North Carolina State University and director of the palaeontology lab at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, said the fossil could help provide new clues about the evolution of crocodiles. Name: Carnufex carolinensis . Meaning: Carolina Butcher. Carnufex is Latin for Butcher while Carolina refers to the state of North Carolina where the fossil was found. Age: The reptile lived 231 million years ago . Distinctive features: It had a long slender skull with a bony boss running from side to side. Its fore limbs were short and it probably ran on its larger hind limbs. Skeleton location: It was found in Chatham County, North Carolina. Importance: The fossil will help scientists unravel the evolution of early crocodiles. Running on its hind legs, Carnufex would have been the top predator in the area during the Triassic period. She said: 'Fossils from this time period are extremely important to scientists because they record the earliest appearance of crocodylomorphs and theropod dinosaurs, two groups that first evolved in the Triassic period, yet managed to survive to the present day in the form of crocodiles and birds. 'Until we deciphered the story behind Carnufex, it wasn’t clear that early crocodile ancestors were among those vying for top predator roles prior to the reign of dinosaurs in North America.' The scientists, whose work is published in the journal Scientific Reports, used high-resolution scanning techniques to reconstruct Carnufex's skull from the fossil fragments. They found that the skull was unexepectedly slender, at least 50cm in length, with an ornamented boss running across the top of the skull. They said that Carnufex is one of the world's earliest and largest early crocodile ancestors. Scientists reconstructed the skull of Carnufex carolinensis, shown above, using 3D scanning technology . At the time it was alive North Carolina was part of a super-continent called Pangea and was in the warm, wet equatorial region. Other large predators like rauisuchids and popsauroids, cousins of the ancient crocodiles, roamed much of the southern Hemisphere. They would have hunted alongside many of the early theropod dinosaurs that began to emerge at the same time. Carnufex was a large early crocodile and is marked in red above alongside other early crocodile species . Prehistoric crocodiles were able to run around like dogs to escape the jaws of predatory dinosaurs. This is according to a study published last year that showed, for the first time, how the reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world. Today, most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish, but their ancestors ran around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales. The study, by Bristol University, revealed how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable the fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments. The team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the Mesozoic - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years. The study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the Jurassic seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey, such as fish. Sample of jaws from the Mesozoic crocodile record . The research also found that variation peaked again in the Cretaceous period- 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food. The research also found that variation peaked again in the Cretaceous period- 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food. After the devastating end-Triassic extinction event, crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish. They also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the Cretaceous Period - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs, including eating plants. Surprisingly, the lower jaws of Cretaceous crocodiles did not have a huge amount of variation. Instead, the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy, such as armadillo-like body armour. However, the dinosaurs did not come to dominate until 135 million years later when many of these large crocodylomorphs died out. The smaller ancestors of modern crocodiles, which looked more like modern day foxes but without fur, managed to survive. Dr Zanno said: 'The discovery of Carnufex, one of the world’s earliest and largest crocodylomorphs, adds new information to the push and pull of top terrestrial predators across Pangea. 'These animals hunted alongside the earliest theropod dinosaurs, creating a predator pile-up. Modern crocodiles like the Nile Crocodile pictured above are the descendants of the smaller and lighter crocodylomorphs that survived the extinctions at the end of the Triassic period and the rise of the dinosaurs . 'Theropods were ready understudies for vacant top predator niches when large-bodied crocs and their relatives bowed out. 'Predatory dinosaurs went on to fill these roles exclusively for the next 135 million years.' Susan Drymala, a palaeontologist at North Carolina State University who was also involved in the research, added: 'As theropod dinosaurs started to make it big, the ancestors of modern crocs initially took on a role similar to foxes or jackals, with small, sleek bodies and long limbs. 'If you want to picture these animals, just think of a modern day fox, but with alligator skin instead of fur.'","Carnufex carolinesis pursued reptiles and early mammals on its hind legs .

"Mothers are now as likely to go out to work as women without children, figures showed yesterday. The historic landmark reached last year means just one mother in four stays at home to raise children. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed 74.1 per cent of mothers with children under 16, or between 16 and 18 if they are still at school, are regarded as ‘participating in the labour market’. By comparison, 75 per cent of women without dependent children were either in work or looking for a job last year. Mothers are now as likely to go out to work as women without children, figures showed yesterday . In the mid-1990s, only two thirds of mothers had jobs, while then, as now, three in four childless women were working. The gap has closed because there are now half a million more women with children under five in work, or looking for jobs, than in 1996. There are also 200,000 more women with children aged between five and ten in the labour market. Mothers were briefly more likely to have jobs than women without families in 2013, the ONS report revealed, but last year more than 350,000 childless women entered the growing labour market. The latest figures will be welcomed by Coalition ministers. Chancellor George Osborne said in his Budget speech on Wednesday that a key element of the Government’s ‘massive moment’ in job creation, giving Britain its highest-ever employment rate, was ‘more women in work than ever before’. Ministers have claimed credit for raising state subsidies for childcare from £2billion to £3billion a year since 2010. But critics of the Government’s drive for more mothers to go out to work say many are reluctant to do so and would prefer to stay at home to bring up their children. The historic landmark reached last year means just one mother in four stays at home to raise children (picture posed by models) Author and family commentator Jill Kirby said the figures were a result of government efforts to persuade mothers that ‘children are better off in childcare’, adding: ‘Children are losing out – a string of different childcare workers is no substitute for the love of a mother.’ Imogen Thompson, of the pressure group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘We question whether this is what all women want, or whether many are forced into returning to the labour market before they feel they, or their children, are ready.’ The new estimates are based on the large-scale Labour Force Survey covering women who either have jobs or are unemployed and looking for work. The ONS report said benefit changes that have pressed single parents into looking for work may have influenced the change. It added: ‘Other government policies, for example to fund 570 hours of free early education childcare a year in England for all three to four-year-olds, will have provided additional incentives to engage with the labour market.’ The biggest change has been among mothers of children under five. In 1996, 1.6million of them were in the labour market, compared with 2.1million last year. This represents a rise from 54.5 per cent of mothers of under-fives in work in 1996 to 65 per cent now. More mothers of older children are also working, but the rise has been much less steep, while the rates for women without dependents have not changed in nearly 20 years. The report said 74.5 per cent of all adult women had jobs in 2014, compared with 71.3 per cent in 1994. The most popular jobs for women are either in teaching and education, or ‘caring personal services’, including medical work, or in shops.","Just one in four mothers stay at home to raise their children, figures reveal .

"Facebook has already begun flying its giant drones designed to bring internet access to the world, Mark Zuckerberg has revealed. 'As part of our effort to connect the world, we've designed unmanned aircraft that can beam internet access down to people from the sky,' he posted on his Facebook page. 'Today, I'm excited to share that we've successfully completed our first test flight of these aircraft in the UK.' Zuckerberg revealed the final design will have a wingspan greater than a Boeing 737 but will weigh less than a car. It will be powered by solar panels on its wings and it will be able to stay at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet for months at a time. Facebook aims to use a mix of solar-powered aircraft and low-orbit satellites to beam signals carrying the internet to hard-to-reach locations. The drones, flying at 65,000ft (19,800 metres), will be capable of staying in the air for months. They are relatively cheap and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals. The drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on Earth. Low-orbit and geosynchronous satellites, which have orbits that match the Earth’s rotation and are effectively stationary, will cover more remote areas in Africa and Asia. The internet access would be transmitted in the form of free-space optical communication, or FSO, which transmits data using infrared laser beams. 'The final design will have a wingspan greater than a Boeing 737 but will weigh less than a car. 'It will be powered by solar panels on its wings and it will be able to stay at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet for months at a time.' 'Aircraft like these will help connect the whole world because they can affordably serve the 10% of the world's population that live in remote communities without existing internet infrastructure.' At Facebook's f8 conference in San Francisco, the firm's Facebook's chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer revealed the firm thought drones were key to getting connectivity around the world. 'This basically mean going to the sky,' Schroepfer says. He showed off the Aquila, an Internet-connected unmanned drone with the wingspan of a 737 and the 'mass of a small car.' At a summit in New York earlier this year, Facebook's engineering director announced the vehicles will be closer in size to jumbo jets, than traditional drones, and they'll soar at 65,000ft (19,800 metres). Following the tests, it could then be just three to five years until the super-sized, solar-powered drones are hovering  above remote parts of the world to provide internet access. Yael Maguire, engineering director of Facebook’s Connectivity Lab, told the Social Good Summit that the planes will be ‘roughly the size’ of a Boeing 747, but much lighter than the popular aeroplane, which weighs around 600,000lbs (272,155kg) without passengers or fuel. Facebook previously said the drones will be 'relatively cheap' - although did not specify a cost - and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals. The California-based tech giant has joined forces with Nokia, Qualcomm, Samsung and other tech firms to develop the planes in an initiative called Internet.org. Facebook has revealed more details about its plans to provide web access to the world. Drones as large as jets are set to extend the reach of Wi-Fi around the world. They will be powered by the sun and hover some 65,000 feet (19,800 metres) above the ground . Today, around 2.7 billion people have access to the internet, which is just one third of the global population. The members of the initiative said in a report that connecting the world is 'one of the fundamental challenges of our time' and they plan to do it using a variety of technologies, including drones. 'The final design will have a wingspan greater than a Boeing 737 (pictured) but will weigh less than a car,' said Zuckerberg. 'When people have access to the internet, they can not only connect with their friends, family and communities, but they can also gain access to the tools and information to help find jobs, start businesses, access healthcare, education and financial services and have a greater say in their societies. 'They get to participate in the knowledge economy,' the report said. A recent study by Deloitte found that the internet is already an important driver of economic growth in many developing countries. Expanding internet access could create another 140 million new jobs, lift 160 million people out of poverty and reduce child mortality by hundreds of thousands of lives. In terms of how this could be achieved, Mr Maquire has previously explained that Facebook is 'looking at a new type of plane architecture.' The drones are set to fly at 65,000ft (19,800 metres), because this altitude is a point where winds are at their lowest. It's also above commercial airliners, and even above the weather, and this means the drones will be able to safely stay in the air for months at a time. ‘These planes are solar-powered and they sit there and circle around, and have the ability to broadcast internet down.’ Facebook’s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in March that the social network’s Connectivity Lab was building ‘drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone' The large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful signal that covers a city-sized area of territory with a medium population density, according to Internet.org. The large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful sThe drones will be tougher and able to fly for longer periods of time than balloons, while also being able to have their location precisely controlled. In March this year, Facebook acquired British drone maker Ascenta for an estimated £12.5 million ($20.2 million). The company is run by chief engineer Andrew Cox who has helped set records for the longest flights for unmanned aircraft powered by the sun.","Facebook's drones are set to soar at 60,000ft for months at a time .

Earlier on Thursday, Amanda – who in 2013 penned memoir Waiting to be Heard about the murder case and her four years in jail - was spotted with her fiance writing on a notepad in the backyard. The Italian court is set to decide if it will uphold a 2013 ruling declaring Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of the 2007 killing of the British exchange student. The decision was due on Wednesday but has been delayed. And today, Sollecito's lawyer launched a last-ditch attempt to save his own skin and blow a hole in American's defense. The former lover was compared to a 'Forrest Gump' caught up in events beyond his understanding. Knox and Sollecito had originally been convicted in 2009, but were acquitted in 2011, allowing Knox to fly back to her hometown in the US, although the verdict was then reversed in 2013. There are a number of possible outcomes to the trial: Either both Knox and Sollecito will be found guilty, they will both be declared not guilty, one will be convicted but not the other, or the whole thing could go back for another round of appeal. Even if the trial does end in a conviction, former judge Mike Heavey – who has long championed Knox’s cause and become close to her family, even being invited to her wedding - says he feels there is little chance of her being extradited to Italy for the 28 and a half year sentence she has been handed if convicted. Earlier in the day, sitting in the afternoon sun, Amanda Knox calmly wrote in her journal in mom's backyard . If declared guilty, the decision to extradite Amanda back to Italy ultimately rests in the hand of President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry . Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online, he said: ‘I imagine it’s been very tense for [the Knox family]. I’m optimistic the case will be dismissed and they’ll be acquitted. ‘Well respected scientists are coming in and debunking the DNA evidence against them and public opinion [in Italy] has gone from 90% against to around 80% for her. ‘Raffaele was in court Wednesday which is good. They never really aimed at Raffaele, it’s always been Amanda, Amanda, Amanda. Very sexist, by the way, very anti-American. ‘But this has been a witch-hunt, as if it was Salem, Massachusetts, 1691. No different except that it goes global. ‘And it titillates a great percentage of people, they find is fascinating, this idea of a sex orgy gone wrong and two pretty girls that was originally put forward by the prosecution.’ Referring to the 2003 kidnapping and transportation to Egypt of Italian cleric Abu Omar by the CIA and the subsequent conviction in absentia by an Italian court of ex-CIA operative Robert Seldon Lady for that crime, he added: ‘There’s good reasons to dislike the Americans, we’ve done a lot of bad things around the world, I can agree with a lot of their criticisms. Ms Kercher, a 21-year-old student from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in Perugia in 2007. The house in Perugia where British student Meredith Kercher was murdered aged just 21 in November 2007 . Raffaele Sollecito is pictured leaving Rome's Supreme Court on Wednesday as Italy's top judges delayed  a ruling on whether to uphold his and Amanda Knox's conviction for the murder of student Meredith Kercher . Rudy Guede is serving a 16-year sentence for his involvement in Kercher's death after a separate trial . ‘Our CIA kidnapped an Islamic cleric, an Italian citizen, and they can’t get their minister of justice to ask the US for an extradition, they can’t get it done, so they’re frustrated. ‘[But in this case] Raffaele is collateral damage. If we confirm their convictions, we send an innocent Italian man – and the people probably won’t like that – to prison, and the [Italian] Minister of Justice probably won’t even ask for extradition, but even if he did are they going to pick a fight with the United states of America on a false claim? ‘The kidnapping of an Italian citizen – that’s a legitimate claim and they still don’t want to take on the USA. So are they going to take on the US on a B.S. claim? ‘No. It’s a fraud, and everybody knows it and everybody is playing along.' If Knox is declared guilty, the decision to extradite her back to Italy ultimately rests in the hand of President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry.","Hours before her fate is to be be decided by Italy's highest court, Amanda Knox and her fiancé take a walk outside her mother's home .

"Oysters which have been grown at a West Country site for the first time in 120 years have been given the highest status, which means they can be eaten directly from the sea. The oysters have been grown at Porlock Bay in Somerset for the first time since the natural crop was decimated by powerful trawlers which swept the beds clean. Now locals are reaping the benefits of a community-led project to reintroduce the shellfish industry to the area, with the ripening of the first crop. Oysters have been grown for the first time in 120 years in Porlock Bay in Somerset following a community-led project and have been grown in seawater classed as so pure they can be eaten directly from the sea . The oysters are considered to be grown in such pure seawater they have been given grade A status by the Food Standards Agency. This means they can be eaten directly from the sea without having to be treated or washed. Only one other area in the UK has the same status. Locals in Somerset have been seen with mobile stalls on the beach, offering people the chance to sample the first harvest from the waters for more than a century. Oysters from Porlock Bay were once a sought after delicacy, supplying many restaurants in London throughout the 1800s. But after the natural crop were ruined, a community project was launched. Porlock Bay oysters used to be served in London restaurants in the 1800s when the crop was plentiful . The crop has ripened for the first time in 120 years and sellers were seen on the beach with the shellfish . The oysters are being grown and harvested by a just five locals who have joined forces to bring the industry back to the area. The group, known as Porlock Futures, are trying to raise £90,000 to set up the business properly over the next five years. They hope to make the business the first community sustainable shellfish farm in England and Wales. Roger Hall, one of the organisers of Porlock Futures, told the Western Morning News: 'We need £90,000 to set the business up properly over next five years – that will pay for premises, stock, packaging, cleaning and so on. The new crop of oysters are considered such high quality they have been awarded grade A status . The crop of oysters has been grown by the Porlock Futures project, a group of five local volunteers . In trying to raise part of that money in the community, we sent letters out asking for a loan to match-fund any grants – and in less than three weeks we've had 74 positive replies from people in the parish with around £40,000 on offer.' Mr Hall said he hopes that Porlock Bay oysters could be back on the market, at least on a small scale, by mid-summer. Experts said that oysters taste differently depending on the water they are in and what they are feeding on.","Porlock Bay oysters used to be served in London restaurants in the 1800s .

"As many as 200,000 boys and girls are kidnapped in China every year and sold openly online, it’s been reported. Child trafficking has been a long-standing problem in China, but despite the efforts of the authorities, the sinister practice is thriving, leading to thousands of families being torn apart. The US State Department believes that 20,000 children are snatched every year – that’s 400 a week. Scroll down for video . As many as 200,000 boys and girls are kidnapped in China every year and sold openly online, it’s been reported . However, Chinese state media says the figure could be as high as 200,000, according to the BBC. Baby boys, who are preferred in China because they’ll ensure the family name remains intact, can sell for as much as £10,500. In a bid to evade the spotlight of the police, child traffickers in recent years have turned to the internet to do their selling. Last year hundreds of babies were rescued by police in China after a crackdown was launched on trafficking infants. The nationwide bust saw 1,094 people arrested as officers acted on information relating to four major internet-based baby trafficking rings. China's Public Security Ministry said 382 babies were rescued after four websites were found to be selling children under the guise of adoption. Baby boys, who are preferred in China because they’ll ensure the family name remains intact, can sell for as much as £10,500 . Some critics say the trade is fuelled by the country’s one-child policy. The strict laws limit many families to one child, and with boys being favoured as heirs to the family name, many female babies are sold - typically fetching half the amount boys do - aborted or abandoned. Poverty fuels the trade, while illicit profits tempts traffickers, resulting in a thriving market for babies and toddlers. An investigation by the BBC revealed the plight of one father, Xiao Chaohua, who has not seen his son since February 2007 after he disappeared from their home in Huizhou, aged five. Since then Mr Chaohua has scoured the nation and even taken out TV adverts in an effort to find him, but to no avail. He claims that the problem of trafficking can only be eradicated if tougher laws are brought in to punish those to buy kidnapped children. Presently, they face a three-year jail term if caught, but it’s claimed that many never find themselves in trouble over their actions.","Child trafficking a long-standing problem in China despite efforts of police .

"Vegetarians look away. If you've ever craved the smell of fast food all day long, Burger King has come up with the ultimate solution with the launch of a new burger-scented cologne. The cologne will supposedly imitate the signature aroma of the Whopper Burger, which consists of 100 per cent flame-grilled beef, freshly sliced onions, lettuce and mayonnaise. The scent, which has been named Flame-Grilled, is set to be launched by Burger King Japan on 1 April 2015. Scroll down for video . Burger King Japan's new cologne, 'Flame-Grilled' is set for launch on 1 April 2015 . Not for vegetarians: 'Flame-Grilled' will smell like the Whopper Burger: beef, fresh onions, lettuce and mayonnaise . 'Flame-Grilled' will set you back 5000 yen - which comes to around £27. Pricey. There will also supposedly be a one day promotion, whereby every customer will receive a free Whopper Burger with their purchased perfume bottle. It's apt that the release of the perfume would fall on 1 April (April Fools' Day), and many have speculated that the 'launch' is in fact a global practical joke. While many people are doubtful of the launch's authenticity, the fast food chain insists that the upcoming release is not a hoax. In fact, this isn't the first time that it's launched a fragrance. In 2008, Burger King unveiled a men's spray, dubbed Flame, which was promoted as 'the scent of seduction with a hint of flame-broilled meat'. Flame was only available online and in certain stores in New York, and was discontinued shortly after its launch. April Fool's? While many people think that the cologne is a hoax, the advert insists the authenticity of the cologne and sees it retailing for 5000 yen, which is around £27 .","Burger King Japan is promoting a new scent called Flame-Grilled .

"It was popularised by artists like Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton in the fifties and sixties. But now it would appear country music is more popular than ever. Chart history was made on Sunday as the first ever home-grown British country act shot into the top ten with a debut album. Scroll down for video . The Shires, comprised of Crissie Rhodes from Bedfordshire and Ben Earle from Hertfordshire, made it to tenth place in the Official UK Album Chart . The feat follows the meteoric rise of US country star Taylor Swift who has had two number one albums in the UK. Relatively unknown until now, The Shires, comprised of Crissie Rhodes from Bedfordshire and Ben Earle from Hertfordshire, made it to tenth place in the Official UK Album Chart with their debut album Brave. The pair, both aged 26, overtook established band Hozier and came just behind Paloma Faith when the results were announced on Sunday. Their position sees them sit alongside big names such as Kelly Clarkson, Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith in the charts. Their feat has been described as ‘truly remarkable’ for a country band and is evidence the genre is shifting eastwards from its heartland in Nashville, Tennessee. Country band The Shires now sit alongside the likes of Paloma Faith and Ed Sheeran (pictured) in the charts . Official Charts Company chief executive Martin Talbot said: ‘This is a fantastic feat by this young British country duo. No UK country act has ever made this kind of impact on the chart before – it is truly remarkable.’ BBC Radio 2’s Bob Harris added: ‘I’ve been doing the country show for 15 years now, and in the whole of that time I’ve never known things to be quite as exciting as they are today. Country is now appealing to a completely new, young generation.’ The genre has experienced a renaissance in recent years. Last year Dolly Parton returned to perform at Glastonbury to huge critical acclaim.","Country band The Shires make it into the Official Album Chart's top 10 .

"Motorists in Los Angeles were stunned after a Second World War-era bomber flew low over the highway as it approached Van Nuys airport in California. The B-29 Superfortress is the same type of aircraft which bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki to force Japan into surrendering, . The aircraft, which was built in 1945, did not take part in the war, and despite the B-29 seeing service in Korea, the aircraft, dubbed Fifi, was not involved in that conflict either. Scroll down for video . The B-29 bomber was photographed as it approached Van Nuys airport in Los Angeles as port of a nationwide tour . Extremely low and incredibly close: The aircraft was rescued in 1971 by a group of enthusiasts who returned it to flying condition . The B-29 was the bomber which delivered the first atomic bombs to HIroshima and Nakasaki and remained in service until September 1960 . The historic aircraft was discovered in 1971 and underwent a full restoration, returning it to a flying condition. The aircraft flew into Los Angeles as part of a publicity tour where fans have the ability to gent onboard the historic aircraft and even buy tickets for a short spin. A seat in the cockpit costs $1,045 while guests pay $575 for a seat further back in the aircraft. The bombadier's seat in the nose of the aircraft is the most expensive at $1,595. The aircraft is owned by the Commemorative Air Force after their members found it at the US Navy's proving ground in Chine Lake, California. The plan was being used as a target for naval gunnery. Amazingly it was not destroyed . For more than 30 years the aircraft was powered by its original engines, but they required replacing in 2006. The owners commissioned a specialist company to supply and fit some custom built engines allowing the aircraft to remain in the air. Boeing began developing the B-29 in 1939 as a long-range heavy bomber with four engines. The B-29 was the first bomber to have a pressurised cabin and it was also equipped with remote control guns . The aircraft was revolutionary as it was pressurised, meaning the crew did not have to use oxygen masks while on a mission. It was also the heaviest production aircraft at the time. According to Boeing, the aircraft also had remote control guns. Most of the B-29 fleet was involved in the war against Japan, with 1,000 bomber raids targeting Tokyo. However, the Enola Gay delivered the first atomic bomb to Hiroshima, while the Bockscar bombed Nagasaki three days later. After the Japanese surrender, the B-29 saw service in Korea and was used for anti-submarine patrols, weather reconnaissance and rescue duty. It was eventually retired in 1960. Meanwhile, the Imperial War Museum in Duxford has built a scale model of the B-29 as part of its American Air Museum. The model was constructed by local schoolchildren.","The historic aircraft was built by Boeing in 1945 and was returned to flying condition after it was purchased in 1971 .

"Special bond: Gunner Amy Stevens and Highfield (H.P), who is retiring . The poignant message on a tombstone outside the HQ of The King’s Troop at Woolwich Army barracks says it all: ‘Here lies an old horse called Wonder, his extraordinary age being forty years old when he died. This stone was placed August 1, 1808.’ Of course, that was back in the days when horses really went to war. One can only imagine the battles Wonder courageously survived. But the fact that Wonder lived to such a ripe old age — in human years, well over 100 — is testament to the fact that even when horses were used on battlefields, the British Army valued and looked after them. Today, the four-legged members of The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery housed at Woolwich don’t have to charge at the enemy, thank goodness. They perform only ceremonial duties, such as Trooping The Colour, state funerals and military tattoos. The worst they have to cope with is galloping through theatrical smoke at the Horse Of The Year show. What’s more, they live in a luxurious state-of-the-art equestrian training facility, with an army of grooms tending to their every need. They enjoy 24-hour care, with a dedicated vet and farrier on site. They are exercised daily in the arena or hacked out in nearby Charlton Park. Once a year they go on a four-week summer holiday to Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, where they spend time out at grass. And yet, despite this, animal rights activists launched a withering attack on the MoD last month, accusing the Army of being cruel to horses. Campaigners from Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) claimed the military should not be allowed to keep any animals at all. They seized on figures showing the MoD had put down 109 of their horses in the past six years as evidence of neglect. Anyone with experience of horses — like me — will tell you that figure is actually quite modest considering the MoD has 500 horses in its care at any one time at Woolwich, where The King’s Troop is stationed, and at Knightsbridge, where the Household Cavalry is based. Activists singled out figures showing that horses were put down because they fell lame or suffered from colic. They suggested the MoD did not try hard enough to re-home horses who could no longer work. Again, any horse owner will know that colic and leg injuries in equines are all too often serious enough to warrant euthanasia and that it is sometimes the only option. However, this didn’t stop the activists. Mimi Bekhechi, director of Peta, complained: ‘The Ministry of Defence has no business using horses, dogs or any other animals. They are not soldiers, nor are they pieces of military kit to be used and then decommissioned at the end of their involuntary service. ‘While painless euthanasia is the only humane option for sick or wounded animals, a combat zone is no place for them.’ But no horses are used in combat now. What the animal rights lobby appear to be campaigning for, therefore, is an end to the role of horses at official events. This is a worrying development. The artillery fire a 41 Gun Royal Salute in Green Park in honour of Her Majesty The Queen's 87th birthday . They perform only ceremonial duties, such as Trooping The Colour, state funerals and military tattoos . For anyone who feels proud to watch the magnificent spectacle of our gleaming military horses on parade at Buckingham Palace or on The Mall, it seems unthinkable. What’s more, anyone who visits the Woolwich base can see that they are incredibly well cared for. By any standards, The King’s Troop headquarters is an amazing facility. Everywhere you look, soldiers are sweeping, scrubbing and polishing. The horses are in peak condition. Their coats are glossy, manes neatly trimmed. If they actually bothered to visit, the naysayers would see that the horses look as happy as can be. As he shows me round the stable blocks, Captain Nick Watson explains that the soldiers become incredibly attached to the animals in their care. They put years of painstaking work into training them. Almost all are bought as four-year-olds, mostly from Ireland, and stay in service until 18. Every effort is then made to find them civilian homes where they can kick up their heels. But military chiefs readily admit it can be tricky finding the right home. It is not just a simple case of turning them loose in a field or handing them over to the first person who comes through the door. These are working animals who are used to an interesting and varied life. On parade, the unit’s soldiers drive a team of six of the horses with each pulling World War I field gun. They perform in front of massive crowds and so it is imperative that they stay calm and perform their duties unflustered. Those coming up to retirement age include 18-year-old Doughnut, a quiet bay mare who nuzzles me gently when I pet her over her stable door. A typical ‘war horse’, according to her handlers, she never makes a fuss. She featured in last year’s Trooping The Colour and will take part in the Queen’s birthday parade again in June this year — one last time, perhaps. Like the rest of the troop, Doughnut is smaller than the huge black horses of the Household Cavalry. The King’s Troop features some horses who are just over 15 hands (5ft), so they are lighter to manoeuvre. ‘She’s awesome,’ says Sgt Andrew Higson, who rode Doughnut at the last British Military Tournament to take place at Earl’s Court, in 2013. ‘She’s had more outings than people have had hot dinners. She’s worth her weight in gold. Anyone new who can’t ride when they come here, we put them on her and she looks after them.’ They will miss her terribly, but want her to go to a home where she won’t be overworked. The King's Troop horses pictured in 1952, leading King George VI's through wet London streets . ‘She has had a full career,’ says Sgt Kathryn Charters. ‘So, we want her to take it easy. Our vet will stipulate that she is rehomed only to someone who will not do too much with her, perhaps just lightly hack her.’ Another horse they will be sad to lose when he retires is Junior, also 18. As he gallops and bucks around the arena, you can see how incredibly fit he still is for his age, perhaps living up to his name. Junior has performed in all the Queen’s birthday parades, the Windsor Horse Show, the British Military Tattoo, the Horse Of The Year Show and the Olympia Horse Show. Like Doughnut, he featured in last year’s Trooping The Colour and will again this year. Whenever a horse is deemed unfit to work, it goes through a process called ‘casting’, whereby it is found a new home. The military never needs to advertise because there are always willing takers. The horses are sold in a negotiation that involves the potential new owner putting in a bid. Only if it is reasonable is it accepted. Do you like to save your stale bread to feed the ducks? Beware — wildlife experts are warning that the starchy snack is the equivalent of ‘junk food’ for the birds. Each year six million loaves are tossed into British waterways by well-intentioned people, says the Canal & River Trust. But the charity says that not only is all this bread unhealthy for ducks, it also encourages rats and algae to thrive. It is advising people to feed ducks with snacks such as defrosted peas and sweetcorn, chopped lettuce and halved grapes. Seeds, oats and even leftover takeaway rice also get the thumbs up. Anyone who does want to rehome a ‘war horse’ has to go through a strict process in which they must trial ride them and sign a contract stipulating what they may do with them. H ighfield, or H. P. for short, a handsome bay mare with a distinctive stripe down her face, is due for rehoming in the next six months. ‘She’s got so many letters in her folder from people who want her,’ says Sgt Charters. One horse who was successfully retired recently is Bert, or Mr Twister, to give him his formal title. A 15-year-old black charger who had been with the troop since 2005, he was the lead horse in Baroness Thatcher’s funeral procession. As thousands lined the streets of London to watch the former prime minister’s funeral cortege in 2013, Bert stayed steady as a rock as he walked in front of the gun carriage. Sadly, he had started to suffer from osteoarthritis, so his duties had to come to an end. Due to his medical issues, Bert needed an expert home, so in February he was taken to the Horse Trust for retired horses in Princes Risborough, Bucks. Any suggestion that the military should be prevented from having horses seems ludicrous when you think how much care and attention is paid to their needs at every stage of their life, right into their old age. And when you consider what would be lost if Britain did not have ceremonial horses, as well as the traditional skills that would disappear, it seems little short of an outrage that an animal welfare group would call for these horses to lose their jobs. ‘This is what makes us Great Britain,’ says Capt Watson. ‘If they got rid of the ceremonial side of the Army a lot of tourism would go.’ There is clearly a special bond between the horses and their handlers. ‘They eat before us, they get seen to before we do anything for ourselves. They have a better life than most horses,’ says one soldier. Little wonder, therefore, that some of the soldiers end up taking the older horses home themselves. A few years ago, Sgt Charters re-homed a horse called Moose back to her family home in Devon, where her mother runs a livery yard. She is now 22 and enjoying giving pony rides to children as part of the Riding For The Disabled scheme. Such stories are a tribute to the bond between horses and soldiers. And as the tombstones to veteran steeds testify, war horses are never incidental or forgotten. They may not fight for their country these days, but they still do Britain an amazing service by putting on the pageantry for which we are world-renowned. It seems so sad to think that if the animal rights lobby get their way such a key part of our heritage could be lost. It’s enough to make old Wonder turn in his grave.","Members of the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery are housed at Woolwich .

"Jane Lu’s success started like many others. She got up early each morning, put on a suit, waved goodbye to her supportive parents and took off to start work. The only difference was that the 28-year-old didn’t have an office to go to, a formal job title or a boss to report to. Keeping her ventures a secret in fear that her parents wouldn't approve Ms Lu would venture into the city each day to hold up in a cafe or library to contact wholesalers, find new and exciting styles and build her online shopping empire. Business is booming: Ms Lu's online shopping business has turned over $10 million in the last calendar year . Ms Lu’s story is one of perseverance; determination and achievement with her successful online shopping venture ShowPony.com reportedly turning over $10 million in the past calendar year. She distributes clothing to 45 countires, has 420,000 followers on Instagram and 464,000 friends on Facebook, attributing her success to dominating the social media platforms. After reading about her triumphs it will surprise you to know that her road to success was paved with a few failures. Ms Lu completed a business degree and gained an elusive graduate position before throwing it all away for her dream . With Ms Lu being the first one to admit things don’t always work out the first time you give it a crack. She started her professional life in corporate finance first securing an elusive graduate position with KPMG and then moving on to accounting firm Ernst & Young . After spending some time pondering her future life as a corporate go getter, she said she was left feeling unfulfilled. ‘I wasn’t getting much out of my day to day and a uni friend said they wanted to start a business so quit my job and blindly followed.’ Ms Lu took advantage of social media saying it was the perfect marketing opportunity for someone without much capital . ‘The small quick and nimble can really dominate a market like that because big business didn’t know how to capitalise on it' Ms Lu’s family, in a show of their unwavering support, lent her money for the start up venture was unsuccessful. ‘It was really devastating when my first attempt failed. I’d quit my job so I couldn’t really go crawling back to my old employers. It was also right in the middle of the global financial crisis so I really had no other option but continue on,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. Being faced with the option of flight or fight Ms Lu secretly soldiered on in the hopes that she would have better news to give her parents soon. From humble beginnings: Ms Tu worked on bended knee scrubbing out her first warehouse,right, and she put in the hard yards before getting her first office, left. ‘My parents lent me money to start up my first business and after it failed it felt really hard to justify to them why I didn’t want to go back to business, which was their dream job for me. Selling clothes online was completely foreign to them. They don’t even use email,’ she said. In a few short years Ms Lu has managed to take her business from a dream to cold hard reality. She said if she had given up when she first failed she would have never achieved what she has today. Ms Lu now has 10 employees and says she loves that she has the opportunity to have fun each and every day . Try and try again: ‘So many young people have a fear of failure but having failed, I can tell you it’s really not as bad or as scary as it seems' ‘So many young people have a fear of failure but having failed, I can tell you it’s really not as bad or as scary as it seems. ‘It is worth the risk and you should always back yourself,’ she added. Ms Lu said although she could have spent a lot more time on the couch after her first disappointment but she found it really motivating to get up every day with purpose, as if she had a boss to report to, and work for the job she really wanted. ‘It can be so easy to sit at home and watch TV or go to the beach with other friends who aren’t working but you can’t let yourself do that. Its about being productive every day.’ After being brought up in a ‘very academically focused’ environment Ms Lu said she wasn’t once taught about how to be successful if you pursue a creative career maintain that passion can get you through. Ms Lu said she saw a gap in the online shopping market for affordable garments . Even after becoming a front runner in Australian online business Ms Lu said she still finds it ‘bizarre’ to think of herself as a role model . ‘Life is long and people have to stop thinking that you can’t spend some of that time time when you are young to investing in yourself and what makes you happy.’ ‘Your work life pretty much takes up the majority of your life so why not work to live instead of live to work,’ she added. After taking the online shopping market by storm Ms Lu said it was social media that catapulted her to success. ‘Basically, I had no money when I started the business so I needed social media to get the brand out to our community.’ Coming into a market where big businesses hadn’t quite grasped the power of social media Ms Lu said there was a huge marketing sector that could be taken advantage of. ‘It was really devastating when my first attempt failed. I’d quit my job so I couldn’t really go crawling back to my old employers' ‘The small quick and nimble can really dominate a market like that because big business didn’t know how to capitalise on it. She said while she was starting out social media remained relatively unknown with big businesses blowing it off as ‘a fad’. ‘It’s about building a loyal community who are genuinely interested instead of paying for advertising to just make sales.’ Ms Lu used Facebook to start her social media campaign but says a lot of consumers are migrating to Insagram . Ms Lu said even though her she may not have been completely honest with her parents in the start of her career, she knows they are beyond proud of her accomplishments. ‘At first they said ‘I don’t understand how you had the guts to do this’ but in reality it was them who left everything to take their young family to Australia,’ she said. Ms Tu was born in China, left, and was eight-years-old when she first moved to Australia, right. Ms Lu’s family immigrated from China during political unrest in 1994 when she was eight years old. 'They quit their great jobs to work as cleaners and in factories, now that is gutsy,’ she added. She said she knows it was their inital investment and support that helped her put herself out there and maintains that she doesnt know anyone thats worked as hard as them. Ms Tu said she came from a 'very academic' environment with her parents dreaming she would find a job where she could be financially stable . Even after becoming a front runner in Australian online business Ms Lu said she still finds it ‘bizarre’ to think of herself as a role model for women who are out there working hard to achieve their dream. ‘It is so bizarre, I mean, I don’t really have any experience, my first business failed so really if I can do it, anyone can do it.’ Her positive attitude caught the attention of The League of Extraordinary Women and they asked Ms Lu to take her story to the 'Run the World' conference where several of Australia’s most successful entrepreneurs will tell of their trials and tribulations in the hopes of motivating a new generation of young female go-getters. Winners are grinners: Ms Lu said she has an amazing team who have become a huge part of her sucess . Chiquita Searle, general manager of the League, told Daily Mail Australia that they knew they wanted Ms Lu to speak after hearing of her overwhelming perseverance in the face of crushing adversity. ‘It’s so important for young entrepreneurs to see someone in Jane’s position who didn’t have the perfect run. ‘It really wasn’t an easy journey for her, she quit her job, her first business failed leaving her with $50,000 of debt and she spent years working before she gained any traction,’ Ms Searle said. Ms Lu said throughout all her academic pursuits she was never once told she could be successful by chasing a creative dream .","Jane Lu quit her job and started Show Pony after a failed business venture .

"The Nigerian military says it has destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram in the barbaric terrorist organisation's de facto capital city Gwoza. The official Twitter account for the Nigerian Defense Headquarters announced 'FLASH: Troops this morning captured Gwoza destroying the Headquarters of the Terrorists self-styled Caliphate.' It followed with 'Several terrorists died while many are captured. Mopping up of entire #Gwoza and her suburbs is ongoing.' Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau declared the northeast Nigerian city to be the capital of a new Islamic caliphate after he seized the town in August. Earlier this month Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, formally recognising Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as their spiritual leader. Liberators: The Nigerian military says its soldiers (pictured) have destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram in the barbaric terrorist organisation's de facto capital city Gwoza . Breakthrough: The failure of President Goodluck Jonathan (left) to defeat Boko Haram has dogged Nigeria's leader as he stands for re-election tomorrow. It was not immediately possible to verify this morning's morale-boosting announcement from Gwoza - but critics have questioned its timing . Goodluck Jonathan's opponents have said the offensive against Boko Haram is a political ploy ahead of tomorrow's election (a billboard for which is pictured). They have asked why Nigeria's military, of which Jonathan is the commander in chief, is suddenly is capable of doing what it has failed to do for six years . It was not possible to verify this morning's morale-boosting announcement, which comes just one day before critical presidential elections in Nigeria. The Twitter messages made no mention  of military operations in Sambisa Forest, where Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremist group is believed to have several camps. Warplanes have been bombarding the area for weeks. The forest starts about 20 miles from Gwoza town, which is 80 miles southeast of Maiduguri - the Borno state capital state and Boko Haram's birthplace. Sambisa Forest is where extremists first took nearly 300 schoolgirls kidnapped from a boarding school in Chibok almost a year ago. Dozens escaped on their own but 219 remain missing. The failure of the government and military of President Goodluck Jonathan to rescue the girls created international outrage and continues to dog Nigeria's leader as he stands for re-election. Nigeria's military, with support of troops and military aircraft from neighboring countries, in the past two months has retaken dozens of towns from Boko Haram. This comes after months of defeat at the hands of Boko Haram, with soldiers fleeing the battlefield after they ran out of ammunition. Jonathan's opponents have said the offensive is a political ploy, asking why Nigeria's military, of which Jonathan is the commander in chief, is suddenly is capable of doing what it has failed to do for nearly six years. Brutal: Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau (pictured) declared the northeast Nigerian city to be the capital of a new Islamic caliphate after he seized the town in August . Earlier this month Boko Haram militants (pictured during a recent filmed beheading) pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, formally recognising Iraqi Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as their spiritual leader . On the run: Civilians who fled the fighting in Bama and the surrounding areas in recent days gather a makeshift camp for displaced people on the outskirts of Maiduguri . Reports from the newly-liberated town of Bama say the city has been devastated by the militants' occupation and the efforts to re-take the city - with the army claiming the stench of death hangs heavy in the air. The devastation is visible from the air in Bama. Corrugated iron roofs lie ripped off among charred debris, the walls of the houses blackened with soot or in ruins. On the dusty roads that separate properties in the second-biggest town in Borno state, northeast Nigeria, the sight -- and smell -- is much worse, with evidence of atrocities everywhere. The Nigerian military forced out Boko Haram from Bama earlier this month. As they did so, locals who managed to escape said the Islamists set fire to homes, including the emir's palace. But clearly much worse happened -- and the evidence is on the streets, beneath them and in the parched fields beyond. Troops found the decomposing body of a man in a sewer, in the fetal position surrounded by trash and human waste. Soldiers cover their noses as more remains are found elsewhere.

Nigerian troops are seen taking up positions in the northeast Nigerian town of Bama earlier this week . Reports from the newly-liberated town of Bama say the city has been devastated by the militants' occupation and the efforts to re-take the city - with the army claiming the stench of death hangs heavy in the air . Earlier this week it emerged that Boko Haram had abducted hundreds of women and children  from primary schools  to use them as 'human shields'. The Islamic militants took adults and children from primary schools in the north-eastern town of Damasak as troops from Niger and Chad approached a month ago, Mike Omeri, the Nigerian spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, confirmed this week. When the soldiers arrived, they found the town largely deserted - with local reports suggesting as many as 500 people were taken in the raids. Mr Omeri refused to be drawn on exactly how many people had been taken by Boko Haram militants, but he was clear on the reason why they had been kidnapped. 'Boko Haram ... rushed to primary schools they took children and adults that they are using as shields to protect themselves from the menacing advance of troops,' he said. 'They are being used as shields by Boko Haram.' Damasak, which is near the border with Niger and had been held by Boko Haram for months, was recaptured on March 16 - but officials have only confirmed the kidnappings now. Evidence of a mass grave was also discovered by the troops from Chad and Niger, who now hold the town, Chad's ambassador to the U.N. Mahamat Zene Cherif confirmed Wednesday. Kidnapped: As many as 500 women and children were taken from Damasak, in north-eastern Nigeria, as Chadian troops (pictured) advanced on the town, which had been held by Boko Haram for months . Defence: Officials believe they were taken so they could be used as human shields when troops arrived. Pictured: Chadian army celebrates entering Damasak - showing off one of Boko Haram's flags . Last week, the troops found the bodies of at least 70 people in an apparent execution site under a bridge leading out of Damasak, which had been used as an administrative centre for the extremists who hope to create their own 'caliphate' in the region. The six-year battle against the insurgents is one of the major issues voters will be considering on Saturday. Thousands have already lost their lives - including an estimated 10,000 last year alone - while more than 174,000 people are thought to have fled to neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger as refugees. Analysts attribute the success to newly acquired war materiel including tanks, armored cars and helicopter gunships, training by foreign instructors and a joint offensive with battle-hardened soldiers from neighboring Chad, as well as troops from Niger and Cameroon. A regional offensive against Boko Haram was mounted at the end of January amid growing international concern as Boko Haram seized territory the size of Belgium. The terror group also pledged to become the West Africa franchise of the Islamic State group operating in Syria and Iraq, and as the Nigerian insurgents spread their attacks across borders. At least 10,000 people were killed in the Islamic uprising last year and more than 1.5 million people have been driven from the homes.","Nigerian military says it has destroyed the jihadi's headquarters in Gwoza .

"Authorities are searching for a man caught on surveillance video running down a sidewalk with a toddler in his arms, with the boy's two young siblings screaming and chasing behind him, in what authorities in the tiny town of Sprague, Washington, say was a failed kidnapping. The dramatic scene ended after a pair of local teenagers also chased after the man and he set the boy down and ran off on Sunday, authorities said. The 22-month-old boy - called Owen - was unhurt, said Lincoln County Sheriff Wade Magers. Authorities are searching for a man caught on surveillance video running down a sidewalk with a toddler in his arms, in what authorities in the town of Sprague, Washington, say was a failed kidnapping on Sunday . Authorities are searching for a man caught on surveillance video running down a sidewalk with a toddler in his arms, in what authorities in the town of Sprague, Washington, say was a failed kidnapping on Sunday . Owen's older sister Delicia, left, and brother Brenden, right, were also captured on security video footage as they gave chase after the man who had taken their younger brother . Authorities said they don't believe the man is a resident of Sprague, a wheat farming town of about 500 people located 40 miles west of Spokane. 'We don't believe him to be a local at this point,' Magers said. 'We'd recognize him if he was local.' Magers said authorities have no leads in the case. Michael Wright, the boy's father, said he was horrified by the incident. 'I can't explain the feeling, the anxiety and everything that goes into finding out your children is missing or something has happened to them,' Wright told KXLY-TV of Spokane. Wright left his three children with a baby sitter Sunday while he went to work. The children, Brenden, 10; Delicia, 8; and the boy were playing unsupervised in a city park near the sitter's house, he told KXLY. Sheriff's deputies said a man talked with the children for a few minutes, then scooped the toddler out of his stroller and ran down the street. Surveillance video from a grocery store showed the kidnapper running, child in arms, with Delicia chasing and Brenden not far behind. Delicia's screams alerted Dorothy Giddings, who was working at her antique store downtown, reports KIRO7. 'I said there is something wrong,' Giddings recalled Tuesday. Father Michael Wright said he was horrified that his children were left unsupervised in a park by their babysitter . 'Then this man busts out and runs across the street and he's got a baby and a little girl right behind him screaming,' Giddings said. 'The girl said, 'That man got my baby brother! That man got my baby brother!'' Giddings said she realized what was happening and sent her teenage grandson and his friend to chase the man. As the older boys approached, the kidnapper put the child down in a vacant lot and fled, the sheriff's office said. No vehicle was seen with the suspect, who is described as about 30 years old, 6-foot to 6-foot-2, with a thin build, brown hair and a mustache. 'We are leaning on somebody coming through town,' which sits along Interstate 90, a major east-west artery, Magers said.","Police are searching for a man caught on surveillance video running down a sidewalk with a toddler in his arms .

"Isaac Martinez took it in stride when he was shot during Wednesday's deadly Arizona rampage, posting online a series of selfies making light of his brush with death. Suspect Ryan Giroux was arrested in Mesa following an intense manhunt sparked by a shooting spree that left one person dead and five others injured yesterday morning. One of the victims was Martinez, a 20-year-old student at the East Valley Institute of Technology who works at the school-operated Bistro 13 restaurant. Scroll down for video . Bloody selfie: When Isaac Martinez, 20, was shot by a suspect in Wednesday's Mesa, Arizona, rampage, the first thing he did was reach for his phone and post a bloody selfie on Snapchat . Viral hit: The culinary student posted another photo from the hospital bed, and a friend later turned it into a funny meme . Matter-of-fact attitude: Martinez took to Facebook to let his friends know about what happened to him . Blow by blow: The EVIT student detailed the attempted carjacking, which left him wounded in the shoulder . Martinez was on his way to the eatery when Giroux allegedly confronted him in the parking lot and demanded his car. Martinez refused to hand over his keys, prompting the suspect to shoot him in the shoulder. Instead of calling 911, a wounded Martinez took to the social media app Snapchat, sharing a photo of himself in a white chef's coat spattered with blood. The caption stated matter of factly: 'I just got shot.' The Internet-savvy college student did not stop there and continued documenting his harrowing ordeal. After he was taken to a hospital to be treated for his gunshot wound, he shared another selfie, which shows him lying in bed bear-chested with a white dressing on his bloodied shoulder. A friend of Martinez’s even turned one of his hospital snapshots into a meme, accessorizing him with a painted-on cigarette and dark sunglasses, along with the caption: 'Thug Life.' After being released from the hospital, the 20-year-old culinary student offered his 1,200 friends an update on his condition, saying that the bullet struck him from behind and exited out of his collar area. Suspect caught: Police apprehended Ryan Giroux, 41, who is suspected of killing a man and injuring five others, among them Isaac Martinez.

Tanya Ehrig, 27, cries for victims of a shooting as she holds her child Trinity in Mesa Wednesday . 'Any higher or lower it coulda hit a artery, or shatter my shoulder blade. It was a miracle hit,' he wrote. Martinez then proceeded to give a play-by-play of what happened in the parking lot of Bistro 13 shortly before 9am. The EVIT student explained that when Giroux pulled a gun on him during the attempted carjacking, Martinez started backing away while yelling at passersby to get down on the ground. After Grioux allegedly carjacked an EVIT teacher and took off from the parking lot in his Honda, Martinez said he noticed police and emergency vehicles down the street, and ran there for help. ‘I was the only one injured. Everyone else was unharmed. overall im glad it went the way it did rather than any other way,’ the 20-year-old concluded.

"In scenes now seared into the fabric of a nation, state troopers in helmets and gas masks stand off against crowds of young, black protesters on the roads between Selma and Montgomery, Alabama. Seconds later they charge, tear gas flowing around them. Other frames show venerated leaders of the Civil Rights Movement marching implacably, despite the threat of harm to them and their supporters. The images, now fifty years old, have been assembled from the work of three photographers covering the marches, and are now being displayed in a New York City photography exhibition. Scroll down for video . Bloody Sunday: Alabama State Troopers are pictured above on March 7, 1965, confronting activists Hosea Williams, John Lewis and their supporters.

Leaders: Martin Luther King Jr (center), James Forman (left)  and Reverend Jessie Douglas (right) are pictured above marching around the state capitol in Montgomery, Alabama . The first was Spider Martin, a staff photographer for the pro-segregation Birmingham News, who described dodging heavy-handed authorities, climbing rickety churches and scrapping with other journalists to get the best shots.

High-quality images of the authorities' brutal response helped galvanize change and push through the Voting Rights Act just five months later. However, the transmission of the images was far from guaranteed - Martin recalled how his editors initially tried to suppress his images. Explaining their logic, he said: 'the largely segregationist editors thought if you didn't publish it, much of this would go away'.

"Pets might soon be able to use pot under a bill introduced on Tuesday in the Nevada Legislature. Democratic Senator Tick Segerblom is sponsoring the measure that would allow animal owners to get marijuana for their pet if a veterinarian certifies the animal has an illness that might be alleviated by the drug. Segerblom said he's concerned that some animals might have adverse reactions, but 'you don't know until you try,' he said. Pot for pets: Companion Cannabis, by Holistic Therapeutics, a Marijuana medicinal tincture for dogs and cats is displayed at La Brea Compassionate Caregivers, a medical marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles . Some veterinarians who have given cannabis to sick and dying pets say it has relieved their symptoms, although the substance hasn't been proven as a painkiller for animals. Los Angeles veterinarian Doug Kramer told The Associated Press in 2013 that pot helped ease his Siberian husky's pain during her final weeks, after she had surgery to remove tumors. Kramer said cannabis helped his dog, Nikita, gain weight and live an extra six weeks before she was euthanized. 'I grew tired of euthanizing pets when I wasn't doing everything I could to make their lives better,' Kramer told the AP. 'I felt like I was letting them down.' The proposal is in its earliest stages and faces several legislative hurdles before it could become law. Experimental medicine: Comapany Canna Companion claims that medical marijuana helped Kaley the cat who was suffering from arthritis pain . The pot-for-pets provision of SB372 is part of a larger bill that would overhaul the state's medical marijuana law, removing penalties for drivers who have marijuana in their blood and requiring training for pot-shop owners. Segerblom said he added the provision after being approached by a constituent. Senator Mark Manendo, a fellow Democrat and animal rights advocate, said he hadn't heard of the practice of giving marijuana to animals and is concerned about its safety. 'That gives me pause,' he said. 'Alcohol is bad, chocolate is bad for dogs.' His own dog died in his arms at age 15, and the experience was difficult and emotional, he said. New bill: Democratic Sen. Tick Segerblom is sponsoring the measure that would allow animal owners to get marijuana for their pet if a veterinarian certifies the animal has an illness that might be alleviated by the drug . But 'I don't know if I would've given him marijuana,' Manendo said. According to the website for Canna Companion,one of several existing marijuana supplement companies for pets, the drug is able to help pets with joint pain, anxiety, digestive issues, end of life care, neurological function, and immune system function. Dr. Sara Brandon ans Licensed Veterinarian Lisa Anderson turned to medical marijuana after traditional medicine failed to help their own pain and health issues and they turned to hemp supplements. Canna Companion is not intended for human digestion but rather is a hemp supplement infused with other vitamins they say they've successfully used to treat animals . One of those pets is Kaley the cat who once suffered from Arthritis and who now is in much less pain, says the company. Only time will tell how medical marijuana affects pets as the substance hasn't been officially proven to cure or alleviate symptoms of any disease.","Democratic Sen.

Footage: The video is subtitled in Arabic and the description posted on the YouTube page suggests it has been uploaded by a group calling themselves 'Anonymous Arab' The video is narrated in an electronic voice, suggesting software has either been used either to conceal the identity of the person speaking, to translate it from another language into English, or possibly both. 'We are coming back to punish you again, for your crimes in the Palestinian territories, as we do every year on 7 April, All we see is continuous aggression, bombing, killing and kidnapping of the Palestinian people, as in the last war against Gaza in 2014,' the voice in the video says. 'Our message to the foolish Benjamin Netanyahu and all leaders in the Zionist entities, we will continue to electronically attack until the people of Palestine are free,' it adds.

'For the most part, this is posturing. This is actually the fourth year that Anonymous has carried out this Op Israel attack and called on their supporters to erase Israel from the internet,' he said. 'As the years have progressed we have seen that, despite their increasing sophistication in hacking techniques, we have seen less damage against Israeli cyber infrastructures, largely due to Israel's pioneering of most cyber warfare tactics, both offensive and defensive,' Mr Decker added.

The agency says he told his family he was going on a religious pilgrimage to Mecca, but instead, he and a friend flew to Istanbul in January and then traveled to a safe house in southern Turkey. From there, smugglers brought them to Syria. Khalil returned after a few weeks and was later arrested by the Shin Bet.

The conviction could land Olmert five years in prison, in addition to a six-year prison sentence he received last year in a separate bribery conviction, all but ensuring the former premier will not return to politics for many years to come. 'His behavior constitutes a breach of trust which harms the public, harms morality, and harms the public's trust, in how he behaved corruptly,' prosecutor Uri Korev said following the verdict. Olmert's lawyers said they would likely appeal the ruling by the Jerusalem District Court. A sentencing hearing is slated to take place in May. Olmert has claimed he was on the brink of a historic agreement with the Palestinians when he was forced to resign in early 2009 amid corruption allegations.

Happy surprise: The Anderson, South Carolina, resident adopted the pet as a companion after her fiancé died in June 2013 - she joked that he has now seen more of the world than her after his cross-country exploits . She later joked  that the creature has seen more of the world than she has in her lifetime. Generous donations have been pouring in to allow Kevin to fly home. He is set to jet off from Palm Springs this week. John Welsh from Riverside County Animal Services said it appeared Kevin had been cared for during the time he had been away. But who - and how Kevin got into the trailer - are mysteries yet to be solved. Walls said she was looking forward to the feline's return and she would be at the airport to greet him.","Kevin the orange tabby was found inside a trailer this month by a transport inspector performing routine checks near the Arizona-California border .

"A teenager who went out for a street fight armed with a knife has avoided jail – but boasted of his ‘Ankle Rolex’ after being given an electronic tag by a judge. Calvin Saward, 18, was baited by former friends who called him asking for a scrap outside his home in Herne Bay, Kent, and grabbed a knife to confront the gang. But his father disarmed him before any fight could take place and called police. Then, at Canterbury Crown Court last week, he was ordered him to stay indoors overnight for the next four weeks. Avoided jail: Calvin Saward (left), 18, grabbed a knife to confront a gang outside his home. Then after the case, Saward posted a picture on Facebook of his electronic tag (right), which he labelled 'Ankle Rolex' After the case, Saward posted a picture on Facebook of his electronic tag, which he labelled ‘Ankle Rolex’, adding: ‘Want to pull this thing off already. Lesson learned? Don’t play with knives.’ Judge Heather Norton said the father’s actions last December prevented the incident from escalating. And Phil Rowley, defending, said: ‘His dad should be commended for his behaviour.’ The judge told Saward: ‘What you did was a very stupid act. It was not just stupid; it was also dangerous - not just to others but also to yourself. ‘People who take knives on to the street should realise the consequences could be fatal. There is a lot of concern about young people arranging fights and then taking knives with them. Sentenced: At Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) last week, Saward was ordered him to stay indoors overnight for the next four weeks. He was also given a community order by the judge . ‘I know you were confronted by a larger group, but you could have stayed inside. ‘Your father’s action in taking that knife away and calling the police may have landed you in court, but probably prevented something more serious from occurring.’ Possessing a knife in public usually results in an immediate jail term, but the judge gave the teenager a community order. She also took the unusual step of refusing to issue a destruction order for the weapon and returned the kitchen knife to the father, who was present at the court.","Calvin Saward, 18,  grabbed a knife to confront gang outside Kent home .

"Imagine playing a game of Pictionary with a group of Oxford University students who are unable to recognise the Taj Mahal, the Pyramids or the Eiffel Tower. Welcome to the parallel universe of North Korea, where some of the hermit kingdom's brightest young minds have a lack of worldly knowledge which would shame a Western primary school student. In 2011 writer and journalist Suki Kim went undercover for two terms teaching English at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, just outside the capital of the world's most secretive country. Scroll down for video . Suki Kim (left), arrived for her first term in North Korea in July 2011 and left at the end of her second shortly after the country's Dear Leader, Kim Jong-Il (right), died in December of that year . Students at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology doing their mandatory morning exercises . Miss Kim taking a class. One student once asked her if it was true everyone in the world spoke Korean. Portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il hang on the wall above the blackboard . Posing as one of the Christian missionaries running the facility, Miss Kim spent months secretly documenting her experiences for a book, 'Without You, There Is No Us: My secret life teaching the sons of North Korea's elite'. The 270 boys aged 19-20 were the offspring of some of the regime's most loyal citizens - some of the few allowed to live in the capital outside of which the vast majority are stuck in grinding poverty in the countryside. Their new teacher was getting up at 5am every day to write-up notes she had taken on her experiences, making sure she copied everything to five USB sticks and left nothing on her laptop which could be spied on by her hosts. If Miss Kim, then aged 40, had been caught, she risked being branded a spy and being thrown in one of North Korea's gulags, or forced labour camps, where 120,000 political prisoners are thought to be held. Every piece of material for every lesson had to be submitted and approved for use by a shadowy group known as the 'counterparts' - North Korean staff overseeing the lessons of the foreign teachers who had been brought in. Students on a cold and snowy day after an exam, with the Kimilsungism Study Hall in the background . Miss Kim wrote her book (left) after months of secret note-taking. The Juche Tower in Pyongyang (right) An enclosed walkway that connects all buildings at the PUST campus, including the classroom building on the left. A Pyongyang smokestack belches fumes in the distance . By Miss Kim's second week the counterparts had approved various games, including trivia contents, spelling competitions and Pictionary. And yet, for North Korea's best and brightest, 'photos of the United Nations, the Taj Mahal and the Great Pyramids of Giza elicited only blank expressions'. They knew about Bill Gates from their previous universities, but had no idea how Mark Zuckerberg and the website he created, Facebook, had revolutionised the way the rest of the world communicated. Miss Kim wrote: 'A few guessed the names of the Eiffel Tower and Stonehenge, but only after much hemming and hawing. 'Hardly anyone knew what country had first landed men on the moon, despite the fact that they were science and technology majors. 'Asked what year computers had been invented, most had no idea; it was only after much consultation that one team ventured a guess: 1870.' Miss Kim told MailOnline: 'In a way, why would they know? They have never been taught about the outside world. Three uniformed students on guard duty outside the IT building. The sign reads: 'The Sun of the 21st Century, General Kim Jong-Il' Students on sports day with the Forever Tower to the right, on which is inscribed 'Our Great Leaser is Always With Us' Students often watched from their dormitory windows while Miss Kim practiced playing basketball below . 'They didn't even know about the existence of the internet. There is only one TV channel about the Great Leader and one newspaper about the Great Leader [North Koreans' term for Kim Il-Sung, the country's founder and first leader, who is considered to be immortal and the country's 'Eternal President']. 'But on another level they were the elite. If any of them did know more the fear and the consequences of being exposed were so great they never let it be known.' One student asked Miss Kim if it were true that everyone in the world spoke Korean, as it was 'so superior that they spoke it in England, China and America.' Many of the boy's families lived as little as 10 minutes drive away in Pyongyang, but they were hardly ever allowed to see them or have any contact at all during term time. One student's father stopped by the campus to see him but was turned away and all he could do was leave a note. Another was late for lunch one day because his mother had come to the gate with rice cakes and roast chicken as it was his birthday. Miss Kim wrote: 'He was an only child, and she wept during their twenty-minute meeting, so he told her, ""If you keep crying, I am going to go back inside."" 'He was laughing as he said this before his friends, but his eyes watered.' Miss Kim in the classroom with the lyrics of a North Korean song which she translated with her students . Eating instant ramen outside the Seventh Pyongyang Autumn International Trade Fair on a rare outing . All the students wore lapel pins featuring the face of Kim Il-Sung. Even during the bitterly cold winter months, groups of six students at a time dressed in martial uniforms were expected to stand guard all night outside the campus's hulking grey Kimilsungism Study Hall. It is where they went to study Juche, Kim Il-Sung's pseudo philosophy of self reliance, and many performed such duties outside similar halls in the areas they grew up in since they were teenagers. Miss Kim is unnerved by the extent to which her students lied, be it about the myriad achievements of Kim Jong-Il, the country's 'Dear Leader' at the time, or what they had been up to that morning. She said: 'It's a whole world of lies. Coming from a world where everything is a lie in some ways it's just been ingrained but they also lie because they are constantly being watched. 'The system has an absolute hold. They lie to protect the system from the outside and also out of fear. 'They were lovely at the same time and also very sincere but their system is a system built on lies.' A highlight of Miss Kim's time at PUST was when she fought successfully so that one of her classes could watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Students taking part in their final exam. One class was ecstatic at being allowed to watch Harry Potter . The sign on this building in the capital reads 'We are happy'. Downtown Pyongyang was only around 10 minutes drive from PUST, but students were never allowed out to visit their families during term time . She said: 'They loved it. Most of them had never seen a Western film. They related to Hermione and Ron and saw that they were ""just like us; in school like us; with homework to do like us"". 'That I found very moving. They were never allowed to see the outside world and be exposed to a world that isn't about the Great Leader . 'It was probably the first time they related to Western people in a normal way.' But Miss Kim does not see much hope for the international pariah state opening up to the world any time soon, given what she saw of its system. She said: 'I hope that things will open up even a tiny bit so the boys would be able to find out about my book - that's my biggest wish. 'But I am not that hopeful for real change because the amount of control I saw there was so absolute and so brutal, with no mercy. 'I thought the elites had it a better than everyone else. On the other hand they may have a had a bit more food and a bit more electricity but no one is spared in North Korea from the control of the military dictatorship. 'They are never allowed to move about freely in the country or exchange information. I don't see how they can rise up. 'I think change has to come from the outside somehow because I don't know what they can do from the inside. 'I really loved them and it broke my heart to see them living in that way, in that place. 'It was really a gulag, nothing else. It is the most inhuman thing, controlling people with fear.' 'Without You, There is No Us' by Suki Kim is published by Rider Books, priced £8.99 .","Suki Kim, a Korean-American journalist, taught for two terms at Pyongyang University of Technology while pretending to be a Christian missionary .

"The evidence for Mars once being habitable is steadily growing, as samples collected by Nasa’s Mars Curiosity rover have revealed a key ingredient for life in Martian rock. Scientists found traces of nitrogen compounds known as nitrates, a vital source of nutrients for living things on Earth. The discovery is the latest feather in the cap for the theory that while Mars is barren and dry now, it was once habitable. Nasa scientists in California found evidence of nitrogen on Mars. Findings were made by Curiosity's (shown) Sample Analysis at Mars instrument. The scientists found nitrates - a source of nitrogen for life on Earth. It was likely created by asteroid impacts or lightning in volcanic plumes . The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In their paper, the team of researchers said the nitrogen could indicate the first stage of a primitive nitrogen cycle on the surface of ancient Mars. This could have provided a biochemically accessible source of nitrogen for life on Mars. The Earth’s nitrogen-rich atmosphere made life possible, but the origins of the air we breathe have long been a mystery. Now, scientists believe they have found the answer: that tectonic forces responsible for creating mountains and volcanoes, also made the atmosphere habitable. Geoscientists studied tectonic chemistry and found that nitrogen started building up in Earth’s atmosphere three billion years ago. Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, Carnegie Institution of Washington researchers explained in October 2014 that the chemistry of the air we breathe is the result of billions of years of photosynthesis, as well as tectonic activity. While scientists knew that plant life was responsible for the build up of oxygen, which makes up one fifth of the Earth’s atmosphere, the nitrogen content - which accounts for 80 per cent of air - had remained a mystery. ‘Discovery of indigenous martian nitrogen in Mars surface materials has important implications for habitability and, specifically, for the potential evolution of a nitrogen cycle at some point in martian history,’ they wrote. The latest evidence was found by using the Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), more commonly known as Curiosity. The discoveries were made at areas of Mars known as John Klein and Cumberland. The scientists note that this particular nitrate likely resulted from an asteroid impact, or lightning in a volcanic plume. Nitrogen is a key component of things like RNA, DNA and amino acids, and thus important for life. Nitrates themselves are important because they are a good source of nitrogen for living things. The next step will be to see if nitrates are still being produced on Mars. ‘People want to follow the carbon, but in many ways nitrogen is just as important a nutrient for life,’ said Dr Jennifer Stern, a science team member for the Mars Science Laboratory mission, reported LA Times. ‘Life runs on nitrogen as much as it runs on carbon.’ Shown is Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument. In their paper the team of researchers said the nitrogen could indicate the first stage of a primitive nitrogen cycle on the surface of ancient Mars. This could have provided a biochemically accessible source of nitrogen for life on Mars . This follows news in December 2014 when the rover identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria-like organisms on the surface. 'This temporary increase in methane - sharply up and then back down - tells us there must be some relatively localised source,' said Sushil Atreya of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Curiosity rover science team, at the time. 'There are many possible sources, biological or non-biological, such as interaction of water and rock.' Previous satellite observations have detected unusual plumes of methane on the planet. But none of these previous readings are as extraordinary as the sudden 'venting' measured at Gale Crater, where evidence suggests water once flowed billions of years ago. Curiosity landed in the 96 mile-wide (154km) crater in August 2012 and has been exploring the region ever since. Since it landed, conclusive evidence has been found that Mars once had water on its surface, and now scientists are hoping to provide an answer once and for all to the greatest question: Was there, or is there still, life on Mars as well?","Nasa scientists in California found evidence of nitrogen on Mars .

"The decorated Boston police officer who was shot in the face during a routine traffic stop has been upgraded to a stable condition following successful surgery to remove the bullet from his neck. Officer John Moynihan, 34, was placed in a medically-induced coma and listed in a critical condition after being shot below his right eye at point blank range in Boston, Massachusetts, on Friday night. The suspect, Angelo West, 41, was  gunned down  by other cops in the city's Roxbury area. He was declared dead at the scene, while a female bystander is recovering from a bullet wound to the arm. Now, Moynihan has been upgraded to a 'stable and improving condition' after undergoing several hours of surgery to remove the bullet that lodged behind his right ear during the 'unprovoked' attack. Scroll down for video . Victim: Officer John Moynihan, 34, who was shot in the face during a routine traffic stop, has been upgraded to a 'stable and improving' condition following  surgery to remove the bullet from his neck, police have said . Expressing gratitude: Boston Police Department said in a tweet to well-wishers: 'To all who are sending thoughts and prayers to #BPD and Ofc Moynihan we say thank you. Your prayers are much appreciated' Hospital: Moynihan is expected to be moved out of Boston Medical Center's Intensive Care Unit in 'coming days' following his improvement. Above, the cop's colleagues gather outside the hospital after the shootout . He is expected to be moved out of Boston Medical Center's Intensive Care Unit in 'coming days', Boston Police Department said in a statement on Sunday, in which it praised medics' efforts. 'I’m thankful to the doctors and medical team at Boston Medical Center for taking such good care of my officer,' Commissioner William Evans said in the document, posted on the force's website. 'I was happy to hear that he made it through surgery without any complications, it shows you what a strong kid he is and what a great medical team they have here at Boston Medical Center.' On Sunday morning, the police department, alongside other officials and members of the community, held a special service to pray for Moynihan and his family at Saint Patrick's Church in Roxbury. 'He's a fighter, he's going to pull through,' Evans said at a press conference on Boston on Saturday. Moynihan was attacked by West after he approached the driver's door of a car that he and five other gang task force members had pulled over following reports of shots fired in the area, police said. West, traveling with two others, allegedly shot the officer in the face at point-blank range without warning. He then started shooting at other cops, but was killed when they returned fire, it is said. Suspect: The suspect, Angelo West (pictured, above, following a prior arrest), 41, was shot dead by other police officers in the city's Roxbury area.

Scene: On Sunday, the police department, alongside members of the community, held a special service to pray for Moynihan and his family at Saint Patrick's Church in Roxbury. Above, the car West was traveling in . Emergency response: Moynihan was attacked by West after he approached the driver's door of a car that he and five other gang task force members had pulled over following reports of shots fired in the area, it is said . During the attack, the suspect, from Hyde Park, reportedly fired so many bullets that he emptied his revolver, according to the Boston Globe. He was later revealed to have had a violent criminal past. None of the officers with the Youth Violence Task Force, including Moynihan, had drawn their guns when West opened fire, Suffolk DA Dan Conley said at the press conference on Saturday. The woman at the scene who suffered a flesh wound to her right arm was said to be in good spirits on Saturday, while three other officers were taken to a hospital with stress-related problems. Following the shootout,  Moynihan was forced to undergo tests to check for bleeding in his brain, Evans said. 'We are hoping and praying there's not further damage,' he said on Saturday. He added that the officers had been watching the vehicle before pulling it over. Police are now interviewing the other two people in the car. It is unknown whether criminal charges will be filed. Thankful: 'I’m thankful to the doctors and medical team at Boston Medical Center for taking such good care of my officer,' Commissioner William Evans (pictured demonstrating the suspect's hand movements) said . Police: Evans added: 'I was happy to hear that he made it through surgery without any complications, it shows you what a strong kid he is and what a great medical team they have here at Boston Medical Center' Officers conferred in Roxbury after Humboldt Avenue was shut down following a shooting on Friday evening . Moynihan is a highly decorated military veteran who was awarded a medal for bravery by President Barack Obama last May for his involvement in a shoot-out with the Boston Bombing suspects. He had helped to save transit officer Richard Donohue Jr,  during the gunfight with Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, which occurred just days after the marathon bombings that killed three. He and other officers pressed against Donohue's chest and forced air into his lungs after he started losing bloody rapidly on the Watertown Street, ultimately saving his life, CNN reported. Moynihan, an Iraq veteran, won the Boston Police Department's Medal of Honor in 2014. Local prosecutors will now investigate Friday's shooting to ensure that Moynihan followed departmental procedures during the attack, said Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Connolly. Shootout: During the attack, the suspect, from Hyde Park, reportedly fired so many bullets that he emptied his revolver, according to the Boston Globe .

Above, shots of the scene on Friday night . A helicopter flies over the scene after police shut down Humboldt Avenue following the sudden shooting . 'It's going to be completely transparent,' Connolly said of the review, which he added would be shared with West's family and lawyers once it is complete. Over the past year the United States has seen waves of sometimes violent protests after unarmed black men were killed by white police officers, including in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York. Evans alluded to those concerns, but stressed that West set off Friday's gunfight. 'It was a really violent confrontation that was clearly unprovoked by our officers,' the commissioner said. Such shootings are rare in Boston, but firearms are a major concern in the city, Evans added.

'We've got way too many guns out there, way too many young kids running around with the guns,' he said. 'Unfortunately, this is what happens.' Mayor Marty Walsh said his thoughts and prayers were with Moynihan, his family and other police officers in the department, saying: 'These acts of violence have no place in our neighborhoods.' He added: 'Our community is stronger than ever, and tonight we are thankful for all of those who put their lives on the on the line every day to protect our city.'

"Mickey Mouse, Hello Kitty: Move over and make way for laidback Brown bear and his irrepressible girlfriend Cony the bunny. Once just digital stickers that users of mobile messaging app Line send to each other like emoticons, the bear, the bunny and their seven friends will soon be unleashed through stores, virtual reality and possibly an animated film. For smartphone users in Asia where most of Line's 181 million monthly users are located, the characters are as familiar as old school icons such as Hello Kitty and Disney's animated stars. Scroll down for video . Line plans to open 100 stores selling Brown dolls and other cute 'Line Friends' paraphernalia worldwide over the next three years. Some of the Line app's many characters . They are not well known in America or Europe but owner Line Corp. hopes to change that. It plans to open 100 stores selling Brown dolls and other cute 'Line Friends' paraphernalia worldwide over the next three years. It has already opened two stores in Seoul and its first Shanghai and New York stores will open this year. The popularity of the Brown and Cony stickers has shaped a new trend in mobile communication. Instead of typing messages, many users simply tapped a sticker showing a coy-looking Brown sitting on a toilet or eating a bowl of ramen. Users began to associate themselves with certain characters and the lineup now includes a bespectacled middle-aged man named Boss and James, a blond narcissist. Though partly an accidental strategy, the company says the bricks-and-mortar presence will draw more users to the app and help replicate its rapid Asian success in other regions. It will also give the company a backdoor into China, where Line is blocked along with other foreign messaging apps and social media sites. 'We never intended to do a character business,' Yoon Sunmin, who oversees Line's character business, said in an interview that was the first time the company has outlined its merchandizing plans in detail. 'It exploded by accident,' he said, drinking coffee from a paper cup emblazoned with the dazed face of Brown. Visitors to the newly opened flagship shop in Seoul's trendy Gangnam district screamed with delight when they saw an outsized Brown bear greeting them near the entrance of the three-story store.

Evelyn Tan, a 27-year-old from northwestern China, and her friend Keira Yi, 23, from Beijing, said they don't use Line in China but came to look at Brown and other cute dolls. 'I have some friends from Taiwan and they use Line,' said Tan. 'The stickers. They are so cute.' Larger and more expressive than emoticons, the stickers have been a draw card for Line whose users are mostly in Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, India and Spain. They also set Line apart from the bare bones interface of rival WhatsApp, which was bought by Facebook for about $22 billion. Line is worth about $18 billion based on revenue from monthly users, according to Marcello Ahn, a fund manager at Quad Investment Management.

Stickers also made Line the rare mobile messenger that rakes in cash, first by selling stickers for $2 a pack to mobile phone users and later by adding new businesses such as games and a taxi hailing service. The free line app offers voice and video calls - and also chat using stickers.

In China, the company hopes the stores and other ventures will put it in a strong starting position in case authorities ever relent on their blocking of the app. The first Line Friends store in China will open in Shanghai's Xintiandi shopping district in May, selling Brown dolls, Cony pens, Sally mugs and other goods such as kitchen utensils, stationary, jewelry and toys. 'We hope to resume the Line app service someday' in China, Yoon said. 'If the Line app is resumed at a time when our characters are well known, it would be a powerful launch. 'We hope that in the countries where the Line app is not used actively, Line characters would promote the app.' Apart from stores, Line is in talks to open a virtual reality amusement park in China. The first such park, where visitors can explore a virtual space with Line characters, will open in Bangkok this summer.

"A dog with an 'unbelievable' sense of smell has been able to sniff out thyroid cancer in people not yet diagnosed with the disease. US researchers said that on a test of 34 patients, Frankie the German Shepherd showed 88 per cent accuracy in finding tumours. Frankie was trained to lie down when he could smell thyroid cancer in a sample of urine and turn away if it was clean. A dog with an 'unbelievable' sense of smell has been able to sniff out thyroid cancer in people not yet been diagnosed with the disease. The US researchers said that on a test of 34 patients, Frankie the German Shepherd showed 88 per cent accuracy in finding tumours . Researchers at the University of Arkansas said Frankie only made two false positives and two incorrect 'all-clear' diagnoses. 'What we have done, no one has attempted to do,' said lead author Arny Ferrando, who noted past studies showing trained dogs can reliably tell the difference between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues. 'We have taken the next step by asking the dog to tell us whether or not cancer exists before the medical diagnostic system does. 'We wanted to see, can the doctor utilise the dog to help diagnose cancer?' Thyroid tumours, which occur in a gland in the neck, are relatively rare and usually diagnosed by taking a blood sample and testing its hormone levels. Frankie was trained to lie down when he could smell thyroid cancer in a sample of urine and turn away if it was clean. Thyroid tumours (artist's illustration right), which occur in a gland in the neck, are relatively rare and usually diagnosed by taking a blood sample and testing its hormone levels . 'Detecting and diagnosing thyroid cancer can be difficult, because it's often looking for a very small number of occurrences in a very large background of benign nodules,' said Dr Donald Bodenner at the University of Arkansas. 'It is also difficult to say with certainty that a patient is cancer-free after surgery.' Dogs, however, can sense it as their ability to smell is 10 times better than that of humans. The researchers now want to see if Frankie, and other dogs, could be used as a diagnostic test for different types of cancer. Cancer Research UK told the BBC that using dogs would be impractical. However, it added that discovering the chemicals the dogs can smell could lead to better tests. Researchers at the University of Arkansas said Frankie only made two false positives and two incorrect 'all-clear' diagnoses. He is pictured here. Pictured is Dr Arny Ferrando, who found Frankie as a stray . 'Having a technique with which to do these things with a higher degree of certainty would be a tremendous advance in thyroid cancer,' said Dr Bodenner. The implications could be tremendous, the researchers said, both in terms of cost savings in diagnoses and especially the prevention of unnecessary surgeries. Additionally, the method could be transported to under-served areas where traditional detection methods of biopsy and ultrasound are unavailable. The researchers believe the training could also potentially be used in diagnosis of other cancers such as ovarian, breast, kidney, bladder and prostate. Josie Conlan, 46, had no idea she had a lump in her breast until her two-year-old border collie Ted began to repeatedly cry, paw and nuzzle at her chest . Earlier this year, it was revealed a woman has had an aggressive cancerous tumour removed after the dog she rescued from a life of misery sniffed out an aggressive tumour in the nick of time. Josie Conlan, 46, had no idea she had a cancerous lump in her breast until her two-year-old border collie Ted began to repeatedly cry, paw and nuzzle at her chest - and she now credits him with saving her life. The mother-of-four from Stockton-on-Tees wondered what was wrong, and when she put her hand to her chest she realised she had a lump. She visited her GP and was diagnosed with cancer but has now had the tumour, which she was told was advanced at grade three, removed. In the two weeks before she was operated on the lump had grown by an incredible five millimetres and Josie believes that if it wasn't for Ted she could have been dead by summer. Stay-at-home-mum Josie now wants to let other people know that they should take notice of dogs if they start to draw attention to a certain area of their owners' body. 'Thyroid cancer is our template,' said Dr Ferrando. 'It's one of the fastest growing cancers in terms of occurrences in the world. 'It's not one of the highest mortality cancers, but one of the fastest growing in terms of newly diagnosed cases.' So far the team has used what are termed 'general source' dogs, or strays that have been trained in scent detection methods. Their plan is to now work with researchers at Auburn University's Canine Performance Sciences program in the College of Veterinary Medicine to teach and imprint 'specific purpose' dogs, or those specifically bred for detection. 'If we do 300 samples with a diagnostic accuracy of 90 percent, that's pretty hard to ignore, especially if it comes from Auburn, which has been doing canine training for 25 years,' added Dr Ferrando. 'What we have done, no one has attempted to do,' said lead author Arny Ferrando (pictured), who noted past studies showing trained dogs can tell the difference between various cancerous and non-cancerous tissues .","Frankie was trained to lie down after smelling thyroid cancer in urine .

"Many teenage girls spend a decent chunk of their beauty grooming time trying to hide all signs of baby hair on the forehead. But it seems it is now about to become a blessing, as baby hair is one of THE beauty trends for this summer. As championed by the likes of FKA Twigs, Katy Perry and Rihanna, the short fluff around the top of the forehead is becoming a key accessory. FKA Twigs regularly makes a feature of her baby hair . Katy Perry wore slicked down baby hair at the Givenchy show last month, while Rihanna is also a fan . The style is worn gelled down on the forehead, styled into curls and wavy tendrils. The cutting-edge pop stars aren't the only ones using the style though - several top name designers have also been using their look in their catwalk shows. In February, Riccardo Tisci sent his models down the runway at the Givenchy show with wet look baby hair. The Caitlin Price show at London Fashion Week also used the look, but in a more other-worldy manner. Model's at the Givenchy show in February sported baby hair and facial jewellery . The look also appeared it he DKNY SS15 show and last month's Caitlin Price show in London . The style isn't new - it has been adopted from black and Latina cultures in the US, who have used the look for many years. While the look appears to have the beginnings of a new trend among fashion designers, many have been unimpressed by its use in the shows. Twitter users commented in their hundreds on the look after it featured at Givenchy, with many voicing their distaste. One user called Sandi Cheeks  wrote: 'Givenchy had white models with slicked down ""baby hairs"" I don't know if that counts as embracing Afro-hair.' Another called Bobola_O said: 'Not a fan of Givenchy's gelled baby hair look for their models. When has high fashion ever given a damn about appropriation?","Baby hair was a big trend on catwalks at London and Paris Fashion Week .

"A two-year-old Florida girl died earlier this week after she tumbled out of a minivan and was accidentally run over by her great-grandmother. Izbella Bronson was riding in the back of Alice Barber's 2008 Kia Sedona with the door open on Wednesday afternoon in Palm City when she fell out. Barber, 69, had just picked Izbella' brothers - aged nine and seven - up at the bus stop and was driving the van back up her private driveway. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old Izbella Bronson fell out of Alice Barber's 2008 Kia Sedona on Wednesday in Plant City, Florida . The little girl was run over by one of the van's rear tires and she died later at Tampa General Hospital . No charges are pending because the accident occurred on a private driveway and car seat rules don't apply . The seven-year-old brother was running ahead to the house while Izbella and her other brother sat on the floor of the van with the door open. The little girl fell out just before the van made it back to the house, Bay News 9 reported. She was run over by the van and died after being taken to Tampa General Hospital. Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Larry McKinnon said: 'Unfortunately, this time on the way back, she obviously hit something that knocked the child out and underneath the rear wheels.' There are no charges pending because the accident occurred on a private driveway where car seat rules don't apply, ABC Action News reported. McKinnon said: 'These are potential risks that you take when you put a child that is not secured in a car seat regardless of where it's at.

"A bearded tattoo artist has dressed up as Disney's Elsa- complete with dress and long blonde wig- to take his daughter to a Frozen singalong. Devoted father Rob Chillingworth was snapped riding the tube with his daughter Ruby, who was dressed as snowman Olaf, on the way to the party. The 16st heavy metal fan, from Waltham Abbey in Essex, had his blue sparkly dress and cape specially made to resemble the Disney princess. The picture quickly went viral with more than 1.5 million views in just three days and many hailing him as 'father of the year'. Scroll down for video . Rob Chillingworth was snapped riding the tube with his daughter Ruby, who was dressed as snowman Olaf, on the way to the party . Mr Chillingworth told The Sun: 'The kids had to dress up. I thought I had to as well. 'Ruby said 'you be Elsa'. I had to get the dress made as I'm a big geezerand you can't get them in my size.' On Twitter, many praised the biker with Tina, under the handle @Tinatbh, calling him the 'best dad ever' and Kelsey Dittloff writing that he deserved the 'best dad award .' While Gillian Soden ‏wrote: 'Elsa has let herself go, but you cannot fail to be in awe of these superb parenting skill.' Frozen is the most profitable animated Disney movie of all time and is continuing to rake in staggering amounts of money more than one year after its initial release, thanks to the sell-out success of the movie's merchandise. In the lead-up to Christmas, shops across the country - and around the world -  sold out of all Frozen products, as parents desperately try to get hold of the latest Elsa or Anna doll for their child. The 16st heavy metal fan, from Waltham Abbey in Essex, had the blue sparkly dress and cape made specially made to resemble the Disney princess . For some parents, their children's obsession with the popular animated flick, runs into thousands of pounds a year, with many spending on special themed parties, toys, costumes and other merchandise. As early as March last year, Disney had shifted half a million Anna and Elsa dolls. Two months later they had sold out of dolls altogether, only for desperate parents to discover them re-appearing on eBay, being auctioned for four times their retail price. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, Frozen become a global phenomenon when it opened in 2013. In the Disney film, flawed heroine Elsa has magical powers meaning almost everything she touches turns to ice. After accidentally triggering an eternal winter, Elsa flees her mythical kingdom and her brave younger sister Anna sets out on an epic journey to bring her back. The film, which subverts the fairy-tale premise that a princess's primary purpose should be to bag a handsome prince, picked up two Oscars for best song and best animated feature. But even more startling than its critical acclaim was its commercial success. Frozen is the most profitable animated Disney movie of all time and is continuing to rake in staggering amounts of money more than one year after its initial release . It raked in more than £820million in worldwide ticket sales, and became a huge money spinner – its merchandise boosted Disney profits by 35 per cent in the final quarter of last year, to £920 million and overtook Toy Story 3 to be the biggest animation ever. And there are no signs of  Frozen fever abating any time soon with a sequel on the horizon. Frozen Fever is a seven-minute short film which reunites the cast, characters, directors and even songwriters of the original 2013 movie, and will be screened ahead of Disney's Cinderella (that hits cinemas on March 13 in the US and April 3 in the UK). 'If history is any indicator, kids will go nuts,' Actor Josh Gad - voice of Olaf the snowman - tells USA Today, about the catchy new song. The film will be shown in British cinemas from March 27. Lego has teamed up with Disney to create Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle while Mattel has designed new Elsa and Anna dolls. Gary Grant, chairman of Dream Toys, which compiles the Toy Retailers' Association list of must-have toys, said: 'The popularity of Frozen toys has not waned since Christmas and the Elsa doll remains a top seller.'","Rob Chillingworth dressed as a Disney princess for his daughter Ruby .

"Forget football and the beauty salon - according to a new study, women seek well-travelled, cultured and informed guys, while men seek ambitious, active and creative girls. In a recent eHarmony survey of more than 100,000 members, it was revealed that some hobbies can have a significant impact on boosting a single’s chances of scoring a date, while other pastimes may actually be doing more harm than good. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Lloyd and Kellie Davis-Slade, who met on eHarmony in 2012, say they were instantly attracted to each other's profiles, although they admitted many users secretly make up hobbies in the hope of attracting the opposite sex. 47-year-old Lloyd Davis-Slade (pictured right) and 38-year-old Kellie Davis-Slade (pictured left) met on dating site eHarmony . The couple, who are now the proud parents to one and a half year old daughter Elena Rose, hit it off on the first date. 47-year-old Lloyd, who hails from New York, had been married before and was looking for the love of his life. He knew straight away that 38-year-old Kellie was different to the other five women he had been on dates with from the site. 'I liked the idea of eHarmony because you could put in all the information about yourself and who you are and what you’re looking for in life and what your interests are,' Lloyd told Daily Mail Australia. 'I did it for about a year and I was at the end of it and starting to get discouraged a little bit because I was just going through this series of meet ups and dates and they just weren't going anywhere. All of a sudden, Kellie, who was born in the Chester in the UK, came into his life. She liked the same movies as Lloyd, had the same musical taste and most importantly had the same life goals. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Lloyd and Kellie Davis-Slade, who met on eHarmony in 2012, say they were instantly attracted to each other's profiles, although they admitted many users secretly make up hobbies in the hope of attracting the opposite sex . Politics . Travel . Health/exercise . Food . Theatre . Learning . Photography . Finding love . Charitable . Family . Personal growth . Health/exercise . Food . Family . Dancing . Art . Photography . Friends . Outdoor interests . Work / career . Kellie, who is an IT professional was interested in Kung Fu, while Lloyd, who works in Harley Davidson, was obsessed with motorcycles. 'Our hobbies were different but the thing that really attracted us to each other was our life goals and our plans and what we wanted out of life,' a besotted Lloyd said. 'We both wanted to meet somebody that we could fall in love with. We both wanted to get married. We both wanted to start a family. We both wanted similar life plans. 'I saw her (Kellie), she was lovely and beautiful and she was a good listener and it seemed like she was keen and was looking for the same things as I was.' Just eight months after meeting the pair got married in September 2012 and ten months after that they welcomed their baby girl Elena into the world. Kellie, who is an IT professional was interested in Kung Fu, while Lloyd, who works in Harley Davidson, was obsessed with motorcycles . According to the findings, men with an interest in politics are considered the most attractive to women, followed by those with an interest in travel, health and exercise, food and theatre. On the flipside, the top five hobbies and interests listed by women that are most likely to capture men’s attention are personal growth, health and exercise, food, family and dancing. However, Kellie disputes these findings and said politics would not be on the top of her list when looking for the perfect partner. 'Politics has no effect on how I felt about anyone,' she said. 'For me it was having a varied interest. I looked at the outdoors so somebody who liked that as well. You just want to see that somebody has interest in a few different areas.' While Kellie said exercise was important, she believes some of the men on the site put too much emphasis on their physique. Kellie believes men who come across like they only have one interest are a major turn-off and show that they do not have time in their lives for anything else . 'I noticed when I was on eHarmony most of the guys would upload a photo of when they are overseas, a photo where they're exercising,' she said. 'Men will try and make themselves seem more active than they were so they would make out like they cycled all the time or  lifted weights everyday, when that’s not really the truth. 'People do try and demonstrate that they have varied interests on the site. Although dating wasn't always plain sailing on the site for Kellie and Lloyd. While one woman had posted on her profile saying she didn't have any kids, she suddenly revealed to Lloyd on one of their dates that she actually had an 18-year-old son. Kellie found out the hard way that one man wasn't exactly Mr Right after he failed to let her know he was still living with his ex-girlfriend. Lloyd was different - he made Kellie laugh and had the same life goals as her. 'We just clicked straight away,' she said. Lloyd said he was very honest with Kellie very early on, that way there was no confusion or secrets to be found out later. The pair were married within eight months of meeting and now have a one and a half year old daughter called Elena . 'I was always up front. It actually scared some women away because I came on too full on. It scared away the fails and my attitude was: why else are you on this thing unless you’re planning on settling down?,' he said. 'I think there’s a lot of fear and doubt out there and they’re scared and people so much want to impress somebody and fall in love with somebody, they’re willing to fudge the truth in the beginning. 'Really the best way to get in the door is just to be upfront and truthful in the beginning and that way the right doors open not the wrong doors.' Both Kellie and Lloyd believe many people's profiles can be a major turn-off, with Lloyd claiming women who paraded their wine glasses on their cover photo turned him away. 'There’s a high number of women who put their profile photo up of them drinking. I don’t want to judge but I’m sober, so when I saw that it was a turn-off, it kind of gives the wrong impression,' he said. Exercise . Photography . Personal growth . Travelling . Art . Dancing .

Kellie believes men who come across like they only have one interest are a major turn-off and show that they do not have time in their lives for anything else. 'A lot of men on the profile said they were into football,' she said. 'Really sports mad is really off-putting, especially for me because I don’t like going to sports games. 'A lot of men would really push it. One of the questions was: what are your five favourite things? and some of them would put football for all five. I'm sure they thought it was funny but it was just an immediate no.' Though the findings suggest that personal hobbies and interests can have an impact on how we’re perceived by the opposite sex, eHarmony matches its members based on core personality traits and values, which, in the long run, are far more significant than superficial factors like hobbies which evolve over time.","A new study by eHarmony show hobbies that attract the opposite sex .

"It’s the wonder material that’s 200 times stronger than steel and one million times thinner than human hair, which is set to revolutionise electronics, medicine and transport. Now graphene is set to make its commercial debut in the form of a light bulb in a ‘matter of months’. The  bulb contains a filament-shaped LED coated in the super-strong carbon and is set to go on sale late 2015. The dimmable bulb contains a filament-shaped LED coated in the super-strong carbon, which was co-discovered by Sir Konstantin Novoselov (pictured left). Here, Chancellor George Osborne examines the bulb . British researchers behind the bulb claim it will last longer and be cheaper to make than conventional LEDS, as well as slash energy use by 10 per cent. It looks like a traditional light bulb, but the graphene coating enables it to conduct electricity and heat more effectively, to facilitate the improved performance, meaning users won't have to change their bulbs as regularly. It was designed at the University of Manchester, where graphene was discovered, and will be made by Graphene Lighting PLC, a UK-registered company that’s a spin-out from the university. Professor Colin Bailey, deputy vice-chancellor at the university told the BBC: ‘The graphene light bulb will use less energy. We expect it to last longer. ‘The manufacturing costs are lower and it uses more and more sustainable components.’ The innovative product looks like a traditional light bulb, but the graphene coating enables it to conduct electricity and heat more effectively, to facilitate the improved performance. An illustration of the structure of graphene is shown, made from a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms . Graphene is a single atomic layer of carbon atoms bound in a hexagonal network. It not only promises to revolutionise semiconductor, sensor, and display technology, but could also lead to breakthroughs in fundamental quantum physics research. It is often depicted as an atomic-scale chicken wire made of carbon atoms and their bonds. Scientists believe it could one day be used to make transparent conducting materials, biomedical sensors and even extremely light, yet strong, aircraft of the future. Similar to another important nanomaterial - carbon nanotubes - graphene is incredibly strong - around 200 times stronger than structural steel. The university said in a statement: ‘It is expected that the graphene light bulbs will be on the shelves in a matter of months, at a competitive cost.’ This implies that the graphene bulbs may cost less than LED bulbs, which can be priced at around £15. The graphene light bulb is thought to be the first commercial application of graphene to emerge from the UK’s £61 million National Graphene Institute (NGI), which was opened in Manchester last week by the Chancellor, George Osborne. The wonder material was isolated by university researchers Sir Andre Geim and Sir Kostya Novoselov, earning them the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010. Now more than 200 researchers are studying the material at Manchester to unlock its commercial potential. While the material is difficult to make in large quantities, graphene could one day lead to lighter and more efficient forms of transport such as planes. In the shorter term, it could lead to thinner, lighter, tougher and more efficient smartphones, laptops and wearables such as smartwatches, which could be charged much faster than they can now. The graphene light bulb is thought to be the first commercial application of graphene to emerge from the UK’s £61 million National Graphene Institute (pictured), which opened in Manchester last week . Medical researchers are also excited, because graphene could be used to make nanotechnologies, which could one day provide better cancer treatments, for example and a filter system could create safe drinking water from salt water. Professor Bailey said: ‘This light bulb shows that graphene products are becoming a reality, just a little more than a decade after it was first isolated – a very short time in scientific terms. ‘This is just the start. Our partners are looking at a range of exciting applications, all of which started right here in Manchester. ‘It is very exciting that the NGI has launched its first product despite barely opening its doors yet.’ More than 35 companies have partnered with the university to incorporate graphene into products, such as Head, a company that makes tennis rackets. Graphene is the most conductive material in the world, but because it is thin and flat it doesn’t have the surface area needed to be used in batteries. To increase the size and shape of this so-called super-material, scientists in South Korea have used graphene's sheet-like structure to create ‘pom-poms’. The 3D structures were made by dropping graphene oxide into hot solvent - a process that has been likened to deep-frying food. To increase the surface area of graphene, in order to make it transfer more charge and make it more suitable for use in batteries, scientists at the Yonsei University in Seoul created graphene ‘pom-poms’ (pictured). These 3D spheres were formed by dropping graphene oxide into hot solvent . Deep-fried pom-poms of graphene could ultimately make batteries in phones and tablets smaller, efficient, and more capable of storing and transferring charge. Sang-Hoon Park and his colleagues at Yonsei University, in Seoul put flakes of graphene oxide into an ultrasonic nozzle, which used sound waves to create microdroplets. These microdroplets were when sprayed into a mixture of organic solvent and ascorbic acid, at temperatures of 160°C (320°F). In the solvent and acid, the graphene oxide was turned into graphene, the water in the droplets evaporated, and the resulting spheres resembled pom-poms. As they formed, nanosheets in the graphene spilled out from the centre, creating ‘waves’ of particles. This created so-called nanochannels, which increased the area in which charge could be transferred. Early tests with the graphene pom-poms showed that they performed better as electrodes compared to typical sheets of graphene.","Bulb contains a filament-shaped LED coated in ultra conductive graphene .

"He may be known for his party-loving ways, but Prince Harry works tirelessly to help vulnerable children living in extreme poverty at risk of AIDS - and now his services are being recognised. As part of his Sentebale charity, which he set up with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, the 30-year-old royal built the Mamohato Children’s Centre to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education. And now, Harry's programme will be receiving the 2015 Swarovski Crystal Of Hope Award at the glittering Life Ball event in May. Prince Harry, who set up Sentebale, a charity that provides healthcare and education to vulnerable children in Lesotho, Southern Africa, will be honoured with an award for his services . Speaking about the award, Life Ball founder Gery Keszler told FEMAIL: 'We always select programmes to receive this award that are relatively unsung heroes, doing interesting, innovative and important work but not yet well-known. 'This award not only donates substantial funds, but also brings an international spotlight to the work. I will be visiting the programme in April, which helps children living with HIV/AIDS educationally, emotionally and physically - it is really exceptional and we are proud to be working with them.' As part of his Sentebale charity, Harry built the Mamohato Children's Centre to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education and the initiative is being awarded . Speaking about the award, Life Ball founder Gery Keszler, who selected Harry's work, told FEMAIL: 'We always select programmes to receive this award that are relatively unsung heroes, doing interesting, innovative and important work but not yet well known' The Life Ball, which takes place in May, is the biggest charity event in Europe supporting people with HIV/AIDS and is being dubbed Europe's answer to the MET Ball thanks to it's dazzling guestlist. Speaking about the origins of the glittering event, Keszler said: 'Life Ball was born out of the energy and environment prevalent across the world in the late 80’s and early 90’s - particularly in the fashion industry - that saw AIDS as a daily issue profoundly effecting our friends and colleagues who were dying, but that no one understood or was willing to talk about. 'There was this undercurrent of urgency to do something: to help, to get involved and make some noise. 'My main goal with the first Life Ball was to bring a spotlight to the disease, the fundraising aspect was a secondary consideration.' Prince Harry's award will be announced at The Life Ball, pictured, which is the biggest charity event in Europe supporting people with HIV or AIDS and is being dubbed Europe's answer to the MET Ball . Gery Keszler set up the event in 1992 with the goal of the show being to be provocative and have HIV/AIDS and the taboo that it represented acknowledged . Gery Keszler, left, pictured with Sir Elton John, centre, set up The Life Ball in 1992 to raise vital funds . The event, which has attracted the likes of Bill Clinton, left, and Dame Vivienne Westwood, aims to get people talking about AIDS, which Keszler says was a daily issue profoundly effecting his friends and colleagues who were dying but that no one understood or was willing to talk about . Keszler aimed to marry the unique and prolific Ball tradition that they have in Vienna, and combine the splendour of the Viennese Waltz with modern, liberal ideals to celebrate life. 'At that time, the goal of the show was to be provocative as we were aiming to cause a stir and have HIV/AIDS and the taboo that it represented acknowledged,' he explained. 'When in 1993 one of my clients, Thierry Mugler’s main stylist, died of the disease, he agreed to do the fashion show and so Life Ball as a standalone event was born. 'I had no conceivable idea what I was taking on, it was me and a fax machine in six square meters of office space in my client's kitchen. I funded it entirely from my own pocket and didn’t really know if anyone was going to attend but knew that we had to do something.' Keszler aimed to marry the unique and prolific Ball tradition that they have in Vienna with more liberal ideas (Conchita Wurst pictured at the event) Keszler says this year's Life Ball, which takes place in Vienna, will 'undoubtedly be better than ever' Keszler 'strongly believes' that a cure for HIV is on the horizon and hopes to make as much noise about it as possible via his glittering event . From there, a huge event was born and the likes of Debbie Harry, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen were among the first guests. The event is now listed as one of the top 50 HIV/AIDS fundraisers in the world and has partnered with Elton John’s AIDS Foundation, Bill Clinton’s AIDS Initiative and AmFAR. Keszler says this year’s Life Ball will 'undoubtedly be better than ever'. The event will be continuing its work with Elton John’s foundation, supporting the crucial work that they do, and Graham Norton will be attending as part of the foundation. Adding some high fashion glamour to the event, Jean Paul Gaultier is set to unveil an exclusive retrospective of work twenty years after he first showed there. With gold as this year’s Life Ball theme, taking inspiration from the exquisite baroque Vienna Secessionists, the couture show will follow the vibrant and ostentatious theme with a bevy of internationally acclaimed supermodels set to walk for well-connected Jean Paul. 'It is really perfect timing to have JPG back this year,' said Keszler. 'It has been twenty years since he was part of the Life Ball and we are at such an exciting time in our medical fight against HIV that his presence is a wonderful reminder of how far we have come.' The event is now listed as one of the top 50 HIV AIDS fundraisers in the world and has attracted guests such as Maria Cross, left, and Antonio Banderas and Naomi Campbell, right . Ricky Martin has performed at the event in previous years and 2015 will welcome Jean Paul Gaultier and Charlize Theron . Jean Paul's show will be watched from the front row by actress Charlize Theron, who will attend on behalf of her foundation Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project. Theron will join a bevy of A-list celebrities and performers, who pour into Vienna annually to help fight against HIV at the world’s largest AIDS event. The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project, based in her home country of South Africa, is dedicated to addressing HIV/AIDS in adolescents across sub-Saharan Africa through education, grant giving, networking and community outreach. Theron will give a keynote speech at the First Ladies Luncheon at the Belvedere Castle in Vienna ahead of attending the Life Ball, where she will present the work of her organisation and her vision for and AIDS-free generation. So who would Keszler love to host? 'We have long been aware of Prince William’s continued support of HIV AIDS organisations, much like his brother, following in the footsteps of their mother and would naturally consider supporting any relevant programme. 'He and the Duchess of Cambridge are both welcome guests at Life Ball,' he said. Keszler won't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change . Keszler 'strongly believes' that a cure for HIV is on the horizon and that the leap forward that was affordable generic medication was crucial to the fight for survival for the 34 million people in the world living with HIV. 'Ironically we have further to go in the fight against social AIDS than we do the medical disease now and thus it is this fight that we must be equally concerned with,' he said. But that's where the Life Ball comes in - and he won't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change. He concludes: 'Life Ball is symbolic, it is a unique weekend in the year in which the world’s most significant AIDS organisations come together, stand together, fight together and continue to fight for those who are not able to fight for themselves. 'It is my constant desire for Life Ball weekend to expand, to obtain more friends, have better connections, help more programmes and become internationally known for fighting social AIDS as well as the disease itself.'","As part of his Sentebale charity Harry built the Mamohato Children's Centre .

"Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality glasses start-up, has provided a rare glimpse into the capabilities of its technology. The company, who received $542 million (£352 million) in funding by Google, today released a video that showcases its augmented reality graphics in a real-life setting. Titled 'Just another day in the office of Magic Leap', the clip shows an office worker scrolling down his email inbox, which appears in front of him as a hologram. Scroll down for video .

The Florida-based company was meant to show at the TED conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, this week, but mysteriously cancelled its appearance. Its system is currently one of the most highly-anticipated, and secretive, virtual reality glasses in development. Last month, the company revealed some details about its augmented reality glasses - although it appears the technology still needs a full trolley of parts to work. The 3D system operates by shining images on the retina, creating an augmented reality which combines fictional characters with the real world.

Its system is currently one of the most highly-anticipated, and secretive, virtual reality glasses in development. Pictured is a scene from the video . Until now, very few details about the Florida-based technology had been revealed.  Rachel Metz, writing for MIT Technology Review, was able to test out one of the larger systems. The patent shows that, in terms of design, the headset resembles skiing goggles . Rachel Metz, writing for MIT Technology Review, was able to test out one of the larger systems which will compete with the likes of Facebook's Oculus Rift and Microsoft's HoloLens. 'Magic Leap had to come up with an alternative to stereoscopic 3-D – something that doesn't disrupt the way you normally see things,' she wrote. 'As I see crisply rendered images of monsters, robots, and cadaver heads in Magic Leap's offices, I can envision someday having a video chat with faraway family members who look as if they're actually sitting in my living room while, on their end, I appear to be sitting in theirs. 'Or walking around New York City with a virtual tour guide, the sides of buildings overlaid with images that reveal how the structures looked in the past.' Magic Leap's Florida-based makers said it is a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality, which it calls 'cinematic reality'. The firm's website features an elephant (pictured) moving  realistically in a person's hands . Sensors can track the wearer's location and position, to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible. Buttons on the visor could act like a 'home screen', to take wearers to menus, for example. While other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus, copy, select and back . She says the experience is like 'watching movies where the characters appear to be right in front of me, letting me follow them around as the plot unfolds.' In October, Magic Leap announced it had raised $542 million in funding, led by Google. Other investors included Qualcomm, the world's leading phone chipmaker, Andreessen Horowitz, KKR, and Legendary Entertainment. The patent was filed in July 2014 by chief executive Rony Abovitz, and was awarded earlier this week. In terms of design, the headset resembles skiing goggles, connected to a battery pack. It connects to a network, which then connects to a so-called 'passable world model.' This model is created using a database of objects and 'object recognisers'. Sensors can also track the wearer's location and position, to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible. Buttons on the visor could act like a 'home screen', to take wearers to menus, for example. While other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus, copy, select, back or cancel, and right clicks. In one drawing from the patent, a mother and child are in a supermarket, and a virtual version of their list appears on the trolley. Other drawings show a man watching sport on this TV, with scores, player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him. The company appears to be aiming to fit its technology into a chunky pair of sports sunglasses wired to a square pack that users can place in their pocket. But the prototype that Ms Meltz used was fixed on 'unwieldy scaffolding'. The company won't say how it will shrink its device, but chief executive Rony Abovitz has confirmed that the headset will be a glasses-like system. Despite the secrecy surrounding the system, it has been deemed exciting enough for Google to have invested around $500 million. Other investors included Qualcomm, the world's leading phone chipmaker, Andreessen Horowitz, KKR, and Legendary Entertainment. In January, an extensive patent not only showed how the augmented reality headset could look and work, it also provides a number of example uses. The patent was filed in July 2014 by chief executive Rony Abovitz, and was awarded earlier this week. It features a total of 180 pages and drawings detailing the look, functionality and uses for the device. In terms of design, the headset resembles skiing goggles, connected to a battery pack.

Sensors can also track the wearer's location and position, to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible, with the correct depth and proportions. Further into the patent, a number of case uses are shown in the form of drawings. One shows a man watching sport on TV, with scores, player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him . An example image, showing the blurring of a fantastical virtual reality object and the real world produced by the technology, is pictured. As part of Google's investment, Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps at the search engine, will join Magic Leap's board . Buttons on the visor could act like a 'home screen', to take wearers to menus, for example. While other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus, copy, select, back or cancel, and right clicks. Mr Abovitz recently said: 'We have the term 'cinematic reality' because we are disassociated with those things. 'When you see this, you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years. 'To go farther and deeper than we're going, you would be changing what it means to be human.' The soon-to-be defunct Google Glass, already lets users see augmented reality. Using a particular app for example, runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them. The Magic Leap patent shows how its headset could be used in a similar way by cyclists, for example. Google Glass also superimposes information on the periphery of a wearer's vision. Facebook spent $2 billion buying Oculus last year, which makes a virtual reality headset, mostly aimed at gamers. Unlike Magic Leap's future device, it blocks out the real world around the user. Gamers hope Facebook and Google's involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology, which would make playing games and watching films more realistic, as well as creating other immersive experiences. A release date and price for the Magic Leap headset have not been revealed. Magic Leap's system claims to be more realistic than the Oculus Rift (pictured). The firm was bought last year by Facebook for $2 billion, and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the headset to be launched .

"Michael Graydon, 29, had been missing for two weeks before his body was found in  Monaco today . A British boxing promoter has been found dead in Monaco after going missing two weeks ago. Michael Graydon, 29, from Stockwood, Bristol, became separated from a friend outside the Rascasse nightclub on February 21, and was last seen on CCTV at about 1.30am. The father-of-one was in the principality  to watch a boxing match featuring Bristol fighter and friend, Lee Haskins. But he never made it to the event and missed his flight home, prompting a major police search around harbours and marinas nearby. The body was found today 'behind a little church' in the Sainte Devote area of Monaco, close to where he was last seen, a Monaco government spokeswoman confirmed. Genevieve Berti, deputy director of the Monaco Media Bureau, said: 'We can confirm on the death of a British national - Michael Graydon, who had previously been reported missing, in Monaco. 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' Ms Berti added that footage showed Mr Graydon climbing over the wall of a property and said it is believed that he then fell. She added that the body was unrecognisable due to be in an advanced state of decomposition, but tattoos on the arms were 'really comparable' to the ones described by his family. He was also carrying his driving licence, which confirmed the name of Michael Graydon. Ms Berti said the death is not being treated as suspicious, adding that no one else can be seen in the CCTV images. Following his disappearance a 12-strong group of close family and friends travelled to central Monaco to hand out leaflets and meet police and legal officials. The father-of-one, pictured left with son Reuben, had been in Monaco to watch a boxing match featuring friend Lee Haskins when he disappeared after a night out clubbing . He became separated from a friend outside the Rascasse night club and was last seen on CCTV at 1.36am . The former boxer missed the match he was due to watch and flight home, prompting a huge police search . Stacey Marie Jones, a close friend, described Mr Graydon as 'the kind of man who would do anything for anybody'. Speaking before today's discovery, she said: 'He is such a family man and such a mother's boy that we knew that when he had not been in contact with his mother that something was wrong. 'We are not leaving Monaco and we are not going to stop until we have answers and until he is back home with us - whether that be in body or in spirit. 'He has a two-year-old son, Reuben, who will need answers. We do not believe that anyone can go missing in Monaco and no-one would know what happened to him.' Well-wishers raised £15,000 since Tuesday to help fund the search and hire lawyers in Monaco, while members of the public held a march in Bristol to support his family and friends. A message posted on a social media page, set up to help find Mr Graydon, said today: 'From the family and friends of Michael, thank you for the support and messages over the last weeks. It meant so much.' After his disappearance a group of 12 family and friends flew to Monaco to start searching for him themselves . They set up a social media page and gave out flyers in a bid to find Mr Graydon - described as a family man .

"Robert Durst has been transferred to a prison wing for the mentally ill in New Orleans while he awaits extradition to LA to face a murder charge as questions surfaced over his links to two missing California girls. The troubled real estate heir was moved to the acute mental health facility at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in Louisiana because he is considered a suicide risk, according to the sheriff's office on Wednesday. Durst has been charged with murder over the execution-style shooting of friend, Susan Berman, 15 years ago in LA. He also has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen McCormack, in New York. And now, Eureka Police Department in California has said they want to probe links between Durst and 16-year-old Karen Marie Mitchell, who vanished after leaving her aunt's store in 1997. Durst had reportedly visited the aunt's store dressed in drag. Five months earlier, Kristen Modafferi, 18, also vanished after leaving her job in San Francisco. Durst was in the Bay area at the time, CBS reported. Scroll down for video . Robert Durst grinned as he was transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on Tuesday . Law enforcement officers stand outside the building where Robert Durst is believed to own three condominiums on Tuesday in Houston, Texas. Cops and the FBI searched the millionaire's home and left with two boxes, possibly of evidence . In 2003, Durst was acquitted of murder after he admitted to killing a neighbor in self-defense, dismembering him and throwing the body parts in Galveston Bay, Texas. Durst's lawyer does not believe his client suffers from acute mental illness, according to a brief filed by the sheriff's office on Tuesday. A three-judge panel ruled that the sheriff has sole authority to decide where to house inmates needing mental health treatment. The magistrate agreed Durst should stay in the city jail so he could help his defense team prepare for his weapons case. But the sheriff's office said in its brief that lawyers could have 'virtually unrestricted access' to Durst with 24 hours' notice to the prison. Dick DeGuerin, Durst's lead attorney in New Orleans, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As Durst was placed in psychiatric care on Tuesday, police raided his home in Houston, removing two boxes of possible evidence. Seven officers searched Durst's home for several hours at a 17-story condominium building in an upmarket neighborhood before carrying out two white cardboard document boxes. Around 8.30pm the officers, including one wearing a Los Angeles Police Department badge, carried two  boxes to their six vehicles and left. FBI agents were participating in the operation at the request of the LAPD, a spokeswoman said. The LAPD would not comment until Durst was in the department's custody. Eureka police said on Tuesday they would like to speak to Durst about his possible connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997 . Five months before Miss Mitchell's disappearance, Kristen Modafferi, 18, also vanished after leaving her job in San Francisco . Dick DeGuerin, Durst's longtime Houston defense attorney, said he was baffled by what investigators could be looking for in the condo building. 'I don't know what they're looking for. I don't know what they could be looking for 15 years after Susan Berman was killed 1,500 miles away... I think it's a publicity stunt. 'I'm not surprised by it, but I would really be surprised if they found anything of any evidentiary value,' he said. 'They can search now till kingdom come. They're not going to find anything because there isn't anything.' Durst's arrest in New Orleans came the day before the finale of HBO series, The Jinx, about his links to the three killings. On the final episode, Durst made an apparent confession, saying in an unguarded moment: 'I killed them all, of course.' Eureka Police Department in California has said they want to speak to those investigating Durst in LA and New Orleans about a missing teenage girl from the late 90s, NBC News reported on Tuesday. Karen Mitchell, 16, vanished in  Eureka, California, on November 25, 1997. Author, Matt Birkbeck, who has written repeatedly about Durst, claimed to CBS that Durst had been seen with the teen at a homeless shelter where she volunteered. Eureka Police Department Chief Andy Mills said on Tuesday that he believed foul play was involved in the girl's disappearance and that he wanted to know more about the time when Durst was in California. Five months earlier on June 23, North Carolina college student Kristen Modafferi vanished on a trip to San Francisco . However he cautioned against any conclusions being drawn too quickly. Durst was being held in Louisiana on drug and weapons charges after being found with a quarter-pound of marijuana and a revolver during his arrest on Saturday. It's not clear how soon he will be returned to California. The real estate mogul was charged on Monday in LA with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Susan Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. Durst was rebooked on charges of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance, a small amount of marijuana on Tuesday . In the six-part documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, the 71-year-old mumbled about how he 'killed them all,' providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series. But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote. Analysis linked a letter Durst wrote to Berman a year before her killing with one that pointed police to her body, and that was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation. Bob Martin, who has lived with his wife, Carol, in the Houston condo building for 18 months, said he would occasionally say hello to Durst and discuss the real estate market with him. He described Durst as no quirkier than anyone else in the building. He added that Durst would occasionally attend the building's homeowners' association meetings and that the building staff reported Durst was courteous to them, as well. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him with being a felon in possession of a gun and with having marijuana. Assistant District Mark Burton said investigators found more than a quarter-pound of pot and a revolver in his hotel room. Attorney Dick DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest. 'The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact,' he said. 'We want a hearing as quickly as possible so Mr. Durst can go to California and face trial as quickly as possible.' The judge in New Orleans has scheduled another hearing for next Monday. Robert Durst is escorted into Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment. He was later moved to a psychiatric care ward .","Authorities searched the Houston home of Robert Durst, 71, on Tuesday and left with two boxes of possible evidence .

"A couple's adventure touring the beautiful wildlife of Africa is set to be documented in a stunning new photobook. Kym, 53, and Tonya Illman, 47, from Perth, Australia, utilised remote controlled camera buggies, hidden cameras and quad-copters among other things, to portray African wildlife in different ways. The couple have managed to join in with packs of cheetahs, wild dogs, elephants and one occasion grabbing the attention of a young lion for a photo Mr Illman calls the 'lion selfie'. Scroll down for video . The 'lion selfie' is one of the Illman's proudest shots, from their mesmerising set of African wildlife photographs . The couple's adventure touring the beautiful wildlife of Africa is set to be documented in a new book, this photo is called Elephant Trumpets and was taken in Tanzania . Kym and Tonya Illman utilised remote controlled camera buggies, hidden cameras and quad-copters among other things, to portray African wildlife in different ways, including this Impala relaxing at the Manyara Ranch in Tanzania . They plan to feature more than 140 of their finest images, along with the story behind each one, in Africa on Safari, a 204-page book launched on Kickstarter imminently. 'We carry more photographic gear on safari than almost anyone, except perhaps the BBC,' said Mr Illman. 'People (and animals) are most intrigued by our remote-controlled camera buggy though.' The battery operated 4WD camera buggy was custom made to carry a Canon 5D Mark 3 camera with a 16-35mm lens. The pair use the buggy primarily on private game reserves or conservancies with the approval of the guide or game reserve manager. Mr Illman said: 'Low and wide angle shots of wild animals are rare captures. Unlike normal shots taken from the roof of a vehicle, the horizon is low and the animal looks large as it approaches the hidden camera or buggy. People simply aren't used to seeing this perspective.' The photographs, including this cheetah at a Lion Park in Zimbabwe, will be documented in a 204-page book set to be launched on Kickstarter imminently .

The wildlife-loving Australians the buggy primarily on private game reserves or conservancies with the approval of the guide or game reserve manager; here eland run towards the camera . The couple have spent more than 22 weeks in Africa over the past two years alone, photographing for the book and have got frighteningly close to an array of wildlife. 'We put the buggy out with a male lion one day but when it started raining, I drove it back to our safari vehicle,' said Mr Illman explaining the day they snapped the 'Lion Selfie'. 'Two sub adults saw it and followed it back. Not wanting them to damage it, I drove it under the vehicle hoping they'd depart. They didn't so Tonya quickly mounted a camera on a monopod and connected a remote shutter. I lowered the monopod through the open window and when the lion came closer and started pawing it gently, Tonya clicked the remote shutter - my lower hand just 50cm from its paw.' Kym, 53, and Tonya Illman, 47, from Perth, Australia, manage to show their love for Africa with their stunning photography skills . Mobile cameras and video cameras capture the wildlife in their natural habitat; pictured here are buffalo in Zimbabwe . A gorilla in Rwanda makes the final cut in the Australian couple's beautiful set of wildlife photographs . The pair, who immersed themselves in photography four years ago, have also used a quad-copter. 'A number of aerial shots feature in the book, shots that many years ago would have been impossible to capture,' said Mr Illman. 'Unfortunately, a couple of countries have limited the use of drones over the past 12 months so these shots will be harder to acquire in the future.' Mr Illman's wife had been to Africa in the 90's but it took her two decades to convince him to join her on a second safari. He said: 'Tonya thought I would love it but for decades I resisted. Then one day, she called me at work and said, 'I've decided we're taking the boys (then aged 10 and 12) on safari in South Africa. I've booked flights for the four of us; you can book the accommodation'.' A group of lions looking into the camera buggy in Tanzania, thankfully the photographer was at a safe distance . This photo shows a giraffe from eye level which was shot using the quad-copter in Tanzania . A leopard makes a move as it appears to hunt its prey, caught on camera very close-up, in Tanzania . This lion's intrigue saw him get up close and personal to the camera, but unfortunately for her, it wasn't edible . Resigned to the prospect, Mr Illman scoured the net and, being a passionate photographer, bought a number of African wildlife photography books. 'I quickly became aware of the awe-inspiring photographic opportunities that a safari offered and decided I would embrace the trip,' said Mr Illman. Since then the Illmans have shot more than a quarter of a million images and have settled on 143 of their best to feature in this large format book, Africa on Safari, to be published by London-based Papadakis Publisher and released later this year. This elephant in Zimbabwe is caught doing some of its daily exercise as its trunk reaches into the foliage . A leopard guards a dead zebra; all aspects of life on safari are documents in the photo set . Mrs Illman added: 'A lot of our work requires two people. Kym can be a little disorganised and when you have 3,000 images to wade through at day's end, my organisational skills come to the fore. Having two of us shooting also allows one to shoot wide, the other tight, resulting in two different perspectives.' The couple admit that with so many great shots to choose from, it's hard to leave certain shots out. 'We have an abundance of lion photos, we could do a whole world-class book on lions but we're having to jettison so many of them so it's not lion-indulgent,' explains Mr Illman.

'Like most women (and quite a few men) I cant think of anything sensible to #AskPoldark once Aidan takes his shirt off. Sorry,' wrote one hyperventilating fan. Another, named Sarah Hook, asked: '#AskPoldark why was I never offered the position of painting semi nude actors when I had my careers talk at school?!' Turner, although slow to respond to marriage proposals, gamely attempted to answer many of the more sensible questions offered up by fans, including one about his new-found fame. Swooning: A fan named Jane Williams spoke for many when she shared her appreciation of shirtless scenes . Compliments: Many of the questions offered up by fans focused on Aidan Turner's looks . Nice work! Another wished that her careers' advice had included tips on becoming a make-up artist . Asked whether he knew that a Twitter account dedicated to his hair existed, the Irishman answered: 'I am aware, yeah! It’s pretty hilarious!' Not everyone was happy with his answers, however, with one fan complaining that Turner took longer to answer than his character did to find copper - a reference to the ongoing plot line about Poldark's mining activities. 'Did he answer any of the questions or has he been removed to some sort of high security location for his own protection? #AskPoldark', wrote another fan named Katy Moran afterwards. Most, however, contented themselves with firing questions on everything from gardening to the pedestrianisation of Norwich city centre at the actor. Gardening: Another popular topic with fans was gardening - in particular the scything of lawns . Left field: Others offered up some more unusual questions about the election and Norwich city centre . Too slow: Others complained about the actor's slowness to answer questions . Among the more amusing was a question from a Twitter user named Linda who asked the actor whether he might be interested in a spot of gardening. 'My mower has packed up,' she wrote. 'Would you come round and scythe my lawn please? #AskPoldark' Another, David Hussey, offered up a tongue-in-cheek query that read: 'AskPoldark thinking of ditching the wife, running off with a red-haired wench and opening a copper mine. Any tips or pilchard recipes?' Most entertaining of all was a fan who quizzed Turner on his plans for life post-Poldark. 'Would you consider presenting Top Gear?' asked Adele Mitchell. Turner chose not to answer that one. Pin up: Another asked how Turner's new-found pin-up status was working out for him . Clarkson's replacement?

"A University of Oklahoma student has claimed today that the sick racist chant that brought national disgust on the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity is a longstanding tradition among brothers at the organization. A student spoke out to the Today show to say that she had heard the 'there will never be a n***** in SAE' chant from members of the fraternity at least two years ago and that the brothers all thought it was a gas. 'I would definitely say this is not an isolated incident,' the student, who did not want to be named, told Today. Scroll down for video . 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma . Cut it off! As one frat brother gleefully sings a racist chant, another steps in and tries to cut off recording of the shameful incident . 'It was really offensive to sit there and listen to that especially because they would just chant it and then laugh after and they thought it was funny.' Meanwhile, the national SAE headquarters announced that it was investigating reports of other incidents at other chapters across the country. The fraternity traces its founding back to 1856 at the University of Alabama - before the Civil War an the end of slavery. It has 218 active chapters, more than 15,000 student members and 325,000 alumni. The fraternity has chapters at the most prestigious universities in the country, including Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT and Duke, as well as some of the largest universities - including Texas A&M, Ohio State and Penn State. The SAE fraternity was disbanded by the national headquarters and banned from campus by University of Oklahoma officials . 'Several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters staff and leaders, and each of those instances will be investigated for further action,' the fraternity said. However, the fraternity - which is now headquartered at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois - denied claims that the racist song sung by University of Oklahoma brothers was a widespread tradition. 'Some reports have alleged that the racist chant in the video is part of a Sigma Alpha Epsilon tradition, which is completely false. The fraternity has a number of songs that have be,' the statement said. The chant, which surfaced Sunday in a nine-second video, appears to be a well-known song to the fraternity brothers. As some members began singing it, others can be seen standing up to join in. SAE officials quickly disbanded the Oklahoma chapter of the fraternity and launched their own investigation following outrage over the clip.","A student, who refused to be identified, claims that 'this was not an isolated incident'

"Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, appearing this morning in his first nationally-broadcast interview since announcing yesterday that he would run for president, attempted to shed his conservative hardliner image. Cruz said social liberals were 'absolutely' welcome in his version of the Republican Party and that he's willing to compromise - as long as those concessions move the country forward. 'I have never said I won't compromise,' Cruz told Today's Matt Lauer after the ABC News host asked if he'd bring the same brand of 'no compromise' politics to the White House that he's brought to the Senate. Scroll down for videos . Republican Sen. Ted Cruz appeared this morning in his first nationally-broadcast interview since announcing yesterday that he would run for president . Cruz, accompanied by his wife Heidi for the interview, attempted to shed his conservative hardliner image. 'I have never said I won't compromise,' he told Today's Matt Lauer after the ABC News host asked if he'd bring the same brand of 'no compromise' politics to the White House that he's brought to the Senate . The 44-year-old Texas senator contended that from day one he has said he'd compromise the way that revered Republican president Ronald Reagan did. 'What do you do if they offer you half a loaf? Answer: you take it,' he said, 'and then come back.' Confronted with a past statement in which he said, 'I don't think Washington needs is more compromise,' Cruz suggested to Lauer that his words had been misinterpreted. 'What Washington does often is it compromises going backwards,' he said. 'I'm perfectly happy to work with anyone, Democrat, independent, libertarian, Republican, if they are shrinking the size and power of the federal government, if they are turning around the debt, if they're expanding liberty.' Cruz said that lawmakers in the nation's capitol often makes deals that are 'not a good compromise' thought because they don't fix the problem at hand. A freshman senator, Cruz said he's sought 'more than anything else' during his time in the federal government is to 'tell the truth' and 'do what I said I would do.' Though voters may not always agree with his principles, the conservative lawmaker said he believes they can respect that he stays true to his word. With his run for the White House Cruz said he hopes to rebuild the coalition that elected Reagan and attract more women, Hispanics and young people to the Republican Party. Presidential candidate-in-waiting Rand Paul suggested in an interview Monday night on Fox News that his Senate colleague panders too much to conservatives to grow the GOP, however. Acknowledging that he and Cruz have 'very, very similar voting records,' Paul said 'what makes us different is probably our approach as to how we would make the party bigger.' 'And I’m a big believer that you should stand on principle, and be true to your principles. But I also think that we should take those principles and try to bring in new people with them,' he asserted. Paul pointed out that as part of his preparations for a national run, he's traveled to areas that Republicans don't traditionally campaign in and spoken to groups such as the NAACP that Republicans haven't historically engaged with. 'And maybe not just throwing out red meat, but actually throwing out something intellectually enticing to people who haven’t been listening to our message before.' Continuing he said, 'So, it isn’t just about rousing the base, it’s about exciting the base by being for the principles of liberty, but it’s then taking those principles of liberty, not diluting them, and taking them to new people and bringing them into the party. 'That’s the way you win general elections.' The 52-year-old freshman lawmaker argued that his approach makes him more viable in a general election that other conservatives vying for the nomination - including Cruz. 'There will be a lot of conservatives. Ted Cruz is a conservative, but it also goes to winnability, and people will have to make a decision which is the Republican that can not only excite the base, but can also bring new people into the party without giving up principles,' he said, noting that he fares better in polls against presumed Democratic presidential candidate, and nominee, Hillary Clinton. Heidi said a trait that drew her to her husband was that he is 'a person of conviction.' She said, 'Ted Cruz is someone who tells the truth. He knows what he believes' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul speaks with diners at Beantowne Coffee House & Cafe on Saturday in Hampstead, New Hampshire. Paul said in an interview Monday that he'd be a better general election candidate than Cruz or any of the other conservatives running because he appeals to groups that are not  traditionally Republican . Joining Cruz for his interview Tuesday morning was his wife, Heidi. A trait that drew her to her husband, the the senator's wife said, is that he is 'a person of conviction.' 'Ted Cruz is someone who tells the truth. He knows what he believes.' He's also very 'agile' in fragile situations, she said, repeating phrasing Lauer used in a question to her. Lauer had noted Cruz's kindly response to a little girl at one of his recent speeches who became frightened when he claimed that the 'world is on fire.' Heidi said he takes the same care when addressing his six-year-old, Caroline. Recently, Caroline came home from school, she said, upset that everyone was talking about her father rather than her. 'And Ted said, ""Wow,"" he said,"" the same is true for me. I spend my day talking about you!""= . Mrs. Cruz, who has not made herself available in the past for major media interviews quite like her talkative husband, commented that it may not be possible to ever 'feel fully prepared' for a journey like the one she and her family are taking, 'but we have a very strong marriage, an incredibly strong family, and are guided by our faith. 'I think we are ready to see change in this country,' she added. 'We're honored to have a voice in that.'","The 44-year-old Texas Republican and his wife, Heidi, sat down with Today's Matt Lauer .

Bush aides told the paper that none of the emails contained classified information and that most of the information was already public knowledge. This comes just over a week after Bush publicly attacked Clinton for using her personal email while serving as Secretary of State. 'For security purposes, you need to be behind a firewall that recognizes the world for what it is, and it’s a dangerous world, and security would mean that you couldn’t have a private server,' said Bush in an interview with Radio Iowa. 'It’s a little baffling, to be honest with you, that didn’t come up in Secretary Clinton’s thought process.' Communications director Tim Miller said of this new report; 'This Democrat opposition research dump of a few innocuous e-mails that Gov. Bush voluntarily posted on a Web site only highlights how large the gap is between him and Clinton in the area of transparency.' This news comes just one week after Bush attacked Hillary Clinton (above) for using her personal email while Secretary of State . Johannes Ullrich, a cybersecurity expert, outlines the problem however with using a personal account, which is far easier to get in to for a hacker. 'The bigger issue here is, what else can an attacker do?' he said. 'Now I may be able to penetrate a National Guard commander’s laptop by infecting it or by impersonating Jeb Bush’s account. . . . Now you may even be able to give the order to remove troops or change deployments.' The Democratic National Committee said they still have questions for Bush, with spokeswoman Holly Shulman saying; 'The GOP presidential hopefuls’ attacks on this issue are completely disingenuous, and there are still a litany of questions Republicans need to answer, like what e-mails has Jeb Bush not turned over?'","Jeb Bush used his private account while he was governor of Florida to discuss a variety of topics .

'For example, some companies allow for unmetered viewing of catch-up TV programming like that offered by ABC’s iView. 'With other providers that are metered you should note that a 60 minute program can potentially consume up to 300MB of data. 'When making the switch to Internet television you also need to consider how well your devices and the platform are able to stream videos.

"A self-styled Lord who was released from prison as an ‘act of mercy’ when he convinced judges he was gravely ill is clearly enjoying life as a free man. Edward Davenport, nicknamed ‘Fast Eddie’, was jailed for eight years in 2011 for masterminding a £4.5million fraud where he hoodwinked the rich and famous. Last May he was released early after claiming he was 'at death's door' because of kidney problems and suffering the 'ordeal' of having to leave prison each week for life-saving dialysis. But eight months on socialite Davenport looks to be close to a full recovery as he had fun with a friend on Saturday. New life: Eight months after being released from prison on health grounds Edward 'Fast Eddie' Davenport is seen here kissing a friend on Saturday . He was seen kissing and hugging an unnamed woman as they walked through central London. As a property developer and party organiser he  made millions and boasted of befriending guests including supermodel Kate Moss and Princes William and Harry. His £30million home, a mansion in London’s West End, was the former Sierra Leone High Commission and was used as a location for the Oscar-winning film The King’s Speech. But the socialite was ruined when he was exposed as a fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes and jailed - only for his health to falter. Last year he was pictured handcuffed to a prison guard in hospital after undergoing a second kidney transplant. He said at the time: ‘I know I’m fighting a death sentence. ‘I feel like an old man shuffling around, chained to a prison officer even when I want to go to the bathroom. 'I can’t even wear my own silk pyjamas – I have to wear the hospital ones. The truth is I feel shaky. I know I’m at death’s door'. Fall from grace: Davenport was one of London's richest and most popular socialites until he was convicted of a multi-million pound fraud and later required a second kidney transplant . Contrast: A grey-looking Davenport shortly before he was jailed for almost eight years in 2011 and, right, enjoying the sunshine in central London with a companion over the weekend . Judges agreed to his plea for clemency and cut his sentence by a year to allow him to be released early after serving around three years. Davenport's fall from grace is a far cry from his days at the heart of the London party scene in the 1980s. His black-tie Gatecrasher Balls, aimed at wealthy public school teenagers, quickly became synonymous with drunkenness and debauchery and helped him make his fortune. But it also led to his first fraud conviction and nine months in jail. Despite the setback, Davenport never lost his love of taking risks – even though it repeatedly landed him in trouble. In 1998, he and two other men were charged with running up an £18,000 bill at the luxury Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland during a five-day New Year party while posing as aristocrats. They denied the claims and charges were later dropped. A year later, he bought the lease of the Sierra Leone High Commission building in Central London for just £50,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war. The property is said to be worth £30 million and was used to film scenes for the Oscar-winning movie The King’s Speech. But in May 2011 Davenport was given eight years for his part in a £4.5 million fraud. The judge described him as the ‘ringmaster’ who was careful not to leave ‘footprints in the snow.’ Recovery: A year ago the fraudster was getting treatment in hospital in south London where he had to be accompanied by prison officers an handcuffed to his chair . The con artist, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds to investors which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel lost the life savings she invested with Davenport. After his latest conviction  a defective kidney failed and meant he needed repeated visits to hospital - where he was handcuffed to his bed while undergoing treatment. Last March his sentence was reduced to six years and eight months by judges at London’s Criminal Appeal Court, who said that, although there was nothing wrong with his original punishment, it should be reduced as an act of mercy and meant he could be freed two months later.","Edward Davenport jailed for eight years in 2011 for a £4.5million fraud .

"David Cameron's former advisor Emma Harrison founded the company A4e, where 10 former workers have been jailed for a large-scale fraud . Six former employees of a welfare-to-work firm were jailed yesterday for forging files in a scam that cost the taxpayer almost £300,000. They became involved in the massive fraud through a ‘culture of dishonesty’ at A4e, which was founded by David Cameron’s millionaire former jobs tsar Emma Harrison. Another four ex-members of staff received suspended prison sentences for what Judge Angela Morris said were ‘deceitful and unscrupulous’ practices. In a telling aside, she said it was not for her to decide whether more senior managers should also be held to account. The ten people sentenced yesterday falsified employer details, time sheets and jobseeker signatures to inflate the numbers they said they had helped into work. The Department of Work and Pensions paid A4e a £1,775 bounty for each of the first 500 candidates it helped into jobs, and then £888 for every successful placement after that. It was paid for 558 successes – but nearly a third of these proved to be faked. The cost to the public purse was around £288,000. The scam was based on a programme called Inspire to Aspire and designed to assist single parents in the Thames Valley to find jobs. It earned A4e more than £1.3million between August 2008 and June 2011. Some of the employees received considerable bonuses in their monthly pay packets as a result of their fakery. Genuine jobseekers whose names were used for the fraud when they did not in fact take part in the scheme may have had their benefits reduced or stopped. Passing sentence at Reading Crown Court, Judge Morris attacked the failure of A4e managers to impose checks on whether claims submitted to the DWP were valid. ‘The lack of any independent verification procedure in this case allowed a number of employees to engage in deceitful and unscrupulous practices for their own or another’s financial gain at the expense of the public purse,’ she said. A whistleblower alerted senior management to the fraud in November 2010, but files continued to be forged until March 2011. The judge said ‘innumerable’ files were ‘nothing more than wholesale forgeries from start to finish’. Staff members at A4e forged client signatures, time sheets and employers' details to make it look like they had got more people through back-to-work courses and into jobs between 2008 and 2011 . The judge added: ‘In this case there is a considerable volume of documents which have been totally fabricated, manipulated, back-dated or altered in other ways in an effort to give a wholly misleading impression about the way that the contract was being implemented.’ A4e recruiter Julie Grimes, 52, from Staines, Surrey, who was jailed for 26 months, was put under huge pressure to meet unrealistic targets by managers who did not care how she met them, the court heard. Her barrister Steven Pidcock said: ‘She was immersed in a culture of dishonesty that she didn’t have the moral fibre to resist. ‘It doesn’t start from the roots - this sort of thing starts from the top of the tree.’ Dean Lloyd, 38, of Milton Keynes, who received a 15-month sentence, had no idea about the ‘dishonesty intrinsic in A4e’ until after he had accepted the job, the hearing was told. His lawyer Rhodri James said: ‘To some extent it almost seemed acceptable because those who worked there, particularly in the hierarchy, were so entrenched in their dishonest practices.’ Contract manager Ines Cano-Uribe, 39, of Madrid, was jailed for 18 months, while Charles McDonald, 44, of Egham, Surrey, who faked documents to get bonuses to support his drug habit, received a sentence of 40 months. Judge Angela Morris, sentencing the group to 15 years in prison at Reading Crown Court today, said they had carried out 'deceitful and unscrupulous practices' during their work on the contract . There was also a prison term of 22 months for Nikki Foster, 31, of Reading, and one of 15 months for Bindiya Dholiwar, 29, of Slough. Suspended 12-month sentences were given to Zabar Khalil, 35, of Slough, Matthew Hannigan-Train, 31, of Bristol, and Hayley Wilson, 27, of Milton Keynes. Aditi Singh, 32, of Slough received a ten-month suspended sentence. Cano-Uribe, Khalil, Hannigan-Train and Hayley Wilson had denied forgery, but were found guilty by a jury after a trial that lasted for 12 weeks. The other six pleaded guilty. A4e Group chief executive Andrew Dutton said: ‘We are obviously disappointed and sorry that there were people working for us on this historical contract who behaved dishonestly, and in doing so let down the customers we had intended them to help and the taxpayer. ‘A4e long ago set aside the money to pay back the DWP the amount it received as a result of the unsubstantiated claims and we have ensured that the taxpayer will have lost nothing from the conduct of the people involved.’ Emma Harrison, 51, built A4e - formerly called Action for Employment - into an operation spanning 11 counties and became a multimillionaire . The scandal of the massive taxpayer fraud at A4e was exposed by the Daily Mail three years ago. A series of whistleblowers came forward in 2012 to speak out about a highly-pressurised culture where many employees forged documents to make it look like they were meeting impossible targets. The company would then submit fraudulent claims for payment by the taxpayer based on getting more jobseekers into work than it had actually achieved, the insiders alleged. A4e, formerly called Action For Employment, was set up to retrain redundant Sheffield steelworkers in 1991. Founder Emma Harrison, 51, built the company into an operation spanning 11 countries. She became a multi-millionaire and was appointed David Cameron’s ‘back to work’ tsar in December 2010. But she was widely criticised for paying herself an £8.6million dividend in 2011 – when A4e’s entire £180million UK turnover came from state contracts – even though her firm had failed to meet Government targets for finding jobs for the unemployed. An internal A4e audit in 2009 found widespread allegations of fraud, including business owners being asked to sign blank jobs forms. The review also said the company had falsely claimed it had found positions for people and payments being claimed for applicants who stayed in the post for only one day. The whistleblowers told the Mail that the problems at A4e were ‘endemic’. The firm strenuously denied the allegations, insisting the fraud was confined to staff at its Slough office. But the claims painted a disturbing picture. In Bradford, whistleblowers showed a forgery kit consisting of rubber stamps they said had been used to defraud the taxpayer of £2,000 for every ‘clunk’ of the stamp. In Newcastle, another whistleblower said the taxpayer was cheated by staff being forced to pose as jobless clients and actually sit numeracy and literacy exams alongside the unemployed, in order meet money-spinning quotas. Manchester staff apparently forged signatures by pressing sheets of paper up to sunlit windows to trace the names. Following the Mail’s revelations, A4e denied all wrongdoing and said the issues were confined to local staff. Mrs Harrison quit as the PM’s ‘family champion’ in February 2012.","Ten workers from employment firm A4e found guilty of large-scale fraud .

"It seems while Chinese men are earning more money, they're also losing more hair. A quarter of Chinese males are going bald, according to the People's Daily. If their bald patches were combined together, the size would cover 4,725 square kilometres which is roughly a quarter of Beijing or three times the size of London. Hair-rising fact: A quarter of the 800 million men in China are getting bald or are already bald, expert says . The new survey, which interviewed 5,779 men from five Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou revealed that 25 per cent of men are losing their hair. The balding rate among men in China is increasing and the phenomenon is appearing in younger crowds, wrote the People's Daily. The thinning trend shows more men are losing their hair compared with a previous survey in 2005. The state-run media also suggested that young and middle-aged men form the majority of China's 'army of balds'. The same survey also revealed that 95 per cent of Chinese men with the issue don't seek conventional medical treatments – instead they prefer other ways of treatment such as folk or secret prescriptions. Lu Jun, the Deputy Secretary of Chinese Medical Doctor Association, said there are approximately 200 million bald and balding males in China. The survey was conducted after Li Yapeng, a popular actor in China and a former heartthrob, was photographed drinking soup in a restaurant with a balding head. Analysis: Chinese media attribute the phenomenon to a mix of causes, including stress and irregular lifestyle .","Survey shows 25 per cent of Chinese men have hair-losing issues .

"A two-year-old Ohio boy was so overwhelmed during a meeting with his heroes, he completely lost it during a moment that was captured in a priceless photo. Little Quincy Kroner didn't fall apart during a visit with Dora the Explorer or SpongeBob; it was two garbage men from Cincinnati that made him go to pieces. The Cincinnati Public Services workers, Eddie Washington and Mark Davis, agreed to meet with Quincy last week as a special prize after he successfully completed potty training. Quincy Kroner (center) couldn't handle it when he got to meet his heroes, two Cincinnati, Ohio, garbage men . Cincinnati Public Services is working on a special recognition of Quincy and his friends but 'it has not been settled yet', according to a spokesperson . Quincy also got a garbage truck he wanted to show the men. While a photo was being taken of Quincy and his heroes in front of their truck, 'he became undone'. In a Facebook post of the photo, his dad Ollie Kroner wrote: 'Quincy's been waiting all week to show the garbage men his garbage truck. But, in the moment, he was overwhelmed in the presence of his heroes.' Kroner said his son knows that Washington and Davis will be driving by every Friday, according to ABC News. Washington and Davis know that Quincy will be watching, so they honk, wave and 'put on a show' for him. Quincy's father said: 'From the moment he hears them from blocks away he runs to the window, climbs up on the couch and watches them. 'They've developed a kind of relationship through the window.' Cincinnati Public Services told Daily Mail Online: 'These sanitation professionals are part of a new generation of Public Works employees who understand that their work is essential for the quality of life of our citizens.'

"In a bid to potentially bring the woolly mammoth back from the dead scientists have begun extracting DNA from the remains of a beast found in Siberia. A team of experts took samples of bone marrow from the extinct creature's front left leg during a special symposium at a university in Siberia on Monday. The samples will be examined at a laboratory in Yakutsk and by scientists in South Korea with the hope of being able to clone one of the prehistoric animals. Scroll down for video . A team of experts took samples of bone marrow from the extinct creature's front left leg during a symposium at a university in Siberia on Monday (pictured). The samples will be examined at a laboratory in Yakutsk and by scientists in South Korea with the hope of being able to clone one of the prehistoric animals . At the very least, the Russians hope to decipher the mammoth's complete DNA structure by 2017. The perfectly-preserved remains were discovered two years ago in the Sakha Republic permafrost region, having been frozen for about 28,000 years. Dr Semyon Grigoriev, the director of the Mammoth Museum in Yakutsk, told The Siberian Times: 'If the samples are good then our coordinated work, I think, will allow in a year or two to decipher the world's first nuclear genome of the mammoth. 'Today the technology allows it. We're doing all this as part of 'the Revival of Mammoth' project, which is being implemented in two ways. The perfectly-preserved remains (pictured) were discovered two years ago in the Sakha Republic permafrost region, having been frozen for about 28,000 years. It is thought the carcass belonged to a female woolly mammoth aged between 50 and 60 when she died . Mammoth blood (shown) was also found in the permafrost close to the perfectly-preserved trunk. Experts will use modern methods to analyse samples taken from the creature and the facility, which will specialise in molecular palaeontology,  will also study the remains of other dinosaurs found in the region . 'Firstly by searching for live cells, culturing them and creating a clone, then secondly by creating artificial living cells based on artificial nucleus DNA.' The remains, complete with the creature's famous hair, were discovered in May 2013 on an Arctic island off the diamond-rich Sakha Republic, the largest region in Russia. Mammoth blood was also found in the permafrost close to the perfectly-preserved trunk. It is thought the carcass belonged to a female aged between 50 and 60 when she perished. The team was led by the Dr Hwang Woo Sul, a professor of the Korean Foundation of Biotechnology Research in Seoul (pictured above the carcass). The work forms part of 'the Revival of Mammoth' project, which plans to search for live cells, culture them and create a clone before creating artificial living cells . The mammoth (remains pictured) was roughly the size as a modern African elephant, standing up to 11ft (3.3 metres) tall and weighing about seven tonnes. Its fur and long hair protected it from the harsh winters. The remains found in Yakutia are the best-preserved ever found . In the 1993 film, scientists use dinosaur DNA taken from a mosquito . preserved in amber to clone the animals and create a theme park. Last year a controversial Australian billionaire was believed to be drawing up secret plans for a real life Jurassic Park. Mining . magnate Clive Palmer, who has already embarked on a project to rebuild . the Titanic, was rumoured to be working with the team who created Dolly . the sheep. It was said the park would be based at Palmer's super resort in Coolum. But . the research has shown that their DNA is just too old to be able to use for de-extinction. However, Korean scientists are hoping that the samples found on the Siberian woolly mammoth aren't too old. They plan to take the DNA samples and reassemble them into a full genome. This could then be injected into embryonic cells which have had their own DNA . taken out, and a suitable living surrogate would be found. Samples of bone tissue were taken on Monday during a gathering at the North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk, as part of a special International Scientific Workshop on the modern methods of working with fossilised remains. The team was led by the Dr Hwang Woo Sul, a professor of the Korean Foundation of Biotechnology Research in Seoul. A new laboratory opening in Yakutsk on Tuesday will use modern methods to analyse samples taken from the creature. The facility, which will specialise in molecular palaeontology, is the only one of its kind in Russia and will also study the remains of other dinosaurs found in the region. Dr Semyon Grigoriev said: 'We are taking samples of bone marrow - it is one of the best materials for DNA analysis. 'While no one knows exactly, presumably a mammoth nuclear DNA is made up of 40 to 45 million nucleotides. 'If we set this whole sequence, it will be very great progress for the project of the study and cloning of mammoths.' This knowledge would enable the synthesis of artificial DNA molecules. Woolly mammoths co-existed with early humans who hunted them for food. They are the best studied of all the prehistoric animals because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as dung and skeletons. The mammoth was roughly the size as a modern African elephant, standing up to 11ft tall and weighing about seven tonnes, and its fur and long hair protected it from the harsh winters. The woolly mammoth (stock image) is related to the elephant. The creatures lived on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago. They also co-existed with early humans who hunted them for food . In 2013, a group of scientists discussed the possibility of bringing 24 animals back from extinction, also known as 'de-extinction'. For example, the dodo (pictured) evolved without any natural predators, but it was forced into extinction by humans who killed them all for food . Another animal considered for 'de-extinction' at the recent conference was the Quagga - a species of plains Zebra that once lived in South Africa. The last wild one was shot in 1870 and the last in captivity died in 1883 . The remains found in Yakutia, also known as the Sakha Republic, were the best-preserved ever found and scientists believe there is a good chance of being able to clone the animal. The eventual plan is to plant an implanted egg into a live elephant for a 22-month pregnancy. In 2013, a group of scientists from around the world met for TEDx conference in Washington, sponsored by National Geographic. The group were discussing the possibility of bringing 24 animals back from extinction, also known as 'de-extinction'. The animals included the dodo bird, the Carolina Parakeet, last . seen in 1904 in Florida, and the Quagga, a plains zebra which once lived . in South Africa but died out in 1883. However, a real life Jurassic Park is not an option, it is said, because dinosaur DNA is just too old. The remains, complete with the creature's famous hair, were discovered in May 2013 on an Arctic island off the diamond-rich Sakha Republic, the largest region in Russia (pictured) As if he was sleeping: The remains of a baby woolly rhinoceros, (pictured) who has been named Sasha and still has its wool, has been discovered in the ice of Siberia. It is the first juvenile of the species to be found . The remains of a baby woolly rhinoceros, which still has its fleece, was discovered in the ice of Siberia last month. Named Sasha, the extinct creature - which must be at least 10,000 years old and is the first juvenile woolly rhino to be found - was well preserved by permafrost and experts are hopeful of extracting its DNA. A local hunter found the infant woolly rhino in a ravine by a stream in Russia's largest and coldest region, the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, in September. Initially, he thought the carcass was a reindeer, until he saw the horn growths and realised he had made the historic discovery of the world's first baby woolly rhino. Scientists will first try to extract DNA from the remains, which was kept frozen to increase the chances of this being possible. They hope to get results in a ‘week or two’. The calf’s remains weigh 132lbs (60kg) and were found by Alexander Banderov, a hunter and businessman from Abyysky district.","Perfectly-preserved remains were found in the Sakha Republic permafrost .

"A professor who was arrested on an American Airlines flight after lighting a cigarette and ranting about President Obama is no longer teaching. Dr Karen Bettez Halnon, 52, became an internet sensation after she was caught on camera lighting up shortly after a flight from Nicaragua landed at Miami International Airport on Saturday. Dr Halnon, who taught sociology at Pennsylvania State University Abington, said she used the moment to protest 'US military global domination,' and claimed the country was responsible for giving her hero Hugo Chavez cancer. A spokesperson for PSU Abington said that Prof Hanlon was still employed, but 'no longer in the classroom'. Scroll down for video . Dr Karen Halnon, left in her police mugshot and right in a faculty photo, is now longer teaching at Pennsylvania State University Abington after she was filmed smoking and ranting about the US on a plane in Miami . She was arrested for disorderly conduct and breach of peace. The university's investigation into the incident is ongoing, according to the Allentown Morning Call. She has taught at the institution since 1999, first as an assistant professor and most recently as an associate professor. According to her faculty page, she is an expert on capitalism, Latin America and 'mad women'. Dr Halnon has said that her statement was political and necessary after 'the US declared war on Venezuela'. 'I had to speak out now,' she told Philadelphia Magazine after returning home from her research in Central America. 'The situation is dire and urgent.' 'Any sacrifice I make for my own self, if it saves lives — there have been far too many lives lost due to US global military domination.' Dr Halnon is seen smoking onboard the flight, in a video uploaded to YouTube and posted on Reddit . Dr Halnon claims she was 'tortured' by the FBI and TSA after she was arrested in Miami for disorderly conduct. 'I was put in a room with two fans in the ceiling, it was freezing cold for hours and hours and hours,' she said. The professor alleged she was not allowed to go to the bathroom and had to wet her pants. She said she also defecated on the floor and was forced to pick it up while being 'laughed at'. A number of passengers around Halnon became angered after she lit up on the plane. The professor said the act was a 'symbol'. 'Every revolutionary I know smokes,' she said. 'It was identifying with the revolutionary cause. 'Beyond that, it is a symbol that the United States is a smoking gun.' When fellow passengers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior, Halnon blamed someone else for smoking and went on a  rant, saying the US had 'declared war on Venezuela' According to an eyewitness, she also allegedly said that Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays'. Dr Halnon shouted: 'The United States has declared war on Venezuela. Venezuela has been declared a national security threat.' 'You're a national security threat,' a passenger remarked off camera. 'She's gangster' another passenger said, laughing. Flight attendants warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. But she yelled louder, ranting that Venezuela 'previously owned the oil in Venezuela.' 'My great hero Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people would own the oil...not Exon Mobil.' A flight attendant, right, warned Halnon that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. Halnon said she knew she was going to be arrested and wanted to speak her piece . After she was warned again by a flight attendant that she was going to be arrested, Halnon remarked 'I know already.' 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. Dr Halnon was award her PhD from Boston College in 1995 with a thesis about treatments for women and hysteria. She has two published books, and has more than 25 journal articles to her name. The video of Halnon was captured  by a passenger who then posted the video  to YouTube and Reddit. The poster, with the user name 'upside down dog', alleged that he was on the same flight as Halnon when he recorded her. He  wrote: 'While the plane was waiting on the tarmac for the police to arrive, she leans over to me and asks for a cigarette. 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. 'She pulls one out of her bag and lights up. This is the point where I pull eject and run to the back of the cabin. The police arrive after 20 minutes and escort her off the plane. 'She only had a single drink on the plane (however, others told me she was pounding them back pretty hard in the terminal and she also was on prescription painkillers)'. Halnon confirmed she only had one small bottle of wine on the plane that she said she mixed over the course of three drinks. 'I wasn't drunk,' she said. 'I don't need alcohol to protest. This is my life.' Dr Halnon paid an undisclosed fine to resolve the matter in Florida, according to Local 10. Earlier this month President Obama signed an order sanctioning seven Venezuelan officials for human rights abuses.","Dr Karen Halnon, 52, was caught on camera lighting a cigarette and ranting .

Miss Dance said she initially thought it was 'quite amusing' to see a cat being walked on a lead but tried to intervene when she realised the animal was 'being dragged'. The 26-year-old said the owner ignored her and continued pulling the animal 'for a good five minutes' before picking up the cat. She said: 'She caught me filming her but then she dragged the cat down the road anyway. 'I said to her that she might want to pick the cat up but she ignored me and kept going. 'It was only a little black and white kitten. At first I thought it was funny but the more I look at it I just think she was horrible.'

Alice Potter, a companion animal scientist from the RSPCA, said the five-second video shows the animal was distressed. She said: 'We have concerns about the handling of the cat in this footage as it appears to be causing it distress. 'The cat does look like it's kind of being dragged and looks distressed, putting its front paws out like it wants to stop. 'Without seeing more it's hard to know how comfortable the cat is walking on a lead but it gives the impression that the cat was not particularly comfortable or relaxed.' She added that putting cats on leads took away their 'sense of control' and that harnesses should be introduced gradually from a young age if owners want to put them on a lead.","Woman was filmed pulling black-and-white cat down Hertfordshire street .

"Jeremy Clarkson was last night at the centre of renewed controversy after he said foreign taxi drivers in London have ‘vehicles smelling of sick’. The Top Gear host – whose future at the BBC is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer – made the controversial comments in the March edition of Top Gear magazine. He wrote: ‘In London, there are two types of [cab] driver. Jeremy Clarkson behind the wheel of his car leaving his house in London yesterday. He now at the centre of a new controversy after saying that foreign taxi drivers in London have cars 'smelling of sick' ‘You have a chap who has just arrived from a country you’ve never heard of, whose car smells faintly of lavender oil and sick, who doesn’t know where he’s going and can’t get there anyway because he never puts more than £2 worth of fuel in the tank of his car. ‘Then you have someone in a suit in a smart black Mercedes S-Class who does know where he’s going and is very polite but he charges around £7,500 a mile.’ He also turned on drivers in the North, saying northern roads are overrun with immigrants ‘who have never experienced tarmac before’. Although it was unclear last night when Clarkson, 54, wrote the article, it was almost certainly before the dust-up in North Yorkshire, and sources close to the presenter believe his enemies immediately latched on to the magazine remarks to pile more pressure on the beleaguered star. Although it was unclear last night when Clarkson, 54, pictured, wrote the article, it was almost certainly before the dust-up in North Yorkshire . Labour MP Helen Goodman had earlier said: ‘These are not the reactions of someone on a peace mission. He’s trying to maximise the conflict. 'As an MP for a northern constituency, I can tell you he’s talking complete nonsense.’ Clarkson’s magazine comments were an embarrassing distraction for the presenter on the day he faced an interrogation over his dust-up with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon by BBC chiefs, who are said to be ‘desperate’ to get rid of him. Ken MacQuarrie, head of BBC Scotland, is leading an inquiry into the fracas and is expected to deliver a verdict within days. The inflammatory comments follow a string of rows over racism.

"Nick Clegg will promise new fathers six weeks of paternity leave if his party gets into government for a second term . Nick Clegg will promise new fathers six weeks of paternity leave if his party gets into government for a second term. The Liberal Democrats would triple the amount of leave for dads of newborns from the current two weeks – and pay them the maternity leave rate of £138.18 a week. It will be seen as a bid to woo women voters and young families ahead of the General Election, but will face concerns from the business community. Mr Clegg has already pushed for shared parental leave, which starts from next week (April 5). It means parents can split a year off work between them at statutory pay. This means that a mother who wishes to end her maternity leave – and pay – early to return to work, can hand over their entitlement to the child’s father. But Mr Clegg and the business minister Jo Swinson announced today that fathers can have an extra four weeks leave at home with the child’s mother, and both would be entitled to pay. Mr Clegg believes the two-week period fathers get is often treated as a holiday, and extending it would encourage men to be more involved in childcare. The policy will be in the party’s manifesto and would be introduced in 2018-19 after consultation with businesses. They hope half a million fathers would benefit from the scheme which would cost £58million a year, and be paid for once the deficit is cleared. Mr Clegg said today: ‘The Liberal Democrats want to tear down the barriers that stop people reaching their full potential. For too long, mums have been told their place is at home with their child, while dads return to work. I want parents to choose for themselves how to balance work and family.’ The entitlement would be under a ‘use it or lose it’ basis so fathers must start their six weeks’ leave within eight weeks of their child’s birth and cannot transfer it to the mother. Mr Clegg was promoting his policy to treble paternity leave to six weeks with Lib Dem minister Jo Swinson (right) as he visited Play Town soft play centre in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire . Labour have already pledged to increase paid paternity leave to four weeks – and increase paternity pay - which triggered criticism from small businesses that the costs would be prohibitive. But Lib Dem sources said the policy would help businesses retain staff who wanted to take time off with their families. Around 55pc of fathers take the full two weeks currently available. One of Mr Clegg’s early schemes, in 2011, to encourage parents to share their time off – called Additional Paternity Leave – was a flop after being found to have an uptake of only 1pc. Scroll down for video . Mr Clegg, who yesterday tried his hand at making pancakes on a visit to Cardiff, believes the two-week period fathers get is often treated as a holiday, and extending it would encourage men to be more involved in childcare . It allowed fathers to take the statutory six months maternity leave instead of mothers, but the downside was that they would not get any pay after the first two weeks. Lib Dem sources said: ‘There was low uptake of that scheme because it wasn’t paid, so families made decisions based on their finances. And of course there was also a cultural barrier. ‘But we believe six weeks of paternity leave on statutory pay will be popular and help to change attitudes. There has been no greater champion for this in government than Jo Swinson, she pushed for six weeks paternity leave in government but the Tories blocked it.’ The scheme is modelled on a similar one in Sweden in which fathers get a ‘daddy month’ and also the right to shared leave for more than a year. Uptake is high because fathers are entitled to 90pc of their full pay. But Miss Swinson said yesterday that the aim was to ‘challenge the gender stereotypes that all too often write fathers off as hapless or bumbling’. She added: ‘Liberal Democrats want to triple paternity leave, to encourage new dads to spend more time with their child in those vital early weeks and month after birth. Most fathers want to spend more time with their new baby – and we know it makes a positive difference for children when they do.’","Liberal Democrats would triple the amount of leave for dads of newborns .

"It was once an eagerly anticipated new block of flats, built to help with the housing crisis in Hull and standing as the city's tallest building. But in a mere eight seconds Highcourt, a 20-storey tower block measuring more than 190ft high in the Orchard Park estate of Hull, was flattened to leave just a pile of rubble behind. People lined the streets to watch the demolition, which took place almost 50 years after the high rise was first built. Scroll down for video . Highcourt, Hull's tallest building (left) containing flats, was demolished and turned into a pile of rubble (right) in just eight seconds . The tower was demolished using explosives on Sunday afternoon. It was knocked down as part of a 'masterplan' for the state which will see a new shopping centre, a care home and affordable housing built. But for some people who had seen the vast tower block planned and built, the scale and speed of its destruction was a sad event. Samantha Clark, 58, said: 'I was a young girl living in north Hull when this block of flats was built. Highcourt was built in 1969 to help with the housing crisis and extended over 19 floors but yesterday explosives were used to demolish it . The building began to topple to the right hand side as the explosives tore through the bottom section and dust and rubble collected . As the tower began to fall huge plumes of smoke and clouds of dust were seen coming from the building as it clattered towards the ground . In seconds the 190ft high building fell towards the ground to make way for a planned new estate that will see new houses built . Eight seconds after the explosion the tower block was no more, and replaced by smoke and piles or rubble as workmen looked on . 'I remember the new building being celebrated because there was a houses shortage at the time but now its demolition is being celebrated. It is quite emotional really.' The tower was built in 1969 and stood as one of the tallest parts of the city, along with Hull Royal Infirmary. Jim Roles, 61, said: 'I can't believe that a block of flats that size, which took an age to build, could be demolished as quickly as that. The 19 storey building was flattened to the ground on Sunday afternoon and workers will now have to begin clearing the large site . All that is left of Highcourt high rise is now large slabs of concrete and twisted metal after it was demolished within a matter of seconds . The tower block, shown previously, was built in the 1960s and was the tallest building in the city of Hull, as well as the infirmary . 'One minute it was there, the next it was gone and that is that. It was an eyesore but I will miss it when I walk past every morning.' More than 400 affordable homes are currently being built on the estate - many of which are being made more energy efficient. Councillor John Black, of Hull City Council, said: 'It is an exciting time for residents of Orchard Park. 'Highcourt was one of the tallest buildings in the city along with Hull Royal Infirmary so it is a big deal that it is coming down but our masterplan for Orchard Park will improve the estate hugely.'","Highcourt, Hull's tallest tower was built almost 50 years ago as block of flats to deal with the housing crisis in 1960s .

"Fire has destroyed a historic New Jersey inn that once hosted George Washington. Firefighters found smoke coming from The Sergeantsville Inn in Delaware Township early Monday. But flames eventually tore through the roof of the two-story stone structure that is more than 300 years old. Historic structure: The 300-year-old Sergeantsville Inn in New Jersey caught fire early Monday morning. The historic inn once hosted George Washington . All that remains: The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Inn owner Joe Clyde says he plans to rebuild, if possible.  Above, Joe's wife Lisa Clyde (left) is hugged by neighbors in the aftermath of the fire . Mayor Roger Locandro tells CBS that the inn is the center of the town. 'This is the place people would come after a township meeting. The town hall is right across the street. My kids have had their birthday parties there. It’s a terrible loss for our community,' Locandro said. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. One firefighter sustained a minor knee injury fighting the blaze. Owner Joe Clyde told the Hunterdon County Democrat that he plans to rebuild the inn if possible. Mr Clyde and his wife lisa have been running the property as a fine-dining restaurant since 1999. Dangerous blaze: One firefighter sustained a minor knee injury fighting the blaze . Loss: Mayor  Roger Locandro described the Sergeantsville Inn as the center of the town, where people would eat on special occasions . The original part of the building traces back to the 1700s when it was built as a private home in the village then called Skunktown, according to the restaurant's website. When a post office opened in the town in 1827, the name was changed to Sergeantsville. Another addition was added in 1830, and in 1869 the building was sold to a Farley Shepherd who ran a general inside. His son Edward took over the business in 1900 and during the 1930s, the store was run as both an ice cream parlor and feed store. Its next owner John Balanar obtained a liquor license for the store at the end of prohibition, and it was run as a tavern for several years.

"Winston McKenzie has been sacked from his job as Ukip’s Commonwealth spokesman after a series of gaffes . He became one of the most high profile figures in Ukip after organising the party’s disastrous ‘carnival of colour’ and comparing Nigel Farage to Jesus. But Winston McKenzie has finally been sacked him from his job as Ukip’s Commonwealth spokesman after a series of gaffes that included calling Croydon a ‘dump’ while being the candidate there. The former professional boxer who describes himself as ‘not your average politician’ said he was ‘dismayed’ and ‘disappointed’ by the decision. He told the Mail: ‘You get these things in politics when the leader has a little reshuffle. ‘I’ve had a very good run and thought I was doing pretty well with it, but bigger people than me have been moved around jobs. ‘You look at the Tory party and Michael Gove. He was doing a fantastic job as education secretary and was moved on. It’s a bit of a shock to the system.’ While standing for Ukip in the 2012 Croydon North by-election, Mr McKenzie described gay adoption as ‘tantamount to child abuse’ and ‘unhealthy’. Then after Mr Farage pulled out of appearing at a ‘Ukip carnival’ he had organised there last year, Mr McKenzie said the town was ‘unsafe and a dump’. In his most recent controversy, Mr McKenzie earlier this month said he was ‘disillusioned’ and ‘dismayed’ about former boxing promoter Frank Maloney’s sex change to become Kellie Maloney. Mr McKenzie, who refers to Mr Farage at ‘The Guv’nor’, denied that his sacking was related to his comments. He said: ‘The one thing with the Guv’nor is he’s very frank with me. If he is upset, you know about it. I don’t think it’s the fact that I’m outspoken. 'When that news broke about Kellie, I called The Guvnor and said “Nigel look at what’s happened”. ‘He was of the same opinion of me, that it’s his life and he has got to do what he has to do, but everybody was surprised. I wish Kellie the best.’ Despite his reputation for bizarre television appearances, including wearing sunglasses during an interview on the BBC’s Newsnight last year, Mr McKenzie said that he had given media training to others in the party. He said: ‘I ran classes for a lot of the Ukip candidates. I’ve given them help on how to perform. I’ll give them confidence.’ Mr McKenzie said that he had been told that he was being sacked in a telephone call from Ukip chairman Steve Crowther on Monday. While standing for Ukip in the 2012 Croydon North by-election, Mr McKenzie described gay adoption as ‘tantamount to child abuse’ and ‘unhealthy’ Mr McKenzie became one of the most high profile figures in Ukip after organising the party’s disastrous ‘carnival of colour’ and comparing Nigel Farage to Jesus . He said he had tried to speak to Mr Farage about the decision, but he had told him he did not have the time. ‘I spoke to him briefly and asked “what’s going on?”, but he said “I’m really busy at the moment, I will call you”. ‘I’ve got no real bone to pick with Farage. He’s an honourable type of guy, a good leader. No doubt we will speak in a few days and have a sparring session.’ He added: ‘I cannot say I’m not gutted, I’m not going to pretend, but at the same time I’m extremely loyal to the Guv’nor. This is the way that politics goes. ‘Getting this Commonwealth spokesman job was the best thing that ever happened to me really, at least in my political life. It led me to meet High Commissioners and Ambassadors of the Commonwealth. ‘It’s a bit of a shock to the system, but you have to follow the Guv’nor. I’m a little bit dismayed by it all, but I’m happy if it’s better for the party.’ Mr McKenzie, who said he will remain as a Ukip candidate at the General Election, is also hoping to stand for London Mayor for the party. He said: ‘My main ambition in politics is to become the Ukip London mayoral candidate. It is up to the party. I’m sure another post will come.’ Mr McKenzie, who said he has never experienced racism from within Ukip, denied that there was now a lack of high-profile ethnic minority figures at the top of the party. He said: ‘It’s quite clear that there are a growing number of black people participating in the party. ‘I believe I’ve done an awful lot for the party in getting support from the black community. They are more Ukip friendly than when I came into the party.' Mr McKenzie joined Ukip after previously being a member of the Conservatives, Lib Dems and his own Unity party. He has stood to be an MP, Mayor of London and a local councillor, but lost his deposit on every occasion. He made a rap video during his 2008 campaign to be Mayor of London and previously auditioned for the X Factor. West Midlands MEP James Carver has been appointed as the party’s new Commonwealth spokesman. Mr Farage said: ‘I am delighted to appoint Jim to this role. ‘It is part of the growth ensuring that UKIP has a full and energetic team going forward to the election and beyond.’","EXCLUSIVE: Winston McKenzie dropped as Commonwealth spokesman .

"Murdered: Keshawn Brooks, 15, was stabbed to death on his way home from school . A 15-year-old boy walking home from school was stabbed to death for his backpack, California authorities said. Keshawn Brooks was jumped and stabbed several times as he struggled with his assailant for his bag Thursday afternoon outside Stephens Middle School in Long Beach, police said. The suspect ran off but was later arrested. Brooks, a freshman at nearby Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo High School, was given first aid by witnesses before paramedics arrived. The teen was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead from serious stab wounds. After interviewing witnesses, investigators named 18-year-old Giovanny Montelongo as a suspect. He was taken into custody Thursday evening at a Long Beach residence on suspicion of murder, said police spokeswoman Nancy Pratt. 'My son was not a gang member. This was a murder, done outright, and he did not deserve this,' Brooks' father, Keeyon Layton, said at a Thursday evening press conference. 'And to the people who came to his aid, I would like to thank you, very much. It pleases me that he was not alone during his time of death.' The killing occurred as parents were picking up students at the middle school, police said. Investigators and Brooks' father implored any witnesses to come forward. Keshawn's grieving parents spoke out on Thursday. His father Keeyon Layton said: 'This was murder, done outright. He did not deserve this' Montelongo was held without bail as a requirement of one of three outstanding warrants unrelated to Thursday's incident, Pratt said.  The warrants were sealed because the previous alleged offenses occurred when he was a juvenile, she said. Pratt didn't know if Montelongo has a lawyer. He was scheduled to be arraigned on Monday. The Long Beach Unified School District was providing grief counselors for students Friday.","Keshawn Brooks was stabbed multiple times outside a middle school on Thursday afternoon .

"Ordinary families will not have to pay a single penny of tax on their savings, George Osborne announced today. The Chancellor said he was abolishing all tax on the first £1,000 of interest savers earn from their nest eggs. The move will benefit 17 million who have put aside up to around £35,000. Until now, people earning less than £42,700 have had to pay 20 per cent tax on the interest they get from their savings - while those on up to £150,000 have been taxed at 40 per cent. Today's announcement means 95 per cent of savers will no longer pay any tax on their savings. Mr Osborne said savers have paid tax already on the money when they earned it – they shouldn't have to pay it again. He said it meant 'tax free banking for almost the entire population’. Scroll down for video . The Chancellor said he was abolishing all tax on the first £1,000 of interest savers earn from their nest eggs. The move will benefit 17 million who have put aside up to around £35,000 . He told MPs: ‘With our new Personal Savings Allowance, 17 million people will see the tax on their savings not just cut, but abolished. ‘An entire system of tax collection can be scrapped. At a stroke we create tax free banking for almost the entire population.’ It is the latest in a series of measures designed to woo pensioners, who are more likely to vote and save. Mr Osborne also confirmed plans to let five million OAPs cash in their retirement deals to help people stuck on rip-off annuity rates. Mr Osborne's policy will give those who have already taken out an annuity the right to cash it in for a lump sum from April next year. He told MPs: 'We will give five million pensioners access to their annuity. For many an annuity is the right product, but for some it makes sense to access their annuity now. 'So we’re changing the law to make that possible. From next year the punitive tax charge of at least 55% will be abolished. Tax will be applied only at the marginal rate. 'And we’ll consult to ensure pensioners get the right guidance and advice. So freedom for five million people with an annuity.’ Until now, people earning less than £42,700 have had to pay 20 per cent tax on the interest they get from their savings - while those on up to £150,000 have been taxed at 40 per cent . Today’s announcements offer welcome relief to millions of savers who have suffered dismal rates on Isas, savings accounts and annuities since the Bank of England base rate was slashed to 0.5 per cent just over six years ago. Families have lost as much as £5,000 since rates were cut, according to a recent estimates. The average rate paid on instant access bank accounts has fallen from 3.1 per cent in September 2008 to just 0.78 per cent now. Average Isa rates have also fallen from 1.99 per cent in March 2009 to 1.45 per cent. Savers will also benefit from a 'radically more flexible Isa', which will allow savers to take money out of their Isa and put it back later on in the year without losing any of their tax free entitlement. Mr Osborne said: ‘We will introduce a radically more Flexible ISA. In two weeks’ time the changes I’ve already made mean people will be able to put £15,240 into an ISA. 'But if you take that money out – you lose your tax free entitlement, and so can’t put it back in. 'This restricts what people can do with their own savings – but I believe people should be trusted with their hard earned money. 'With the fully Flexible ISA people will have complete freedom to take money out, and put it back in later in the year, without losing any of their tax-free entitlement . 'It will be available from this autumn and we will also expand the range of investments that are eligible.'","No tax on the first £1,000 of interest savers earn from their nest eggs .

"Sugar is a bad word in some circles but that isn't stopping Sonic from pouring candy into its drinks. Last summer, Sonic Drive-In launched a line-up of Slush drinks with Nerds candy mixed in. They were so popular the chain says some people ask to get the crunchy little candies mixed into other drinks, like soda. And given their success, CEO Cliff Hudson says Sonic is looking at adding a second candy-drink mashup this summer, although he declined to provide details.

In the meantime, the Nerds are still on menus as a drink add-in for around 30 cents. Already, a medium Grape Slush has 73 grams of sugar and 230 calories.  Add in the Nerds, and it has 130 grams of sugar and 510 calories. Sonic, which has more than 3,500 locations, notes it also offers plenty of lower-calorie drink choices, such as sparkling water with the option to add in various fresh fruits and flavors. Drinks have been a big part of Sonic's growth strategy, with the company letting people mix and match flavors and offering them at half price between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. The company says drinks now represent 30 percent of its total sales. That's compared to an average of about 22 percent for the overall fast-food industry, according to Technomic. More broadly, Sonic has been increasing sales in part by revamping recipes, such as for its chicken sandwich. In the most recent quarter that ended on Feb. 28, the company said sales rose 11.5 percent at established locations. That's following an 8.5 percent increase in the previous quarter, and a 3.5 percent increase for its last fiscal year. Order up!

"Scribbling an eyeliner and smudging a lipstick on the back of your hand to test the colour will be a thing of the past, thanks to a 'genius' new app. L'Oréal Paris Makeup Genius allows customers to virtually try on 4,500 of the cosmetic brand's catalogue of products using their smartphone or tablet. The augmented reality app was launched in Australia on Tuesday with a glittering event attended by the brand's local ambassador, Megan Gale. While make up apps have been around for a while, they have only ever worked on a static portrait. Scroll down for video . 'Genius': L'Oréal Paris' new make up app launched in Australia this week, allowing customers to try on over 4,500 of their products in real time using augmented reality technology . The Makeup Genius applies bronzer, eyeshadow, lip gloss, and eyeliner in real time using facial recognition technology, enabling the virtual make up to stay in place as you move your face. The technology captures 64 facial data points and 100 different facial expressions to accurately place the make up. The app scans your face, and then allows you to try out different products or entire make up looks. You can then save your selfie, share it on social media, and purchase the products directly through the app. Facial recognition: The virtual make up stays in place as you move your head and change your expression in real time and works in different lighting conditions - pictured are individual lip gloss and bronzer products . Makeover: While Femail editor Andrea liked testing the individual products, she found the pre-set 'looks' (above) a bit over the top... and one setting added unsightly red blotches to her chest (left) According to L'Oréal, the app works on all ethnicities and in over 400 different lighting conditions to ensure how the make up appears in the app is accurate to the product. Daily Mail Australia road-tested the app on a handful of staff, with mixed results. I tested out two looks - 'Caresse' and 'So Timeless', as well as the more natural-looking individual products like bronzer and eyeliner. The app was impressively accurate at placing the make up on my face, though it took a bit of adjusting to get some of the eyeliner looks perfect. While some of the 'looks' bordered on scary drag, testing out individual products was proved more successful. The bronzer and lip gloss looks appeared perfectly and gave me a solid idea of how they would look on my skin. Subtle: News reporter Sarah tried subtle eye shadow and lip gloss looks, and thinks the app managed to apply make up better than she could do herself . News reporter Sarah Dean tested 'Smokey Minute' look, as well as the 'Tropical' look. She also tested some subtle bronzer and winged eyeliner. 'I thought it was a really smart way of trying out new looks without having to stand in a make-up aisle and test things in front of tiny smudged mirrors,' she said. 'It’s also much more hygienic than using testers in the shops. 'The make-up looked like it had been applied professionally – probably better than I could actually do myself!' Editorial assistant Helen liked the naturally sunkissed look the Glam Bronze Duo gave her. Impressed: Editorial assistant Helen liked the subtlety of the lip gloss (left), and bronzer (right) and says it gave her a good idea of the looks she could achieve with the products . 'I thought it was a really great way of trying out the range of products available,' she said. 'Although you don’t get the chance to feel how the products work on your skin and how they apply as you would in a shop, you certainly get a good idea of the looks you can achieve with them.' Showbiz reporter Karishma Sarkari was less impressed, struggling to get the eyeliner and eyeshadow looks to place accurately. ‘While it was definitely a bit of fun trying out the different looks, the app seemed to put the make-up over my left eye a lot for some reason, despite trying to “calibrate” a number of times,' Karishma said. The major drawback of the app is that it sucked the life out of my phone - my battery, which had been at 100 per cent, was almost gone after 20 minutes playing with my make up. Dramatic eyes: Showbiz reporter Karishma enjoyed the effect of the bold winged eye liner, but found it took several attempts to get the placement of the make up right . The app has been downloaded 10 million times in the US, France and China, and L'Oréal is predicting 500,000 downloads in Australia this year. L'Oréal Paris Makeup Genius is a true game-changer in today's beauty industry and we are thrilled to be pioneering a new future of beauty,' said Cameron Woods, L'Oréal Paris Marketing Director. 'We are so proud to bring a true innovation to the market, providing what we hope is a genuinely useful, inspiring and educational tool for our consumers. 'In the virtual reality experience we allow a new and powerful way for our consumers to experience the world of beauty - testing and trying on products, viewing beauty tutorials, accessing personalised advice and purchasing their favourite products at the convenient click of a button.'

"A job advert for a council-owned company says it would be an advantage to speak Polish – in Wales. The £6.50-an-hour jobs are for 'recycling operatives' at waste company Cwm Environmental, in Carmarthen, which is owned by Labour-led Carmarthenshire County Council. The advert says: 'The ability to speak and understand Polish is an advantage but not essential.' There is no mention of speaking Welsh. Council-owned waste management company Cwm Environmental in Carmarthen, Wales, has put out a job advert in which it states: 'The ability to speak and understand Polish is an advantage but not essential' However, 30 of Cwm's 100 workers are from Eastern Europe, mostly Poland. Cwm said it made sense for them to be able to communicate in Polish for health and safety reasons. The council said the firm was entirely responsible for recruitment. But Welsh Tories said local workers were being disadvantaged. A spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said: 'This is an extraordinary attempt by a Labour-run council to recruit migrant workers, at the likely expense of local jobseekers who speak English or Welsh. 'Ed Miliband promised to ban recruitment agencies which try to undercut local wages by hiring only migrant workers, yet here is a Labour-led council aiming a job advert at Polish speakers - with such rank hypocrisy, it's no wonder voters can't trust Ed Miliband on immigration. 'Putting local workers at a competitive disadvantage and exploiting foreign workers is clearly beyond the pale.' Official figures show more than 40 per cent of the population of Carmarthenshire speak Welsh as well as English - but there is no mention of speaking Welsh in the advert.

"A  mansion on London's Billionaire's Row which was built by the owner of the Tate and Lyle sugar empire has  sold for £25million - just a quarter of its original asking price. Heath Hall on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, north London, a 24,000 sq/ft trophy home set in a plot of around 2.5-acres, was put on the market three years ago for £100 million. Property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou bought it as a rundown wreck for £5 million in 2006 and then set about transforming the property into his dream home. Scroll down for video . Bargain: Heath Hall, on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, north London has sold for £25million around a quarter of its original asking price . After spending a fortune on a lavish refurbishment, the businessman put it on the market in 2011 for a staggering £100 million - making it the most expensive home for sale on the open market in the UK. However, a year later the price was dropped to £65 million. It was then thought the home, which is more than 25 times the size of the average new build, would be quickly snapped up. But a buyer could not be found and Heath Hall, which was originally built in 1910 for sugar magnate William Park Lyle, has languished on a stagnating market - until this week. A deal has now been struck but not for anywhere near £65 million. Instead, the new buyer is thought to have paid just £25 million for one of London's grandest private homes. Palatial: The property was built for sugar magnate William Park Lyle in 1910, but fell into disrepair in the 1950s while under the ownership of the Bank of China . Eat your heart out: The magnificent three-story house was brought back to its glorious best thanks to a massive renovation by property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou . The developer employed a team of 120 tradesmen for the renovation, adding a further 8,000sq/ft to the already substantial 19,000sq/ft . Mark Pollack, director of Aston Chase, whose agency acquired the mansion wouldn't reveal the identity of the purchaser or the price paid but confirmed the new owner is now set to carry out a major fresh refurbishment and re-landscaping of the grounds. Mr Pollack said: 'This is a truly magnificent property. There is 24,000 sq/ft of space on a 2.4-acre plot, with an exceptional frontage and thus, the property has huge kerb appeal for an ultra-high net worth purchaser. 'The original £100 million asking price was over-ambitious for a property in Kenwood as this equates to £3,700 per sq/ft which is only really achievable in the golden postcodes. 'Our objective was to acquire it for our client who recognised the immense potential of Heath Hall. They are naturally very excited about buying it and intend to spend many millions upgrading the property. 'The accommodation is arranged over three floors only which is very unusual as most trophy homes in London with similar square footage invariably have 30 - 40 per cent of the accommodation below ground. 'I firmly believe that, in the right hands, the property has the credentials to command a figure in the region of £50 million as in many respects, it is the ultimate trophy home. 'Needless to say, we are thrilled to have successfully acquired the property for our client.' The pool and gym area inside the mansion which was bought it as a rundown wreck for £5 million in 2006 and originally put on the market for £100million . High-class finish: Twelve types of Italian marble and seven types of wood, all prepared in Italy, were used for the bathrooms, according to the estate agents . Entertainment hub: There is also a library, home cinema, steam room with sauna, fully fitted home gym and wine cellar with climate-controlled temperature . Tranquil: The home, set in 2.5 acres of manicured gardens, is one of the largest private properties in the capital, . Cheap at the price: The new buyer is thought to have paid just £25 million for one of London's grandest private homes . Heath Hall was built in 1910 for William Park Lyle of the Tate & Lyle family. The property fell into disrepair after the Bank of China took over the three-storey mansion in the 1950s. Around 50 members of staff lived there at one time. When Mr Panayiotou bought the home in 2007, he employed a team of 120 tradesmen for the renovation. The hand-carved marble basins were prepared in Italy before being transported to the property. The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, north London, boasts dozens of eight-figure properties and has been dubbed 'Billionaires Row' Twelve types of Italian marble and seven types of wood were used for the bathrooms while the snooker room, office, bar, library and grand staircase are all clad in Oak. In total there are 14 bedroom suites, six reception rooms, a drawing room, dining room, family room, sun room and snooker room. There is also a tennis court, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, library, home cinema, steam room with sauna, fully fitted home gym and wine cellar with climate controlled temperature.","Heath Hall  in Hampstead, north London was originally put on the market three years ago for £100 million .

"Ever found yourself craving a cuppa but decided that boiling the kettle was too much effort? Well you’re in luck, because a fresh mug of tea is now available at the touch of a button – from your coffee machine. Two British firms have joined forces to launch tea capsules which can be used in existing Nespresso machines. The Cornish Tea Company will provide the leaves for a revolutionary pod made by Dualit – a brand best-known for its toasters and kettles. The Cornish Tea Company (pictured) will provide the leaves for a revolutionary tea capsule made by Dualit . Coffee drinkers have long enjoyed the merits of capsules, which provide instant hot drinks from machines made by Nespresso, Krups and Nescafe. But now tea drinkers can enjoy the same benefits with Dualit pods which are filled with tea from the family-run Cornish company. The pods are also compatible with Dualit’s own range of coffee machines, but do not come cheap. A single cup of tea will cost 30p – 15 times more than a typical 2p tea bag. Duncan Bond, director of the Cornish Tea Company, said: ‘We are terrifically proud to be the first tea brand in the world to be launching a Nespresso-compatible capsule. It’s never been done before and it has tremendous global potential. ‘When tea bags were first introduced people said they’d never catch on, now they are 97 per cent of the market. This could have a similar impact.’ Mr Bond, who founded the business with his nephew in 2012, added: ‘Many of our consumers lead very busy lives and this is not only incredibly convenient – the quality of the cup of tea is absolutely, scientifically consistent every time.’ The pods were developed last year after High Court judges ruled Dualit’s coffee capsules – which can also be used in Nespresso machines – did not infringe owner Nestle’s patents. The tea capsules, made by Dualit (left) which is best known for its kettles and toasters, can be used in existing Nespresso machines (right) The decision has blown open the tea and coffee capsules market, and Dualit has invested £1million in a new factory to meet the expected demand. The company started selling its own-brand tea capsules late last year but this is the first branded tea product to be made into a capsule. Dualit's Managing Director Leslie Gort-Barten said the Cornish Tea Company, based in Looe, Cornwall, was the perfect partner for the product. 'Cornish Tea are passionate, they are enthusiastic - they are player-managers in the same sense we are,' he said. 'The bigger a company gets, the more risk averse and blind to opportunity it can become. They weren't. 'I think Cornish Tea is a great company - it's a really good fit.'","The Cornish Tea Company will provide the leaves for a revolutionary pod .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday reappeared in public after an unusually long 10-day absence that unleashed frenzied speculation about the whereabouts and health of the Russian strongman. Looking pale, Putin met with Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev at the sumptuous Konstantinov's Palace just outside Saint Petersburg, an AFP correspondent reported. Putin, commenting on suggestions that he had been forced to lie low because of ill health, said that life without gossip would be 'boring'. Scroll down for video . President Vladimir Putin on Monday reappeared in public in a meeting with Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev (left) after an unusually long 10-day absence that unleashed frenzied speculation about the whereabouts and health of the Russian strongman . The Bishkek leader claimed Putin was fit, and that rumours of his ill-health were unfounded . 'It would be boring without gossip,' Putin said in his first public appearance since March 5. He refused to explain his absence. The Bishkek leader claimed Putin was fit - and in macho mode. 'The president of Russia isn't just walking, he's hot-rodding around, driving his guests around behind the wheel,' said Atambayev. 'Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin) just drove me around the territory. That's just so there's no rumours.' After studying images and video of the meeting body language expert Judi James, author of The You Code: What Your Habits Say About You, told MailOnline that the poor-health rumours might be true after all. She said: 'Putin's face looks shiny and although the smile is held in place, his eye expression lacks some of its normal steel and arrogance. 'His stride has most of its normal energy, but his left arm could be showing signs of weakness. In some poses, it hangs lifelessly down at his side and when he sits he appears to support it with his right hand, although he can clearly use it as he shows when he unbuttons his jacket. 'His leg-splay is wide, suggesting alpha confidence, and he leads the conversation with his usual determination and active head movements. 'His posture in the chair is slightly slumped to the right though and when he finishes talking his legs pump backwards and forward as though he might be keen to see an end to the meeting.' His reappearance came after it was revealed that he was ready to place his nuclear attack forces on alert when he seized Crimea a year ago. The Russian president's revelation was aired in a pre-recorded TV interview broadcast at the end of last week.

Putin refused to explain why he had been absent for 10 days . In the documentary – titled Crimea: Way Back Home – he claimed the area was Russia's 'historic territory', even though under international law it remains Ukrainian. Putin went on to say: 'Russian people live there, they are in danger and we cannot leave them.' He also claimed that he feared they would have been overrun by 'a nationalist bulldozer' from Kiev, and said he could not have left the area and the people who live there 'to whims of fate'. However the president explained that he knew the West could have intervened, and had been 'ready' to put his nuclear arsenal on alert, adding: 'I talked with colleagues and told them that Crimea is our historic territory. We were ready to do it.' The Kremlin has since claimed it has the right to station nuclear weapons on the Crimean peninsula. Putin's absence occurred amid rumours of illness, a coup, or his Olympic gymnast 'lover' Alina Kabayeva giving birth to a child in Switzerland. He vanished soon after aides to one of his key allies were blamed for ordering the assassination of one of the Kremlin's most outspoken critics, Boris Nemtsov.","Putin reappeared in public after an unusually long 10-day absence .

"Beautiful images have emerged of a new island that has formed off the coast of Tonga - although scientists say it could soon disappear. The photographs were taken by three men who climbed to the peak of the land mass 40 miles (65 km) northwest of the capital, Nuku'alofa. The island started forming in January after a volcano exploded underwater and then expanded creating a mile long, cone-shaped formation. Scroll down for video . Stunning images have emerged of a new island that has formed off the coast of Tonga - although scientists say it could soon disappear . Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai sits beneath the ocean 39 miles (62km) northwest of Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa. The volcano gets its name from the two islands it is situated between - Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai. It is said to be part of the volcanic Pacific Ring of Fire and is believed to one of a 36 undersea volcanoes in that region. A short-lived eruption in March 2009, lasted for almost a week. At the time, geologists said the eruption originated from two volcanic vents - one was located on Hunga Ha'apai, while the other was around 330ft (100m) offshore. The two vents spewed so much debris, however, they created a new land mass. Source: Atlas Obscura . Hotel owner GP Orbassano, along with a friend and his son, arrived at one of the island's three black beaches on Saturday. 'It was a perfect day, with fantastic views – bright blue sky and the sea was the same colour as the sky,' GP Orbassano, one of the locals, told Tonga's Matangi Online. The island is made mainly of scoria, which is a dark coloured volcanic rock that can sometimes contain crystals. The holes in the material form when gases that were dissolved in the magma come out of solution as it erupts . Scientists believe the dimensions of the new island are about 1.1 miles (1.8 km) by 0.9 miles (1.5km), and that it rises about 328ft (100 metres) above the sea. Orbassano admitted that the climb was dangerous as a result of the excessive heat on the dark landscape, according to Matangi Online. However, he said the natural beauty of the location could make it into a popular tourist attraction before the island disappears in a few months. The island was first spotted in an image taken by the Pleiades satellite on 19 January 2015. The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai underwater volcano, that created the formation, is located between two land masses in the Tonga archipelago - Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai. They said the surface of the island was still warm and, after climbing to the highest point of its crater, they caught sight of a vast green lake which smelled of sulphur. 'The island is double the size of Fafa. There is a lot of rock, it's not just ash. It looks like the moon,' said Orbassano. The region is dubbed Ring of Fire because of the high levels of seismic activity in the area. Hunga Tonga's latest eruption began on 19 December 2014 and continued into this month. Steam, ash and nitrogen and phosphorus erupted from the ocean, and international flights around the island were cancelled. At its peak, the ash plume reached heights of more than 14,765ft (4,500 metres). The photographs were taken by three men who climbed to the peak of the land mass 40 miles (65 km) northwest of the capital, Nuku'alofa .

The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai underwater volcano, that created the formation, is located between two land masses in the Tonga archipelago - Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai. In addition to creating the new island, the eruption is also said to have stripped its two neighbouring islands of vegetation, and caused what is known as a red tide. A red tide, or algal bloom, occurs when there is a sudden increase in the amount of algae in water. When levels of nitrogen and phosphorus rise, which can be caused by underwater eruptions such as the one off the coast of Tonga, algae can multiply. Typically, this causes water to turn green, but the effect also causes reds and yellows to be released. In particular, a bloom of dinoflagellate algae causes water to turn blood red in colour. Land masses forming after volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are relatively common. In 2013, a volcanic island appeared off the coast of Japan, near the uninhabited island of Nishino Shima. Dubbed Niijima, it was first spotted on 20 November in the Ogasawara chain around 600 miles south of Tokyo and had tripled in size by the following month. Scientists believe the dimensions of the new island are about 1.1 miles (1.8 km) by 0.9 miles (1.5km), and that it rises about 328ft (100 metres) above the sea . Orbassano admitted that the climb was dangerous as a result of the excessive heat on the dark landscape, according to Matangi Online . The island started forming in January after a volcano exploded underwater and then expanded creating a cone-shaped formation . Initially, scientists were unsure how long it would last because volcanic islets of that type tend to be reclaimed by the sea after a short time. However, the island expanded to 56,000 square metres (13.8 acres) - around three times its size - as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below. Similarly, in September that year, a new island appeared off the coast of Pakistan. It was forced to the surface following an earthquake and was made up a mound of mud and rock 70ft (20 metres) high and 295ft (89 metres) wide on the coastline near the port of Gwadar. The natural beauty of the location could make it into a popular tourist attraction before the island disappears in a few months .

"Her ginormous breasts have already left her barely able to run, but now the 'human barbie' Lacey Wildd has revealed that she is planning a 13th breast enlargement. Indeed, the mother-of-six from West Virginia - wants to enhance her chest to a QQQ cup size, and wants to go under the knife for her 37th operation in a bid to transform her appearance. Not only that, the 46-year-old has been on an extreme diet in a bid to slim down to a tiny size zero. Scroll down for video . Lacey Wildd took a stroll along the breach showing off her newly slimmed down figure, she has revealed she plans to lose more weight and wants her breasts enlarged again . Lacey, who this week showed off her curvaceous body in a tiny bikini, said: 'I feel really good but I still think I need to lose more weight. I want to go down to a size 3 or even a 0. 'I want to have the most extreme body in the world, I want to be a walking cartoon character. But I know I have to be careful.' Lacey had previously been turned down for more surgery by a doctor who told her that she would ruin her body if she made her breasts any larger. However, she vowed to carry on until she found someone who would do the operation for her. Lacey has previously said: 'My world rotates around my boobs. I don't get high when I have surgery. But I do get a little thrill out of thinking I’m going to wake up looking different.' Lacey's breasts are so large that she can only use the back hobs on her oven so she doesn't burn them . Lacy originally started off with breast enhancement surgery but soon moved on to other parts of her body. 'As I got older I got a flatter butt, so I had Brazilian butt lifts to give me more shape. I had three implants at $10,000 a time, so now I've got a $30,000 butt,' she jokes. However her exaggerated curves mean that she finds it difficult to find clothes that actually fit her. Her young daughter Jenaveve is less enthusiastic about her mother's massive embonpoint. 'I can’t go anywhere without people swarming over her,' she complains. As for the boobs themselves: It's disgusting,' she admits. Through the years Lacey has had so much surgery that she is no unrecognisable from her former self - pictured left before her surgery, and right, after her first operations . Lacey has previously stared in the TLC show My Strange Addiction, where she revealed all about her quest to look like Barbie . Lacey - who has been living off a controversial diet of just an apple, lemon juice and water for the past six weeks - has previously spoken out about her desire to look like Barbie. In TLC's My Strange Addiction which filmed about her 36th surgery she said: 'I want to be an adult Barbie, like the extreme Barbie. 'I'm known as one of the most extreme plastic surgery patients in the world and I want to keep pushing the limits.' 'I'm proud to be plastic. I have spent a quarter of a million dollars to build the most extreme plastic body in the world,' she previously said. 'I'm not just obsessed with my boobs,' she added. 'I'm obsessed with the entire look. I'm looking for the perfect body.' Lacey's 36 previous surgeries include 12 boob jobs, liposuction, nose and chin augmentation and she's even had her bum made bigger. The huge weight of her chest - each breast currently weight 21 pounds - means that she has to prop pillows underneath her while driving and she only uses the back burners on her stove in case she burns her breasts while cooking. Lacey has previously revealed that she finds it hard to find clothes that fit her thanks to her giant chest .

"Mark Duggan: Linked to ten shootings and two murders before he was shot and killed by police while travelling in a minicab . Violent gangster Mark Duggan – whose death sparked the 2011 riots – was holding a gun when a police marksman opened fire, a report concluded yesterday. An exhaustive three-and-a-half year investigation by the police watchdog completely exonerated the firearms officer who shot Duggan of any wrongdoing. The 500-page report concluded that the marksman, known only as V53, used ‘reasonable and proportionate force’ and said that there is no ‘reliable evidence’ to undermine his account. And it backed V53’s version of events: that he shot Duggan because he saw a gun and thought the gangster was about to open fire. Last year an inquest ruled that Duggan was lawfully killed – but the jury concluded that he had dropped the gun some time before he was shot. However, yesterday’s report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission said the gangster was holding the gun and was ‘in the process of throwing it to his right as he was shot’. The IPCC said it based its conclusions on the evidence from the inquest and extra evidence which it obtained later. In the aftermath of Duggan’s death, supposed witnesses claimed they saw police marksmen shoot him after he had already given himself up. One claimed she saw police officers plant a gun at the scene minutes after the shooting. All of these accounts were rejected by the IPCC because the accounts were riddled with inconsistencies. The investigation also rejected claims made by Duggan’s mother Pamela and girlfriend Precious Douaihy that officers tampered with evidence and lied in their witness statements. Before his death, Duggan, 29, was considered to be one of Britain’s most violent gangsters who was linked to ten shootings and two murders. Aftermath: Duggan's body lies in the street moments after he was killed. A report today ruled that he had run from the minicab holding the gun wrapped in a sock, at which point officers opened fire . He was placed under surveillance in August 2011 after officers learnt he was about to pick up a gun from Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, an associate, in Leyton, east London. After Duggan had collected the weapon, the minicab in which he was travelling was stopped by armed police during the evening rush-hour in Tottenham, north London. The IPCC rejected wild conspiracy theories and inaccurate witness statements, which were promoted by Mark Duggan’s supporters. The father-of-four, who had taken the party drug ecstasy, then ran out of the Toyota minicab holding the gun, the report said. Duggan was shot twice by V53 after the officer saw him raise a gun wrapped in a sock towards him. One bullet hit the gangster in his right bicep and the other hit him in the chest. When stopped by police he was carrying a BBM Bruni starter pistol that had been converted into a ‘lethal’ handgun capable of firing 9mm bullets. The marksman has repeatedly said that it was his ‘honestly held belief’ that Duggan was about to shoot him and his colleagues. ‘The world just stopped in my head,’ he told the inquest. ‘It’s like a freeze frame moment. The only thing I was focusing on is the gun.’ Duggan’s death triggered four days of rioting and looting across England, leading to five deaths and £200million of damage. More than 1,400 were later jailed over the riots. The IPCC report found that Scotland Yard’s decision to place Duggan under surveillance was ‘logical and legitimate’ because he was ‘coming to prominence’ as an active member of the notorious Tottenham ManDem gang. It also said that undercover officers were right to stop Duggan when he was in the minicab. After studying more than 1,200 documents, 500 witness statements and 340 exhibits, it found ‘no indication of misconduct for any armed officer involved’. But it recommended that police forces should use audio and video equipment to record undercover operations so they can provide an ‘accurate and incontrovertible’ record of what happened. IPCC deputy chairman Rachel Cerfontyne said: ‘Our findings are based on the best available evidence, checked and cross-checked.’ Last night, the Duggan family released a statement in which they claimed the report ‘confirms their belief that the IPCC are unfit for purpose’. The family described the watchdog’s conduct as ‘a chronicle of inefficiency and incompetence’.","Mark Duggan, 29, was shot twice during rush hour in Tottenham in 2011 .

"When nurse Faye Gregson decided to share an intimate moment with her boyfriend, privacy wasn’t exactly utmost in her mind. Not only did her romantic liaison take place in the front seat of her Audi, but she was also parked in the middle of a zebra crossing. And to top it all off, she left her hazard lights flashing. Faye Gregson, 26, from Preston, was arrested by police after they found her car parked at an angle on a zebra crossing on Christmas Eve while she was straddling her boyfriend in the passenger seat . The 26-year-old, who was nearly twice the drink-drive limit, was arrested after police caught her straddling her boyfriend in the passenger seat. Yesterday, she was fined £300 and begged a judge not to take her licence, saying: ‘I’m really sorry. It won’t happen again.’ A court heard she had stopped in the middle of the road in Blackpool at around 2.30am on Christmas Eve before clambering on top of her boyfriend. Gregson, whose favourite books include Fifty Shades of Grey, had parked her black Audi at an angle on the crossing but put her hazard lights on to warn other drivers. The keen netball player at first denied she had been drinking and tried to get out of a breathalyser test by claiming that she had a cold, Blackpool Magistrates Court heard. But officers carried out the test anyway, describing her as ‘smelling of alcohol’ and having glazed eyes. Prosecutor Alison Quanbrough told the court they had spotted her because of her flashing hazard lights. Gregson initially denied being drunk, saying she had just finished a 15-hour shift at Preston hospital. She refused a breath test, saying she had a cold, but a urine test showed she was twice the drink-drive limit . ‘She was straddling a male in the passenger seat,’ said Mrs Quanbrough. ‘When she saw the police she got off the male. She then got into the driver’s seat and put on the seatbelt.’ Officers asked Gregson to step out of the car and found she was unsteady on her feet. But she said she had not been drinking, and claimed to have just finished a 15-hour shift at the Royal Preston Hospital, where she works. Gregson was taken to a police station where she refused to be breathalysed and was given a urine test instead. It showed she had 205 milligrammes of alcohol in her body. The maximum allowed by law is 107. Gregson, who had no previous convictions, later admitted being in charge of the car while over the limit. She apologised and pleaded with the court to let her keep her licence, saying: ‘I need my car to get to work at hospital as I work shifts.’ Magistrates agreed and instead ordered ten points to be added to her licence. Gregson, from Preston, was also told to pay £85 costs and a £30 victims’ surcharge. On her Facebook profile she lists Fifty Shades of Grey as one of her favourite books alongside What I Wish I Knew About Nursing. Pictures taken on Christmas Eve show her partying with her friends. Drivers can be prosecuted for being ‘in charge’ of a vehicle while over the alcohol limit. The offence is used when drunk people are caught either getting into or having just stopped their cars. They can be charged even if they are in the passenger seat if police think they were recently driving, as in Gregson’s case.","Police saw Faye Gregson, 26, parked on zebra crossing on Christmas Eve .

"Jihadi bride: Sharmeena Begum is thought to be in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa . To her adoring father, she was just like any other 15-year-old. Sharmeena Begum loved shopping at Forever 21, listening to Rihanna and watching EastEnders. A keen pupil, she would chatter excitedly to her father about her dreams of becoming a doctor. And of course, like most of her schoolmates, she was utterly obsessed with her mobile. Like most fathers, Mohammad Uddin saw nothing sinister in her constant tapping away on her iPhone. He assumed she was using Twitter and the instant messaging service WhatsApp simply to chat with her friends. Only now does he know the horrifying truth – that Sharmeena was being groomed through the internet by shadowy IS extremists. The 38-year-old father discovered too late what was going on under his nose. His daughter is now living in the IS stronghold of Raqqa, in Syria, as a jihadi bride – and has told him she will never return. Last night Mr Uddin told of his belief that sinister IS recruiters had taken advantage of Twitter and WhatsApp to corrupt his daughter. She had told him she was too sick to go to school the day before she fled, last December 6. But she met up with her best friends – Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15 – at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, that evening. Sharmeena bought an iPhone 5S and some new clothes, apparently using £500 she persuaded her grandmother to hand over a few weeks earlier. The four girls had been inseparable at Bethnal Green Academy, a school rated outstanding by Ofsted. They were so close that Sharmeena invited the other three to her father’s wedding when he married for a second time in September. Mr Uddin, a waiter at a central London restaurant, urged police to speak to the other teenagers after his daughter vanished, and even suggested they might have considered running away with her. ‘I said [to officers], “Keep an eye on the three girls, maybe they’ll give you a clue.” Shamima, Kadiza, and Amira were her closest friends,’ he said. ‘I was pretty sure when my daughter went missing that the four girls would have gone together. And when I realised [they hadn’t] I was surprised. ‘I went to Bethnal Green Academy two days later, on the Monday, and I spoke to the deputy headmistress and I asked to speak to the three girls. Scroll down for videos . Mohammad Uddin with pictures of his teenage daughter. He said he believes she was targeted by extremists . ‘She told me “The police are speaking to them so you can’t”.’ Sharmeena was born to Bangladeshi parents in Tower Hamlets, east London, in 1999. She was largely brought up by her mother Shahnaz Begum until 2007, when her father moved to Britain. Mrs Begum was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in 2013 and told she had only six months left to live. She kept this secret from her daughter for as long as possible. Recalling the moment their GP broke the news to Sharmeena, Mr Uddin said: ‘It was two months before her mother died. ‘She was crying loads, but I told her: “Everyone is going to die. Today it’s your mum, tomorrow it could be me. We need to be patient”.’ Growing up in a modest two-bedroom council flat in Bethnal Green just a stone’s throw from the trendy bars and coffee shops of Shoreditch, Sharmeena harboured ambitions to become a doctor or a teacher and achieved top grades in English, her favourite subject. She was an ordinary teenager who loved shopping for clothes and make-up. But after her mother died in January last year, aged just 33, she changed and began taking an intense interest in Islam, spending most of her free time praying in her room. Family album: Sharmeena pictured as a young child . Mr Uddin said: ‘I thought this was normal because she lost the closest person to her, and she’s an only child. Before then she wasn’t very religious. She wouldn’t go to the mosque and she would wear English dress. ‘But then she changed her dressing style and wore a scarf and started praying five times a day. ‘Sometimes she would go to the East London Mosque for prayers.’ Her father was not worried about this change in her behaviour, and even took his daughter to Mecca for the hajj pilgrimage – an Islamic ritual devout Muslims are expected to perform at least once. Sharmeena set her alarm to wake herself up early to pray, and she destroyed old pictures of herself, saying women should not be photographed. She stopped listening to Western music and spent more and more time watching the news. It is now apparent that she was preparing to travel to Syria to join IS, although her contacts with jihadists are impossible to trace because she has deleted her social media accounts. Shortly before fleeing to Turkey, she asked her father to pay for an online order from her favourite shop, Forever 21, because she needed some new clothes for the ‘cold weather’. The package arrived two days after she had run away. Her father thinks she was groomed to go to Syria by two young women, who are believed to have taken her to the airport and ensured she got on the flight to Turkey. Mr Uddin could not believe that his daughter had left Britain because she was not even allowed to travel the one mile down the road from her home to Whitechapel by herself. He said: ‘When the police came, I was ringing my daughter continuously, but it kept going to voicemail in a different language. The 15-year-old is believed to be in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa with classmates Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum (above) ‘I asked the officers what the language was – two or three hours later they told me she was in Turkey. ‘I didn’t know why she had gone to Turkey. I thought she’s got no relatives or friends there – there was nobody in Turkey, so how come she went there? I asked the police “How can she fly without any parent or guardian?” They told me the airline’s rules say a 14-year-old can fly by herself.’ Mr Uddin does not blame the police for his daughter running away but he believes more could have been done when she was in Turkey and making her way to the Syrian border. He said: ‘She didn’t make it to the Islamic State the same day, she was in Turkey for a few days. ‘I saw from my phone records that she was still making calls in Turkey to a Turkish mobile. So I was a bit upset because I gave police all this information. ‘She was calling two or three people over four or five days. Maybe they could have found her in Turkey but they didn’t.’ Video footage showing the three British schoolgirls an hour before they crossed into Syria to join Islamic State emerged last night. It was filmed on a hidden camera by a double agent said to work for the Canadian intelligence agency. He can be heard giving the girls fake Syrian passports and counting their bags in the boot of a car before telling them to get in the vehicle. ‘Yalla, sis,’ he says, meaning ‘Let’s go, sisters.’ Then he points towards Syria and says with a laugh: ‘It’s nice.’ He tells them it will take only an hour to reach to reach the border. The girls’ bags were put in the car by a second man. A woman’s voice can be heard, too, but her face isn’t shown on the 73-second video. The agent, a Syrian, is said by Turkey to be a ‘local asset’ who works for Canada on a freelance basis. He was picked up by Turkish officials just over a week ago and is in custody. Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the man was ‘someone who worked in the intelligence services of a country in the US-coalition [against IS]. ‘I told this to the British foreign secretary and he replied, “As usual.” ’ But a senior Canadian government official said the suspect was ‘not a Canadian citizen’ and ‘not employed by’ its spy agency.

"A bank worker tried to murder his topless masseuse girlfriend after he quit his job to start a business with her but then became jealous when a man smiled at her in a club. Amish Kansagra opened a massage parlour with his Polish lover Anna Imporowicz, but he was angry that she attracted interest from other men, including her ex-boyfriend. The couple fell out when a man smiled at Miss Imporowicz in a salsa club - and the next day Kansagra turned up at her home and stabbed her in the throat, saying: 'You will die today.' He was today convicted of attempted murder at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court, after a jury heard he had 'eyes like the devil' during his violent rampage. Attack: Amish Kansagra, left, tried to murder his masseuse girlfriend Anna Imporowicz, right . Judge Susan Tapping said that Kansagra, 28, would face a 'lengthy sentence' for the crime after being found guilty. The couple first started dating when Kansagra became a regular client of Miss Imporowicz, 35, who would give massages to naked customers while she was topless or wearing skimpy underwear. He left his job at a bank and opened a massage parlour with her in Ealing, west London, but their relationship fell apart last June after the incident in a Holborn salsa club. The court heard that the pair went home together that night, but Kansagra shoved Miss Imporowicz against a fridge, destroyed her phone and laptop and posted a picture of her on Facebook with the caption: 'I'm a prostitute and proud of it.' The next day, he turned up at her house in nearby Brentford armed with a knife which he had taken from the massage parlour. Victim: Miss Imporowicz met the defendant because he was a massage customer of hers . Prosecutor Julian Jones told the jury: 'She saw Amish with the knife in his hand and he shut the kitchen window and put the knife to her throat and said, ""You've made the wrong decision. You will die today."" 'He was trying to stab her neck and she felt him cut her neck and and she saw her blood and fell to the floor saying, ""I love you. Don't do this."" 'She described him as having gritted teeth and eyes like the devil, and he cut her neck again, harder and deeper, and used the tip of the knife to cut her gum.' Miss Imporowicz tried to flee out of the front door, but was pulled back by the defendant, Mr Jones continued. 'He still had the knife in one hand and the other hand around her neck and stabbed her in the side. 'She escaped via a window and while she had one leg out Amish tried to stab her everywhere.' A retired nurse came to her aid, and as Kansagra fled the scene he told witnesses that Miss Imporowicz had inflicted the horrific injuries on himself. The defendant initially ran away to Manchester, but he later turned himself in to police and claimed not to remember anything thanks to a three-day vodka binge. 'He said she was the first person he had ever loved and that there was something inside him,' the prosecutor said. 'He recalled stabbing Anna in the neck and seeing the blood and confirmed he was not acting in self-defence.' Kansagra was convicted by the jury of one count of attempted murder, but was found not guilty of assaulting Miss Imporowicz. Before the trial he pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage, possessing a bladed article and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. Kansagra was remanded in custody for sentencing on March 19.","Amish Kansagra, 28, met Anna Imporowicz when he became a customer of hers at topless massage parlour .

"She was a young woman who had her dreams of being a model ruined when she became the victim of an acid attack instigated by her ex-boyfriend in 2008. And on Friday, Katie Piper proved she's stronger than ever by launching the UK's first-ever fashion catwalk that  included models with visible differences. One lady, like Katie, was a sufferer of visible scars from burns and the pair met through Katie's charity foundation. Scroll down for video . Katie Piper launched the UK's first-ever fashion catwalk on Friday and called on one of her friends, who had visible scars from burns, to walk in the show . Launched at the Ideal Home Show, the show - called 'Confidence - The Secret' - aimed to challenge the conventional catwalk. Speaking to FEMAIL about the initiative ahead of the show, she said: 'I am working with The Ideal Home Show as a fashion and beauty ambassador to launch a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from my foundation, the Katie Piper Foundation, and Models of Diversity. It's all incredibly exciting.' The shows, which will also take place on  March  21 and  April 3, have a twist. The models on the catwalk  bravely admitted what their true insecurities are, which aren’t always the obvious anxiety that people assume. Whether it be their height, their weight or colour of their hair, the representatives wanted to emphasise that what others assume to be their insecurity isn’t always the case.

In her role as a fashion and beauty ambassador for the Ideal Home Show, Katie launched a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from her foundation, the Katie Piper Foundation, and Models of Diversity . Whether it be their height, their weight or colour of their hair, the models wanted to prove that it isn't always the obvious features that they are insecure about .

The women took to the catwalk in T-shirts emblazoned with the question: 'What do you see?' and when they walked back, their inner most insecurity was displayed on the back of the top. Katie, who was left with severe scarring after being attacked in 2008 when her ex-boyfriend employed an accomplice to throw a cup of industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face, was keen to reveal hers. 'You might look at me and think that's what I would be insecure about it, but it isn't,' she revealed. 'In fact, it's my height; I would love to be a bit taller.' The shows, which starred models with visible differences, will also take place on March 21 and April 3 . The lady in a wheelchair then took to the catwalk with a T-shirt explaining her true insecurity . Katie, who penned several positive affirmation books during her recovery, says an optimistic outlook is one of her secrets to success and she no doubt passed that advice on in today's show . Explaining the inspiration behind the show's name, Katie said: 'It's called Confidence - The Secret because confidence is something you can use to express yourself and convey yourself and it's something I've used through several periods of my life. 'It's not about trying to look and be perfect, it's about a positive mindset and being the best version of yourself that you can possibly be.' Katie, who  penned several positive affirmation books during her recovery, says an optimistic outlook is one of her secrets to success. 'I can't express how important positive thinking is,' she said. 'When I was recovering from my attack, I would write lots of little powerful notes and stick them around the room. Before I walk onto the red carpet, I have a mantra and always repeat to myself ""inhale confidence, exhale doubt""; it really is so powerful. 'It's all about looking at what you do have and not what you don't.' This model, an amputee, revealed that she hates her wide hips as she walked the runway . Katie heeded her own advice recently when she took to the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'. Her catwalk coup kicked off what looks set to be a successful year for Katie. She's penning a new book, due out later this month, is working on a third series of Bodyshockers and has been busy growing her charity. If that wasn't enough, Katie is planning her wedding, mothering her one-year-old daughter and training for a triathlon, too. She added: 'No matter what you look like, you can live a full life and that's what I want to show with Confidence - The Secret.'

"A BBC presenter has vented his fury at the corporation in an on-air outburst after he was kicked off his popular morning show because he is engaged to the local Tory MP. BBC Radio Bristol presenter John Darvall, 48, and MP Charlotte Leslie, 36, began dating in October and got engaged just two months later. But the radio DJ has been ousted from his mid-morning show and moved to a less news-based afternoon slot in the run-up to polling day, as she is standing for re-election. BBC Radio Bristol presenter John Darvall, 48, pictured, has been ousted from his regular show due to his engagement to Tory MP, Charlotte Leslie, in the run-up to the general election . BBC bosses insist it is due to 'heightened sensitivities' and to avoid accusations of a conflict of interest, and the father-of-four will be back after May. But during one of his final shows, the twice-divorced presenter vented his frustration at the corporation and suggested he might not be allowed back even after the election. MP Charlotte Leslie, 36, began dating the father-of-four in October . Speaking to a caller during a phone-in to discuss Jeremy Clarkson's sacking from the BBC, Mr Darvall said: 'Trust me I have a lot of reasons myself to be angry with the BBC at the moment.' Later, when a caller suggested he should apply to replace the controversial Top Gear presenter, he joked: 'I am coming off this programme tomorrow, so I might consider something of a career departure.' Questioned by another caller, he added: 'It's to do with the election and protecting BBC impartiality. It's not my decision. 'I'm honouring what the BBC have asked me to do and I sincerely hope to be back after the general election, and the BBC have sort of said that I might possibly be, barring any unforeseen circumstances. 'A true BBC management meeting.' Bristol MP Leslie - voted the sexiest woman in politics - met John when she first went on his show four years ago. They began dating in October, he proposed on Christmas Day, and they officially announced their engagement last month. BBC bosses immediately said he would have to move to an afternoon show because his fiancee is standing for re-election. Mr Darvall - who joined the show in 2011 - remained silent on his move until he got frustrated during a call-in this week, and his last morning show until after the election was yesterday. Speaking after her fiance's on-air rant, Leslie said he had 'always been completely professional and impartial'. The MP for Bristol North West said: 'It would be extraordinary if he were not allowed to return to his programme after the General Election, and I fully expect he will be. 'John has always been completely professional and impartial and I understand this is being done to protect him and the BBC for the few weeks of the final election period. 'It would be extraordinary if he were not allowed to return to his programme after the General Election, and I fully expect he will be.' The BBC said the arrangement was to avoid any perception of a 'conflict of interest' and said it would continue until after the general election . A BBC spokesperson said: 'We have every confidence in the professionalism and impartiality of all our presenters and staff, but given the heightened sensitivities of an election period John Darvall will move from the Mid-morning Show to present the Afternoon Show on BBC Radio Bristol. 'This is to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest and the arrangement will continue until after the General Election.' Announcing their engagement last month, Leslie said his proposal was 'completely natural and lovely' and that the presenter often grilled her on her views. The term comes from the Urdu (parda) and Persian (pardah) word meaning veil or curtain. ‘Purdah’ refers to the period between the dissolution of Parliament and polling day. The Cabinet Office issue guidance for Ministers and civil servants on the handling of Government business designed to ensure that no party or candidate uses their position for electoral advantage during this period. The BBC has produced its own 20 page document of 'election guidelines' for its staff in the run-up to polling day. They say: 'There is no area of broadcasting where the BBC’s commitment to due impartiality is more closely scrutinised than in reporting election campaigns.' Under the requirements of the organisations Charter Agreement of 2006 it must ensure that political issues are covered with due accuracy and impartiality. It states: 'In all elections, the BBC must take care to prevent candidates being given an unfair advantage.' BBC editorial staff are also warned that anyone involved in producing election-related content must avoid compromising the BBC’s impartiality or bringing the BBC into disrepute by their activities, such as by expressing their own views on political matters, either on personal websites or social media. She said: 'We have known each other since 2011, when he started interviewing me. 'He's always given me quite a tough time, as he's a robust interviewer. I always enjoyed it because there was always a lot of banter. 'I like the fact that we don't agree and if I ever get too Tory-Tory, he'll bash me. He'll dissect my arguments, and I enjoy being challenged. 'My parents always said you could tell we got on well on air. He came for tea and that was it.'","Charlotte Leslie, 36, is set to marry BBC Radio Bristol host John Darvall .

"Getting a job lifts more people out of poverty in Britain than anywhere in Europe, a new study reveals. More than seven in 10 people in the UK were no longer in poverty after finding work, compared to the EU average of just half. Ministers said the figures showed Britain was leading the way in proving that work is the best route out of being poor. Seven in 10 people in the UK were no longer classed as poor after finding work, compared to the EU average of just half . In work poverty rates have been lower in the UK than the EU average every year since 2006, the figures show . The Office for National Statistics examined figures for every European country to analyse the impact getting a job can have on people classed as poor. It found gaining employment helped far more people out of poverty than the rest of the continent. Someone is classed as living in poverty if their disposable income is less than 60 per cent of the national average. People living in 'in-work poverty' are both below the poverty threshold and in employment themselves. For the EU as a whole, only half of people (49 per cent) left poverty when they got a job in 2009, according to analysis carried out by the European Commission. Detailed figures by country suggest the UK has a higher poverty exit rate for people getting a job than almost any other country examined. The ONS said: 'The percentage of people who moved out of poverty when entering employment in the UK was relatively stable and well above the EU average throughout the period 2007 to 2012, with an exit rate of 68 per cent in 2007 to 2009, compared with 73 per cent in 2010 to 2012.' By contrast, the poverty exit rate was lowest in Romania just 23 per cent of people left poverty after getting a job. In Bulgaria just 36 per cent were lifted out of poverty and Spain 37 per cent. In Sweden the figure was 70 per cent, followed by Portugal (66 per cent), Lithuania (64 per cent) and Luxembourg and Estonia, both 62 per cent. The Tories have argued that the introduction of Universal Credit, which combines six benefits into one, will ensure that work always pays and is guaranteed to lift people out of poverty if they get a job. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the research showed work is the best route out of poverty . Increasing hours and getting a pay rise were key routes to moving out of in work poverty, the ONS said . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'Our welfare reforms are designed to support people to move off benefits and into a job - to move from dependence to independence. 'We've always known that work is the best route out of poverty - and we now see that this is more pronounced in the UK compared to rest of Europe. 'We have more people in work than ever before, and poverty in this country is at the lowest level since the mid 1980's. 'Universal Credit will build on this record - ensuring sure work always pays, and making three million households better off.' According to the ONS, 8 per cent of working people aged 18-64 were in poverty in 2013, some 3million in total. By contrast 31 per cent of those not in work were in poverty. The data shows people taking up full-time jobs of 30 or more hours per week are more likely to move out of poverty when entering employment (76 per cent) than those who get a part-time job (62 per cent). Whether a job is permamnent or temporary makes little difference to the impact on someone being in poverty. The ONS added: 'Unsurprisingly, those moving out of poverty have a substantially higher rate of hourly pay than those who remain below the poverty threshold. This is the case for both full-time and part-time workers.'","Seven in 10 Britons moved out of poverty after entering employment .

"Rob Biddulph's picture book Blown Away has won Waterstones Children's Book Prize . It took him almost five years to find a publisher, but last night Rob Biddulph's persistence paid off when his first children's book won a major award. Blown Away, the magazine art director's enchanting tale about a sky-faring penguin, won the £5,000 Waterstones Children's Book Prize. It is only the second time a picture book has triumphed during the award's 11-year history. Mr Biddulph, who works for The Observer, said last night: 'I'm totally surprised at winning. It took me a while to get this book published.' Melissa Cox, chairman of the judging panel, said the author had 'a beautiful fresh style all his own'. She said: 'The test of a good picture book is not how good it is on first reading, but how enjoyable it is on its fiftieth. 'It's a beautiful fresh style that is all his own and his style of storytelling is very reminiscent of classic picture book writers like Allan Ahlberg. 'It's very unusual for a brand new illustrator to write their own text, which marked it out, and even more unusual is for them to do rhyming text.' Mr Biddulph began as an author by making up stories for his three children and illustrating them. Blown Away was named the overall winner beating two other titles which had triumphed in their categories – Half Bad by Sally Green, the best teenage book, and Murder Most Unladylike by Robin Stevens, the best title for younger readers. Waterstones Managing director James Daunt said: 'This year we have another wonderfully inspiring Prize that is testament to the extraordinary vibrancy and creativity in children's publishing.' Penguins also captured the public imagination in the build-up to Christmas last year when the computer-generated Monty starred in the John Lewis ad campaign, with spin-off cuddly toys selling out. Sally Green (pictured) was crowned winner of the best book for teenagers with her debut Half Bad .","Rob Biddulph's picture book has won Waterstones Children's Book Prize .

"British photographer Terry O'Neill has unveiled a new exhibition of celebrity mothers and daughters, including Jo Wood, Twiggy and Judy Garland, just in time for Mother's Day. The new collection, Mum: A Snapshot, is led by Jo Wood and daughter Leah, who appear in the exhibition twice thanks to a 1981 shot of the pair on tour with Ronnie Wood and the Rolling Stones. Capturing the special bond between mother and daughter, the show has been created in homage to the photographer's own late mother, and is free to the public this weekend, at London's White Space gallery.

'I actually did it in homage to my mother who I never had a chance to thank, because she died when I was young,' Terry O'Neill told This Morning. 'I never had a chance to thank her, and as you grow older of course you appreciate your mother more.' He added: 'So I got together this exhibition as a tribute to Mother’s Day.' Terry has been photographing celebrities for the last 50 years and the new show features both old and new pictures.

"Escaped jail: Eva Jaciskova, pictured in Ugg-style boots outside court today, stole £7,000 worth of shoes while working at Russell and Bromley . A shop assistant stole more than £7,000 of shoes by walking home in a new pair every day. Russell and Bromley worker Eva Jaciskova slipped on a pair of designer shoes at the end of each shift at the Oxford Street store without anyone noticing. Once home, Jaciskova would put the shoes up for sale on eBay, Southwark Crown Court heard. The mother-of-two, who was yesterday spared a jail sentence, walked off with £7,363-worth of shoes before staff noticed a large amount of the shop’s stock was advertised on eBay. Jaciskova, 37, who lives in High Wycombe, was then hauled into a meeting and initially denied stealing 26 pairs of shoes, before later admitting to her crime. Sitting in the dock wearing a pair of tatty, black Ugg-style boots, she wept as details of her theft were read to the court. Jaciskova had earlier pleaded guilty to one count of theft at a magistrate’s court in February. Yesterday, prosecutor Peter Zinner said: ‘This is a breach of trust case. The defendant was an employee of Russell and Bromley in Oxford Street and she was employed by the store as a sales assistant. ‘It transpired in June last year that significant amounts of Russell and Bromley stock had found their way for sale on an eBay account. 'In particular seven pairs of shoes and this is the initial tranche of shoes the defendant stole.’ Jaciskova, originally from Presov, Slovakia, stole shoes from the brand’s Diva, Laura and Skater ranges – with some pairs worth up to £400 each. Mr Zinner said: ‘She admitted what she had done was take the shoes out of the boxes from the stock room over a period of weeks, worn them home and then placed them on eBay to sell. There was an element of pre-planning and deviousness because the defendant left empty boxes in the right place in the stock room.’ Jaciskova initially avoided prosecution by agreeing to hand in her resignation the day she was accused of the theft. ‘However the staff were concerned that in fact that was just the tip of the iceberg because a significant number of shoes had gone missing from the stock room and a further 19 pairs of shoes were discovered having been stolen,’ Mr Zinner added. Serial thief: After stealing the designer footwear from Russell & Bromley, above, the mother would then sell them on eBay . ‘Because the defendant had not volunteered the extent of her criminality and the second tranche significantly increased the loss to the company it was reported to the police and on November 24 last year the defendant attended High Wycombe police station.’ Robert Conway, representing Jaciskova, said his client was ‘truly ashamed and regretful’. He added that she suffered a ‘medical condition’ that she was now getting treatment for. Judge Michael Grieve acknowledged she stole because she had been in financial difficulty, so instead of jail sentenced her to a 12-month community order with a three month curfew attached. He said to Jaciskova: ‘I am told and I can see from your behaviour at the moment that the realisation of your behaviour and being found out – that combination has caused you shame and regret.’ Jaciskova, of High Wycombe, pleaded guilty to a single count of theft but avoided a jail at her hearing at Southwark Crown Court, above .","Eva Jaciskova, 37, worked at Russell and Bromley store on Oxford Street .

"British Airways could be facing a compensation payout of up to £90,000 following a pungent smell that forced one of its flights to return to Heathrow Airport. The BA flight to Dubai returned to London due to a foul odour emanating from an overflowing toilet, and three passengers have since filed claims for compensation due to the travel disruption. They argue they are entitled to hundreds of pounds each after cabin crew were unable to fix the problem and the flight turned around near Brussels. A British Airways captain told passengers the smell was from 'liquid faecal excrement' in a toilet . Passengers were initially told that they would board another flight in three hours, but it turned into a 15-hour delay. Three passengers have contacted Claim4Flights.com to seek up to €600 each (£450) in compensation, the maximum allowed for a delay of more than four hours when travelling over 2,200 miles as stipulated by EU rules. If all 200 passengers on board the flight were to claim, BA could be forced into paying out up to£90,000. One claimant is Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev, who was travelling to Dubai with his pregnant wife and two-year-old daughter. At the time he took to Twitter to explain how a 'smelly poo in the toilet' had forced the plane to turn back and land at Heathrow. Tory councillor Abhishek Sachdev was travelling with his pregnant wife and their two-year-old daughter . Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev said passengers were told that crew could not fix the problem . Speaking to MailOnline Travel Mr Sachdev, a Tory councillor, said: 'We had booked a night flight to allow my two-and-and-half-year-old daughter to sleep. 'Initially we were told that the delay would be three hours until another flight. When we landed, the pilot said it would be a 15-hour delay, until 1pm the next day. A smell emanating from the toilet on a BA flight forced the plane to turn back (file photo) 'This meant we lost a whole day of our holiday, and that we also had the stress of travelling on a daytime flight with our toddler daughter.' Mr Sachdev decided to lodge a claim with Claim4Flights.com after being unimpressed with how BA officials dealt with the situation. 'At the baggage collection area, we were told by some BA staff to queue for information. After 15 minutes in that queue, we were then told there was no need to do so, and were given a leaflet,' he added. 'This leaflet simply said BA apologised for the technical fault, even though the pilot was clear that there was no technical fault. 'We then had to wait 25 minutes to get our accommodation and food voucher. About five or six staff were trying to print these for us but couldn't because of system problems they said. 'This was now midnight and we had pleaded with them to hurry up but it still took a long time to resolve. Then we got to the hotel, and had to wait another 25 minutes to check in.' A British Airways spokesperson told MailOnline Travel at the time that they were 'sorry for the discomfort' of the passengers. David Williams, director for Claim4Flights.com told MailOnline Travel: 'We are exploring the circumstances against the Regulation 261/2004 set by the European Parliament which dictates when passengers are entitled to claim compensation for delayed or cancelled flights. 'If the circumstances are such that the delay to the flight was within the control of British Airways then each passenger on the flight could be entitled up to €600 compensation, assuming there were 200 passengers on the flight then this could cost British Airways €120,000 in compensation.' British Airways have told MailOnline Travel that they 'will assess any claims and respond accordingly'.","Three passengers have launched compensation claims after 15-hour delay .

"Facing jail: Robert Stephens, 23, broke an ASBO banning him from drinking petrol . A man who propositioned schoolgirls in the street while high on unleaded petrol is facing jail after breaching an ASBO banning him from drinking the fuel. Robert Stephens was found drunkenly staggering around a petrol station having bought a gallon of unleaded fuel less than eight hours after being released from prison for a string of offences. The 23-year-old, who is addicted to drinking and sniffing gasoline, was first handed an ASBO banning him from large swathes of his home city following a bizarre drunken outburst during which he taunted unsuspecting women with sexual jibes. This involved approaching two schoolgirls and saying to them: 'If you're old enough to smoke you're old enough to suck my d***'. On the same day he violently threatened his grandfather. He was also issued with an ASBO banning him from drinking petrol after investigators noted the connection between the habit and his offences. In court, one official said: 'Stephens is known to drink and sniff petrol and during his spree of offences it was noted by some witnesses that he smelled strongly of petrol. 'His presence within the exclusion area coupled with his intoxication and purchase of petrol represents a significantly high risk of serious offences being committed. 'It was fortuitous that police were in the area and able to apprehend Stephens before more serious offences were committed.' Stephens admitted breaching his anti-social behaviour order when he appeared before a judge at Oxford Crown Court, above, on Friday . A judge heard that he returned to the neighbourhood he was banned from almost immediately after being released from jail in February this year. He went straight to a petrol station where he was found completely intoxicated after buying a gallon of petrol. Stephens admitted breaching his anti-social order when he appeared before a judge at Oxford Crown Court on Friday. Judge Ian Pringle QC told him that a pre-sentence report would be produced and remanded him in custody to appear for sentencing on April 14.","Robert Stephens, 23, of Oxford, is addicted to drinking and sniffing petrol .

"Banks have experimented with card readers and even fingerprint scanners but in the near future you could access your accounts using your heartbeat. Halifax has recently completed a successful trial of 'cardiac authentication' for its online accounts using the Nymi band. Nymi reads  the wearer's heart rhythms, which is said to be as unique as a person's fingerprint, to authenticate who they are. Halifax (branch pictured) recently completed a successful trial of 'cardiac authentication' for its online accounts using the Nymi band. Nymi reads the wearer's heart rhythms, which is said to be as unique as a person's fingerprint, to authenticate who they are . A built-in proximity sensor can then detect where they are, and when the wearer is close to a paired device, will automatically confirm their identity and unlock the account. In particular, the bracelet contains a HeartID sensor that measures the amount of electrical power generated by a human heart, called a cardiac rhythm tracked on an electrocardiogram, or ECG. This ECG differs from person to person and depends on the location and size of the their heart. Nymi only works with a registered person's cardiac rhythm, meaning if the bracelet is stolen it can't be hacked. The technology was developed by Toronto-based Bionym.

The bracelet contains a HeartID sensor that measures electrical power generated by a human heart tracked on an electrocardiogram, or ECG . When the wearer clasps the Nymi around their wrist, the bracelet powers on. By placing a finger on the topside sensor while the wrist is in contact with the bottom sensor, it completes an electrical circuit. When the wearer clasps the Nymi around their wrist, the bracelet powers on. By placing a finger on the topside sensor while the wrist is in contact with the bottom sensor, it completes an electrical circuit. Nymi will then vibrate and built-in LEDs light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them. Users will stay authenticated until they remove their Nymi and the electrical circuit is broke. The Nymi functions on a three-factor security system - the bracelet, a unique heartbeat and an Authorized Authentication Device (AAD), which is a device registered with the app. Nymi vibrates and built-in LEDs light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them. Users stay authenticated until they remove their Nymi and the electrical circuit is broke. The Nymi functions on a three-factor security system - the bracelet, a unique heartbeat and an Authorized Authentication Device (AAD), which is a smartphone or device registered with the app. When the Nymi authenticates a user it looks at the shape of their ECG wave, not their heart rate. It can therefore adjust to typical variations in heart rate, even if the wearer has an irregular ECG as a result of a medical condition. The product's site said: 'Nymi offers security without compromising convenience, putting you, and only you, in control of your identity. 'As you head out the door, you’ll be able to interact with the world around you through the power of simple gestures. 'With accurate and convenient authentication technology there is no end to the possibilities. 'The Nymi can replace everything from the PIN on your credit card to the account information on your gaming console without sacrificing security, privacy or convenience.' In the first-of-its-kind trials by a UK bank, Halifax asked customers to use the wristband to login to their online accounts. When connected to an account, the band could also be used to pay for goods using contactless readers too. Marc Lien, Halifax's director of innovation and digital development, said: 'Exploring innovative technology is a real focus for us at the bank. In the first-of-its-kind trials by a UK bank, Halifax asked staff and customers to use the wristband to login to their online accounts.

'We are in the very early stages of exploring potential uses for the Nymi Band and wearable technology more widely.' The bank - owned by Lloyds Banking Group - said the technology  only works when worn by the account owner and the band has to be paired with the device being used to access the account. Lloyds recently updated its online banking app with a similar feature that pairs and recognises the phone or tablet it is being used on. This removes the need to enter the username, password and memorable information every time. Instead the app just asks for the latter. The Nymi bracelet can be pre-ordered for $79 (£50). Devices were due to ship in December but the site has not updated when it will go on general sale.","Halifax has completed a successful trial of the tech using the Nymi band .

"From cute animals to Benedict Cumberbatch and even the Queen, it seems that virtually everyone has managed to get in on the photobombing craze. And now it seems even the spirits of the dead are making an appearance after two teenagers spotted what seems to be a ghostly girl in the background of a Snapchat selfie. Bethany Harvey, from Northern Ireland, took a picture of herself, her baby nephew and her sister to show friends, but later noticed what seemed to be a little girl's torso in the background. Closer inspection revealed what looked like a young girl wearing a purple dress sitting down with her hands folded neatly in her lap. Bethany Harvey, from Northern Ireland, captioned her Snapchat selfie 'photo bombed!' after her sister jumped into the background (left), but another ghostly figure also seems to have got in on the act (right) Miss Harvey told the Daily Mirror: 'I was taking a picture of my nephew and I, but my sister jumped into the background so I captioned the picture ""photo bombed!"" 'A friend of mine came to my house that night and pointed out what looks to be a woman with her hands folded on her knees in the background, baring in mind the picture was taken facing the living room door. 'Although we can't see the face of the figure the rest of it is as clear as day. There was nobody else in the living room at the time, except for the ghost girl in the purple dress.' She added that she is now terrified of going into her living room in the dark in case she catches another glimpse of the spectre. It is not the first time that a lost soul has apparently wandered into a Snapchat photograph. Kayley Atkinson, 23, and Victoria Greeves, 22, from Newcastle, were on a night out in the town centre when they decided to take a snap to send to friends. They were having drinks in the Slug and Lettuce on Quayside, which they said was virtually empty, when the image was captured. But when they looked closer at the image, they saw what appeared to be the tormented face of a ghostly woman dressed in Victorian clothing between their heads. Miss Greeves, who works as a nurse, said: ‘We took the picture in the bar as we usually would, we are both fans of a selfie. 'I uploaded the picture to Snapchat and thought nothing more of it. But later that night Kayley rang me in a panic and told me to have a closer look. 'She said there was a figure in the background, and I am quite sceptical about things like that so I just laughed at the time. Scroll down for video . Kayley Atkinson, 23, and Victoria Greeves, 22, from Newcastle, also appeared to have captured a picture of another lost soul while on a night out (pictured between their heads) Kim Davison and Jessie Lu, who were with their three children when they took the image, noticed the ghostly apparition in their photograph, before discovering a girl drowned in the swimming hole 100 years ago . ‘But when I looked back at the picture I could not believe what I was seeing. It is terrifying. 'I couldn't look at the picture at the beginning as I was too freaked out. It is so clear, and it looks like what can only be described as a Victorian woman, laughing behind us.’ Local authority worker Miss Atkinson added: ‘The bar was dead when we went in. It was only when I got home later on that I noticed the photo. 'I couldn't believe it. I was absolutely terrified and Victoria was so scared that she deleted the photo off her phone. A lot of people have said we must have photoshopped the picture. 'I can't blame them, but neither of us would even know how to do that. I didn't believe in ghosts at all before, but I'm not so sure any more.’ The image also comes just days after an Australian family apparently photographed the spirit of a young girl who drowned in a swimming hole while they were taking a dip there. Kim Davison and Jessie Lu say they were with their three children when they took the image, but another child can be seen in the centre of the picture. After the image attracted a lot of attention online the pair did some research and found that a young girl drowned in the same spot 100 years ago.","Bethany Harvey took image of herself, her baby nephew and her sister .

"Obese women have a 40 per cent higher risk of developing at least seven types of cancer in their lifetime . Obese women have a 40 per cent higher risk of developing at least seven types of cancer in their lifetime, according to research. These weight-related cancers include bowel, post-menopausal breast, gallbladder, womb, kidney, pancreatic and oesophageal types. Statistics released by Cancer Research UK show that obese women have around a one in four risk of developing a cancer linked to weight in their lifetime. In a group of 1,000 obese women, 274 will be diagnosed with a bodyweight-linked cancer in their lifetime, compared with 194 women diagnosed in a group of 1,000 healthy weight women. Approximately a quarter of women are classified as obese and it is estimated that 18,000 women develop cancer as a result of being overweight or obese each year. There are different ways that obesity could increase the risk of cancer. One possibility is that it is linked to the production of hormones by fat cells – especially oestrogen which is thought to fuel the disease. Around 12 per cent of postmenopausal breast cancers – a total of 5,269 women – are blamed on obesity. It is the highest number of cases linked to obesity because the cancer is so common. Last year a study found women were at double the risk of getting the disease because of their weight compared with men. Researchers said 8.2 per cent of all cancers in women in the UK were caused by being fat. The study found 4.4 per cent of all cancers in men were due to obesity. Previous estimates claimed if Britons continue to pile on the pounds, it will lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026. Dr Julie Sharp of Cancer Research UK said: 'Losing weight isn't easy, but you don't have to join a gym and run miles every day or give up your favourite food. Just making small changes that you can maintain in the long term can have a real impact. To get started, try getting off the bus a stop earlier and cutting down on fatty and sugary foods. A quarter of women are classified as obese and it is estimated that 18,000 women develop cancer as a result of being overweight or obese each year . 'Gradually build on these to achieve a healthier lifestyle that you can maintain. And find out about local services, which can provide help and support to make lifestyle changes. We know that our cancer risk depends on a combination of our genes, our environment and other aspects of our lives, many of which we can control – helping people understand how they can reduce their risk of developing cancer in the first place remains crucial in tackling the disease. 'Lifestyle changes – like not smoking, keeping a healthy weight, and cutting back on alcohol – are the big opportunities for us all to reduce our cancer risk. Making these changes is not a guarantee against cancer, but it stacks the odds in our favour.' Breast cancer patients can raise their chances of survival by exercising, a study has found. Tumours grew more slowly when mice being treated for cancer had an exercise wheel in their cage. It means that in future, breast cancer patients could be prescribed exercise as part of their treatment. As cancers grow, the blood vessels supplying them with oxygen become thin and tangled, making it harder for drugs to reach the tumour. But when US researchers from the Duke Cancer Institute in North Carolina let mice with breast cancer run on wheels, their bloody supply improved. Researcher Dr Mark Dewhirst said: 'We were truly amazed by these findings.' Macmillan Cancer Support has previously described exercise as a 'wonder drug'.","Obese women have a 40%  higher risk of developing seven cancers .

"Aimee Griffiths, 30, (pictured) told her two children to lie down and go to sleep as she started the blaze at their home in Ruabon, Wrexham . A mother-of-two set fire to the home she was being evicted from in a bid to kill herself and her two young children after hearing voices. Aimee Griffiths, 30, of Ruabon, Wrexham, told her two children to lie down and go to sleep as she started the blaze. But her 10-year-old daughter ran out of the house as the fire began to spread and raised the alarm. Heroically her neighbours - both in their sixties - were able to get Griffiths and her seven-year-old son out of the burning house despite Griffiths fighting to stay inside with the boy. She was 'grabbed by the scruff of her neck' and dragged out - and even then tried to get back in. Griffiths has now been jailed for five years and four months at Mold Crown Court after she admitted arson. Judge David Hale told her that what she did in the early hours of August 27 last year 'defied belief'. 'You were clearly intent on killing yourself and your two little children,' he said. 'You were on that day, without doubt, in mental turmoil.' The court heard she had been threatened with eviction and was not in a position to cope with a number of other pressures. The judge said: 'The fact remains that you intended to kill your children and yourself by setting fire to the house. 'If it were not for the tenacity of your daughter, determined to live, you may well have succeeded.' Judge Hale went on to praise the 'heroic intervention' of neighbours William and Eileen Bride. 'They are entitled to a most remarkable thanks from the community for what they did,' he said. The judge said that while on remand at Styal Prison in Cheshire Griffiths had made 'remarkable progress which was all credit to her'. The court heard Griffiths and her family had spent the previous afternoon playing bowls with her sister and friends. Griffiths set fire to the house with her family inside shortly after being told she was facing eviction . But she ended up fighting with her sister while drinking wine before buying another bottle to drink at home which culminated in her starting a number of fires in the early hours of the morning. John Philpotts, prosecuting, said Griffiths told the children to lie on the sofa and that 'everything would be all right'. But her brave daughter refused and ran out of the house to the house next door, the home of Mr and Mrs Bride. Mrs Bride, 62, tried to get into the house and shouted to Griffiths to come out, but Griffiths refused and demanded her daughter go back in. Mr Bride, 66, got into the burning house through the back door, braving thick black smoke to find Griffiths holding her son. The court heard she shouted at him to 'leave my kids alone' but he was able to grab the child and pulled her out of the house by the scruff of her neck. Judge Hale praised the 'heroic intervention' of neighbours William and Eileen Bride (pictured) Once outside, Griffiths had to be restrained from getting back in. The blaze caused £50,000 of damage to the semi-detached property. The court heard that a week earlier Griffiths had been referred to the psychiatric ward at Wrexham Maelor Hospital. Henry Hills, defending, said she had explained that voices were telling her to burn the house but she had been allowed home. He said it was a tragic case and Griffiths had an appalling childhood. DC Mark Griffiths of Wrexham CID said: 'The sentence reflects the seriousness of the incident. Had it not been for the swift actions of neighbours, the events of that night could have ended tragically. 'I'd like to thank members of the public who assisted both on the night and during the course of this investigation which was both complex and distressing.'","Aimee Griffiths, 30, told her children to go to sleep as she started the blaze .

"School friends of under-fire Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson now query whether the health guru invented stories 'to get sympathy' and warned people against vaccination while she was in high school. Ms Gibson, 23, is in the spotlight this week after doubts were raised about her remarkable cancer survival story - and the book, Apple Watch app and website that it inspired. There have also been questions about donations made to charity. The mother-of-one attended Wynnum State High School in Brisbane and former classmates describe the health guru as a 'drama queen' who constantly reinvented herself and backed medical cannabis. Scroll down for video . Young mum: Close friends told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday that Ms Gibson may have departed Australia for the United States this week . Former school friend Chris Green said Ms Gibson was 'a drama queen. There was always something going on with her.' 'At one stage she was an emo, then a skater girl then she was a surfer chick; she was always something different,' Mr Green told The Courier Mail. Mr Green also said that Ms Gibson never mentioned an autistic brother or a mother with multiple sclerosis, who she had previously claimed to be a carer for. One anonymous school friend said that Ms Gibson would often post information advocating against vaccinations and pushed the viewpoint quite hard. Former classmate Meg Weier said that Ms Gibson was quite strange. Doting mother: Ms Gibson, pictured left with her son Olivier, and right with another friend, founded the popular app and cookbook Whole Pantry . The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) is also a popular app, which costs $3.79 to download. The app is slated to appear on the new Apple Watch . Ms Gibson shot to stardom on social media and gave hope to cancer sufferers worldwide after she revealed that she had prolonged her life despite shunning conventional medical treatment and relying on her own 'whole life' concept. Now, however, friends close to the mum-of-one have said that she may have gone overseas to avoid confronting claims that her remarkable cancer survival story is not all it seems. Another former friend of Ms Gibson has called on her to 'come clean' on her 'misdiagnosis'. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims in various media stories this week, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. The Whole Pantry, a popular app, gained media attention because of Ms Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival . The company she founded, The Whole Pantry, said donations to charities that allegedly failed to arrive had been 'accounted for and not processed' and that promised donations 'would be honoured'. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia she was 'baffled' by this week's allegations and was most upset about the hope Ms Gibson's followers had invested in her program if she was being dishonest. She said Ms Gibson had the 'gift of the gab' and 'needs to answer to these people (her followers), because they are good hearted people who deserve answers'. 'I don't care about exposing Belle. I haven't spoken to her for months, years. 'I just want her to confirm or deny (her diagnoses) so people who put their faith in her, invested in her - they need to know. 'They need to know, if they've rejected conventional medicine on what she's saying. 'It's their lives, it's not a game.' Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want' After three years of sometimes personal exchanges online, Ms Gibson and Ms Smith stopped talking after the development of the Whole Pantry app. 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want. 'I don't want to see her beg people for mercy. I don't want her to beg for forgiveness - I just want the truth. 'Come clean, be transparent, let the world know where you're at. If you were misdiagnosed, own up to it. 'Belle DID create an exceptional application, that is loved by many, but I think she should sell it for what it is, complimentary medicines and a diet - not life saving treatment. 'All people want is the truth from her.' Close friends told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday that Ms Gibson may have left for the United States. Police visited her home on Tuesday night to check on her welfare, but she was not there. Multiple calls to Ms Gibson's mobile rang out. Amid claims that the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry app has fled to country, more details about Belle Gibson's past are coming to light. The young social media personality - who came under fire after claims her 'terminal cancer' and incredible survival story from the life-threatening illness were false - once described herself as a psychopath. Ms Gibson has previously gone under the name of Annabelle Natalie Gibson, and tweeted in 2009: @bellmneb: 'Is a distinguished physcopath (sic),' the Herald Sun reported. The next month she sent another tweet, from the account which appears to have been removed. 'Obama won the nobel peace prize. This is more f***ed then (sic) the government giving me cancer. #obamawinsnobelprize,' it read.","Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has come under fire this week after friends raised doubts about her cancer survival story and charity donations .

"They were among the first creatures to invade the land during one of the great evolutionary transitions in Earth's history. Now, scientists believe the first four-limbed vertebrates, known as tetrapods, that lived 360 million years ago may have been more like modern crocodiles than previously thought. They were able to reconstruct the skull of one of these animals in 3D from fragments of fossils that have been found in East Greenland. Scientists have reconstructed a 360 million-year old tetrapod's skull from bone fragments, to reveal it was similarly shaped to a modern day crocodile's. The top image shows the articulated cranium and lower jaws, in the middle the image shows the right facial skeleton in an 'exploded view' and the inside of the sutures and the bottom image shows the lower jaw also in an 'exploded' view. Individual bones are shown in different colours . Acanthostega gunnari lived between 380 and 360 million years ago when animals made the transition from the sea to land. Scientists are fascinated by the species because it is thought to be crucial to understanding the anatomy and ecology of the earliest tetrapods. However, after hundreds of millions of years buried in the ground, fossils are often damaged and deformed. They found that the reconstructed skull had a longer postorbital region and a more strongly hooked lower jaw than previously thought, making it relatively similar to modern crocodiles. A saltwater crocodile is shown . The evolution of hind legs began as enhanced fins, according to a study publsihed last year. Researchers discovered a well-preserved pelvis and a partial pelvic fin from a 375 million-year-old fossil of a transitional species, Tiktaalik roseae, between fish and the first legged animals. The find challenges the existing theory that large, mobile hind appendages were developed only after vertebrates transitioned to land. Corresponding author of the study Doctor Neil Shubin, of the University of Chicago, said: 'Previous theories, based on the best available data, propose that a shift occurred from ""front-wheel drive"" locomotion in fish to more of a ""four-wheel drive"" in tetrapods. 'But it looks like this shift actually began to happen in fish, not in limbed animals.' The fossil was discovered in 2004 and represents the he best-known transitional species between fish and land-dwelling tetrapods. A lobe-finned fish with a broad flat head and sharp teeth, Tiktaalik looked like a cross between a fish and a crocodile, growing up to a length of nine feet as it hunted in shallow freshwater environments. To reconstruct the skull of the species from numerous pieces, scientists from the University of Bristol put fossil specimens of Acanthostega gunnari from East Greenland into a CT scanner, before using a computer programme to assemble it. They found that the reconstructed skull had a longer postorbital region and a more strongly hooked lower jaw than previously thought, making it relatively similar to a modern crocodile's skull. The reconstruction has also provided some clues as to how the species fed. The size and distribution of the reptile's teeth and the shape of contacts between individual bones of the skull, called sutures, suggest Acanthostega may have initially seized prey at the front of its jaws using its large front teeth and lower jaw. The researchers plan to apply these methods to other flattened fossils of the earliest tetrapods to better understand how modifications to these early animals' bones and teeth helped them meet the challenges of living on land. 'Because early tetrapods skulls are often ""pancaked"" during the fossilization process, these animals are usually reconstructed having very flat heads,' said Dr Laura Porro, who led the study published in Plos One. 'Our new reconstruction suggests the skull of Acanthostega was taller and somewhat narrower than previously interpreted - more similar to the skull of a modern crocodile.'","Bristol University researchers scanned bones of Acanthostega gunnari .

"Photos of a naked, young woman at Spring Break, enclosed in a group of raucous male party-goers, has left authorities fearing for her safety amid wider concerns about the annual event. Police were searching for the woman who was stark naked wearing only sunglasses and colorful necklaces in images shared on social media on March 11. The Bay County Sheriff's Office in Florida have not been able to identify the girl and there was not enough background detail in the photographs to pinpoint her location. Sheriff Frank McKeithen told Daily Mail Online on Friday that the photos had been deeply concerning to law enforcement because of how young the girl looked, and their main priority was to find out if she was safe. Scroll down for video . Police in Bay County, Florida were searching for a young woman on Spring Break earlier this month who caused concern after being pictured naked wearing only sunglasses and strings of colorful beads while surrounded by men . 'She isn't in trouble,' Sheriff McKeithen said. 'We want to be proactive about her safety.' An investigation was underway into the photographs and how they ended up on social media, the sheriff confirmed. Bay County officials were alerted to the photos after they were posted to Twitter on March 11. In one of the pictures, the young woman was bent over and dancing naked at the water's edge on a beach in the Gulf of Mexico. The Bay County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) provided a breakdown of criminal activity between March 5 - 15 this year, with three weeks of Spring Break still to go: . In a separate shot, she appeared to be trying to cover her body while a group of men gathered around her. In another picture, the scene was more aggressive. The girl appeared to be trying to escape the frame but was surrounded by shirtless men. One of the men was grabbing the necklaces at her throat. Anyone with information has been asked to contact the Bay County Sheriff's Office at 850-747-4700 or Crime Stoppers at 850-785-TIPS (8477). Panama City Beach in Bay County is the country's top destination for students on Spring Break. Sheriff McKeithen told Daily Mail Online on Friday that his officers, along with the Panama City Beach Police, face an overwhelming wave of criminal activity during the five weeks of Spring Break, when their community swells from 12,000 people to an estimated 100-300,000. 'We have a mess here... this is not the traditional Spring Break of the past,' the sheriff said. 'The kids themselves are posting videos of them having sex on the beach and getting into fights.' He called Spring Break an 'emotional roller coaster' both for the students who end up victims of violence and sexual assault and for his officers, who work double shifts to cope with the influx. 'The majority of sexual assaults are not reported, because they feel shame, are embarrassed, have never likely been this intoxicated before and are far from home,' the police chief said. 'But our message is this - no matter how intoxicated you are, if you are violated, we take that very seriously.' Although the sheriff offered no exact figures on the cost of policing Spring Break, he said that the $150,000 given in assistance by the Tourist Development Council 'barely scratched the surface'. The crowd packed the beach during Spring Break festivities in Panama City Beach, Florida on March 12. Bay County authorities believe that the naked, young woman was on a beach somewhere in this area . Along with hundreds of thousands of drunk, college kids pouring into the town, there was also the dangerous elements that a group this large, with money to burn and wanting to experiment, attraced. 'Build it and they will come,' the sheriff said. Among 22 people arrested at a local bar this weekend in a narcotics sting, was a 39-year-old man from Nashville, Tennessee, who was selling the synthetic party drug, known as 'molly'. Heroin and prescription drugs have also been seized. Weapons were also a growing problem - arrests had uncovered a Glock and an AK-47 during Spring Break. McKeithen said earlier this week that the number of incidents so far this year showed the changes designed to tone down Spring Break haven't worked. These included a 2am closing time for alcohol sales. Sheriff McKeithen said: 'We can't ''police it'' away, that's not going to fix the problem. We are doing the best we can. At some point, someone has to decide whether this is what we want or don't want. 'I am trying to keep people and our officers safe.' If you know who this is email tips@dailymail.co.uk .

"Police in Vermont are desperate to speak to Robert Durst after he was linked to a teenage girl who went missing 44 years ago. College student Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, at a time when Durst owned a health food store in town called All Good Things. She was last seen standing at a bus stop opposite the store. Middlebury police chief Tom Hanley said at a press conference on Tuesday that Durst's name was first connected with the missing girl in 2012, following a tip from a member of the public about him owning the store but who was unaware of his link to Schulze. Investigators searched Durst's former property in the area last year but found 'nothing of interest in this case', the chief told a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. Scroll down for video . College student Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, at a time when Durst owned a health food store in town called All Good Things. She was last seen at a bus stop opposite the store after buying prunes inside . Robert Durst and his first wife, Kathleen McCormack in an undated picture. The couple lived in Vermont in the early seventies around the time a teenage girl vanished from the area. Kathleen Durst later went missing in 1982. She has never been found . On the day she vanished, Miss Schulze, who was a freshman at Middlebury College, was seen at 12.30pm across the street from Durst's store at a bus stop, eating prunes she had bought inside. She was trying to catch a bus to New York City on December 10, the case's lead detective Kristine Bowdish said on Tuesday, but it had already left. The teen returned to her nearby college dorm room at 12.45pm and remained there for ten minutes. At 1pm, her final exam began but she did not attend. At 2.15pm she was seen once again at the bus stop across from the health food store. She has not been seen since. Miss Schulze was last seen wearing blue jeans, a maroon sweater, parka and boots. She was 5'2', around 105lb and had severe acne at the time. All her possessions including her ID were left at her college room. She was not reported missing until December 16 when her parents, who lived in Simsbury, Connecticut, contacted police. Fellow students had not noticed she was missing for several days in the ebb and flow of the end of term. Middlebury Police Detective Kristine Bowdish points to a photograph of the building where Robert Durst owned the All Good Things health food store in the 1970s. The store is near where Middlebury College student Lynne Schulze, was spotted December 10, 1971, the day she was last seen . Her parents had asked that their daughter's disappearance be kept quiet for several weeks. It was finally made public on January 24, 1972. Durst, who owned the Middlebury health store for two years and lived in the area with wife Kathleen, was not questioned in 1971, police said on Tuesday. The original investigator in the case has been dead for 20 years. Police admitted there was no indication that Miss Schulze and Durst had ever met or interacted. However Chief Hanley said that Durst was 'a person who had a proximate connection with the missing person' and that they were cooperating with other agencies, including the FBI, for an opportunity to talk with the 71-year-old real estate scion. 'When it involves Robert Durst, it's a broad scope we have to deal with on this,' Hanley said. He added that police had been 'following the news...and trying to get as many memories going as possible'. The student's disappearance was classed as an open missing person case and a possible homicide. Chief Hanley said there was 'assumed wrongdoing'. The Schulze case had been reopened in 1992 after police received several leads but they came to nothing. Robert Durst (pictured left in a court sketch this week and right, leaving a hearing last week) is wanted for questioning by police in Middlebury, Vermont after being connected to a missing girl . The missing college student was the latest suspicious case to be linked to Durst who has also been dogged by questions about his first wife's disappearance in New York . It was not until 2012 that a citizen called Middlebury police and told them Durst had owned the store. Durst, is currently awaiting extradition to California to face a murder . charge for the 2000 execution-style killing of his friend Susan Berman, was denied bail on Monday in New Orleans. Durst, who recently featured in the HBO documentary 'The Jinx', must remain in Louisiana on weapons charges until his next court date on April 2, a judge ruled, finding him a likely flight risk and a potential danger to others. Middlebury police said the 2012 tip about Durst did not come from the producers of the HBO show. Both of Lynne Schulze's parents had passed away without ever knowing what happened to their daughter. Her brothers and sisters were 'very interested in the Robert Durst lead', police said. The family has also asked for privacy. Chief Hanley said: 'I've got an 18-year-old woman who disappeared, who didn't deserve to disappear. 'We've kept this case alive for many years and will continue until we bring resolution to her family.' Durst was being looked at in connection with five deaths or disappearances. Two women disappeared in California, his first wife vanished in New York, another woman went missing in Texas and now the latest, a teen college student in Vermont. Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, did not seek bail but argued . his client's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier . this month in New Orleans were improper, and that investigators . wrongly interviewed him without counsel present. Durst's attorneys want to expedite his extradition to Los . Angeles County, where he has been charged with the 2000 murder . of longtime friend Susan Berman and could face the death . penalty. The HBO documentary broadcast Durst being presented with . evidence his handwriting appeared to match that of Berman's . likely killer. The 71-year-old Durst's voice was subsequently captured on a . microphone saying that he had 'killed them all.' Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen . Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the . dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003. The final HBO episode aired one day after Durst's arrest at . a New Orleans hotel, where he was staying under an alias and had . over $42,000 in cash, a revolver, marijuana and a latex mask . that could fit over his neck and head with salt and pepper hair, authorities have said. FBI agents arrested Durst over fears he would flee the . country, the agency has said. Durst, long estranged from his powerful family with its . major New York real estate holdings, appeared in court on Monday . with his head shaved, revealing a long scar on the right side of . his head. He was being held in a prison psych ward in New Orleans where officials have deemed him a suicide risk. James O'Hern, an investigator for the local district . attorney's office, testified that authorities tracked Durst down . after he placed two calls from a phone at the hotel to the . voicemail on his personal phone. Also in his room was a scribbled tracking number for a . package that authorities later seized, which contained $117,000, . O'Hern said. Former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, . who reopened an investigation in 2000 into the disappearance of . Durst's wife, was also in court. Durst's attorney asked her to be removed from the courtroom . as a potential witness.

A constituent flagged up the blunder after realising the Labour MP had favourited a tweet  linked to an account described as 'an 18+ Erotic account for posting sexy pictures of sexy women'. The Rochdale MP does not follow the account, which features dozens of pornographic pictures of women. He says a glitch with his smartphone caused it to favourite the image and he was unaware of what had happened until Friday. The howler came after his selfie-Queen wife, Karen, was invited to host the UK Porn Awards, although she has apparently turned down the opportunity. Scroll down for video . Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk, pictured right, the husband of selfie-loving Karen, pictured left, was spotted favouriting hardcore porn on Twitter . He said: 'It's a fault with my iPhone and I'm getting it replaced. The screen starts flickering and jumping about and I've no idea how this happened.' The picture was initially posted on March 22. Two days later a Twitter user calling himself Neil NW-Hoopz tweeted next to the account: 'Have a look at what my MP @SimonDanczuk is favouriting on Twitter, #oops.' It's understood Mr Danczuk was out canvassing in Rochdale when the slip-up happened. MP, who has campaigned against child sexual exploitation, hit the headlines last week when he said in an interview in the New Statesman that Ed Miliband was considered more of a 'toff' by voters than David Cameron. The interview was brought up by Jeremy Paxman during Thursday's live TV debate with Mr Miliband and David Cameron. Mr Danczuk also clashed with controversial columnist Katie Hopkins on Twitter over race relations. Hopkins has criticised him for posting a picture of himself in Rochdale next to a Pakistani flag. A constituent in Rochdale flagged up the blunder by tweeting the MP, pictured above . She linked it to the child sex grooming scandal in the town, which led to jailing of a gang of Asian men for 77 years in 2012. But Mr Danczuk accused her of spreading 'vitriol' and of 'racist generalisation'. Mrs Dancuk, known as the Queen of the Selfies, is a former Rochdale councillor who announced she was stepping down earlier this year to pursue other career opportunities, including media work. She became known for posting a series of racy images of herself on Twitter and revealed in February she had been sexually abused as a child.","Labour MP Simon Danczuk favourited hard-core pornography on Twitter .

"An Illinois congressman already under intense scrutiny for spending $40,000 redecorating his office like Downton Abbey is embroiled in yet another controversy after it emerged he spent $10,000 of taxpayers' money to have his staff accompany him on a trip to New York. The spending habits of U.S. Republican Aaron Schock have been widely scrutinized after he used $40,000 in taxpayer funds to redecorate his Washington office in the style of the Downton Abbey television show. Now it has been claimed he spent $10,000 taking 10 staff members on a trip to New York to coincide with a U.S. visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Illinois Republican Aaron Schock (pictured) is embroiled in yet another spending controversy after it emerged he used $10,000 of taxpayers' funds to have 10 staffers accompany him on a trip to New York City . In the latest development, The Chicago Sun-Times reported that the Schock staffers did almost no government work there and House disbursement records show he received the $10,053 for 'travel subsistence' between September 26 and 29. The events with the Indian prime minister were September 27 and 28. And about 20 tickets to a Global Citizen Festival concert - where performers included Jay Z and Carrie Underwood - were purchased using $3,000 from a Schock campaign fund. Schock, at an event Monday in Chicago, told reporters the New York trip was official business and he was honored his staff could attend. Schock said about a dozen world leaders including President Barack Obama spoke. His spokesman has said that Schock wanted to play a 'constructive role' in Modi's visit to further economic ties between the U.S. and India. 'It was a very legitimate trip on official business,' he told reporters. 'I'm glad that I played such a significant role in it. And I'm honored that my staff was able to be there with me as well.' Schock would not address questions about why he took so many staff members. Other Illinois congressmen made the same trip but without staff members and some paid for the trip out of personal funds. Photos taken in January of Schock's new office in the Rayburn Office Building, which was designed to resemble the dining room of the TV show Downton Abbey . Schock's financial charges have been made public after organizations questioned what his expenses were going toward. He has spent thousands on concerts and car mileage reimbursements . Schock yesterday also defended his frequent Illinois travel as his way of reaching constituents. He noted that his central Illinois district is geographically expansive, including parts of Peoria, Bloomington and Springfield, and says he has fewer district offices than other congress members. 'Some people spend more on direct mail pieces that they send out,' he told reporters. 'I spend more to get around my district.' Last month the Associated Press identified at least a dozen flights worth more than $40,000 on aircraft belonging to Schock's donors since mid-2011. Beyond air travel, Schock spent thousands more on tickets for concerts, car mileage reimbursements - among the highest in Congress. Other official expenses that have been made by Schock include taking interns to a sold-out Katy Perry show last year and a Bears game. Schock has said that he's hired a firm to review his spending. He's reimbursed the government $40,000 for the office decorations and $1,200 for the Bears game flight. Schock also used official expenses to attend a Chicago Bears game (pictured) last year. He later reimbursed the government $1,200 for the trip .","Aaron Schock under intense scrutiny for lavish spending of taxpayer funds .

"Paul Gascoigne told the High Court today that phone-hacking was linked to his alcoholism. The 47-year-old former footballer gave evidence at the hearing in London to determine what compensation should be paid by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) in eight representative cases. Mr Gascoigne, who has fought a well-documented battle with alcoholism since quitting the sport,  told senior judge Mr Justice Mann that he was 'fuming' that his privacy had been invaded. Scroll down for video . Paul Gascoigne gave evidence at a compensation hearing against Mirror Group Newspapers today. He was supported by former Tottenham Hotspur captain Gary Mabbutt (right) Dressed in a dark  suit and pink-and-white striped shirt, the former England midfielder, who arrived at court supported by former Tottenham captain Gary Mabbutt, said he had changed his mobile because he knew there was something going on with it. His voice hoarse and shaking with emotion, he said: 'I knew I was getting hacked by the Mirror. This continued for ages. 'Phone calls to my father and family were getting blocked so I changed my mobile. It happened again so I kept on changing mobiles, five or six times a month.' Questioned by lawyer David Sherborne, who has said hacking was rife at all three of the group's national titles by mid-1999, he said that the experience of being hacked was 'scary'. Mr Gascoigne, who is complaining about 18 articles, all of which are accepted to have been the product of illegal activity, said: 'I couldn't speak to anybody, I was scared to speak to anybody... my parents, my family and kids, it was just horrendous. 'And people can't understand why I became an alcoholic.' He added: 'At the time I was going through a bad time because I knew I was getting hacked, 110%. Of course (people) wouldn't believe it - my family and Mr McKeown (therapist Johnny McKeown). 'As I was speaking to him on the phone, it clicked again. He told me I was paranoid, I was going through a mental disorder. 'I said 'No, there's f***-all wrong with me'. I knew, I knew. I put the phone down... I've never told a lie, nothing to lie about, nothing.' The former footballer (pictured, centre left, with his lawyers) said phone hacking had partly led him to drink . Gascoigne, pictured in a court sketch, said he was 'disgusted' after being told he'd not be cross-examined . After speaking briefly, Mr Gascoigne was told he would not face cross-examination by Matthew Nicklin QC, for MGN. He replied: 'I have waited 15 years to be sat here so I am disgusted, really. 'I would like to trade my mobile phone in for a coffin because these guys have ruined my life. I have no life, they've left me in a state.' He said that, in early 2006, his suspicions caused him to spend £80,000 on counter-surveillance equipment. Gascoigne said that he blamed his family for what he thought were leaks and did not speak to them for almost two years - refusing to go for Christmas with them - because he thought they had betrayed him. 'It is very sad to me that a lot of damage has already been done to my family that cannot easily be fixed. My apologising to them now cannot turn back the clock for things I have said to them, and the hurt that this has caused.' He said the stories caused  serious rows with his former wife, Sheryl, as every time she visited The Priory, the press and photographers were there. 'I do not believe for one moment that Sheryl would have told the press about my going into treatment because it was so important to both of us and our families that I got better,' he told the court. Gascoigne felt as if his life was falling apart while was playing at Everton (left) and said phone hacking affected his relationship with his ex-wife Sheryl and stepdaughter Bianca (pictured together, right) He also fell out with his life-long friend, James 'Jimmy Five Bellies' Gardner. 'I now believe that I was totally wrong to blame Jimmy and that he has in fact been an incredibly loyal friend to me over the years.' After he was not cross-examined in court, Gascoigne said: 'They bottled it,' as he left the building. In a written statement supplied to the court, Gascoigne said that his fame had brought many benefits but also caused him much heartache as he had struggled to come to terms with the end of his playing career. Constant media pressure made it very difficult for him to lead a normal life and had led to his family not being as close as they once were. He said he suffered from alcohol dependency and also had treatment for drug use and addiction to the drink Red Bull. His statement said: 'I have suffered from mental illness, including paranoia, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. I am bipolar and I have an addictive personality.' He said the period between 2000 and 2006 was very difficult, and he wrongly accused people close to him, such as his stepdaughter Bianca, of going to the newspapers with stories about him. 'I became obsessed about being monitored. I felt that I was being watched or listened into all the time for years and the pressure on me because of that was more than I think any sane person could bear.' Details of eight representative phone hacking cases are being heard at the Royal Courts of Justice . He said that, while he was at Everton in October 2000, he felt as if his life was falling apart and went to stay at the Priory rehab clininc as he needed to get help quickly. 'The main reason why I had to go to get help at the Priory on this occasion was the constant pressure from the media, including articles and threats of articles being published by journalists. 'I was also convinced that my phone was being tapped to get stories about me that very few people knew about. I felt very paranoid at that time about being pursued by the media.' The other cases involved in the litigation are those of actress Lucy Taggart, TV executive Alan Yentob, actress Sadie Frost, soap stars Shobna Gulati and Shane Richie, flight attendant Lauren Alcorn and TV producer Robert Ashworth.

"The 9/11 Museum has won a top entertainment award alongside the Wizarding World of Harry Potter during a ceremony in Disneyland - angering victim's families who claim officials have made Ground Zero a theme park, not a shrine. The Themed Entertainment Association honored the $700 million National September 11 Memorial & Museum with an award for 'Extraordinary Cultural Achievement', leaving relatives complaining it was more concerned with profit than the memory of their loved ones. The black-tie award ceremony was held in the Grand Ballroom at the Disneyland Hotel on Saturday and cost $520 to attend for non-members. A shrine: Families of those who died during 9/11 have said it is deeply inappropriate for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum to accept an award for 'entertainment' 'It's totally outrageous that they would participate in this,' said Jim Riches, a retired firefighter who lost his son, Jimmy on September 11. Speaking to the New York Daily News, Riches said, 'It's a moneymaking place for entertainment and they got an award for it. They've made it into an amusement park.' Furious, Riches said that Ground Zero is a place where almost 3,000 people died, not a theme park ride. 'I don't think they should have sent somebody there to accept an award for a cemetery,' Riches told CBS2's Alice Gainer. 'It's supposed to be a place that's dignified and respectful where our loved ones are to be buried. It's not the Metropolitan Museum.' Deep emotions: Two people embrace during the opening ceremony of the National September 11 Memorial in May of 2014 . Deep significance: United States President Barack Obama speaks at the dedication ceremony for the National 9/11 Memorial Museum . Sacrifice of heroes: Destroyed Ladder Truck of FDNY Ladder Co. 3 is one of many exhibits on display at the 9/11 Museum . Honor Guards comprised of members of FDNY, NYPD, and PAPD entering the stage during the opening ceremony of the 9/11 Museum last year . Before the announcement the 9/11 Museum revealed it had welcomed two million visitors since opening last May, most of whom are charged $24 to view exhibits detailing the attack and the aftermath - culminating in the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. 'The 9/11 Museum won this award alongside a Harry Potter theme park. It's time for professionals like the National Park Service to bring dignity and respect to the World Trade Center museum and get rid of the high-salaried stuffed suits who are disrespecting the dead heroes and victims at Ground Zero,' said retired NYPD Sgt. Al Regenhard in a statement to the New York Daily News. Al and his wife Sally said that they were deeply disappointed by the 9/11 Museum and want it to stop storing victim's unidentified body parts there if they want to go to California to accept entertainment awards. 'What more evidence do the grieving 9/11 families need that their loved one's precious remains are being desecrated in a freak show at Ground Zero?' they said in their statement. 'This award just shows the 9/11 Museum heads have a moral compass that points to money rather than ethics.' Closure: This uniform shirt was worn by the Navy SEAL Team 6 member who killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May, 2011,  and is on display at the museum . Theme park: This is the permanently snow-capped Hogsmeade Village at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter which won the top award at the Disneyland ceremony . The museum was honored for its international impact in raising awareness for the tragic events of 9/11. 'The award recognizes the museum for extraordinary cultural achievement, and it is an honor to continue to be acknowledged around the world as an institution having a global impact,' the museum said in a statement. The 9/11 Museum emphasized that they accepted no money for the award, but this is just the latest controversy the embattled exhibition has encountered. When it opened in May, many were angered by a gift shop which sells coffee mugs and T-shirts, all themed around September 11. Indeed, when asked, visitors to the site on Monday said they did not think the museum should have accepted the award. 'If it offends families who have victims from 9/11 then they shouldn't accept the award,' said Sam Allen of Colorado to CBS.","National September 11 Memorial & Museum won an award for 'Extraordinary Cultural Achievement'

"Looking at someone who is overweight or obese can alter our sense of smell to make the scent of the world around us appear less pleasant, scientists have found. Researchers discovered viewing images of fat people caused participants in a study to rate odour samples as smelling worse - even though they were actually fragrance free. The scientists believe the effect may be caused by inbuilt negative bias that many people have towards those who are overweight and obese. Does looking at this image of an obese man on a bench conjure up a foul odour? You may have an inbuilt prejudice if it does, according to a new study by scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles . Surprisingly they also found that those who had a higher BMI themselves tended to give the scent samples a lower rating. This suggests that people who have their own weight problems are perhaps also the harshest critics of others who are fat. Sit ups help tone your stomach, while squats strengthen your legs and bottom - but love handles are particularly difficult to shift. Now scientists believe they have discovered a way to ‘melt’ the excess white fat in muffin tops by turning it ‘brown’. While white cells are responsible for muffin tops and flab in general, brown fat cells convert excess energy in food into heat. To make white cells behave like brown ones, researchers at the University of Bonn discovered a new signalling pathway. By experimenting on mice, Professor Alexander Pfeifer from the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University Hospital Bonn discovered a new signalling pathway for a molecule called adenosine. Adenosine is known to activate brown fat cells, and is typically released during stress. The adenosine signal is transmitted by the adenosine receptor A2A. If adenosine binds to this receptor in brown fat cells, fat burning is significantly stimulated. The researchers transferred A2A receptors from brown fat cells to white fat cells in mice and found they started to burn more fat. Dr Ayako Tomiyama, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said: 'You wouldn’t think that not liking someone’s weight could then be seen in a totally different sensory modality. 'It makes us think how else is weight stigma affecting our lives that we don’t even know about? 'This is the first step in proving that the consequences of weight stigma could be very widespread in ways that we don’t even know.' The researchers conducted two studies by showing participants two sets of images of people who were either overweight or normal weight. As they viewed each image, participants were asked to smell a container of lotion tinted with different food colourings and rate the scent. Each container was actually fragrance free and contained the same lotion. The researchers, whose work is published in the International Journal of Obesity, found that when images of overweight or obese people were displayed on the screen, participants gave worse ratings to the scent samples. Images of average sized or thin people produced ratings deemed as more pleasant. Writing in the journal, the researchers, who are also presenting their results at this week's American Psychosomatic Society, said: 'The results showed that the substances were perceived to smell worse when they were paired with images of heavy individuals than when they were paired with images of thin individuals. The researchers say that subconscious disgust at obesity may be manifesting itself in people's sense of smell . 'The effect was most strongly manifested by participants with higher BMIs' The researchers claim the results could be a subconscious signal of disgust. Previous research has shown that there is a connection between feelings of disgust and the perception of foul odours. It could also be associated with widespread assumptions that people who are overweight have problems with body odour. Stigma in society against fat people can be  a barrier to them changing their lifestyle, according to scientists . Angela Incollingo Rodriguez said that while some people are overtly biased against people who are overweight, others may not be aware that they harbour negative feelings. She said that bias within society may actually be making weight problems for those who are obese worse. In the UK around 62 per cent of  adults are now considered to be overweight or obese while in the US 35 per cent of adults are clinically obese. A previous study by the same team in 2014 showed that girls who were called 'fat' by the age of 10 had a higher chance of being over weight by the time they turned 19 years old. Miss Rodriguez said: 'It undermines people’s motivation to diet and exercise. 'If anything, stigma is a barrier to these lifestyle changes that people commonly use to lose weight. 'By being aware of our deep-seated attitudes regarding weight, we can begin to change our behavior.'","Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles conducted the study .

"Two of Britain’s most distinguished actors are set to star in a £6million film ‘co-written’ by a leading figure of the Jihadi John apologist campaign group, Cage. Sir Ben Kingsley and Emily Watson will be working alongside an award-winning team in ‘The Secret Evidence’. Golden Globe-winning producer J Todd Harris is said to already be on board, and the film has commitments from Emily Watson, Sir Ben and Lily Collins. Scroll down for video . Actors Sir Ben Kingsley and Emily Watson are among stars to have signed up to the film that has been reportedly co-written by the Cage spokesman . Last night The Mail was unable to contact representatives of the stars, who are believed to have made the commitment to the movie long before the controversy surrounding Cage. The film, which is supported by civil rights group Liberty, is thought to have been co-written by former terror suspect and Cage spokesman Cerie Bullivant. He spent two years under a control order before eventually being exonerated, and the film is believed to be loosely based on his own experiences. But Mr Bullivant’s involvement became an embarrassment for the movie after the unmasking of Mohammed Emwazi as Jihadi John. Last month Cage sparked outrage by defending the London-raised fanatic unmasked as the Islamic State butcher. The group described Emwazi as a ‘beautiful and gentle’ man who was driven to radicalisation by MI5. Promotion: The leaflet for the film showing Miss Watson, Saoirse Ronan and Sir Ben Kingsley . And Mr Bullivant railed for eight minutes about the treatment he had received at the hands of the security services ‘in very similar circumstances’ to those of Emwazi, suggesting it was the MI5’s actions which had led to the brutal killer’s radicalisation. The former mental health nurse also claimed UK security forces harassed Emwazi to the point where he had ‘no options and position within UK society anymore’ in an official video for Cage. He even went as far as suggesting an alleged assault on Emwazi by the police in 2010 could be directly linked to the beheadings. Speaking to the Islam Channel earlier this month, the 32-year-old said: ‘He was looking to get married, get a good job and settle down. ‘If that had happened, if our security forces had not had stopped him, would he be cutting off heads now?’ He added: ‘We have a two year picture of a man constantly…trying to move his life forward and we see a pattern of security services stopping that. ‘We even see a pattern of the police pinning him up against the wall and strangling him. This is a chilling simile when you look at what he ended up doing to other people.’ Cerie Bullivant is a former terror suspect and spokesman for the group Cage . Bullivant was in the spotlight again earlier this month when he stormed off in the middle of a live Sky news interview claiming a question on about his feelings on the beheadings was racist. Now the filmmakers behind ‘The Secret Evidence’ appear to be trying to distance themselves from Bullivant – perhaps fearing that the link with him could damage their chances of securing the £1million still required to begin production this year. The Mail has seen a document, which was presented to potential investors as recently as last summer, clearly stating that the film was ‘co-written by Cerie Bullivant’. And an invitation to a high-profile event due to be held at the Chiltern Firehouse restaurant in London tonight to attract potential investors – which was sent out earlier this month – said: ‘It was co-written by Cerie Bullivant, who was wrongly sent to Belmarsh at 23.’ However, the next day the same invitation was sent out again – but with the line mentioning Cerie Bullivant deleted. The film’s award-winning director Nicholas Racz admitted that the invite to tonight’s event was edited. He said: ‘Cerie generously said there was no reason for him to be mentioned. It was an association that wasn’t helpful to the movie.’ He added: ‘Cerie’s involvement was some five years ago where he was involved as a co-writer. This was before his involvement with Cage and the movie is not based on his life. ‘He has contributed to the script, absolutely, and he will still be paid for that if the film is made but it won’t be a significant amount of money.’ And Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti, who is helping to host the film’s fundraising event tonight, admitted Bullivant had ‘some involvement’ in the film. She explained: ‘My understanding is that Cerie Bullivant is one of a number of stories that inspired this film.’ However she went on to say: ‘Whatever you may think of Cerie Bullivant, he did suffer a miscarriage of justice many years ago, and there will continue to be many more miscarriages of justice if we continue down this path. ‘Fiction is more powerful than anything and I really hope this is a great inspiring film exposing secret courts and secret justice.’ Bullivant described ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi as a 'beautiful man' after his identity was revealed .","Sir Ben Kingsley and Emily Watson among stars due to work on the film .

"A force field that can protect vehicles from the destructive blastwaves thrown out by explosions has been development by aircraft manufacturer Boeing. The company has been granted a patent for a device that appears to work like the fictional shields seen in science fiction movies like Star Wars and Star Trek. The system works by using an 'arc generator' to rapidly heat the air in front of a shockwave creating a cloud of electrically charged gas. Scroll down for video . Boeings patent proposes creating an arc of plasma in front of vehicles, like that shown in the diagram above, that can defect and absorb the energy shockwaves from explosions, helping to reduce the damage they cause . This, Boeing says, creates a buffer that can refract, deflect and absorb the energy contained within the shockwave. They say the device could be mounted on vehicles such as tanks and armoured personnel carriers, buildings, aircraft, ships and submarines. British military scientists have been working on a new type of armour designed to repel incoming fire from vehicles. The armour, developed by researchers at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) would use pulses of electrical energy to defelct rockets, shrapnel and other ammunition that might damage a vehicle. Engineers behind the techology claim it is possible to incorporate supercapacitors into the body of a tank or armoured personnell carrier to turn it into a kind of giant battery. When incoming fire is detected, the energy stored in the supercapacitor can be rapidly dumped onto the metal plating on the outside of the vehicle, producing a strong electromagnetic field that creates a momentary forecfield capable of repelling incoming metal. If timed correctly, the scientists behind the technology say it could help to prevent rocket propelled grenades and shells that detonate on impact from reaching their target. They claim the device could work both in the air and underwater, helping to protect assets from rockets, landmines, torpedoes and Improvised Explosive Devices. Writing in the patent, Boeing said: 'The majority of the damage caused by explosive devices results from shrapnel and shockwaves. 'Damage from shrapnel may be prevented by, for example, physical barriers. 'Shockwaves are travelling discontinuities in pressure, temperature, density and other physical qualities through a medium such as the ambient atmosphere. 'Shockwave damage is more difficult to prevent because shockwaves can traverse an intermediate medium including physical barriers. 'Damage from shockwaves may be lessened or prevented by interposing an attenuating material between the shockwave source and the object to be protected.' Blastwaves thrown out from explosions often cause more widespread damage than the immediate blast area, often structural damage to vehicles and buildings. The high pressures and temperatures created by shockwaves can also cause secondary explosions. Recent research has also shown that blastwaves can cause devastating internal injuries to soldiers, particularly when in the enclosed space of a vehicle. Boeing's patent proposes using lasers (shown above) or microwaves to create plasma to slow the shockwave . Boeing's patent proposes using sensors that can detect the light or other electromagentic radiation - such as microwaves or infrared light - thrown out by explosion. This would then trigger an 'arc generator' to produce a temporary force field between the vehicle or building and the advancing shockwave. It says this could be created using lasers or microwaves to rapidly heat the air in front of the vehicle to produce an area of electrically charged gas, or plasma. This change in medium would interfere with the oncoming shockwave and help to deflect its force from hitting the vehicle, says Boeing. It also claims that the arc generator could create a powerful electric current within just a few milliseconds to create an electric art through the air. This graphic shows how lasers could be used to create a plasma shied protect a vehicle from a shockwave . The USS Enterprise in Star Trek (pictured)used a force field to help protect it from torpedos and phaser blasts . Spacecraft, vehicles and even individual robots in the Star Wars films (pictured) had their own shields . This would heat the gas and change its density to interfere with the path of the shockwave. Boeing also proposes that the arc generator could be a gun that fires multiple pellets on converging paths, leaving a trail of ions in their wake like tracer bullets. These would form conductive channels through the air through which a voltage could be traced. It also says the arc generator could also fire projectiles training conductive wires that would also heat the air to create a medium that would remove energy from the shockwave. The patent said: 'When the shockwave created by an explosion reaches the arc, the shockwave deforms the arc in directions perpendicular to the conductive channels. This diagram shows how a arc generator could be mounted onto the side of a vehicle to protect it from a blast . 'Specifically the shockwave pushes the ionised air created by or making up the arc inward and the current tends to flow where the air is ionised. 'This movement by the shockwave may do mechanical work against the magentic field force and remove energy from the shockwave making it weaker.' It also says that by forming the shield in the shape of a convex lens, it can deflect the energy from the shockwave. As the density of the charged air in the forcefield is different from the surrounding air it would also cause the shockwave to be refracted.","Boeing granted patent for device to shields vehicles against shockwaves .

"Ian Lam, 42, plunged to his death after falling from the top of a car park in Telford on Saturday . A suicidal man who died after he was goaded to 'jump' from a multi-storey car park has been described as a 'caring and loving young man' by his family. Ian Lam, 42, plunged 60ft to his death on Saturday from the top of the car park outside Southwater Shopping Centre in Telford, Shropshire, as more than 30 people filmed the drama on their phones. Witnesses described hearing some of the onlookers shouting 'get on with it', 'go on, jump' and even 'how far can you bounce?'. Their actions were condemned by police who said that those who took the offensive photographs and posted footage of his death on social media could face prosecution. His family said through a statement: 'The wife, family and friends of the man who was involved in a tragic incident in Telford Town Centre on Saturday would like to express their deep sorrow and overwhelming feeling of loss of such a kind, caring and loving man. 'This has been an extremely traumatic time for all of them and I would also ask that their privacy be respected.' Detective Inspector William Scott, from West Mercia Police, said: 'Our thoughts are with Mr Lam's family and friends at this very difficult time. 'This has been an extremely traumatic time for all of them and I would also ask that their privacy be respected.' Officers were called to the scene outside the busy shopping centre at around 1pm but despite attempts by specialist negotiators, but he fell from the ledge two hours later. A man of 57 who was in a building opposite said: 'I saw a crowd of people of all ages, some with small children, gathered outside watching this poor man. Many were taking pictures.' The onlooker, who did not want to be named, said the man had waited on the ledge for more than two hours while a crowd of around 30 gathered below. He said that, although police had cordoned off the scene, some of the mob ducked under the tape to see more. 'I just felt for the guy,' the witness said. 'I can't imagine what frame of mind he could be in to want to do this. As for those who did take pictures and posted them – they should be ashamed.' A jeering mob encouraged Mr Lam to 'get on with it and jump' before he plunged to his death from a car park in Telford, Shropshire (above) Another witness, Kelly-Anne Taylor, 35, said: 'People were recording it with their phones and yelling at him to jump. 'I can't stop thinking about it. I could have tried to help him. I am so heartbroken for him and his family. Onlookers were yelling at him to jump.' Others took to social media to tell of their disgust. One woman wrote: 'The fact people were shouting for the man to jump from that building in Southwater and filming it make me worry for our generation. Scum.' The force said it was analysing an image posted on social media and that it would take 'appropriate action' if it established a criminal offence had been committed. In a statement, the force added: 'As is normal following an incident such as this, where a person has contact with police prior to their death (in this case police officers and negotiators who reasoned with him prior to the fall) this case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). 'The IPCC has confirmed that they will not investigate this incident and they are satisfied that the force's Professional Standards Department carry out a review.' West Mercia Police has hit out at the 'appalling' actions of the crowd who gathered outside Southwater Shopping Centre in Telford (pictured), and said anyone who chanted should be 'unequivocally condemned' Following the incident Inspector Ben Smith, from the force's operational control centre, had condemned the sickening comments hurled at the vulnerable victim. He said: 'Obviously we would certainly not be supportive of that kind of behaviour. 'It is pretty appalling because it is someone who is clearly in need of support and assistance. That behaviour is something we would condemn. 'Clearly what that individual needed was time and space and a professional to help them out. 'The individual would have been in need of care and support and appropriate intervention from medical professionals, so anything like that to encourage someone to jump should be unequivocally condemned.' A petition has been launched on campaigning website Change.org calling for those who 'encouraged' the victim to be arrested. In just five hours it gathered more than 1,000 signatures. Friends of the man took to the website to voice their disgust. Jacqueline Hickman wrote: 'This man was a friend, a lovely warm, caring man. The people who goaded him are despicable. They all deserve to be arrested.' Rebecca Hadley said: 'I am appalled with the behaviour of the Telford people and worked closely with the poor man who took his life.'

"A woman thought the handwritten letter she threw over the fence to her noisy neighbours had worked wonders after an entire week of uninterrupted sleep until she was woken before dawn on Sunday. Sleep-deprived Melbourne based-actor, Lucy Gransbury, wrote a two-page rant to her party-hard residents after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways. Also a comedian, the good-humoured note had paid off until the recent early morning hiccup but she decided the neighbourly thing to do was drop a thank-you card and some gifts over the fence to the 'huge' seven or eight guys because she was too scared to knock on their door. Scroll down for video . Lucy Gransbury dropped a thank you letter and gifts over the fence to her neighbours because she was too scared to knock on their door . The good-humoured letter asks the seven or eight burly blokes not to throw a hand grenade over her fence . Although the neighbours woke her at 4.30am when they arrived home, and again at 6.45am when their mates left, Gransbury decided after writing a list of pros and cons that the mostly-reformed dudes, who she fears could crush her 'between their shoulder blades' as 'they seem to be a gang', deserved to be rewarded. The note, which was posted on her blog and on the Mamamia site, began with thanking the less-noisy neighbours for a quieter week and although their voices woke her on Sunday she was grateful there wasn't the 'bass guitar song' interrupting her dreams about Prince Harry. 'You probably think I'm a bit weird and have too much spare time, and you are entirely correct.' The gifts included: . A burnt DVD of the pilot episode of Neighbours where Max Ramsay breaks up a party on his namesake street by 'yelling at the flamin' lot of them'. She then later reveals that the DVD is in fact blank and suggests they watch the scene on YouTube. Two chickpea cans with a piece of string so she can create her 'own old-school walkie-talkie' with them while adding that they must detach the string if they are having a party - not to mention remove the chickpeas for a more effective communciation device. And in good neighbourly fashion - specifically chose chickpeas in case the burly blokes wanted to whip up some hummus for their next party. Last but certainly not least - Gransbury threw in some salt and vinegar chips because she wanted to share her favourite things with her dear neighbours. She signed off by saying she hoped they got a giggle out of her note instead of being insulted and throwing a hand grenade over her fence. One of the gifts was two cans and string so they could she can create her 'own old-school walkie-talkie' with her neighbours - and she chose chickpeas so they could also whip up some hummus for their next party . After she was woken by their voices on Sunday morning, she wrote pros and cons about the incident - Derpa is in reference to the man she used to regularly hear who sounded like he was constantly yelling 'derpa"" Gransbury even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the first lengthy and hilarious handwritten letter over their adjoining back fence before running off in hysterics. She posted the letter on her blog with the precursor: 'So if you never hear from me again, I've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours' sound system.' Gransbury chose to replace the expletives she had the strong urge to use with the more polite neighbourly word of 'funk' in her letter that was also published on Mamamia website. 'Dear Noisy Neighbours, . 'There are some choice swear words I would like to throw at you, but in the interest of being neighbourly, I'm going to replace them all with the word 'funk'. 'Please turn your funking music down so I can get some funking sleep,' the letter opened with. Lucy Gransbury wrote a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways . The actor/comedian used her humour in the two-page rant to get her rage across to the party-hard residents who live next door and cause her never-ending grief . Gransbury even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics . She then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them 'all the funking time'. Adding that the night before she wrote the letter when was woken at 4.30am was an uncivilised time that should only be reserved for 'breakfast radio hosts, international flight passengers, and parents of infants.' Gransbury said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but wouldn't have been heard over the revving of their friend's engine of their 'sh*thouse fancy ute.' 'They were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty, that I am worried that the man behind the wheel was: A) drink driving B) not sure how to drive C) brain damaged D) actually a potato.' She signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left' Her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar 'over and funking over.' 'I'm not sure if it's you, or perhaps a friend, but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling 'derpa, derpa, derpa, derpa' at the top of his lungs. Is he okay?' she asked sarcastically. She expressed concern that this man is either not sure how to be human, brain damaged or simply a moron. The music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before Gransbury had to go out and begin her day. 'Everyone in my street probably feels the same. And the street behind us. And the deaf man in the next suburb. And anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away.' She also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs . Gransbury said she bought this card because 'Shut The F**k Up' was not available in a large size . As the considerate neighbour, Gransbury gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with the apt songs: Respect by Aretha Franklin, 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, 'All About The Bass' by Meghan Trainor, 'Stop Right Now' by The Spice Girls and Uptown Funk' by Bruno Mars 'because it's just a funkin' good song, really'. But she later revealed in the note that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs. After suggesting to catch up over a G&T sometime, she asked them to 'Grow up. Get some funking manners. And Go. The Funk. To Sleep.' Gransbury also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time. The exhausted performer signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left'.

"It may be handy for killing vampires, but garlic can keep humans alive in more ways than one, researchers have found. They say a nutrient in garlic offers the brain protection against ageing and disease. It could even prevent age-related neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Scroll down for video . Missouri researchers say a nutrient in garlic offers the brain protection against ageing and disease - and could even prevent use from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The University of Missouri researchers found a carbohydrate in the superfood is key. 'Garlic is one of the most widely consumed dietary supplements,' said Zezong Gu, associate professor of pathology and anatomical sciences at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. 'Most people think of it as a 'superfood,' because garlic's sulfur-containing compounds are known as an excellent source of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protection. A thousand year-old potion made out of onions, garlic, wine and bile from a cow's stomach can kill hospital superbugs, scientists claim. The potent 10th century brew - used by Anglo Saxons to treat a stye (an abscess on the eyelid) destroyed 90 per cent of the bacteria on scraps of skin taken from mice with MRSA. Interestingly, the ingredients had little effect unless they were all brought together into the concoction, the study by Nottingham University researchers found. 'Scientists are still discovering different ways garlic benefits the human body,' he said. 'Our research focused on a carbohydrate derivative of garlic known as FruArg and the role this nutrient plays in protective responses.' Gu's team looked at the nutrient's ability to inhibit ― and even possibly reverse ― brain cell damage caused by environmental stress. Environmental stress could include the aging process, smoking, pollution, traumatic brain injury or excessive alcohol consumption. 'Microglia are immune cells in the brain and spinal cord that are the first and main line of defense in the central nervous system,' Gu said. 'Unlike other mature brain cells that seldom regenerate themselves, microglial cells respond to inflammation and environmental stresses by multiplying. 'By massing themselves and migrating toward an injury site, they are able to respond to inflammation and protect other brain cells from destruction.' However, increasing the number of microglial cells won't provide age-defying protection for the brain, Gu said. In fact, it can do more harm than good. 'Although important to brain cell health, microglial cells also produce nitric oxide in reaction to their function as protectors,' Gu said. 'If we simply increased the number of microglial cells, we also would increase the amount of nitric oxide in the brain. 'Excessive production of nitric oxide leads to brain cell damage and promotes neurodegenerative diseases such as cerebral ischemia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. However, the nutrient FruArg may provide an answer to this reactive dilemma. Gu's team looked at the nutrient's ability to inhibit ― and even possibly reverse ― brain cell damage caused by environmental stress. By creating a cell model of neurological stress and monitoring microglial cell function, Gu's team was able to study FruArg's contribution to brain health. 'When stress was applied to the model, there was an expected increase in microglial cells and their byproduct, nitric oxide,' Gu said. 'However, once we applied FruArg, the microglial cells adapted to the stress by reducing the amount of nitric oxide they produced. 'Additionally, FruArg promoted the production of antioxidants, which offered protective and healing benefits to other brain cells. 'This helps us understand how garlic benefits the brain by making it more resilient to the stress and inflammation associated with neurological diseases and aging.' In the future, Gu and his colleagues hope to study the effects of FruArg on other cells in the body associated with conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer.","Nutrient in garlic offers the brain protection against ageing and disease .

"Sometimes the simple things in life can bring the most pleasure, as a new video shows. Mark Ammann, 57, from Texas was wandering through Walmart on Tuesday afternoon when he heard something strange drifting over the airwaves. When he went to investigate, he caught a group of children having great fun singing the national anthem into a row of home cooler fans. Footage shows the young singers lost in the moment as they chime away. Caught on camera: Mark Ammann, 57, from Texas was wandering through Walmart on Tuesday afternoon when he heard the children singing . Even when they forget the words, they continue to keep the melody going. The air being blasted from the fans causes the sound to muffle. All of a sudden a boy comes along with a grocery cart and points to Ammann filming. One girl runs away giggling in embarrassment. Despite losing one member, the other two chorus members continue to sing at the top of their lungs. Impromptu performance: When he went to investigate, he caught a group of children having great fun singing the national anthem into a row of home cooler fans . Ammann later uploaded the heartwarming footage to Facebook, along with the caption: 'What's wrong with today's youth? Not a dang thing.' He later added: 'Yes, I did capture this candid moment today at Walmart. No, it wasn't staged and I don't know the kids involved. 'I was walking through the store and heard the singing and got my phone out to record it. 'I think we could use more sharing of stuff like this that a lot of the other junk I see posted lately.' Many viewers have echoed Ammann's sentiments. 'Makes my heart happy! Thanks for sharing!' one commenter wrote, while another added: 'Love this! Almost brought a tear to my eye.'","Mark Ammann, 57, from Texas was wandering through Walmart on Tuesday when he heard something strange ."
"The funeral procession for a slain Philadelphia cop was nearly stopped before it began were it not for the strength and ingenuity of some mourning officers. Faced with a car blocking the route following Sunday's funeral, no owner in sight and no tow truck near enough to move it in time, over a dozen of Robert Wilson III's fellow policemen pitched in to move it themselves. 'We just moved the car,' explained Springfield Township Corporal Shawn Hart. It was a last ditch effort as countless mourners looked nervously at the car blocking their path. Emotional: Philadelphia cops from various departments pitched in to move this car from the funeral procession route of their fallen colleague with their bare hands . Hero: Wilson helped protect a video game store full of people when he was gunned down by robbers . 'I just asked some guys in line for a hand. They came over and we moved it to the side,' Hart told NBC Philadelphia. 'The procession was able to get past and that was it. After the procession came by [the car's owner] jumped in his car and moved it out of the way before the hearse came down.' No one is sure exactly how many officers pitched in or from which departments they came. 'There were so many,' Hart told NBC Philly. 'They just came over, grabbed a piece of the car and they moved it. I don't even know where they were from.' In his final, courageous moments, Officer Robert Wilson III took on two armed robbers and gave his life to save those around him — an act so noble that Philadelphia's police department will rename its valor medal in his honor, police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said. Ramsey recounted Wilson's heroism during the slain officer's funeral on Saturday, telling thousands of mourners it was the greatest act of bravery he has seen in his 46-year law enforcement career. 'Robert redefined what valor means, in my mind,' Ramsey said. Surveillance video of the March 5 encounter at a GameStop store in north Philadelphia captured the 30-year-old Wilson's unflinching response, Ramsey said. The gunmen burst in as the 8-year department veteran waited in line to purchase a game for his son, who had excelled in school and was turning 10 in a few days. He instinctively moved from the counter to draw the suspects' gunfire away from innocent bystanders and returned fire, Ramsey said. More than 50 shots were fired during the fierce gunbattle, investigators said. 'He never stopped until that fatal round was fired,' Ramsey told the assembled crowd, many of whom were law enforcement officers from across the country whose dress uniforms formed patterns of blues and tans inside the Palestra sports arena. Wilson was remembered as energetic and hardworking. His family (above) attended a memorial viewing for him on Friday . Law enforcement officers saluted the arrival of the remains of Philadelphia officer Robert Wilson III before a funeral procession  for the officer, who exchanged gunfire with two armed gunmen trying to rob the store . Philadelphia officer Robert Wilson III, 30, was remembered at a funeral on Saturday after he was slain at a GameStop in the cities north while buying a video game for his son Quahmier, 10, earlier this month . Mayor Michael Nutter said he is struggling to comprehend the loss of the city's 10th police officer killed in the line of duty in the last 9 years. The city has lost a friend, a brother and an American hero, Nutter said. 'Two cowards came upon him, firing at him,' Nutter said. 'He fought them valiantly until he could fight no more.' Ramone Williams, 24, and Carlton Hipps, 29, are charged with murder, attempted murder, robbery and other offenses. 'I miss my man,' Wilson's partner, Damien Stevenson, told mourners. He shot one of the suspects in the leg as they attempted to flee. Stevenson reminisced about the fun he and Wilson had on patrol in their car, No. 2222, the time they donned red and white striped socks to entertain children at a Ronald McDonald House and the banter they shared. 'That's all we did, we had fun,' Stevenson said, as a video screen displayed images of the partners in their squad car, the slain officer smiling broadly. 'There was no car like 22-22.' Wilson will receive the newly renamed medal of valor and the department's medal of honor and a posthumous promotion to sergeant, Ramsey said.

"An endless, steep road spirals up ahead of me and in the heat of the Ibiza sun it seems insurmountable... until a somewhat over-enthusiastic Spencer Matthews sprints straight past me. Yes, it seems the secret to his rock-hard abs and enviable tan is impossible runs up the mountains of the White Isle, where he is doing anything but partying into the wee small hours. I have signed up to No1 Bootcamp, the retreat tucked into a beautiful sprawling farmhouse near the coastal town of Santa Eulalia. The before and after shots showed the difference the Ibiza camp made to Spencer's figure . It is famed as the bootcamp to the stars (alumni include  X-Factor contestants, model Calum Best and former Atomic Kitten Natasha Hamilton). And as if to prove a point, the indomitable Made in Chelsea stalwart turns up unannounced on my first day. We're a nervous bunch at 7am as we stand in our lycra waiting to meet Andy Morris - a former personal training instructor in the RAF. We had all arrived at different times the day before, dropped off at this picture-perfect villa Casona Morna, where its fragrant gardens give way to a beautiful pool and an outdoor seating area makes the perfect spot for al fresco lunch and dinner. Casona Morna is located near the pretty Ibiza town of Santa Eulalia, not far from the beach . Relaxation time is spent on loungers around the pool in the villa's pretty gardens . Just down the road is the beach - where Andy hosts classes when he feels we need a change of scene - and all around are rolling hills criss-crossed by hiking routes which we explore in the afternoons. A bundle of energy with the essential booming voice that every instructor needs, Andy has us all weighed, measured and taking part in a basic series of exercises as an introductory fitness test before we have even had breakfast. When we do eventually sit down my serving of porridge looks decidedly small as he talks us through the week - 7am intensive workouts for 20 minutes, three-hour hikes, swimming pool-based activities, boxing classes, team games and endurance work-outs on the beach are just some of the highlights. Spencer works out during a boxing circuit with former RAF personal training instructor Andy Morris . Fellow Made in Chelsea star Binky Felstead lost a stone by taking part in No1 Boot Camp in Ibiza . And we'll be doing all this while on a severely calorie-controlled diet. Our amazing chef and nutritionist Kate will be serving up three meals a day and snacks, but it will all be sugar, gluten and dairy-free. My stomach rumbles in sympathy. As it turns out, the food is delicious. For the first 48 hours I feel hungry and have a slight headache - all part of the detox process apparently - but soon enough I start feeling fulfilled by the meals and we certainly have a great mix of foods, from hamburgers and 'chips' (sweet potato) to fish, salad, stuffed peppers and frittata. MailOnline writer Sarah Gordon poses with Spencer Matthews in the sunny gardens at Casona Morna . There are 13 of us in my group and we create a whole spectrum of shapes and sizes. Of the four men, Spencer is at the fitter end of the scale, while others admit they work long hours and don't have the chance to work out. Among us females we have everything from a professional stunt woman looking to hone her shape, to a slim girl who just wants to get fitter and an overweight woman who is keen to kick-start her weight-loss. The rest of us could just do with losing a few pounds. Thankfully, the variety means we're not pitted against each other. Andy is quick to tell us we are only competing with ourselves. Some of us excel during the running and endurance training, others are great when it comes to weights. I learn an entirely new workout vocabulary. It's all about maintaining form (basically, making sure you do the exercises properly and don't do yourself a mischief). We interchange High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT - where you blast through exercises with 100 per cent, but it's all over quite quickly) with isometric training (strength training focusing on one muscle or group of muscles). Despite the somewhat alien terminology, we're all soon using the jargon and Andy takes care to explain exactly what each class is doing for our bodies and why it is perfectly balanced with the previous exercise circuit. Don't be fooled though, he's not all friendly and cuddly - don't let him catch you slacking off. When Andy decides the group needs a change of scene, he moves the workouts to the nearby beach . Porridge with figs, a healthy burger and sweet potato chips and a stuffed pepper keep us full of energy . Bircher muesli, a refreshing salad and a delicious Thai prawn curry are also on the menu in Ibiza . Thankfully, it's not all high-octane. Between classes we're given time to recover, some people swim, others sunbathe and I drag my bruised and battered body into the shade for a nap. By day three I am pretty sure my body is about to give up on me altogether. Walking up the 10 stairs to my bedroom (there is a choice of sharing rooms or having one to yourself) takes about five minutes. Even rolling over in bed sends shooting pains through my muscles. But somehow in each class I manage to find myself working through the exercises. Perhaps Andy terrifies my muscles into submission, but by the end of day three they suddenly start easing up again. This is helped in no small part by a massage booked with local therapists who come to the villa for bookings (it is the best €70 I have ever spent). After a particularly strenuous walk, Spencer cools down with an impromptu shower from a local spring . Throughout my personal ups and downs, Spencer remains irritatingly energetic. He is the first to finish exercises, the fastest runner and the most likely to whip off his top in the heat (well, it is a female-dominated group and he has ladies to impress - even the red and sweaty ones). 06:00 Wake-up time (this was a little later during my stay in Ibiza) 07.00 Short, intense 20-minute workout . 07:30 A healthy breakfast to kick start the day . 08:30 First full class of the day . 10:00 Snack and a short break . 10:30 Circuit training or similar . 12:00 Lunch & much needed break . 13:30 A long countryside hike . 16:30 Team games & exercises . 17:30 Stretching & similar exercises . 19:30 A well-deserved gourmet dinner . Which is how I find myself being overtaken by the Chelsea resident while tackling a particularly steep hill. We are on one of our final hikes, a favourite activity of mine which allows us to ramble all over the countryside, taking in sea views from clifftops and clambering through forest paths, with the intense smell of pine trees all around. Our final hike ends with a devastatingly steep road which Andy has the bright idea of making us run up. We take off full of enthusiasm, round a corner and see that it seemingly goes on forever. Chest heaving, muscles straining and mentally making a note to kill our instructor, I haul myself up, only for Spencer to come bounding past, giving a thumbs up to the camera (Andy also loves nothing more than filming his victims - I mean participants - for a surprisingly touching montage to be shown at the end of the week). At the top there are high fives all-round, shout-outs to those bringing up the rear and even a few sweaty hugs. For our final night, we're allowed 'off-campus' and into town for a dinner of our choice and even a sneaky glass of wine. But Kate and Andy have cleverly organised it so that our final weigh-in is the following morning, so we're desperate not to over-indulge. Spencer and instructor Andy demonstrate how an old mill discovered during a hike can be used for a workout . Small groups mean that everyone gets the attention they need and the chance to bond while taking part in the activities, such as the three-hour afternoon hikes . Despite the concentration of bootcamp on exercise and healthy lifestyles, we haven't been weighed in since our first day and there is little talk of 'diets' and body comparisons. Everyone just seems to get on with doing their best. Prices at No1 Boot Camp Ibiza start at £850 for a week - for bookings go to www.no1bootcamp.com or ring 0208 504 4183. The Ibiza camp reopens for 2015 on March 28 and is open through till the end of October. No1 Boot Camp also runs weight loss retreats in Norfolk (open all year round) and Marrakech. So what's the verdict? Spencer loses a reasonable seven pounds this time around (he has previously lost a stone in one trip), our 'biggest loser' sheds an amazing 11 pounds. Quite a few hover around the seven pounds mark and I lose four, which isn't too bad. Kate reminds us that we will probably go on losing a couple of pounds the following week and I find that actually, it's not the weight I'm worried about so much anymore. My arms feel more defined, I feel lighter in myself and my body feels less sluggish thanks to the leaner diet. To me that is much more valuable than a few lost pounds.","No1 Bootcamp is tucked into a sprawling farmhouse near Santa Eulalia .

"A woman in Saudi Arabia has been sentenced to 70 lashes after 'insulting' a man on private messaging service WhatsApp. The unnamed 32-year-old will also have to pay a 20,000 Saudi Riyal (£3,604) fine for tarnishing the reputation of the man, a court has ruled. The case was filed at Al Qatif criminal court in eastern Saudi Arabia by the man following an argument.The nature of the row is unknown. A woman in Saudi Arabia has been sentenced to 70 lashes after insulting a man on private messaging service WhatsApp, a court has decided . The defendant pleaded guilty to insulting the man but rejected the court ruling, according to a Gulf News report. Article Three of the Saudi Anti-Cyber Crime Law states that any person who commits 'defamation and infliction of damage upon others' using technological devices might have to face imprisonment for up to a year and a fine not exceeding 500,000 Saudi Riyal (£90,171). Two women from Jeddah were similarly sentenced to ten days in jail and 20 lashes in June last year after insulting each other using the messaging service. In 2013 the Saudi Arabian government considered banning WhatsApp. Some people believe the government's attempt to control WhatsApp is due to strict laws on how men and women should interact in the country, where strict gender segregation is enforced . A spokesman for the country's Communications and Information Technology Commission said at the time: 'We have been communicating with WhatsApp and other similar communication platforms to get them to co-operate and comply with the Saudi telecom providers, however nothing has come of this communication yet.' Some people believe the government's attempt to control WhatsApp is due to strict laws on how men and women should interact in the country. A Saudi husband has divorced his wife after she updated her WhatsApp status to include a reference about having to be patient with him. The man said he had been on the private messaging service when he noticed his wife had written: 'I pray to be patient enough to put up with you' followed by his initials. Although he was not initially sure whether the message was directed at him it was confirmed by friends and family, newspaper Al-Hayat reported. The unnamed man said: 'I called one of my relatives to check whether she was addressing me. 'I was so embarrassed that my friends' wives and relatives could see that I was being portrayed in such a light.' The country's Ministry of Justice said the top reason for divorce was social media.","The case was filed at Al Qatif criminal court by the man following an argument .

"A north Texas woman is outraged with her five-year-old son's elementary school after they put him on a bus when he was supposed to remain at school for a daycare program. The bus ended up dropping Ashley Holder's son, Gabriel Muntu, nearly a mile from their apartment, and he walked home alone on Wednesday. Gabriel had reportedly told a substitute teacher at North Elementary School in Fort Worth that he was not supposed to ride the bus, but he was put on to the vehicle anyway. Five-year-old Gabriel Muntu was put on a bus instead of staying at the building for an after-school daycare program on Wednesday . When he was dropped off, he walked nearly a mile alone to get to his family's north Texas apartment . Gabriel's mother, Ashley Holder, said that she 'felt sick' because 'anything could have happened' to her son, who was, unknowingly to her, walking around around Fort Worth alone . When Gabriel showed his mom where he had been dropped off, she realized it was nearly a mile away from their home. Once he was dropped of, he crossed a busy four-lane road as he walked home. Holder told NBC 5 that her son said he crossed the street more than once. Holder was especially concerned because Gabriel is supposed to have an upcoming surgery on his feet. Gabriel told his mother that he told a substitute teacher at North Elementary School in Fort Worth that he was not supposed to ride the bus, but he was put on to the vehicle anyway . Holder, pictured here with her partner and two children, said she spoke up because she doesn't want something like this to happen to any other children . 'I felt sick and I cried because that's my baby, you know. He could have been hit by a car. He could have been kidnapped. Anything could have happened,' Holder told NBC 5. 'He dodged cars to get home and I asked him, I was like, ""Were there cars? Did you see them?"" and he was like, ""Oh they stopped for me""', Holder added. 'If they wouldn't have stopped, that could have been my son's life and that's the only reason why I'm saying something.' White Settlement Independent School District officials said that there was a lapse in procedure on Wednesday. The school apologized to Gabriel's family and will review procedures to ensure another student doesn't go through what Gabriel did.

"Sierra Leone's top sprinter who went missing after Glasgow's Commonwealth Games last summer, is now applying for asylum in the UK after he was found sleeping rough on the streets of London. Jimmy Thoronka, 20, disappeared at the end of the Games and failed to return to the Ebola-hit west African country. Already orphaned by the war in Sierra Leone, he claims that his entire adopted family have been wiped out by the disease while he has been in the UK. Thoronka, who said that he wanted to claim asylum in the UK so he could fulfill his dream of becoming a top athlete, now faces deportation. An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Mr Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted more than 57,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £24,000 to help the young athlete. Jimmy Thoronka carrying the Commonwealth baton in Sierra Leone. He has been arrested for overstaying his visa and claims all his immediate family are dead from Ebola so he cannot return home . An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Mr Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted more than 57,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £24,000 to help the young athlete . Among the high profile names to support his plight are supermodel Lily Cole, and comedian Russell Brand. The Guardian said it had interviewed Thoronka before he was detained for overstaying his visa. He claimed there were no flights to Sierra Leone immediately after the Games and his team-mates all scattered, some staying with relatives and friends until they could return home. But he said his own bag -  containing his money and passport  - were stolen. His visa expired last September and after a brief stint with friends, he has been sleeping on the streets in parks and on buses ever since. He today told the BBC's Sarah Montague that he wanted to claim asylum in the UK so he could fulfill his dream of becoming a top athlete.  Asylum is only granted to those who are in fear of persecution in their home country. He said of Sierra Leone: 'Nobody persecute me or anything, my problem is I don't have a family there to stay with. The person who would help me has passed by Ebola. If I go back i will not make it and I will kill myself, because i cannot pursue my dream. I want to be the fastest sprinter in the world.' When Thoronka, the country's number one 100m sprinter, left Sierra Leone for Glasgow, some Ebola cases had been confirmed in a few of the villages surrounding Freetown, but the epidemic had not yet taken hold of the capital. The death toll in the country is now more than 3,500 cases. The runner said: 'I was hoping to win a medal for my country. But during the Games I got the terrible news that my uncle had died, probably from Ebola. 'I couldn't stop crying. It was difficult to continue with competing but I tried to carry on.' He is not working illegally, nor claiming benefits or housing, and understands the legal implications of remaining in the UK after his visa has expired, but said his situation is hopeless. After the Games, he stayed for a while with friends in Leicester - and found out that his entire immediate family had been killed by Ebola. Later he went to London and began sleeping in parks and on night buses and begging for £1 from passers-by to buy chips. 'Some days I get no food at all. I wash in public toilets and sleep in the park,' he said. 'I wake up around 4am and if I've got a bus pass I get on the night bus and sleep there until morning. 'I met a man who sometimes lets me sleep at his house but I have to wait outside for him to come home at 10 or 11pm and I get very cold. 'We have a cold season in Sierra Leone but it is not cold like England. Some days I don't think I'm going to make it and just feel like killing myself. 'My dream is to become one of the best sprinters in the world but I don't see how that can happen now.' Hampden Park in Glasgow was the venue for the track and field events during the Commonwealth Games . He was arrested on Friday and quizzed by officers over whether he was carrying or using drugs, which he denied. He has since applied for asylum and has been released into Home Office accommodation. The newspaper said hundreds of people have since been in touch to offer support, and a petition has been set up on change.org to support him. It calls for the Government to 'let Jimmy stay here on compassionate grounds, so that he can find a sponsor to help him to continue his athletics career' and has received almost 58,000 signatures. It says: 'With our support, and the opportunities we have in the UK, Jimmy can have a new start and realise his huge potential as a sprinting star.' A Home Office spokeswoman said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases, but there is assistance available for people to return home when they are not entitled to remain in the UK.'","Jimmy Thoronka's entire immediate family has succumbed to the disease .

"The real-life 'Up' house, which saw its elderly owner refuse to take $1million from developers to move out looks set to be demolished by a wrecking ball when it is auctioned off. In 2006, Edith Macefield took a stand against developers by staying in the house in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood where she had lived in for almost 60 years despite being offered money to leave so new retail and office space could be created. Both she and the 1,000 square foot house became a symbol of standing up to corporate giants after developers were forced to awkwardly build around it. Scroll down for video . The house was often compared to the house in the Pixar movie 'Up' where an elderly man refuses to leave his house to go into a nursing home so turns it into an airship by attaching balloons to it . The world famous 'holdout house' where an elderly woman took a stand against developers forcing them to build around her home, is to be auctioned off this Friday . In 2006 Edith Macefield, 84, was offered $1 million in cash and help with healthcare and housing to sell her home to developers of a retail center in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard . The story mirrored the plot of the Disney Pixar movie Up, which sees an elderly man refuse to leave his house to go into a nursing home so he turns it into a makeshift airship by attaching balloons to it. However, Ms Macefield passed away from pancreatic cancer in June 2008, leaving the house boarded up and empty. Tomorrow it will be entered into a foreclosure auction, where it is expected to be bought by developers and demolished. It comes after a friend she left the house to sold it to a company called Reach Returns, who planned to keep it in tact for a new project. But when the company started work, they weren't able to get the financing they needed and defaulted on their loans, meaning it went into foreclosure. The row with developers came after the neighborhood of Ballard, just across Salmon Bay from Seattle, held out against the forces of gentrification until 2000 when developers came knocking. Condominiums and shopping malls for tech-industry workers began to spring up where once modest family homes had once stood. By 2006, Ms Macefield's home stood almost alone, her neighbors long gone, as developers prepared to build Ballard Blocks, a retail and office development. She was offered $1 million in cash for her property, in addition to assistance with housing and healthcare. But she turned down the money for the simple reason that she did not want to leave. Macefield refused to leave her home of 50 years, and construction began on the development that would end up surrounding her house and garden . Ms Macefield had lived in the house for almost 60 years, having originally moved there in 1952 to take care of her ailing mother. It was home to all of her memories, and a large collection of ceramic cats, dogs and cows. The money meant nothing to her, she did not want to move, and had already rejected a smaller buyout offer a couple of years before. As concrete walls began to tower some five floors high above her home, her fame grew and she earned the grudging respect of the construction workers that would pass by every day. Ms Macefield never had to leave her home, and she died there aged 86, leaving the small house sandwiched between a Trader Joe's and an L.A. Fitness. Ironically, she left the house to the supervisor of the very project that had tried to displace her. Barry Martin was one of several construction workers that got to know Ms Macefield, often dropping in to check on her. 'She would get up really early to feed the birds every day,' Mr Martin told Yahoo Homes. 'And so if we ever didn't see birdseed out front by 10 am, we'd know to go check on her.' As concrete walls began to tower above her home, her fame grew and she earned the grudging respect of the construction workers that would pass by every day . Macefield never had to leave her home, and she died there aged 86, leaving the small house sandwiched between a Trader Joe's and an L.A. Fitness. Mr Martin would even drive her to hair appointments, run errands, cook for her and take her to hospital. She was tough and stubborn and would test Mr Martin, but he could be too and did not stop looking after her. 'All she wanted to do was live and die in her house, and that seems like a pretty simple request. And all she really needed was some help using her hands and being on her feet,' he said. Ms Macefield, a very private person, did not like the worldwide attention she received for just wanting to stay put in her home. She stood her ground not because she was standing up to corporate America or because she wanted to be a hero. She simply didn't want to leave. 'Some people still believe that she was doing it to stand up against the man, and that really wasn't it. 'She decided what it was she wanted to do and stuck to her guns, and that part to me makes sense. That's what I relate to,' said Mr Martin. The house is now boarded up ahead of the auction at the end of the week, where it is expected to face demolition by a wrecking ball . Macefield was a reluctant folk hero with a colorful past. She claimed she was not trying to make a stand against corporate America. She simply didn't want to leave . The story of the house came at the end of a remarkable life according to stories she told Mr Martin, some of which he was able to corroborate through letters and photographs he found after her death. Ms Macefield had a large musical collection, and played the clarinet. She talked of playing with jazz and swing musician Benny Goodman, her cousin, and his friends Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey. She had lived overseas in her early life, could quote from classic books, and spoke multiple languages. She also claimed to have worked as a spy during World War II, until she was captured and sent to the concentration camp at Dachau, from which she then escaped. Later she ran an orphanage for war refugees before returning to America to look after her mother. Despite shunning the limelight she has been immortalized in Seattle due to her refusal of the developer's money. Some two dozen people are reported to have tattoos of her house; a drink is named after her at a local cocktail bar; and the Macefield music festival still attracts a crowd of 3,000 people each year.","Often-compared to the Pixar movie 'Up', home-owner Edith Macefield, 84, was offered $1 million to vacate her house .

"A teenager has become the first cancer patient in Britain to have a metal port fitted to his head so doctors can blast  drugs directly at his brain tumour. James Willetts, 17, had the titanium socket - which was created by a 3D printer - bolted to his skull after traditional treatments failed to halt his aggressive brain tumour. A 'plug' is screwed into the port which allows chemotherapy drugs to be pumped into the tumour along four hair-thin catheters with pinpoint accuracy. James Willetts has now become the first British cancer sufferer to have be fitted with a 'skull socket' The 17-year-old had the titanium socket - which was created by a 3D printer - bolted to his skull after traditional treatments failed to halt his aggressive brain tumour . James is one of only three cancer sufferers in the world to receive the risky treatment, called 'convection-enhanced delivery' (CEH), which has not even reached stage one trials. 'The first thing that I thought was that I was going to be like Robocop,' he said. 'But I actually don't really notice it. 'I can feel it when they connect it but once it has connected it is fine. It doesn't hurt. 'When they screw it in I can here a scrapping noise inside my head.' James, of Taunton, Somerset, was diagnosed with Glioblastoma in January 2014 after complaining of migraines and stress. James underwent a 12 hour operation at Frenchay Hospital in Bristrol in February to remove the tennis-ball sized tumour, leaving him with short-term memory loss and restricted use of the left side of his body . A 'plug' is screwed into the port which allows chemotherapy drugs to be pumped into the tumour along four hair-thin catheters with pinpoint accuracy . He underwent a 12 hour operation at Frenchay Hospital in Bristrol in February to remove the tennis-ball sized tumour, leaving him with short-term memory loss and restricted use of the left side of his body. Although most of the tumour was cut out, it was attached to his thalamus in the centre of his brain and some couldn't be removed safely. Following the operation, he began oral chemotherapy, radiotherapy and was enrolled on a stage 2 drug test called Avastin from a French pharmaceutical company. But none of the treatments worked and the tumour began to regrow, leaving the family with few choices. Fortunately for the teen, he was then selected to take part in the CEH trials carried out by neurosurgeon Professor Steven Gill at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. A 3D titanium port was fitted to James' head at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, in late October with treatment beginning in November. He undergoes treatment for several hours over two days, after which he is discharged for six weeks before receiving another dose. The teen, pictured after the operation, is one of only three cancer sufferers in the world to receive the risky treatment, called 'convection-enhanced delivery' (CEH), which has not even reached stage one trials . James' father Simon does not blame the NHS for not funding the treatment . James has now received three doses of the chemotherapy - classed as one 'cycle' of treatment - and will have a scan at the end of March to reveal how he has responded. The concept has been around for nearly a decade but can be dangerous and so had never been used to treat cancer and or had even reached stage one trials. As a result the NHS would not provide funding and the £36,000 cost of James' treatment so far has been privately donated. James's family has now set up the Brain Power Trust, to help pay for his future treatment or that of others and have currently raised £8,000. His father Simon Willetts, 52, said: 'His experience has given him a gift he can share - when you get through it, you've got a unique story to inspire others.' 'He's got a great sense of humour and everyone says he's incredible,' added his father, a salon owner. 'He's got strengths that I don't know where they come from. 'He's teaching me all the time and his inner strength and spiritual calm have helped us all develop some qualities it takes a lifetime to learn.'

"They were a species of early human thought to have roamed Europe and Asia for up to 300,000 years before finally dying out. Now scientists believe they have ruled out one of the major theories for what triggered the extinction of the Neanderthals. They have found that an enormous volcanic eruption in Italy 40,000 years ago had little impact on the species' demise. Neanderthals, shown above from the TV series Walking with Neanderthals, were already on the decline by the time of the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption in Italy 40,000 years ago caused widespread climate cooling . Although the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption was one of the largest volcanic explosions in Europe, scientists say the cooling and increased levels of acid rain that resulted from the explosive eruption would have had little impact in the areas where Neanderthals were living. They argue that Neanderthal populations had already started to decline by the time the volcano erupted and it was insufficient to trigger their extinction. Neanderthals may have created and worn the world's first jewellery 130,000 years ago, according to scientists. Researchers examining eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Krapina in Croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet. The claws bear multiple cut marks, notches and signs that they had been polishing by the Neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found. Anthropologists at the University Kansas say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in Europe. The findings add to mounting evidence that Neanderthals were not the slow-witted and primitive creatures they are often portrayed as. Instead they say that it was likely to be competition with modern humans that led to the demise of the Neanderthals. Dr Benjamin Black, from the department of earth sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, who led the research, said: 'Radiocarbon dating has shown that at the time of the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption, anatomically modern humans had already arrived in Europe, and the range of Neanderthals had steadily diminished. 'Work at five sites in the Mediterranean indicates that anatomically modern humans were established in these locations by then as well.' Anthropologists have for decades debated the possible causes for the extinction of Neanderthals around 40,000 years ago. The species first appeared around 400,000 years ago and spread throughout much of Europe and Asia. Some scientists have suggested that the species were killed off by modern humans - Homo sapiens - as they moved out of Africa or were unable to cope changes to the climate. However, others have proposed that the explosive eruption of a volcano close to what is now modern day Naples threw millions of tonnes of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere that could have led to the final extinction of the Neanderthals. Recent research by scientists at the ANO Laboratory of Prehistory in St. Petersburg, Russia has helped support this view. This image shows the average temperature anomalies in excess of 3°C in the year following the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption alongside sites where Neanderthal and human remains from the time have been found . Mount Vesuvius, which is part of the Campi Flegrei super volcano, still overshadows the city of Naples (above) The huge crater left by this super-volcano, known as Campi Flegrei, can still be seen on the coastline of Italy on the opposite side of Naples to Mount Vesuvius. However, Dr Black and his colleagues, whose work is published in the journal Geology, used computer modelling to simulate the impact this enormous eruption would have had on the area at the time. More than 150 cubic kilometers of magma was thrown out by the eruption. The sulphur dioxide would have acted like an aerosol, blanketing the area with a layer in the atmosphere that reflected sunlight back into space. They were big, brutish and probably not particularly good-looking. Now it seems that Neanderthals had to contend with an ailment that affected their appearance too - psoriasis. Genetic research on Neanderthal remains has shown that these now extinct ancient cousins of modern humans may have suffered from psoriasis. The research has also revealed that they may have suffered from other modern medical disorders such as Crohn's disease, a condition that affects the digestive system. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. The Campi Flegrei caldera close to Napes, Italy hides a supervolcano that erupted around 40,000 years ago . The researchers found that the largest temperature decreases would have occurred in eastern Europe and Asia, avoiding the areas where the last Neanderthals populations were surviving in western Europe. They say that the eruption was 'probably insufficient' to trigger the Neanderthal extinction. However, they say that the cold weather that followed the eruption would still have impacted the day-to day life of Neanderthals and early humans in Europe. they estimate that temperatures in western Europe fell by an average of two to four degrees C in the year following the eruption. Dr Black and his colleagues said: 'Significant volcanic cooling during the years immediately following the eruption could have impacted the viability of already precarious populations and influenced many aspects of daily life for Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.'","Huge volcanic eruption has been blamed for the demise of Neanderthals .
Scientists at University of California Berkeley modeled the eruption impact .
They found the eruption in Italy cooled Europe's climate by 2-4 degrees C .
However, researchers say there was less cooling where Neanderthals lived .
This suggests the eruption did not play a role in the demise of the species .
Competition with modern humans was most likely candidate, say scientists ."
"Lindsay Groce Garder, 27, died of hypothermia with her 13-month-old daughter Hailey Gardner. Their bodies were found in a field in Fort Worth, Texas . A mother found naked and dead with her 13-month-old daughter died of hypothermia, a medical examiner ruled. Lindsay Groce Gardner was discovered by fence repairmen lying on top of baby Hailey in a field in Fort Worth, Texas in January. The 27-year-old's car was discovered crashed and abandoned 200 yards away. Police found her clothes strewn in the field between the car and her body, indicating she undressed as she walked with her baby away from the car. At the time Sgt Joe Loughman said: 'There were no injuries that looked like they would cause a person’s death.' But the death was ruled accidental this week after a Tarrant County medical officer said Ms Gardner undressed in a 'very sad' and 'unusual' case. Paradoxical undressing can occur in cases of severe hypothermia when the confused victim begins to feel as if they are burning up and therefore removes their clothing. The crashed Toyota sedan was first reported around 8:30am on January 13 by resident Amber Bentley, who spotted the car after dropping her kids off at school. 'There's always deer in that field,' Ms Bentley said. 'I was looking for the deer and I saw the car. It was against a tree and the hood was smashed in and the driver's side door was open. 'I was hollering asking if everybody was okay, hoping if somebody was in there that they could at least respond.' Since Ms Bentley had a child in the car at the time, she couldn't get out to approach the car, but called police and stayed until they showed up. While the airbags were deployed, police found the vehicle empty. Ms Gardner and her daughter were found about 200 yards away from a crashed silver car . It wasn't until a man came to repair a fence at 11am that the bodies were found. Ms Gardner's Facebook profile said she had been married to Anthony Gardner since June 29, 2012. According to excerpts from a personal blog, published in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, she was a married freelance artist who previously lived in California. In a post from August 2013, she wrote about stress concerning a move to Lancaster, California. She wrote: 'Why can’t things just go the way you plan them? Why does God constantly have another path? According to a personal blog, Gardner was married and worked as a freelance artist. In her last post from April 2013, she wrote about being pregnant and organizing a move to Lancaster, California with her husband Anthony Gardner (pictured above with their daughter) Gardner's Facebook profile said she had been married to Anthony Gardner (right) since June 29, 2012 . 'These are things I get to thinking. You’ve probably thought them before too. Why do we even bother thinking that? He already had a path. 'It’s our scared insecure brains that try to tie all the knots of false insecurity together into believing that we are going to be ok because of our ‘plan'. Even though, constantly, again and again, our plan fails, falls apart, crumbles, vanishes. But God’s plans are always solid. He always follows through and takes care of us. Mystery: The medical examiner's office said that Ms Gardner (left) paradoxically undressed before lying on top of her daughter (right) 'Please pray for me and my family. My husband and I are going back to no home, no job, and pregnant.' After the incident hundreds of friends posted memorials to Ms Gardner on her Facebook page. One friend wrote: 'She was such a sweet spirit, so genuine, and an incredible artist. 'She was so in love with her baby and we both shared a passion for gentle parenting. She wanted to be the best mother she could be for her.' Gardner was found naked, with a trail of clothes from the car suggesting she disrobed as she walked away from the vehicle . Caroline McLendon, who lives next door to the mother's parents, said she was 'just horrified' to hear about Gardner's death. 'I wanted to tell her how sorry I was that this has happened to that lovely family,' McLendon told NBC DFW. Resident Linda Fuqua is confused, like many in the community. She said: 'It’s perplexing, the fact the bodies were away from the car, you think they would have been in the car.'","Lindsay Groce Gardner was found with her 13-month-old baby Hailey .

"A set of Boston fraternal twins who beat all odds by being born 24 days apart in a rare, lifesaving delivery procedure have celebrated their first birthdays. Alexandre and Ronaldo Antunes had a special birthday party at the Tufts Medical Center on Thursday while gathered with the staff who helped their family during their births last March. The oldest by nearly a month, Alexandre, was born prematurely on March 2 followed by the arrival of his twin brother on March 26. Scroll down for video . Alexandre (left) and Ronaldo (right) Antunes had a special birthday party at the Tufts Medical Center on Thursday while gathered with the staff who helped their family during their births last March . Lindalva Pinheiro da Silva, the boys' mother, held back tears as she thanked the doctors and staff for their work during her pregnancy while at the party on Thursday at Tufts Medical Center . Dr Jonathan Davis (center), chief of Newborn Medicine at the hospital, said he had never seen delayed interval delivery this successful . Lindalva Pinheiro da Silva, the boys' mother, went into labor 16 weeks early last February and had a delayed interval delivery, which is rare. She held back tears as she thanked the doctors and staff for their work, according to CBS Boston. 'One year later we are here celebrating,' said Ronaldo Antunes, the boys' father. 'It looks like it was yesterday. It's unbelievable. Grateful to be here celebrating their first year.' Nurse JoAnn Loiselle said: 'To see them [Alexandre and Ronaldo] going from tiny and fighting for their lives to thriving with what looks like no deficits is almost a miracle. Dr Jonathan Davis, chief of Newborn Medicine at the hospital, said he had seen 'exceptionally rare' delivery attempted several times, but that it was never quite successful. He said: 'It's the first time in my career I've seen it this successful. I've seen it attempted a number of times and it was never quite successful, and in this case it made a huge difference.' Alexandre and Ronaldo were to be Pinheiro da Silva's first children with Ronaldo, and she was thrilled to be pregnant with twins. Ronaldo Antunes (above with son Ronaldo), the boys' father, said he is grateful to be celebrating his sons' first year . Lindalva  (pictured with her husband, Ronaldo, and twin babies) was just 24 weeks pregnant when she went into labor. Her twins beat all odds by being born 24 days apart in a rare procedure . But when her water broke in February, the excitement turned to fear. 'I panicked,' Pinheiro da Silva told ABC. 'It wasn't time. It was too early. I knew I could lose the babies.' Lindalva gave birth to premature Alexandre, who was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit, as doctors were able to keep Ronaldo growing inside of his mother's womb during the unique technique. Miraculously, both twins managed to survive and, despite one being nearly a month older than the other, are doing well. Pinheiro da Silva has spoken out about the technique doctors resorted to in the hope they could save one twin when the first was born at only 24 weeks after she went into premature labor in February . She gave birth to premature Alexandre, who was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit, as doctors kept Ronaldo growing inside of his mother's womb during the unique technique . Miraculously, both twins managed to survive and, despite one being nearly a month older than the other, are doing well . When potassium sulfate injections failed to stop Pinheiro da Silva's labor, doctors decided to go forward with a rare technique in which one baby is kept in the womb after its twin is born. 'When you have a situation where one baby is born and labor stops, you are given this window of opportunity,' Dr. Steven Ralston, director of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, told the Globe. 'But it's a rare window. Most times, labor does not stop.' Thankfully, after Alexandre was born at just 1 pound, 10 ounces, it did happen. Doctors stopped Pinheiro da Silva's labor and left the delivered child's umbilical cord and placenta inside her womb. Pinheiro da Silva's first twin Alexandre was born at just 24 weeks and weighed only 1 pound 10 ounces . As Alexandre fought for his life, his brother Ronaldo lived on in their mother's womb growing stronger. Ronaldo was born 24 days after his brother and weighed 3 pounds 3 ounces . 'On the . second day after Alexandre was born, his umbilical cord came out,' Pinheiro da Silva told ABC. Her husband Ronaldo 'saw it hanging.' 'But they just cleaned it and put it back inside,' she said. Pinheiro da Silva was given antibiotics to combat infection, which can be common . after the procedure. However, unlike many mothers, da Silva was . fortunate not to require her cervix to be stitched up to keep the baby . from coming. For the following three weeks, she remained in the hospital, where she was able to visit Alexandre in the neonatal unit. Then, 24 days after his brother was born, Ronaldo came at a much more robust 3 pounds, 3 ounces. 'They're my miracle babies,' said Pinheiro da Silva. 'Ronaldo because he stayed inside, and Alexandre because he's a survivor.'

"No stranger to courting controversy, Rush Limbaugh has suggested rapper Kanye West would have a hit record if he recorded the same racist chant that cost the SAE fraternity its University of Oklahoma house. Speaking about Sigma Alpha Epsilon's slurs on Wednesday's show, Limbaugh dragged the Grammy-winning rapper into his monologue and claimed hip-hop shared the blame for capitalizing on the N-word in so many lyrics. 'If this had been a song by Kim Kardashian's husband, and they'd sung this song at the Grammys, this would be a hit. Can we all agree with that?' he asked. Rush Limbaugh believes a racist chant that cost a fraternity its University of Oklahoma campus house 'would be a hit' if it was a Kanye West record . Limbaugh told his audience: 'If this had been a song by Kim Kardashian's husband, and they'd sung this song at the Grammys, this would be a hit. Can we all agree with that?' As The Daily News notes, Limbaugh's rant came after mentioning MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski's controversial Twitter post that wondered if the fraternity had learned the word from listening to hip-hop. 'I'm telling you that this stuff gets awards and the people that sing it are portrayed as American royalty in terms of celebrity. You can't deny that,' Limbaugh said. But on Twitter few thought Rush was right. '...sickened by Joe Scarborough and Rush Limbaugh thinking hip-hop the cause of already-racist frat boys,' wrote Twitter user Terry McCarty in Los Angeles. 'WE DON’T EVEN LIKE KANYE RIGHT NOW SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,' joked blogger Xavier D'Leau. Twitter users mocked Rush's claim after the show aired . Some were even outraged over his insinuation . As news broke of the Oklahoma University SAE freshman chanting 'there will never be a n***** in SAE' on a bus from the campus in Norman to the Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club, the university's president David Boren closed the campus fraternity. Following a swift investigation, he expelled the two ringleaders behind the song and said: 'I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma. I hope that the entire nation will join us in having zero tolerance of such racism when it raises its ugly head in other situations across our country.' Privately educated freshman Parker Rice, 19, and his sophomore friend Levi Pettit, 20, both from Dallas, expressed regret in the respective apologies as they accepted the expulsion but refused to explain who taught them the racist chant.","Radio host said argued frat members head the N-word more on hip-hop songs than anywhere else .

"A scandal-hit care home where staff were secretly filmed abusing an elderly dementia patient has banned relatives installing any more hidden cameras. Footage from a camera installed by the family of Gladys Wright, 79, showed her being pushed, shoved and pulled by staff at The Granary Care Home near Wraxhall, north Somerset. Three staff members can be heard calling the helpless pensioner a 'nasty aggressive b**ch' and telling each other to 'f*** her', throughout the recordings. Footage from a camera installed by the family of Gladys Wright, 79, showed her being pushed, shoved and pulled by staff at The Granary Care Home near Wraxhall, north Somerset . Three staff members can be heard calling the helpless pensioner a 'nasty aggressive b**ch' and telling each other to 'f*** her', throughout the recordings . The appalling treatment only came to light after Mrs Wright's son, James, placed a hidden camera in the room. He set the device up to reassure himself the treatment his mother was receiving in the specialist home was unlike the horror stories he had read about, but he was so disturbed by what he saw he immediately took the footage to police. The men, who were suspended from their positions as soon as the evidence came to light, pleaded guilty to the abuse, which took place in October and December 2012. Three care workers were later prosecuted for the abuse, which was caught on a camera installed by Mrs Wright's concerned son James. But now the company which runs The Granary Care Home near Wraxall, north Somerset, has introduced a policy banning covert cameras. Relatives have been told that any devices found during inspections of rooms will be removed and the footage retained. Shaw Healthcare says the ban is down to 'legal issues around filming people without their consent'. Liam Scanlon, head of safeguarding and compliance at Shaw Healthcare, said: 'Shaw healthcare condones the use of cameras so long as they are installed in a way that complies with the Mental Capacity Act and is in the best interest of the service user. 'Given the legal issues around filming people without their consent and the ability of those who may not have the mental capacity to give proper permission for this to take place, we ask relatives and residents to discuss the placement of cameras with us before they do it. 'That way, we can have an open dialogue with the family to address the reasons behind why they want to place cameras in the service user's room, and also to ensure that when cameras are installed it is done so in a way that complies with UK law, regulation and is in the service user's best interest.' But families say the policy 'negates the whole purpose' of hidden cameras, which bring them peace of mind. Now the company which runs The Granary Care Home near Wraxall, north Somerset, (pictured) has introduced a policy banning covert cameras . Retired solicitor Tim Sykes, whose 87-year-old mother and 60-year-old sister are at The Granary, has vowed mount a legal challenge to the ban. Mr Sykes, 58, said: 'By informing Shaw that cameras are in the room it negates the whole purpose of them. 'If cameras were not in the room at the time the elderly lady was being abused it is possible those three men may never have been caught and they could still be abusing residents to this very day. 'I, and many other relatives, do not accept this new ruling. 'I will be writing to Shaw to tell them this and also warning them that I will be bringing civil and criminal proceedings if they interfere with our actions in the best interest of our family members. 'My mother is paying more than £800 a week to live at The Granary. Her room there is what is left of her home and is her only bit of privacy and a space she can continue to command. 'She should be allowed to do what she wishes in this personal setting. 'Using cameras gives relatives peace of mind their relatives are being cared for as they should be.' Hidden camera footage was crucial in the prosecution of three carers at Bristol Crown Court in June last year. Video emerged in which Daniel Baynes, Tomasz Gidaszewski and Janusz Salnikow, can be heard calling Mrs Wright a 'nasty aggressive b**ch' and telling each other to 'f*** her'. Baynes, of Bath, was handed four months behind bars after admitting three counts of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity, and another of theft after he was caught stealing Mrs Wright's food. Video emerged in which Daniel Baynes, Tomasz Gidaszewski and Janusz Salnikow, abusing Mrs Wright . Salnikow, of Southmead, Bristol, who practised yoga while in the dock, was given two months in prison, suspended for two years after admitting three counts of ill-treatment. Gidaszewski, of Nailsea, north Somerset, was sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid work for admitting one count of the same.","Gladys Wright was a resident at the Granary care home in Somerset, wheres staff filmed abusing and manhandling 79-year-old .

"Five students, including Christopher Gibson, 18,  are in police custody for allegedly conspiring to kill another student on campus . Five students at a high school in Tucson are in police custody for allegedly conspiring to kill another student on campus. The five, who attend Flowing Wells High School, were arrested on Wednesday night and booked into jail on suspicion of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Four of the suspects are minors but police say they could all be charged as adults. They have named as Gabriel Quiroga, 15; Jessica Good, 17; Andrew Totten, 15; Anastasia Lakin, 17; and Christopher Gibson, 18. Officers went to the school on Wednesday after another student told Flowing Wells' administrative staff about the alleged plan. Tucson Police Department's Special Investigation Division carried out interviews and learned that the five students were involved in a weeklong plan to kill another student. 'Detectives determined that not only was there a plan but the five students accused would meet in the mornings and at lunch to discuss the details of the plan,' police spokesman Sgt. Pete Dugan told KHBS. 'Each meeting got further involved in the planning process, and the last meeting was when they decided to bring the weapon. Scroll down for video .

Police haven't release details of the motive for the plot, saying only that the group was having problems with the student who was their alleged target. 'It was not a random act,' Dugan said. 'They were targeting someone who hung out in the same group as them. Someone they were having problems with and decided to kill.

"A supermarket worker who battered a charity worker to death with a brick while taking a legal high is facing a life sentence. Malachi Lindo, 27, repeatedly bludgeoned 51 year-old  Phillip Steels in the street after taking the ecstasy clone Ethylone. The attack was so savage that when Mr Steels was discovered, lying in a pool of blood on the footpath, his face had been damaged beyond recognition and there was a gaping hole in the side of his head. Charity worker Phillip Steels (right) was repeatedly bludgeoned to death by Malachi Lindo (left) Psychiatrist Dr Ian Cumming told the court that Lindo was either suffering from drug induced psychosis or paranoid schizophrenia and concluded that Ethylone intensified the symptoms of mental illness. Ethylone is one of dozens of synthetic narcotics that have flooded the UK over the last decade. The most famous, mephedrone or meow meow, was implicated in a series of deaths across the UK which led to the law being changed in 2010 to categorise the drugs as Class B. Lindo said he could not remember the attack but told psychiatrists he believed he could pass through other dimensions. He admitted manslaughter, but an Old Bailey jury took 11 hours and 31 minutes to find Lindo guilty of murder by a majority of ten to one. Lindo showed no emotion as the verdict was read out, but paused briefly to look up at family members in the public gallery as he was taken down. Judge Paul Worsley QC told him: ‘As you know the sentence must be one of life imprisonment.’ The judge remanded Lindo in custody to be sentenced on Monday. Mr Steels was found lying in a pool of blood on the footpath. He had a large hole in the left side of his head and his face was damaged beyond recognition (collect picture) The Old Bailey heard Lindo and Mr Steels did not know each other before their chance meeting in Green Street, Enfield in London, in the early hours of 4 September 2014. Mr Steels, originally from Sligo, Ireland, was walking home after leaving a friend’s house at 1.30am when Lindo launched his attack. CCTV cameras captured part of the struggle as Mr Steels was knocked to the ground and hit repeatedly. Police were called to the scene at 1.38am after a passing motorist spotted the victim and reported a road traffic accident. Officers also spotted Lindo rolling about in the middle of the road about 50 yards away and ordered him to kneel on the ground before putting him in handcuffs. Lindo shouted: ‘Take me to heaven, kill me now, I want to die,’ and added ‘I’m not going to kill anyone else.’ He also asked the police to let him go home, adding: ‘I promise I won’t kill again.’ Lindo told officers he had taken cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis and added: ‘I’m a psychopath, I’m a psychic and I’ve got AIDS.’ Mephedrone, a legal high, known as meow meow, white magic, drone, bubble and MCAT, which was legal until April 2010 . Blood tests later revealed traces of THC, the active component of cannabis, and Ethylone. Police found skunk cannabis, MDEA and methylenedioxymethylcathinone concealed inside Lynx aerosols and other containers in Lindo’s bag. Prosecutor Anthony Orchard QC told the court Mr Steels’ death was ‘wholly unnecessary.’ Lindo, of Bowles Green, Enfield, admitted manslaughter but denied murder. He was convicted of a single count of murder. Over the past five years there has been an unprecedented increase in the number, type and availability of new psychoactive substances in Europe, with 101 new substances reported in 2014 alone. Yesterday, the government banned two groups of dangerous ‘legal highs’. The stimulant compound drug 4,4’-DMAR, which is linked to the deaths of more than 20 people in the UK, mainly Northern Ireland, and the synthetic opioid MT-45, have both been outlawed as Class A substances. The move is part of a crackdown on new psychoactive substances (NPS) – known as ‘legal highs’- and minister have already banned more than 500 new drugs. Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone said the action included the creation of the Forensic Early Warning System to identify substances previously unseen in the UK. Tomorrow a UK-led proposal to internationally control the drug mephedrone is expected to be passed by the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna. If it goes ahead, this would be the first time a NPS is controlled by all UN members. Experts have warned that deaths linked to ‘legal highs’ could overtake those linked to heroin by 2016 . Drugs experts have warned that deaths linked to ‘legal highs’ could overtake those linked to heroin by 2016. Deaths increased eightfold rising from 12 in 2009 to 97 in 2012, according to figures from Centre for Social Justice who claim the UK has the highest rate of legal highs use among young people in Europe. A survey of more than 13 000 young adults aged 15–24 in the EU Member States, found that 8 per cent had tried a new psychoactive substance at least once, with 3 per cent using them in the last year. Only last August, father-of-three Michael McKay, 33, from Arbroath, Angus, passed away at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee following a five-month addiction to new psychoactive substances (NPS), which caused him severe heart problems. In 2013, Adam Hunt, 18, died four days after taking the psychoactive substance AMT at his home in Southampton, Hampshire, after purchasing it from a website. In February last year Lewis Dale, 17, was jailed for stabbing his grandmother to death while high on the former legal high mephedrone after he hallucinated that a Swat team was after him and he needed to 'go to war'. He stabbed his grandfather Allan Dale, 80, twice with a kitchen knife before attacking his grandmother Irene Dale as she lay in her bed . In the same year, keen sportsman Jimmy Guichard, 20, suffered a heart attack and severe brain damage within hours of taking one of the herbal substances. The soaring death toll led to ministers calling the rise in the use of legal highs a 'national emergency'. Currently drug laws in Europe and North America only ban the use and sale of specific substances. Loss: 18-year-old Adam Hunt who died after taking a so-called 'legal high' he bought off the internet . This means new compounds developed by chemists can be sold without fear of prosecution until they are added to the list of controlled substances. Mephedrone, created by Dr Z and sold over the internet as plant food, caused at least one death and has been implicated in at least 13 others. The drug became popular among clubbers in 2007 as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for ecstasy. Mephedrone's popularity gave rise to a whole new market for legal highs sold over the internet. When the substance was finally banned in 2010, a range of other novel synthesised drugs had sprung up to take its place. They include psychoactive substances (NPS) and 6-APB, known commonly as Benzo Fury. Those attempts have now turned into a cat and mouse game with legislators, with chemists synthesising new substances faster them Parliament can ban them, spawning a whole industry to feed Britain's hunger for mind-altering substances. However, unlike drugs which have been around for years and for which risks are generally well known, the long term - and indeed short term - risks many of these new substances are still a mystery.","Malachi Lindo battered charity worker Phillip Steels, 51, to death in street .
