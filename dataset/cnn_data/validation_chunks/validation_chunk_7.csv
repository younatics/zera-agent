"Chris Ramsey will attempt to tame a monster of his own creation on Saturday, but fears talents such as Harry Kane will remain rare so long as clubs and fans apply fickle judgements to their homegrown players. The QPR manager was instrumental in his 10 years at Tottenham in the rise and breakthrough of Kane, but on Friday recalled the sort of attitudes that mean the 24-goal striker remains something of an exception in this country. ‘We played him towards the end of the season last year and the fans weren't having him,’ Ramsey said. ‘They were trying to get the galacticos on the pitch. We stuck to our guns and got a lot of flak for it. Harry Kane battles with Ki Sung-Yueng during Tottenham's clash with Swansea on Wednesday night . Chris Ramsey says that he is not surprised by Kane's remarkable rise to prominence at Tottenham . Kane breaks away from the challenge of Gary Cahill during the Capital One Cup final at Wembley last week . ‘Clubs have to stick their necks out to get English players playing in the Premier League, and getting them judged in the same way as players who cost a lot of money and don't produce.’ In Kane’s case, the bravery of Tim Sherwood and Mauricio Pochettino, his White Hart Lane successor, has been central to the 21-year-old proving he can thrive in the higher reaches of the Premier League. The same can be said of players such as Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Danny Rose, who have all excelled at times this season. But Ramsey added: ‘I know quite a lot of Spurs fans. I used to tell them about the players coming in. I said to a friend of mine that Ryan Mason is probably the best footballer at the club. Ramsey (right) was part of Tim Sherwood's backroom staff when Kane broke through to the first team . Many Tottenham fans were unhappy when Kane began to play in the first team (he is pictured on his debut in August 2011) but Ramsey says they stuck with him and were rewarded . Football data analysts BSports predict that a Spurs win at QPR is the most likely outcome on Saturday . ‘They don’t know what goes on in the background and they were like, “We need this person from this country and we need that guy from that country”. To Tottenham's credit and the manager's (Pochettino) credit, he has come in and has been very brave. All credit to him for being very unbiased to expensive players and actually seeing the players who are on form. ‘What normally happens is a player will go in, not do very well on their first game and then you will never see that player again. And then people will go and buy a player who is similar, who can play 10 bad games and the fans or the people will say, “Oh, he’s got to get used to the Premier League”. ‘Why should a player that £20m be given more favour than the player that comes from down the road and cost less money? That’s one of the biggest problems we have in this country.’","Chris Ramsey was at Tottenham before joining Queens Park Rangers .

"Aston Villa Tim Sherwood spoke exclusively to Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel this week, covering all topics from touchline antics to his spell with Tottenham. Here are the top 10 quotes from that brilliant interview. Aston Villa spoke to Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel in an exclusive interview this week . Sherwood on his leadership qualities . ‘I think I can be a leader of men, but you’re not born with that attitude. In the maternity ward, it’s not girls, boys and natural leaders. You have to become that.’ Sherwood on his touchline antics and emotional nature . 'I could try acting. I could sit down and make little notes and everyone would say I’ve matured. But I know that’s impossible. I can’t imagine being any different 500 games in. People thought I would calm down as a player, but I didn’t. The day I retired I was the same lunatic that made his debut for Watford in 1987. I can’t believe the other managers are not as emotionally involved as I am, either. I think they’re all like me inside. Sherwood says he can't believe other managers are not as emotionally involved as he is . Sherwood on his Aston Villa side . ‘We’re like Everton. I don’t think we’ve got a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle. We can’t be the Crystal Palace of last year, or the West Brom of this year. Digging in, blood and thunder, lump the ball in, protecting a lead, that’s not us. Our squad is better on the ball, they’re more suited to pushing for a place in the Europa League. Sherwood on his players stepping up . ‘The players have a duty, a responsibility to fix this mess. I don’t want to hear crap about how difficult it is to play at home. Playing for a big club comes with pressure. Anyone can do it for a lesser team — but you have to have b******s to play for Aston Villa. This is a big club. 'Aston Villa are like Everton... they're not a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle' Sherwood on not listening to criticism . ‘When I was at Blackburn there were times when it was difficult. My name would be read out and there were a few groans. I didn’t care. I’d sometimes tell David Batty, “I’ll give it away more times than you’ll get it this afternoon.” Sherwood on Nabil Bentaleb . ‘I’d watched him in training. Every day was like his last on earth. He would cry if he lost a five-a-side. He played and never looked back. Sherwood says he loved the way Nabil Bentaleb 'played and never looked back' last season at Tottenham . Sherwood on telling Redknapp to take Bale off in the San Siro . ‘Harry’s going mad. “Get f****** Gareth off?” he says. “He’s the only f****** chance we’ve got.” He keeps him on, he scores a hat-trick, gets us back to 4-3 and if it goes another 10 minutes, we win. The kid’s career springboards from that performance. Sherwood on playing with passion . ‘The coaches used to call me Tackler Tim, or some rubbish. One day, I put one in and he said to Graham Taylor, “Why’s he keep doing that?” I’ve never forgotten his answer. “Brian, you know that shirt you wear on Saturday?” he said. “That’s the shirt he wants.” He was right, too. Take a player like Jack Grealish. I’ve had lots of chats with Jack. He knows what I think. I tell him: “I will take desire over ability every day”. Obviously, the ability can’t be too low. But if you have the ability — and he has — you’ll make it if you have desire. Sherwood says you must have the desire and talent to make it at the top these days . The young manager was appointed last month to attempt to save Aston Villa's season . Sherwood on managing players . ‘So I didn’t come in here all guns blazing or wanting to be their headmaster. You can’t get personal these days, get your hair cut, and all that nonsense. You’ve got to move with the times. I left the stick at home, and the tickling brush. Now I feel I know them a bit better. Some get a whack, others a tickle. Sherwood on Tottenham . ‘I don’t want to be scrapping around; I want to take them forward. I think I did that at Tottenham. I didn’t leave a crumbling house — Mauricio Pochettino has done a good job, but he had it laid out for him, with players like Kane and Bentaleb.

"Tony Mowbray has been appointed Coventry's new manager, the club have announced. The former Middlesbrough and Celtic boss replaces Steven Pressley and has signed a contract at the Ricoh Arena until the end of the current season. Mowbray has been out of work since leaving Middlesbrough in October 2013 and had been keen to return to management. Former Middlesbrough manager Tony Mowbray has been appointed as the new boss of Coventry City . The 51-year-old had been out of work since leaving Championship outfit Middlesbrough in October 2013 . Chief executive Steve Waggott said on the club's official website: 'We are absolutely delighted to welcome Tony Mowbray to Coventry City as our new manager. 'We've secured the services of a highly-rated, experienced candidate for the job and Tony is a manager who has enjoyed plenty of success at a higher level. 'He has experience in coming into a club in challenging times and steering them through to safety and, on top of that, has enjoyed promotion too. 'We were all very impressed with Tony during the interview process and it speaks volumes that the club are able to attract a manager of Tony's calibre. Mowbray replaces Steven Pressley who was sacked last month - with the club flirting with relegation . 'We wanted someone who could come in and hit the ground running because we have 14 important games left in this season and the number one priority is to preserve our League One status. 'We have agreed terms until the end of the season and then, immediately after the final ball is kicked, we can reassess and look at a longer term deal. It was just vital, at this stage, to get the right man in to help steer us through the current situation between now and the end of the season. 'We believe Tony is exactly the right man for Coventry City and everyone here, from supporters to staff, will get right behind him.'

"Roy Hodgson is confident in Harry Kane's ability to shine for England, it is just a case of whether there is space for him in the upcoming squad. This has been quite the season for the 21-year-old, whose 24 goals in all competitions is far and away the best tally from any English striker this term. That form has impressed Three Lions boss Hodgson, who has strongly hinted recently that Kane will earn a first senior call-up in two weeks' time. England manager Roy Hodgson is open to the possibility of calling up Tottenham striker Harry Kane . The Spurs front man has is a regular in the England Under 21 set up and has been in great form for his club . Kane was far from his best in the Capital One Cup final but Hodgson said he thinks the striker is 'ready' It is not just the Spurs man vying for a striking berth, though, with a number of other in-form, uncapped players hoping to be involved against Lithuania and Italy. Saido Berahino, Danny Ings and Charlie Austin have all impressed for their clubs this season - but it is Kane who is the main talking point. 'He's in my thoughts of course, he deserves to be,' Hodgson said, speaking at the London Football Awards, which raises funds for national charity, Willow. 'He's scoring goals for one of our top teams in the Premier League but I know him anyway, he's done a lot of good work for the Under-21s. Burnley striker Danny Ings (right) is among the names for a call up to the Three Lions first team . QPR's Charlie Austin (left) and West Brom's Saido Berahino (right) have both been in fine scoring form . 'What pleases me most is young players are getting their chance to play. In the past 19, 20, 21-year-olds would be loaned out or would have to sit back and wait for their chance. Now more and more of them are taking the chance when they get it. 'I'm delighted for him and we'll see when I select my squad at the end of month if he's in it.' Asked whether Kane was ready to make the step up to the senior side, Hodgson said: 'He's ready. If he wasn't ready he wouldn't be playing for Tottenham and scoring lots of goals. 'The question you ask is has the player got the quality and talent we're looking for and is there a space for him? 'If he comes in then someone's going to drop out and most forwards we've got have done quite well in the autumn. 'But I can't include everyone unfortunately. It's not always a question of are they good enough, it's a question of is there space at this time.' However Kane is the one gaining all the attention having scored 24 goals in all competitions this season . Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck look set to be involved in the squad, while Rickie Lambert and Jermain Defoe are other experienced forward options when the national team reconvene after a four-month break. 'I am looking forward to it, we all are,' Hodgson said. 'Certainly I and my coaching staff are. I hope the players are looking forward to it, too. 'It will be nice to see them again. We did plan a little meeting in January but we found another way of staying in touch with them. 'It will be nice to see them physically again and I hope to see them in as good a shape as I thought they were last autumn.'

"Bradford City striker James Hanson boasts a rags-to-riches tale fit for any FA Cup romance but his focus is firmly on the future as the Bantams aim to book their place in a Wembley semi-final on Saturday. The story of how Hanson rose from stacking shelves in his local supermarket to starring for his home-city club on the biggest stage has had plenty of airing in the course of his side's recent knockout heroics. And as he prepares for the big Valley Parade quarter-final against Reading, the 27-year-old Hanson believes the time has come to put his tale of non-league toil behind him and set higher targets for himself and his club. James Hanson celebrates scoring from Bradford during their victory over Millwall in the third round replay . Chelsea were beaten 4-2 by League One outfit Bradford during the fourth round back in January . Hanson and Jon Stead (right) celebrate after beating Sunderland 2-0 in the fifth round . Hanson said: 'Ever since I started scoring goals for Guiseley in the Unibond League I had the confidence I could play at a higher level and there is no reason why both myself and Bradford can't achieve this. 'We've shown in recent seasons what we're made of. When I joined in 2009 we were struggling at the wrong end of League Two and since then we've gone to a League Cup final and got promotion and now this. 'The club is thriving at the moment and with the money the club has made from the cup runs and last year's promotion it should be a massive factor for the club in terms of how it is able to progress in the next few years.' Hanson is the only member of the current Bradford squad to cost a transfer fee - he was snapped up for £7,500 with the fee including the guarantee of a pre-season friendly. But Phil Parkinson's side have already emphatically proved their credentials in back-to-back wins over Premier League opposition to the extent that many are making them favourites against high-ranked opponents on Saturday. Phil Parkinson is preparing to send his side out to face Reading in the quarter-final on Saturday . Filipe Morais, pictured after scoring against Chelsea, is expected to be recalled following injury . Bradford made it to Wembley for the 2013 Capital One Cup final, where they were beaten by Swansea . Hanson added: 'We know there's no reason why we can't do it again after what we did against Chelsea and Sunderland but there is no doubt we are still going in as the underdogs. 'We're looking forward to another chance to test ourselves against higher-level opposition. They have a lot of players who have played in the Premier League so we know it is going to be a test.' The game holds particular appeal for Bantams boss Parkinson, who made 361 playing appearances for the Royals and was voted their best ever central midfielder in an online fans' poll. 'I had a fantastic period there and I'm very honoured to be a part of the club that moved from Elm Park to the Madejski Stadium, and to have seen the club develop over the years,' said Parkinson. 'They've been in the Premier League twice in the last nine years and they're a great model for a lot of clubs to look at.' Parkinson expects to be able to recall former Chelsea defender Filipe Morais who has missed the last three games with a knee injury, while Gary Liddle is available again after suspension.","Bradford City aiming to book place at Wembley in FA Cup semi-final .

"Birmingham staged a stunning late comeback to grab a 2-2 draw against Derby as the Rams missed the chance to go top of the Championship. County had looked in control after Jamie Ward's first goal since September and a Tom Ince strike had put them 2-0 up but Birmingham silenced the iPro Stadium by drawing level in stoppage-time through a Paul Caddis penalty and a Clayton Donaldson goal. It was not the result Derby wanted on a day when the crowd stood to join in a minute's applause before the game for former Rams great and manager Dave Mackay, who died on Monday at the age of 80. Clayton Donaldson (centre) was Birmingham City's hero as he scored a late equaliser against Derby . Donaldson (centre) headed home a 96th minute equaliser as Birmingham City drew 2-2 at Derby . Donaldson's goal sparked pandemonium on the Birmingham bench after they battled back from 2-0 down . Derby: Grant, Christie, Keogh, Albentosa, Forsyth, Hendrick, Mascarell, Hughes (Bryson 80), Ince, Russell (Dawkins 83), Ward (Lingard 74). Subs not used: Buxton,   Roos, Thomas, Shotton. Goals: Ward 20, Ince 48 . Booked: Christie, Forsyth, Ince. Birmingham: Randolph, Caddis, Spector, Kiernan, Grounds, Tesche, Davis, Cotterill, Shinnie (Thomas 64), Dyer (Gray 74), Novak (Donaldson 64). Subs not used: Robinson,   Reilly, Zigic, Doyle. Goals: Caddis 90+2, Donaldson 90+6 . Booked: Cotterill, Dyer . Referee: Iain Williamson . Attendance: 31,522 . The opener came as Will Hughes played in Johnny Russell just inside the area in the 20th minute and, although his low shot was parried by Darren Randolph, Ward arrived to score with a cross-shot that struck the inside of a post and bounced over the line. Hughes rattled the bar with a left-footed shot from 20 yards following a short corner in the 27th minute and Jeff Hendrick put Ince through five minutes later only for the winger to lose control. But the speed of Derby's passing and movement was starting to stretch Birmingham and when Ward got away down the left in the 39th minute, David Cotterill was booked for a blatant trip. The half ended on a flash-point with Birmingham boss Gary Rowett involved in a heated exchange on the touchline with several Derby players after he felt Russell should have given the ball back to his team instead of kicking into the corner. Rowett saw his team fall further behind three minutes after the break when Hughes found Ince on the right edge of the area and he slipped past two defenders before driving a low shot inside Randolph's right post. The match was marked with a tribute to former Derby player Dave Mackay - who died earlier this week .

Derby were close to a third minutes later when Russell had a shot blocked and Craig Forsyth's follow-up was scrambled away but Birmingham showed they were still in the game when Cotterill curled a free-kick narrowly wide in the 57th minute. Rowett made a double substitution in the 64th minute but Derby carried the greater threat with Hughes having a 20-yard shot charged down after Ince set him up. Birmingham had a chance to pull a goal back in the 77th minute when the ball broke to Clayton Donaldson 12 yards out but Forsyth got across to put the ball behind for a corner which Lee Grant held comfortably. The game was turned on its head in stoppage-time when Robert Tesche was tripped by Ince and Caddis sent Grant the wrong way with the penalty. Then, with the home fans screaming for the final whistle, Birmingham won a corner which was scrambled in by Donaldson after Wesley Thomas hooked the ball back to secure a dramatic point.

"The chance to test their mettle against the best is what attracts players and managers to the Champions League. But for one young coach who has already reached the promised land, it was the second tier of English football that provided his steepest learning curve. 'The Championship is really, really difficult!' Basle manager Paulo Sousa tells Sportsmail. 'Coaches who don't have that experience cannot realise how difficult it is. 'The standard of the players is more or less the same. It makes it very competitive right through the season. You can see in the way teams' positions change throughout the season, from the bottom and the top of the league. And the dreamland – the Premier League – is so, so close! Paulo Sousa gestures during a press conference at the Dragao stadium ahead of facing Porto . Basle's Fabian Frei, Naser Aliji, Arlind Ajeti,  Breel Embolo, head coach Sousa, Adama Traore, Taulant Xhaka, Fabian Schaer and Behrang Safari train ahead of their Champions League clash at Porto . 'I learnt a lot in that league. There were some points where I was not prepared enough, but you gain experience by doing, not just watching or listening. 'It's like jumping into a swimming pool at the deep end. You can see how to do it from the side, but you will never learn unless you jump in.' And jump in is precisely what Sousa did seven years ago when he left the safety of the Portugal junior set-up to become the face of Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone's project at Queens Park Rangers. Taking the reins under a couple of Formula One moguls with a four-year plan to reach the top flight might seem like a daunting prospect for a debutant manager, but not for Sousa. 'Nothing is too soon. I will always be thankful to Briatore. All the difficulties I got through at that club and all the demands he made of me gave me the opportunity to grow. It was so demanding on a daily basis – 24 hours every day from the first day I arrived there.' But what of Briatore's notorious habit of involving himself in managerial decisions? 'He tried. But I always fight for my convictions.' Basle manager Paulo Sousa says the Championship is a highly competitive league . Sousa's first job in club management was with Queens Park Rangers between 2008 and 2009 . It is widely believed that these convictions - a refusal to act merely as Briatore's touchline proxy - are what saw Sousa ejected from the Loftus Road hotseat after just 26 games in charge. The two-time Champions League winner would get a second chance at Championship success just two months later though, taking over from Roberto Martinez at Swansea in June 2009. Under chairman Huw Jenkins, Sousa was given time to get his ideas across, and a subsequent seventh-placed finish – the club's highest for 27 years – showed it was time well spent. But the manager's progress hadn't gone unnoticed, and when moneybags Leicester came calling, Sousa couldn't resist. It quickly transpired that swapping the Mumbles for the Midlands was a mistake – Sousa was sacked after less than three months in charge – and the former Portugal international readily admits to a lapse of judgment in that summer of 2010. The Portuguese coach also had a spell in charge of Welsh side Swansea City between 2009 and 2010 . As a player, Sousa won the Champions League with Juventus and Borussia Dortmund (pictured) During his playing career, Sousa also spent time with Greek giants Panathinaikos between 2000 and 2001 . 'When I left Swansea, my ambition pushed me to take decisions in the direction of better infrastructures, better club history and higher prospects to reach the Premier League. 'Instead of seeing the whole forest, I saw only the beautiful tree in front of me. Swansea has lots of beautiful trees, but at that moment I didn't recognise that. That I regret.' That season, with Sousa clubless, Swansea were promoted to the Premier League under the guidance of Brendan Rodgers. Sousa insists it was not difficult to see his former club achieve what he narrowly missed out on the previous year. Instead he looked back fondly on his time there, though not everyone at the club regards the Sousa era with such nostalgia. Then captain and now manager Garry Monk has since released an outspoken autobiography in which he claimed Sousa's spell at the club had been a 'wasted season' and he was 'glad we didn't get into the play-offs as he did not deserve to be the one to take us to the Premiership'. These comments resonated with Sousa: 'Look, he's a person I want to succeed, like everyone. But unfortunately he said things about me and I don't appreciate people talking about somebody when they don't have the courage to say it up front. 'He is well integrated in the club, but the key for success at Swansea is the leadership of Jenkins and the support of the board members, not one manager.' Current Swansea manager Garry Monk played under Sousa and is very critical of his former boss . The 44-year-old has managed to lead Basel through the group stages of this year's Champions League . Indeed, if Sousa did not deserve promotion with Swansea, few could argue that five years later, after negotiating a group containing Real Madrid and Rodgers' s Liverpool side, he hasn't earned the right to fight for a place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Going toe-to-toe with Rodgers – whom he describes as 'a top coach and a top person' – was a satisfying narrative. But for Sousa, now 44, travelling to Anfield knowing the winner would reach the last 16 was all the motivation he needed. 'I love the challenge. To play against the best gives us the possibility to become better. 'Liverpool are an important club who invest lots of money on players, but they were beaten by Basle. Basle didn't just defend and look for an opportunity to counter, Basle wanted to be the protagonist. Basle deserved to go through.' On Tuesday, all that stands in between Basle and a first European Cup quarter-final since the playing days of Ottmar Hitzfeld is a formidable Porto side. After a 1-1 draw in the home leg two weeks ago, Sousa admits it's a tall order. Sousa has described Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (left) as a 'top coach and top person' 'I always think we have a chance to win, but we recognise their superior quality. They didn't lose one game in the group stage, and they've only lost three all season. 'We compete with what we have and my players are proud of what they've done. They are ambitious and courageous, and this gives us the possibility to achieve magical nights.' And should the Estadio do Dragao bare witness to another of Basle's magical nights, who does Sousa have his eye on in the last eight? Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, perhaps? 'It would be amazing for our club. He is one of the best coaches in the world. Some people love him, some people don't love him – but his record will always be there. 'I'm really proud of all the Portuguese coaches abroad. Their success feels like my success because I know how difficult it is to do well in a foreign country!' He certainly does, and with Basle seven points clear at the top of the Swiss Super League and rubbing shoulders with Europe's elite, he looks to have well and truly overcome those difficulties. But is it only a matter of time until, once again, the ambitious Sousa tries his luck across the English Channel? ‘My near future is all about what I am doing now in this club. I'm not predicting I'll be in England one day, but I know I could make the Premier League some day in the future.’ Porto's Casemiro (right) vies with Basle's Breel Emobolo during the Champions League round of 16 tie .

"Jon Stead was looking forward to a pre-season trip to the Algarve when he noticed his passport on the bench beneath his peg in the Huddersfield Town dressing-room. Strange. He had only just handed it in. It was then that he scanned – and rescanned - the squad list for the warm-weather getaway. Stead was grounded. ‘I didn’t know what I’d done wrong, the manager (Mark Robins) never said a word to me,’ the 31-year-old tells Sportsmail as he reflects on the shock of his summer exile. Jon Stead (front) celebrates Bradford's famous comeback win against Chelsea in the FA Cup fourth round . The Huddersfield loanee converts the Bantams' second goal against Sunderland in the fifth round . ‘I thought, “What sort of season am I going to have here?”. It was a surprise because I felt good, but I certainly knew where I stood when I saw my passport. ‘They left me behind and went to Portugal. I was getting changed in the senior dressing-room by myself every day, it was soul-destroying.’ Eight months on, however, and it is Stead who is flying. On Saturday lunchtime the Bradford City loanee will bid to extend his remarkable run of having scored in every round of the FA Cup when Reading visit Valley Parade. He is one win away from a first appearance at Wembley. ‘I never dreamt my season would play out like this,’ he says. ‘I was left to train with the Under-21s but the young lads gave me enthusiasm and it was pleasure to work with them. I just went back to basics and worked my socks off. Stead was left out of the squad for Huddersfield's pre-season tour but is now in fine scoring form at Bradford . ‘After that I just needed that chance to go and play and unleash myself. Bradford has been perfect for me.’ His dad is a police detective and has worked in football, including spotting hooligans at the World Cup. Stead was Bristol City’s player of the year in 2011-12, despite playing only six hours of football before the end of February. He is from Holmfirth, the West Yorkshire village where Last of the Summer Wine was filmed. P.S. Stead has five goals and three assists in the FA Cup this season. Only Saido Berahino (five goals, four assists) has been involved in more goals. It was in October that Stead journeyed north across the M62 and joined the League One Bantams. Within a few weeks he was scoring the goal which, on reflection, he admits could prove the most important of them all. Phil Parkinson’s side were trailing 1-0 at Halifax in the First Round and had barely laid a finger on the Conference outfit when Stead pounced to level in the second half. ‘It’s incredible to be on this scoring run, but the goal everyone forgets is the one at Halifax - without that we might not be here now,’ he says. After that came a cool finish in a 4-1 victory over Dartford before a close-range sweep to help dispose of Millwall during a 4-0 triumph on home soil, the prize for which was a trip to Chelsea. At 3.40pm they trailed 2-0 to the Premier League leaders and odds of 1000/1 were available on a turnaround. It was then that Stead drilled home from the edge of the area. ‘Without that I think the game would have drifted away,’ he says. Bradford won 4-2 to set up a home tie against Stead’s former club Sunderland, whose fans once produced a T-shirt mocking the striker’s 30-game wait for his first goal. The striker now has five goals in the prestigious tournament this term, including this strike against Chelsea . Stead (right) celebrates after beating Sunderland 2-0 in the fifth round with team-mate James Hanson . It was sweet, then, when he fired the tie-clincher during a 2-0 victory in front of 4,000 travelling Black Cats. ‘Not only was it a crucial goal but it was nice to prove a point,’ he says. ‘They had their opinion of me, although I always took the T-shirt in good spirit. ‘But these things have a habit of biting you on the backside, don’t they? ‘One newspaper were trying to get me to wear the T-shirt underneath my Bradford top. I thought about it but I would have looked stupid had we got beat and I didn’t score.’ The goal marked the 100th of Stead’s career. Billed as the next Alan Shearer when Blackburn paid hometown Huddersfield £1.25million 11 years ago, the England Under-21 regular never scaled the heights perhaps expected. ‘Everything had been so good for me at Huddersfield. I had no experience of things going wrong,’ he recalls. ‘It didn’t work out at Blackburn or Sunderland but I didn’t have the knowhow to turn it around. Stead was mocked for his strike rate at Sunderland (right) but proved a point with a goal against his old club . ‘It wasn’t until Sheffield United in the Premier League that I rediscovered myself. Then we had the Carlos Tevez affair and were relegated. It just felt like little breaks were going against me. ‘But I’m proud of what I have achieved over 10 years at Championship level. The gaffer says I’m actually getting better – I’m certainly not getting quicker! ‘I think he’s got a point though. I feel I’m playing at a higher level for longer periods. After what happened during the summer I feel like I have a renewed energy for it. ‘It’s good timing, especially with my deal being up in the summer. It’s nice to get my name out there and I have got a lot of football left in me. ‘There will be discussions with Bradford and if I stay that will be fantastic.’ Stead, meanwhile, has had to persuade his lucky mascot and four-year-old daughter Isabelle to come to today’s game rather than a pantomime. Should her dad score in another Bradford upset then it will be him taking centre stage in a Wembley semi-final. Forget the Algarve, now that would be the dream ticket.

"Bradford boss Phil Parkinson says reaching the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley would be a bigger achievement than their improbable march to the Capital One Cup final two years ago. The Bantams will book their place in the last four of the nation's most prestigious knockout competition for the first time in 104 years if they overcome Reading in a Saturday lunchtime kick-off at Valley Parade. Victories over Chelsea and Sunderland have helped write another special chapter in the club's recent cup history and Parkinson is convinced it could rank as the best one yet. Phil Parkinson believes the big teams in the Premier League are jealous of Bradford . Chelsea were beaten 4-2 by League One outfit Bradford during the fourth round back in January . Parkinson said: 'The FA Cup is obviously a level above the Capital One Cup. If we can do it this time it will be the first time since 1911 and this group of players will be remembered. 'This is what being involved in football is all about, and the big teams from the Premier League will be casting very envious eyes on ourselves and Reading playing in an FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday.' Parkinson managed to protect his side's status as outsiders prior to the fifth-round win over the Black Cats and accepts it is harder to sustain the underdog mentality as the rounds go by. And despite many neutrals expecting to see the Bantams sail through to the semi-finals, Parkinson warned that Saturday's showdown could prove even tougher than their two previous rounds. Filipe Morais, pictured after scoring against Chelsea, faces a late fitness test on a knee injury . 'We are playing a team from a higher division who have been in the Premier League twice in the last nine years, and we are enjoying testing ourselves against these types of teams,' added Parkinson. 'Right from the Millwall game through the Chelsea and Sunderland games we just speak to the lads about testing themselves and hoping to perform to the maximum. 'But we are under no illusions at all that to get through this game we are going to have to play probably better than we have at any point this season so far.' Former Chelsea defender Filipe Morais will face a late fitness test on a knee injury which has forced him to miss the Bantams' last three games.","Bradford take on Reading in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Saturday .

"Roy Keane has urged Manchester United fans to give Louis van Gaal up to three years to prove himself at the Old Trafford helm. The Dutch manager oversaw another disappointing performance and result in United's 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal at Old Trafford on Monday night. Danny Welbeck returned to his old stomping ground to score the winner after Wayne Rooney levelled Nacho Monreal's strike in the first half, but it was yet another lacklustre display under Van Gaal that irked United supporters. United's legendary midfielder Roy Keane says Louis van Gaal should get more time in charge at Old Trafford . Van Gaal came under more criticism for another lacklustre display in the 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal . Keane was in the studio with former England stars Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Ian Wright . Their hero Keane, however, maintained the manager needs more time with fans unaware of what the job entails. 'Van Gaal is going to get criticised, you'd expect that,' Keane said during his BBC Match of the Day analysis. 'Give the man a chance - two or three years. A lot of fans don't quite understand how to run a football club as big as Manchester United. 'They should have given David Moyes more time but didn't. What are they going to do? Chop and change again? Van Gaal has been in the door two minutes. It takes time. It's literally a rebuilding job. A dismayed Marouane Fellaini (left), Michael Carrick (centre) and Wayne Rooney after Arsenal's winner . Danny Welbeck broke the hearts of his boyhood club by pouncing on an error to send Arsenal to Wembley . 'It would be a disaster if United don't finish in top four. The big problem with people at the club and ex-players is they keep looking back comparing teams from 10 years ago. 'They have got to look forward. Focus on the players, focus on the manager... get right behind him. I still think they have enough to get in that top four.' Keane's old sparring partner, former Newcastle and England striker Alan Shearer, was more damning. He said: 'Manchester United's main priority this season is finishing in the top four. If they don't then it will be a catastrophe. 'They have spent a lot of money on players. There's a hell of a lot more money that needs to be spent to get them anywhere near where they want to be. 'There isn't another team in the Premier League that passes it back more than Manchester United.' Wayne Rooney's flying header to equalise for United in the first half couldn't stop his side crashing out . Angel Di Maria's red card was the final blow for United as Van Gaal's troops lost their heads . Keane and Shearer's battle of words during the BBC's FA Cup analysis were nothing compared to what the hot-headed duo got up to in their playing days. Neither was a player the opposition wanted to get on the wrong side of, so no battle was more fierce than when the two clashed. Keane lashes out at Shearer when the two came to blows at St James's Park in 2001 . The former United captain named Shearer as a player he 'always had in the back of his mind' in his recent autobiography The Second Half alongside other famous foes like Patrick Vieira and Alf-Inge Haaland. Keane made it clear that although he regularly came across Alan Shearer while working as a TV pundit, there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other. Keane picked Shearer out as a player he always had in the back of his mind alongside Patrick Vieira . The most famous flashpoint came in 2001 at St James' Park. The two skippers came head to head and Keane was shown a red card for lashing out at the England man. It was the first time the former United maestro had appeared in the BBC studio after a long association with terrestrial rivals ITV. Keane has to be held back by David Beckham during the infamous row that saw the United man sent off .","Keane: 'Fans don't quite understand how to run a club as big as United'

"Tim Sherwood has expressed his relief at Aston Villa's crucial victory against West Brom and claims the three points are so important, that he'd rather them than his wife win the Euro Millions jackpot. Christian Benteke's last-minute penalty earned the former Tottenham boss his first win in charge as Villa climbed out of the Premier League relegation places. During the game, Sherwood was a bundle of energy on the touchline but could hardly bear to watch as his Belgian striker kept his cool to slot the ball past Ben Foster. VIDEO Tim Sherwood: Told the wife I'd take three points over lottery jackpot . Sherwood appeals to the referee after Matt Lowton was brought down by Ben Foster in stoppage time . The Aston Villa boss looks to the heavens as his side pressed for a winner against West Brom at Villa Park . Sherwood celebrate with his staff after Christian Benteke's penalty sealed a vital victory for his strugglers . Sherwood went through an emotional rollercoaster and held his pulse to the Aston Villa fans . 'It's incredible, a fantastic feeling to win. My wife said she did the Euro Millions and gets £54million if she wins. I said I'd rather take three points and I genuinely mean that,' he said on BT Sport. 'It's brilliant to win because in the first games we were not that fantastic, but we were vastly improved today. We need to improve but we are making ground. I think it's important the guys spark the crowd. We did that early by pressing off the ball. 'We mixed the game up at times by going long and short and we gave fans something to cheer about. This is a big club at the wrong end of the division.' Sherwood says he'd rather take the three points then his wife win the Euro Millions jackpot . The 2-1 result also ended a seven-game losing run for Villa and lifted them out of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone. Sherwood felt his pulse and gestured to the Villa fans as he walked off and believes the strugglers are fighting again. 'I was saying we're alive. There were people who wrote us off but we're alive and kicking. People will look at that result but the performance was great,' he said, with Villa three points clear of the drop zone. It was a tense affair throughout the 90 minutes and Sherwood appeared to show every kind of emotion . Benteke scored in the league for the first time since December and Sherwood admitted the striker had told him exactly what he would do with a penalty. He said: 'Goalscorers are there to be shot down and it takes a brave man to stand up there. I asked him before the game if he gets a penalty what he was going to do. 'He said 'I'll wait until the goalie goes down and I'll roll it in the corner'. I was still peeping through my fingers.' Gabby Agbonlahor opened the scoring and had two cleared off the line, while also having a penalty claim ignored after he beat Foster to the ball.

We'll dust ourselves off and get going on Thursday.' Pulis also played down Alan Hutton's challenge on Berahino which saw the pair square up to each other late in the game. He said: 'I haven't seen the Hutton challenge. There has been a lot of criticism thrown at referees recently but I'm not going to go there. I'll let other people decide what they thought about it. 'The most important thing was Villa were better than us in the first half. They were quicker, kept the ball better and we wanted half-time. The second half was a different game.'

"When Gus Poyet lost his temper and took out his anger on a cooler box — emptying dozens of drinks bottles and scattering ice on the touchline — it was in protest at so much more than Jack Rodwell’s booking for diving. The yellow was merely the tipping point which made the Uruguayan see red. Rather, there was frustration at the rapid unravelling of Sunderland’s season and his reputation. He chose to take it out on Steve Bruce, marching over to the Hull boss in apparent offering of a friendly handshake before sarcastically applauding in his face. Bruce, understandably, reacted and only the intervention of the assistant referee prevented a physical confrontation. Hull boss Steve Bruce and Sunderland manager Gus Poyet were on good terms before the crucial game . However things turned sour when Bruce and Poyet began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart . Bruce appeared to take exception to Poyet's sarcastic applause of a referring decision by Mike Dean . The two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other . All eyes were on the technical area as the opposing bosses threatened to come together . Poyet had lost his head. Twenty-four hours earlier he had lost star winger Adam Johnson — his four-goal top scorer — after his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an underage girl. He responded by naming four central-midfielders in a 4-4-2 system. It was a bizarre decision which smacked of protest at what he perceives to be a lack of attacking options provided by the club’s hierarchy. That they escaped with a draw was more to do with good fortune, Rodwell’s late equaliser having appeared to go in via his arm. The linesman cuts across an incensed Bruce as Poyet turns his back on the Hull manager . As the pair locked horns Bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in Poyet's direction . But there was enough to worry followers of the Black Cats after another insipid display. As for Poyet’s indiscipline, it soon spread through the team. Lee Cattermole was booked for a blatant kick on David Meyler in the second half and will miss the next two matches. He was substituted moments later. Earlier there had been a reckless lunge by Liam Bridcutt, for which he was lucky not to be sent off and Wes Brown could have seen red for the foul which led to Dame N’Doye’s opener. Poyet was sent to the stands for his antics and could face further punishment after the game . Poyet had been vanquished to the stands just before half-time and the concern must now be that Sunderland, too, could be vanquished to the Championship. The head coach said before the game he was shocked by Sunderland’s involvement at the wrong end of the table. Perhaps he should take a closer look at the numbers. His team have now won just one in 11 league games and have scored just once in more than eight hours of football. The Uruguayan looks in deep thought as he finds his seat among the supporters after his dismissal . The 47-year-old watches on with interest as his side searched for the equaliser at the KC Stadium . Poyet talks of implementing his own style of play which will, in the long term, excite supporters. There is precious little evidence of that offensive brand at present and, Rodwell’s leveller apart, they barely mustered an effort on goal. The body language of Jermain Defoe told its own story. Dropping deep in an attempt to enjoy a rare feel of the ball as they trailed after the break, he was robbed of possession by one of his own players. Paul McShane (right) is in disbelief as Rodwell's header in the 77th minute rescues a point for the Black Cats . Sunderland boss Poyet reacts animatedly to Jack Rodwell's equalising goal from the stands of the KC Stadium . Defoe flapped his hands in dismay. It was yet another show of a side sadly lacking in organisation and discipline. But when you have a boss who starts with four central-midfield players and is himself sent off just when you need his guidance more than ever, what chance do you stand? That they got a point had little to do with their absent manager.","Gus Poyet was sent to the stands during Sunderland's game with Hull .

"You begin to believe Tim Sherwood after a night like this. Aston Villa’s first win since December 7 came in the 94th minute through their first penalty award of the season. It was late, it was a little lucky, but it was deserved. A roar rose out of Villa Park louder than any heard in a long while. Sherwood, hugged and lifted by goalkeeping coach Tony Parks, looked like he was emitting the most decibels. In the instant Christian Benteke rolled the ball beyond Ben Foster from 12 yards the mood in this stadium lifted.

CLICK HERE to see Sportsmail's MATCH ZONE feature for goals (like Agbonlahor's - above), heat maps, statistics and more. Seven consecutive defeats punctuated by one mighty win. How momentous it proves remains to be seen, the battle will present many turns, but this felt seismic. Sherwood owes a large dose of gratitude to Foster, mind you. In the third minute of added time the West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper launched into a calamitous dive after fumbling a bouncing ball, bringing down Matt Lowton in the process. Referee Jonathan Moss pointed to the penalty spot. Benteke was the calmest man in the ground, placing the ball the other side of Foster. No longer do Villa hold the unwanted tag of only side in England’s top four divisions without a league win in 2015. It was earned based on a display of vigour, purpose and creativity. Gabby Agbonlahor, scorer of Villa’s first, played his best game in recent memory. Albion boss Tony Pulis conceded Foster had a ‘poor night’ but refused to blame his No 1. Foster looked shaky throughout and played a part earlier in the decisive goal by only palming Fabian Delph’s shot from long range. He saved Leandro Bacuna’s rebound but Alan Hutton collected the ball and delivered the cross that ultimately led to the penalty award. Hutton’s involvement at this stage was moot. He should have been dismissed earlier for a nasty lunge on Saido Berahino, who received studs into his midriff. Agitated, Berahino reacted. Joleon Lescott appeared to offer Hutton down the tunnel in a ruckus. Moss booked Berahino and Hutton, meaning retrospective action from the FA on the Scottish right-back is unlikely. Before Benteke struck, it had seemed Berahino’s equaliser would crush Villa. In the 66th minute the Albion striker applied a simple header from two yards out after Lescott had headed back Chris Brunt’s corner. His 12th Premier League goal of the season is only three behind Villa’s total — an example of their struggles as much as his fine form. Foster capped a terrible performance by bringing down Matt Lowton in the third minute of added time for a penalty . Berahino celebrates while being chased by his team-mates, it was his 18th goal of the season in all competitions . Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood ran down the touchline and celebrated vigorously after Agbonlahor's goal .

Foster saves himself from a howler during the first half after the ball slipped out of his hands and almost ended up in his own net . Foster initially caught the shot from Agbonlahor but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly . Agbonlahor reacts after West Brom keeper Foster almost dropped the ball over his own goal line in the first half . Sherwood, who had seen his team lose to an injury time penalty to Stoke in his first home match in charge, was in no mood to downplay his first win as Villa manager. ‘It was the best feeling in the world,’ he said. ‘When I left home my missus said she had done the Euromillions. £54million. But I said I would rather have three points all day. Seriously. ‘It was massive, huge for us. We deserved to win the game but it was nice to get a slice of luck. I thought we started really well and inspired the fans. The boys in the dressing room want to give them a lot of confidence.’ At the end he checked his pulse by pressing fingers to neck. ‘I was just checking I was still alive,’ he laughed. ‘But we’re alive and kicking.’ Coming against the club that elected to employ Pulis rather than him in their own relegation fight must have offer pleasure. Foster almost gifted Villa the lead in the 14th minute. He can thank goalline technology that parity was maintained. Delph sent over a cross that was headed back into danger by Benteke. Agbonlahor spun and hit a tame shot that Foster looked like he had collected until the ball squirmed through his legs and apparently over the line before the keeper reclaimed it. Replays showed there was an inch in it. But Villa found confidence. In the 23rd minute the home roar was released. Brad Guzan fired a clearance high and long, Benteke leapt to win the flick-on and release Agbonlahor, whose pace left Lescott in the dust. The Villa striker raced into the box and delivered a finish through the legs of Foster, ahead of Gareth McAuley’s dive. As Villa Park erupted, Agbonlahor ran in front of the West Brom supporters cupping his ear. Sherwood jigged down the touchline towards the Holte End, his hands gripped in fists of delight. It was a similar scene at the final whistle and later a disappointed Foster tweeted his apologies. ‘I love you all,’ he said. Unfortunately for him, those feeling will be reciprocated by Villa and their fans. Not least Sherwood.

At the age of 31, this is likely to be former Barcelona midfielder Toure’s final big-money contract . But Financial Fair Play rules are an issue and City would be reluctant to offer him a pay increase. Instead, they are exploring other incentives, with an ambassadorial role or even a coaching position being talked about. It is a far cry from last summer when Toure threatened to leave after being angered that the club did not acknowledge his birthday sufficiently. But while it seems Toure could end his career in Manchester, defender Bacary Sagna is growing agitated at his bit-part role and may consider his future at the end of the season. Roma coach Rudi Garcia is understood to be monitoring the 32-year-old’s situation with a view to a summer switch. Sagna signed a three-year deal upon arriving from Arsenal on a free transfer last summer. Bacary Sagna has failed to hold down a first-team place and is growing frustrated at his bit-part role . The France defender has started just 12 games for Manchester City so far this season . Roma boss Rudi Garcia is understood to have taken an interest in Sagna's position at Manchester City . But he has made only 12 starts while failing to dislodge Pablo Zabaleta as the club’s first-choice right back. That lack of action is frustrating the France defender, who was a regular at the Emirates. Sources close to the player say he is keen to help City challenge for the Premier League and Champions League. But if his first-team chances don’t improve, Sagna may look elsewhere for regular football. City, however, are in a position of strength as Sagna will have two years left on his contract this summer. Meanwhile, New York City head coach Jason Kreis has refused to dwell on the furore surrounding Frank Lampard’s delayed move from City. He said: ‘This means some other guys are going to get meaningful opportunities in his position. We’re going to have a player who’s at the top of his game to give us a boost in the middle of the season.’","Yaya Toure has two and a half years left on his Manchester City contract .

"Jose Mourinho says skipper John Terry is 'guaranteed' to stay at Chelsea next season. Terry is out of contract in the summer, but terms over a new 12-month deal are close to be being agreed. And Mourinho insists Terry is certain to stay at Stamford Bridge beyond the end of the campaign. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . John Terry will sign a new contract with Chelsea to stay at the club for another year, Jose Mourinho confirmed . Mourinho wants to see Terry leading his side again next season and has guaranteed that his skipper will stay . Mourinho's words come after Terry spoke out about his bid to earn a new deal at Stamford Bridge . Terry has a word with Mourinho as they embrace on the Wembley pitch after winning the Capital One Cup . When asked about when his captain's contract situation would be sorted on Tuesday, Mourinho said: 'Yes, it will be before the end of the season for sure. 'What I can guarantee is he will be a Chelsea player next season. I can guarantee that. 'To guarantee that, it's because I know what my board tell me and what the player tells me. No doubts he is going to get his contract, no doubts. I think it's around that (terms agreed but not signed).' Mourinho's words come after Terry spoke out following the Capital One Cup final about his bid to earn a new deal at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho was certain that Terry was going to be part of his squad for the 2015-16 Premier League season . Mourinho and Terry pose together with the Capital One Cup at Wembley Stadium on Sunday . Terry scored Chelsea's opener at Wembley and then held firm in defence as the Blues ran out 2-0 winners over Tottenham and afterwards he revealed his inspiration came from trying to prove people wrong who had written him off. 'I am fighting for myself and my family, and to prove people wrong,' he said. 'It doesn't come much bigger than that. I want to give it everything. 'I don't know how long I have left. Hopefully I have a few years left but if this is my last year then I hope it will go out on a bang. The Chelsea boss could bring Kurt Zouma into midfield again in the absence of Nemanja Matic . It looks like Mourinho and Terry will be spending at least another year together at Stamford Bridge . 'I have my little target to play next year but beyond that, two or three years (more), I don't know.' Mourinho refused to confirm whether Kurt Zouma would again start in midfield against West Ham on Wednesday with Nemanja Matic and John Obi Mikel both still out through suspension and injury respectively. 'I don't play same team (as at Wembley), that's for sure,' Mourinho said. 'He (Zouma) is not a midfield player. He is not going to be a midfielder. That is completely clear. It's not his future. 'But the team is better when you know the qualities of everybody, when you know everybody can be extra in some details, and if Zouma couldn't do that for us on that day, we would have been in trouble.'

"Serie A frontrunners Juventus travel to Roma in a top-of-the-table clash at the Stadio Olimpico on Monday night. It is a chance for Massimiliano Allegri's men to edge even further ahead of the pack and increase their lead to 12 points at the summit of the Italian top flight. However Roma will be keen for victory in front of a home crowd in order to claw back some lost ground against the Old Lady. Paul Pogba has been in scintillating form for Juventus this term, but starts on the bench against Roma . Juve are on a 15-game unbeaten run in Serie A, and have lost just one league game all season away to Genoa in October. Roma on the other hand have won just twice in their last nine games, drawing seven. Host commentator . That's it from me tonight, an entertaining contest to say the least! Thank you for joining us. Goodnight! And there we have it! A fantastic comeback from Roma to earn themselves a point against Juve. Admittedly, the home side were outplayed for most of the game but their response to conceding the goal and going down to ten men must be admired. Juventus will be happy with the draw and keeping their nine-point gap between themselves and Roma intact. Padoin is brought on for Lichtsteiner, who is cursing his luck as he leaves the field of play. Risky play from Florenzi in his own half but he manages to squirm free and get Roma on an attack but it comes to nothing. Silly, petulant tackle from the Chilean. He's been asking for that. Morata is replaced by Coman. After being silenced by Tevez's free kick, the Stadio Olimpico has truly erupted since Keita's equaliser. The substitute goes in the book for a poor tackle. Keita gets the leveller for the 10 men of Roma after getting on the end of Florenzi's free kick. The Malian heads in the loose ball, to send the home support into raptures. Just 12 minutes remaining. This one's really getting nasty. Iturbe on the sharp end of two stinging Juventus challenges deep in the opposing half. The Argentine has really made an impact since his introduction. Juventus rightly impressed with Tevez's magical free kick. De Sanctis could merely watch as the ball glided into his top left corner. Garcia makes his third and final change as De Rossi makes way for Belgium international Nainggolan. Manolas rises highest to meet a free kick from deep, forcing Buffon into his first real piece of action of the game. Rudi Garcia has sprung into action since the Juve goal and brings on Iturbe for Totti. Ljajic makes way for Florenzi as the hosts look to respond. The Argentinian steps up to take the resulting free kick and bends one in from 25 yards. One hell of a blow for 10-man Roma. As Vidal is played through on the edge of the box, the Greek full back clips the heels of the Juve forward. Intentional or not, he was the last man and was rightfully dismissed. The Roma defender is the latest to go in the referee's book for a foul as Juve threaten to counter. Juve will be unhappy that an advantage wasn't played, but the resulting free kick leads to a wasteful cross. The Bosnian is cautioned for a rash tackle. Morata fouls Yanga Mbiwa and is booked for his troubles. Lichtsteiner shoots from distance but his shot doesn't trouble De Sanctis. The visitors are beginning to ask questions of Roma, who have started the second half rather sloppily. Lichtsteiner shoots from distance but doesn't trouble De Sanctis. The visitors beginning to ask questions of their opponents now. Sloppy start to the second half from Roma. Tevez breaks on the counter and slides Vidal through, but his shot goes just inches wide to the right of goal. Chiellini is in fine form tonight. He looks almost invincible as he slides in to intercept Gervinho on the halfway line. Yanga Mbiwa sloppily gives the ball straight to a Juventus attacker, but clears his lines with his second chance. Roma get the second period underway. Both sides unchanged after the half-time team talks. Roma's Yanga Mbiwa (left) challenges Juventus striker Carlos Tevez for a header in a feisty first half at the Stadio Olimpico. A stubborn defensive performance from Juventus in that first half. Roma with the lion's share of possession but they're finding it tricky to find holes in the Juve rearguard. Allegri will be the happier of the two managers after the opening 45 minutes, and the pressure is on Roma to produce a goal in the second period. Juventus find themselves in a three-on-two situation but as Tevez takes a shot at goal from the edge of the 18-yard box, his effort is deflected out for a corner that is dealt with easily by De Sanctis. Evra is shown a yellow card for a foul on Torosidis. It looks like there's no way through for Roma as the visitors defend with eight men back in their own area. Gervinho's attack is broken down and the home side are forced to start again. Flare smoke engulfs Roma's fans prior to kick off. They're up for this one tonight! Morata gives away a free kick for a trip on former Barcelona player Keita. De Rossi is cautioned for going through the back of Juve striker Morata. He pleads his innocence but the referee is having none of it. Roma skipper Totti is put under pressure from Marchisio as his side try to pick the lock to the Juve defence. So far, they've been unsuccessful. The flares are out, the fans are in full voice and this one is set up to be quite a spectacle. The score, however, remains goalless. The flare are out, the fans are in full voice and this one is set up to be a spectacle. The score, however, remains goalless. Pereya delivers a cross into the Roma box and Manolas almost turns the ball into his own net under pressure from Vidal. However the Greek defender's touch dribbles just wide and out for a corner. Roma manage to scramble the ball clear of their crowded area as the ball is pumped forward. Torosidis is then shown the first yellow of the game for what looked like a double-footed tackle on Vidal. He'll miss the next game through suspension. Totti getting a talking to from the referee after a tackle on Lichtsteiner. It's been a physical start to the game. Juve looking organised in defence. Roma will need to figure out how they are going to pick their way through the visitors' back line. Yanga Mbiwa has Morata breathing down his neck as a loose ball bounces back towards the Roma goal, however the Frenchman clears with a swing of his right boot. Roma trying to build up play patiently but cannot find a way through the Juve defence . Vidal shoots from the edge of the box but his shot goes just wide of De Sanctis' left post . Tevez takes a short corner but the Old Lady's attack is cut out by the home side. Wasteful from the visitors. A drone flies overhead before kick off in the eagerly anticipated clash . Marchisio delivers a free kick from wide on the right but it is headed clear by the Roma defence. De Rossi lets Vidal know his intentions with a hard tackle within the first minute. Arguable could have been cautioned but he gets away with it. Hisses from the hostile home crowd as Juve get the game started. They're in a noisy mood tonight! Two changes from Tuesday's Champions League fixture against Borussia Dortmund as Pogba and Pirlo make way for Caceres and Pereya . Buffon, Caceres, Bonucci, Chiellini, Evra, Lichtsteiner, Vidal, Marchisio, Pereyra, Tevez, Morata. De Sanctis, Torosidis, Manolas, Mapou, Cholevas, Pjanic, De Rossi, Keita, Gervinho, Totti, Ljajic . Welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of the Serie A top of the table clash between Roma and Juventus. Tonight, Massimiliano Allegri's team have the chance to increase the gap at the top by 12 points. Allegri's opposite number Rudi Garcia will want to capitalise on third-placed Napoli's slip up against Torino and close the gap at the top to just six points.","Roma's Vasilis Torosidis saw red for a last man foul on Arturo Vidal .

"If Nottingham Forest fans were sceptical when Dougie Freedman was announced as Stuart Pearce's successor last month then they will be pleasantly surprised now. Saturday's impressive comeback against high-flying Middlesbrough made it six wins in eight Championship games under the Scot and 19 points from a possible 24. Forest have reignited their season in some style, scoring 22 goals under their new manager at an average of nearly three per game - and all that with 15-goal top scorer Britt Assombalonga having been ruled out for a year with a knee injury two matches in to Freedman's reign. Nottingham Forest manager Dougie Freedman has led his side to an excellent run of form since taking over . Gary Gardner (left) celebrates his goal for Forest against Middlesbrough with Jamaal Lascelles . Dexter Blackstock (right) accepts the plaudits from Michail Antonio as Forest made it 19 points from 24 . Bolton fans must be wondering where this Freedman was hiding during his two years at the club. Widely considered one of the best young British managers around before he left Crystal Palace for Bolton, Freedman departed Lancashire in October with his managerial reputation tarnished. Watching Bolton play in Freedman’s final few months - and in truth for the majority of his time at the club - was an uninspiring experience. Freedman the self-assured Palace manager became Freedman the big-headed Bolton boss - blind to his team's failings and unwilling to change his methods. Freedman was widely considered one of the best young British managers around before he left Crystal Palace . His spell with Bolton Wanderers was more difficult but he is using a similar system at Forest with good results . But in reality the character of the man has not changed. There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance and success is the litmus test. He will have learned lessons though from his testing experience at Bolton - he has to have done if he harbours any hopes of a long and prosperous managerial career - which he does. Despite the goal glut, Freedman's system - 4-2-3-1 - has not changed from his time at Bolton but Forest's players are clearly responding better. His habit of tinkering with his line-up regardless of the previous result frustrated Bolton fans but appears to have galvanised a Forest squad where several players were left on the fringes under Pearce. Gardner blasts in his goal against Middlesbrough at the City Ground on Saturday in the Championship . Blackstock (left) finishes high into the net on Saturday afternoon as Forest beat the in-form visitors . We can only guess what a manager does aside from his team selection and media comments but sometimes in football a manager and a club just click and sometimes, as with Freedman and Bolton, they do not. That being said, things clicked at Bolton in Freedman's first season in charge for a short while, and sceptics will wonder if this is just a honeymoon period he is enjoying at Forest. A brilliant run of form in early 2013 almost saw Bolton sneak in to the play-offs and there are parallels with how he has started at Forest - though that run was not as instantaneous as this one. Freedman's habit of tinkering with his line-up appears to have galvanised the Forest squad . Several players were left on the fringes of the squad under Stuart Pearce's leadership but that's changed . Freedman makes an appeal for a decision on the touchline during his time with Bolton back in May . Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi has admitted that Freedman's future will be assessed at the end of the season but denied claims the Scot's contract was only for three months. Either way, the 18 games he had ahead of him when he took charge have always felt like an audition, a chance to build for next season. Keep up this form though and, with 10 games to play, Forest fans might soon start dreaming of a return to the top flight after a 16-year absence. Having been 12th and 13 points off the play-offs when Pearce left, they are now ninth and nine points off. The safe money is still on Forest missing out on the top six but having lost momentum at Bolton in the spring of 2013, never to get it back, Freedman will be desperate to keep this going. Lascelles is already departing this summer for Newcastle United but Forest could get promoted . Karl Darlow is also leaving - and Forest can't afford to be in the Championship for much longer . With £22.9million losses for last season recently announced, the forced sales of Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles last summer and having been under a transfer embargo earlier in the season it would appear Forest cannot afford to be in the Championship for much longer. Their Kuwaiti owners came in with the target of Premier League football nearly three years ago and, five managerial departures later, they needed to get this one right. Time will tell if this is merely a honeymoon period for Freedman and Forest but it's a case of so far, so good. Owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi has gone through five managerial departures since taking over three years ago . Good week for... BARNSLEY. Three wins in three games under new manager Lee Johnson - the latest coming against Walsall - have propelled the Tykes right in to play-off contention in League One. The third tier is so tight - just nine points separate 14 clubs from sixth to 19th - that Barnsley have managed to leap 12 places up to seventh in the space of just three weeks. Bad week for... HARTLEPOOL. Ronnie Moore's side conceded a last-minute winner against Burton Albion to stay firmly rooted at the bottom off the Football League. A point for Cheltenham against Mansfield has stretched the gap to League Two safety to eight points with just 11 matches remaining. Time is running out. Hartlepool United are firmly rooted at the bottom off the Football League and are eight points from safety . Talent scout: Harry Toffolo (Swindon, on loan from Norwich) There's no shortage of promising youngsters at the County Ground and the latest to hit the headlines is 19-year-old England youth international left back Toffolo. Given freedom to attack from wing back in Mark Cooper's 3-5-2 system, Toffolo - who was part of the Canaries’ FA Youth Cup-winning side two years ago - scored the Robins' third in their 3-0 win over Notts County on Saturday.

"Chelsea supporters are planning their own statement against racism during the second leg of their Champions League encounter with Paris Saint-Germain. Instead of the usual array of banners and flags which are draped around Stamford Bridge at home games, there will be only one on display during Wednesday's game: a small cross of St George with the Chelsea badge and the message 'Blues Against Racism'. The flag was made by lifelong supporter Phil Keefe and inspired by his 18-year-old daughter Jodie in response to the incident filmed on the Paris Metro ahead of the first leg against PSG, when some Chelsea fans sang about being racist as they refused to let a black man on the train. Lifelong Chelsea supporter Phil Keefe stands next to the flag he had made ahead of the PSG clash . Keefe and his daughter Jodie were motivated to do it by the incident that took place in Paris in February . 'My daughter was very upset by what happened in Paris and it has tainted the image of Chelsea fans everywhere,' said Phil. 'We thought it was important to do something positive and show PSG and the rest of the world that is not what Chelsea fans are like.' The flag, which Phil and Jodie took to the Capital One Cup final at Wembley, will hang behind the goal in the Matthew Harding Stand during the game against PSG, a last-16 tie poised at 1-1 after the first-leg.

"Defending champions India sealed their place in the World Cup knockout stages with a nervy run chase against West Indies in Perth. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni helped to steer his team to a four-wicket victory in a low-scoring Pool B match. India, who bowled the Windies out for 182, therefore remain one of two unbeaten teams in the tournament - co-hosts New Zealand are the other - after scrambling the verdict with 10.5 overs to spare on a typically bouncy pitch at the WACA. Mahendra Singh Dhoni is congratulated by West Indies captain Chris Gayle after India's four-wicket win . The India captain hit an unbeaten knock of 45 as India chased down the target of 183 in the World Cup game . West Indies were hapless in the first 10 overs, after winning the toss on a glorious afternoon, and might have been bowled out even more cheaply but for four dropped catches by India and captain Jason Holder's second successive half-century from number nine. Dwayne Smith struggled badly against India's new-ball pair, eventually edging behind off Mohammad Shami (three for 35). Chris Gayle was out of sorts too, dropped twice and then holing out to a mis-pull off Shami - but not before a mix-up with Marlon Samuels saw the Windies number three run out for just two. Captain Denesh Ramdin could not halt the slide, aiming an expansive cover-drive to a swinging low full-toss first ball and instead edging on to Umesh Yadav. Lendl Simmons and Jonathan Carter almost doubled the score until the former fell pulling Mohit Sharma to deep backward-square. Darren Sammy was dropped by Ravindra Jadeja on five, when he mistimed a skier into the off-side ring off Mohit. India players celebrate after Mohamed Shami dismisses Darren Sammy of West Indies . Chris Gayle wasn't able to get into his stride on Friday, despite this unsuccessful appear from Shami . Andre Russell was soon gone instead, hitting Jadeja's first ball straight to long-off. But Sammy stayed long enough to help Holder (57) shepherd the Windies into powerplay, before he was caught-behind off the returning Shami. The captain struck four fours and three sixes from 64 balls but was last out, another hitting Jadeja to long-off, with almost six overs unused. Two wickets in an impressive new-ball spell from Jerome Taylor gave the Windies renewed hope, both openers going as Shikhar Dhawan was caught at second slip and Rohit Sharma edged an attempted drive behind. Virat Kohli threatened to shorten the chase until he hooked Russell into the hands of Samuels - and when Ajinkya Rahane went to a marginal DRS verdict, caught-behind off Kemar Roach, India had lost four wickets with more than 100 runs still needed. Suresh Raina struggled against the short ball before edging a cut behind off Smith's medium-pace, and the same tactic from Russell saw Jadeja pull Russell to a juggling Samuels. But Dhoni engineered an unbroken match-winning half-century stand with Ravi Ashwin and finished top-scorer with 45 not out in a curious contest which contained 47 extras.

"England went back to work on Friday at Adelaide’s St Peter’s College, alma mater of 10 Australian Prime Ministers and one of the country’s great schools, but there was no way they could relax and enjoy the splendour of their surroundings. Elimination at the group stages of this World Cup is just one slip-up or even one rainy day away for England, who seem to have been wading through treacle while the rest of the world have been playing a different, far more vibrant, one-day game. Now England must beat Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their final Group A games and hope New Zealand also defeat Bangladesh, while keeping their fingers crossed that the elements do not intervene. Jos Buttler has warned England that they cannot afford any more slip-ups  if they are to avoid elimination . Buttler catches the ball during an England nets session at St Peter's College in Adelaide . Buttler plays a shot during an England nets session as they prepare for the game against Afghanistan . India sealed a place in the World Cup knockout stages after a nervy run chase against West Indies in Perth. The defending champions bowled West Indies out for 182 in 44.2 overs, captain Jason Holder top-scoring with 57 at No 9. India’s task was made harder by an up-and-down wicket at the WACA, but 45 not out from MS Dhoni saw them reach their target with four wickets and 10.5 overs to spare. ‘It was a difficult wicket, with variable bounce,’ said Dhoni. ‘Overall, I was very happy with the performance.’ England have endured some rotten World Cups but to go out in the first round of a competition designed to guarantee progress for the big eight would make this the worst yet. But the way they have been playing, not even victory against the two minnows can be taken for granted. Defeat by Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval on Monday would pile pressure on coach Peter Moores and Paul Downton, who appointed him, when a new broom is sweeping through the ECB. To think that the Ashes were moved and we had to endure a 5-0 thrashing so that this team could have unprecedented one-day preparation for a World Cup. There was a subdued air on Friday with only the St Peter’s pupils chosen to supplement the fielders during middle practice having a spring in their step. England were criticised for changing their line-up on the eve of this World Cup but they would be stubborn in the extreme if they did not shuffle their pack now. Trouble is, Alex Hales looked in terrible touch both in the middle against England’s bowlers and later in a net. India sealed a place in the World Cup knockout stages after a nervy run chase against West Indies in Perth . England coach Peter Moores talks to the players during an England nets session at St Peter's College, Adelaide . Meanwhile, Ravi Bopara cut a forlorn figure as he faced some of the worst net bowling imaginable from the enthusiastic locals and England can only hope that both contenders for Gary Ballance’s place fare much better in practice over the weekend. At least Eoin Morgan looked terrific when he batted. ‘It’s not the greatest,’ admitted Jos Buttler when asked how the mood was. ‘But we are determined to change that round. In simple terms we have to play much better to get to the quarter-finals. We have to play well and win two games of cricket.’ Buttler is one of the few players capable of making the sort of impact we have seen from AB de Villiers, Brendon McCullum and Chris Gayle but he has been held back by a far too conservative England. Eoin Morgan plays a shot during an England nets session at St Peter's College on Friday afternoon . Morgan plays a shot as Sri Lnka wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara looks on during 2015 Cricket World Cup . The fact that he received only 19 balls against Sri Lanka in Wellington perhaps said it all and the new one-day vice-captain accepted that England need to have a look at a batting order that seems to have been set in stone. ‘I think we have to be flexible to different situations,’ said Buttler. ‘If we get off to a good start then maybe guys could go up the order and look to take it on a bit more. Whatever we do we have to post big scores and do it consistently.’ England’s bowlers are under just as much pressure as the batsmen after the way Sri Lanka cruised home in Wellington and it would be no surprise if James Tredwell, who had a long bowl on Friday, comes in against Bangladesh.

"Sam Warburton is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time in the RBS 6 Nations showdown against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday. Nik Simon talks to Warburton and Wales wing legend Shane Williams about the game which could decide the Six Nations Championship. Nik Simon: You'll become Wales's most-capped captain on Saturday. What's the secret? Sam Warburton: I take it with a pinch of salt because there are more games now than 30 years ago. Warren Gatland put his faith in me when I was quite young and he's stuck with me. Before I took up the role, some people said 'If someone's out of line, then you have to give it to them'. Rather than the Roy Keane approach, and as a Spurs fan, I like to compare myself to Ledley King. Sportsmail's Nik Simon speaks to Wales captain Sam Warburton and former Test winger Shane Williams . Warburton (left) is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday . Former Wales and Lions winger Williams believes his Warburton's side are still in the running for the title . Simon: Ryan Jones previously held the record, how do the two compare? Shane Williams: To be captain, you have to be well liked by the players. Warburton came in at the latter stage of my career and was much younger than me, so it was a little strange to have him as captain. But he impressed me straight away and, like Ryan, he trained hard and played hard. Simon: Wales are still in the running for the championship despite losing to England in round one. Are there shades of 2013? Warburton: It's going that way. Our experience in 2013 has given us the belief that we can do it. It was tough then because all the Wales teams previously had won a Grand Slam. Ryan sat us down and gave us the belief that we needed. We've had our one lifeline but we've got the motivation that it's still possible. Williams: Fate is always in your hands with the Six Nations, that's what makes it special. It's an open championship. Ireland are favourites to win in Cardiff but you can't write anyone off — one result can change everything. Simon: Jonathan Sexton ran the show against England. How much of a threat is he? Warburton: If I'm being honest, I didn't see the game live because I was watching Tottenham v Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final. I flicked back and forth to see the rugby score. But Johnny is a massive part of the Irish team. His attention to detail impressed me on the Lions tour and he knew every move so intricately. He deserves to be known as one of the best players in the world. Ryan Jones (centre) previously held the record for Wales's most-capped captain . Simon: How do you defend against Sexton and Conor Murray's kicking game? Williams: The game is changing and there's a massive focus on rugby league style kicks. When I saw the state of Tommy Bowe at the end last week, he had chased a lot of kicks and was very tired. It helps being six-foot plus when you're taking high balls. Dan Biggar is one of the best in the world at kicking the ball in the air, running 40 yards, and catching it. It sounds easy but it's such a big part of the game now. Simon: Who would you select in the Welsh back-three? Williams: Defensively, Leigh Halfpenny is the best full back in the world. George North is my first-choice winger because he's such a talented footballer. On the other wing I would keep Liam Williams, who's the form player in Wales. Scott Baldwin and Luke Charteris were both very good in the pack against France — especially with the 100 per cent lineout — and I wouldn't make any changes for the weekend… if it isn't broken don't fix it! Fly half Jonathan Sexton (right) has been superb for Ireland during this years's tournament . Simon: Can the Welsh half-backs match the Irish? Williams: I've been very impressed with Biggar and Rhys Webb. They've made those positions theirs at the moment and they are able to take pressure off each other through their time management and kicking games. It helps that they've been together at Ospreys and they will have to be on top of their game against Murray and Sexton, because they're the world's in-form combination. Simon: England were blitzed at the breakdown in Dublin, are you putting extra focus on that area? Warburton: Out of all the Six Nations teams I've played against, Ireland have been the most effective at the breakdown. I've not been rewarded as much at the breakdown as I was last year. I haven't made as many turnovers as I would have liked. The post-tackle stuff is always an add-on after training and Shaun Edwards always barks at us when we're doing it. It's key to our game plan. Simon: Ireland have lost just twice in Cardiff in 32 years, why are they so successful? Williams: In the nicest possible way, they take an arrogant approach and expect to win every game. They've had players like Paul O'Connell, Brian O'Driscoll and Ronan O'Gara, who have been able to win these kind of games. They have belief and mental toughness. When they're playing well, they build up confidence and are a very tough team to stop. Wales head coach Warren Gatland (centre) will be pitting his wits against fellow Kiwi Joe Schmidt this week . Simon: What's the key to countering that record? Warburton: Like every international match, there are three areas: set piece, breakdown, kicking game. If you can come out on top in two of those three then that's probably going to be the key. I think the breakdown and the kicking game will be the two key areas against Ireland. We're back at our own little nest in the Vale and we're back at home. After two wins, confidence is high. Simon: Warren Gatland vs Joe Schmidt will be an interesting coaching battle — how do the two Kiwis compare? Williams: They both stick to the game plan they want to play. Schmidt uses the players as a tool to work out how Ireland are going to play, rather than trying to fit them into a certain game-plan. Warren Gatland is very similar. Warren's got a great way with people. He gets the best out of his players by taking the mick out of them. I used to come off the field and, with a glint in his eye, he would say 'oh you were rubbish today!'. He loves the wind-up and he loves getting his players going. Schmidt is very straight down the line. He says it as it is and gets the best out of his players by being honest. They're different personalities but they're both hugely successful. Wales winger George North makes a strong carry during his side's victory against France in Paris . Simon: Wales are still in the running… How much of a World Cup confidence boost would it be to win the Six Nations? Warburton: I don't think the Six Nations will have much bearing on the World Cup. In 2011 that wasn't the case. The Six Nations didn't reflect our World Cup campaign. Last year's autumn campaign finished well for us but that didn't transfer into the first game against England. I don't think there's much of a trend with Wales. The most important period will be the three months we're together in the summer. We'll treat that like a pre-season.

"Mike Brown is set to return for England against Scotland on Saturday after taking a full part in training for the first time since suffering concussion against Italy three weeks ago. England’s first-choice full back was knocked unconscious in the early stages of his side’s 47-17 victory over the Azzurri and missed last Sunday’s 19-9 loss by Ireland in Dublin, where Saracens’ Alex Goode stood in. Brown suffered a setback in his recovery last week when he experienced headache-like symptoms after beginning return-to-play protocols. Mike Brown has been suffering from concussion and missed England's defeat in Ireland last week . Brown was knocked out while tackling Italy's Andrea Masi at Twickenham last month . But he has since completed the six-day programme and participated in controlled contact training against Hartpury College at England’s Surrey base on Friday. ‘Mike took a full part in training and will be available for selection,’ an England spokesman confirmed. Brown's return for his 36th cap would provide a significant boost for Stuart Lancaster, whose team were out-thought and outmuscled against Joe Schmidt’s championship favourites last week. Lancaster will also be able to call on Northampton lock Courtney Lawes after he completed his second game for Saints following the ankle surgery which saw him miss England’s opening three Six Nations fixtures. Lawes looks certain to win his 37th cap at Twickenham on Saturday, meaning George Kruis or Dave Attwood will drop to the bench, leaving Nick Easter’s position under threat. Brown has returned to training in a much-needed boost to England boss Stuart Lancaster . Alex Goode in line to replace Luther Burrell if his calf problem persists . Brad Barritt starts in the centre for Saracens when they take on Wasps at the Ricoh Arena on Sunday, where Goode starts at fly-half, and he could make his first start of the championship if Luther Burrell’s calf problem persists. The Northampton centre has started the first three games of England’s campaign at No 12 alongside Jonathan Joseph but suffered the leg injury in Dublin and has been severely restricted in training. Billy Twelvetrees played 80 minutes for Gloucester in their Aviva Premiership draw with Northampton but he has endured an up-and-down season and struggled badly off the bench against Ireland, leaving the ever-reliable Barritt in line for a place among the replacements at least. Northampton flanker Tom Wood could also return to the international fold after proving his fitness from the ankle injury he sustained in January, although James Haskell is likely to be retained at blindside, putting Tom Croft’s place on the bench in danger. Out-of-favour scrum-half Danny Care scored a try for Harlequins as they beat London Irish yesterday but is not expected to return as Richard Wigglesworth and Ben Youngs fill the No 9 slots, while Danny Cipriani will have to settle for a place on the bench again after being one of only two unused replacements in Dublin. Loosehead prop Alex Corbisero played 60 minutes for Saints yesterday but Joe Marler and Mako Vunipola are favourites to retain their places when Lancaster names his team to face the winless Scots on Wednesday. England’s players will reconvene at Pennyhill Park before recommencing training on Tuesday.","Mike Brown has returned to training after recovering from concussion .

"Wales captain Sam Warburton is expected to be fit for the vital RBS 6 Nations clash with Ireland on March 14. Warburton suffered a knee injury in the 20-13 victory over France in Paris on Saturday night which catapulted Wales back into championship contention. The 26-year-old had ice applied to the knee immediately after leaving the field at the Stade de France and it had been feared that he would miss the visit of Grand Slam hopefuls Ireland to the Millennium Stadium. Wales captain Sam Warburton is expected to be fit for the vital RBS 6 Nations clash with Ireland on March 14 . But the Wales management team have said Warburton will return to training later this week and the openside flanker's deputy Justin Tipuric has been released from the squad to play for his region the Ospreys this weekend. 'Sam suffered a contusion to his knee,' said a Wales team statement on Monday evening. 'He will continue to be monitored by the medical team and will return to training later this week.' Warburton (centre) suffered a knee injury in the 20-13 victory over France in Paris on Saturday . Outside-half Dan Biggar, who scored Wales' decisive try against France, will also return to training later this week after suffering a hip injury in Paris. But Bath loosehead prop Paul James, a late second-half replacement for Gethin Jenkins in Paris, has been ruled out for the rest of the tournament with a fractured thumb and will miss the next four to six weeks. Wales announced earlier that they had released 12 players back to the regions this weekend, among them Tipuric and British and Irish Lions winger Alex Cuthbert who was dropped for the Paris victory in favour of Liam Williams.

"Great Britain’s Lizzy Yarnold won gold at the world skeleton championships in Germany yesterday to complete a grand slam of major titles. The European and Olympic champion achieved her dream treble with the help of a second track record in as many days. Yarnold claimed glory in Winterberg in a combined time for her four runs of 3min 49.95sec, which saw her finish an emphatic 0.67sec ahead of Germany’s Jacqueline Lolling on her home track, with Canada’s Elisabeth Vathje taking third.

But I am so pleased I can say I’m world champion as well as Olympic champion and European champion — it’s all I’ve ever wanted.’ She then revealed she had suffered from a rare case of major nerves, such was her desire to take the title, last won by compatriot Shelley Rudman in St Moritz two years ago. The 26-year-old added the world crown to her Olympic, World Cup and European golds . ‘I wanted this win so badly,’ she added. ‘It’s unusual for me to be that nervous before a race, but I knew this was the one, the ultimate goal. ‘After I won the Olympics last year my mind switched to this race. I wanted to win the World Championships to complete the set.’ Yarnold’s team-mate Laura Deas finished seventh with fellow Briton Rose McGrandle ninth.","Lizzy Yarnold completed the career 'grand slam' of major titles on Saturday .

"The UCI will publish the Cycling Independent Reform Commission's report into whether the world governing body was complicit in past doping practices on Monday. The investigation centred on the UCI's dealings with doping findings and allegations during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including its handling of claims against Lance Armstrong, who has since admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs. A statement on uci.ch read: 'The Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) report has been delivered to the UCI president (Brian Cookson). Cyclists ride at the start of the 'Omloop Het Nieuwsblad' race in Belgium on February 28 . The Cycling Independent Reform Commission report has been delivered to UCI president Brian Cookson . 'The UCI will publish the report in the early hours of Monday, March 9, 2015. Until then, we will not make any comment on the report.' CIRC was a key part of Cookson's campaign pledge ahead of his election as UCI president in September 2013. Last month the Briton warned of some 'uncomfortable reading' ahead. 'We should all prepare ourselves for that,' Cookson said. 'When you open a can of worms, you find a lot of worms. It's going to be very interesting to see.' He also promised transparency, where legally possible. He added: 'We're not going to get into a FIFA-type situation of arguing about the report. 'If they want to redact anything, they can redact it. They may well give us some unredacted information as well, but the report that they give us will be the report that they say is able to go into the public domain.' The investigation centred on the UCI's dealings with doping findings and allegations during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including its handling of claims against Lance Armstrong, who has since admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs . CIRC was established in January 2014, with its terms of reference announced the following month. CIRC is independent from the UCI, chaired by Switzerland's former state prosecutor Dick Marty and included Peter Nicholson, an Australian who has investigated war crimes for the United Nations. Professor Ulrich Haas from Germany, a specialist in anti-doping rules who works for the Court of Arbitration for Sport, is the third person on the commission. The key to the commission's success may hinge on whether Cookson's predecessors agreed to give evidence. Pat McQuaid, the UCI president from 2005 to 2013, has declined to comment either way when asked if he had spoken to CIRC by Press Association Sport. Pat McQuaid, the UCI president from 2005 to 2013, has declined to comment either way . Hein Verbruggen, who was UCI president at the time of the Armstrong's seven Tour de France wins, was accused of helping to cover up a positive test by Armstrong, but has consistently denied the allegations. Armstrong stated in an interview with the BBC last month that he had given evidence to CIRC, although whether it reveals anything new or more than the United States Anti-doping Agency report which led to his downfall remains to be seen. CIRC has the power to reduce sanctions, but whether Armstrong has done enough to see his life ban from competitive sport lessened remains to be seen. Chris Froome, the 2013 Tour de France champion, this week revealed he had spoken to CIRC. 'I sat down with CIRC after the end of the season last year and spent a good few hours with them, just talking about the state of the sport and how, from a rider's point of view, they can try to improve on things,' Froome told the Daily Mail. 'I think the sport is definitely making a lot of headway in trying to improve its image and and putting the past behind us' Whether the CIRC report does enough to leave the past behind in a sport which is still beset by doping remains to be seen.","UCI will publish the Cycling Independent Reform Commission's report into whether the world governing body was complicit in past doping practices .

"Louis van Gaal has insisted the main priority for Manchester United this season must be to qualify for the Champions League despite Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal offering their best chance of a trophy this season. Van Gaal is under strict orders from his bosses to restore United to European football's elite after last season's seventh-place finish under David Moyes saw them miss out. United haven't won the FA Cup since 2004 and landed any silverware since Sir Alex Ferugson left but the Dutchman says the competition must still be treated as a welcome bonus rather than the primary objective of the campaign. Louis van Gaal feels it is more important that Manchester Uited get back into Europe than win the FA Cup . Van Gaal agrees with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger that a top four finish is akin to winning a trophy . Ashley Young scored a late winner as United beat Newcastle in the Premier League on Wednesday . 'I always want to get the goals what we have set. And the goals we have set is the top four,' said van Gaal. 'A title is fantastic. When you win the FA Cup you are not in the Champions League which is important for the club, but you have won a title. So for the players it is fantastic, for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the Champions League.' Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said that finishing in the top four was effectively winning a trophy and Van Gaal agrees. 'Yes, I think that he is right. I think that Arsene Wenger is saying always the right things. I think that for a club the Champions League is the highest level and that's why he is saying that. 'To finish in the first four is a fantastic result, I think. And for us, Manchester United, more I think.' Van Gaal is still expected to put a strong team out against Arsenal. Wayne Rooney in particular wants to add the only major club medal missing from his cv. The United boss, who has had to endure heavy criticism for the team's style of play despite a run of only two defeats in 22 matches, believes the result of the cup tie could also have a pyschological effect on the run-in for the all-important top four. 'Every match you play has an influence in the next match. So we are in a 'rat race' in the Premier League and the club who wins the FA match has a very good feeling for the next matches,' he said. 'It could be damaging for the team that loses, but you can also react.' Van Gaal has been tetchy mood in the build-up to Monday night's game, feeling he has been misrepresented over claims that he has the best team in the Premier League, lacks a 20-goal-a-season striker and has a bad relationship with assistant Ryan Giggs, who sat stony-faced when United scored their last-minute winner at Newcastle on Wednesday night. Van Gaal (right) adamantly rejected talk of a rift with his assistant Ryan Giggs after the Newcastle game . Angel di Maria has been substituted early in United's last two games due to poor performances . Midfielder Michael Carrick (left) could be set to start his first game for United since January 23 . Among the problems van Gaal has to face is the poor form of £60million record signing Angel di Maria who has been substituted early in United's last two games and the lack of goals from Falcao whose loan spell is unlikely to be renewed at the end of the season without a dramatic change in fortunes. The crowd reaction to the United manager on Monday will be interesting to see. So far, he has received little warmth from the fans whose cries of 'Attack, attack, attack' are a sign of frustration against van Gaal's possession-based game. One piece of good news is that Michael Carrick may be able to start his first game since January 23 following a muscle rapture. United's best results this season have come when Carrick has played.","Louis van Gaal's main priority is to get Manchester United back into Europe .

"Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis has signed a one-year contract extension. The Argentina international was approaching the end of his previous deal but has now committed until the end of the 2015-16 season. Demichelis, 34, has become an important member of City's defensive unit after an initially shaky start following his move to the Etihad Stadium in September 2013. Martin Demichelis (left) has signed a new one-year deal with Manchester City . 'I want to say that I am really proud and happy to have extended my contract for another year,' Demichelis told the club's official website. 'Manchester City is a club with a lot of ambition. We want to grow every year. 'When you get to hold a trophy, it's the best feeling for any player. 'I want to say that I will fight for this club and for my team-mates until the end of my contract. I will fight to try and win titles.' Demichelis worked with City manager Manuel Pellegrini at River Plate and Malaga and followed the Chilean to Manchester from the Spanish club via a brief, appearanceless, stint at Atletico Madrid. He also had a successful nine-year spell at Bayern Munich earlier in his career and was a member of the Argentina side that reached last year's World Cup final. His early appearances for City were not impressive but he improved considerably after the nadir of a red card in a Champions League loss to Barcelona in February last year. Demichelis overcame a shaky start to his City career to establish himself in the back four . He played a key role in the season run-in that culminated with title success and he has made 30 appearances this season. Demichelis says he is now settled in England and has not even ruled out looking to stay beyond his new deal. He said: 'We are happy here - my wife and son are happy here. We are trying to improve our English and I think that's a good thing for our future. 'At this stage I am enjoying playing week to week - you can never say what can happen in the future.' Demichelis follows Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov in committing to the club over the last year. Discussions with another player out of contract at the end of the season, James Milner, remain ongoing. The England international has been linked with a move abroad in recent days but Pellegrini has often said they are hopeful new terms can be agreed.","Martin Demichelis has signed a deal until the end of the 2015/16 season .

"When it comes to the FA Cup, Manchester United have edged Barclays Premier League rivals Arsenal in recent years, winning three of their last five meetings. This year, the pair have been pitted against each other once again, in the quarter-finals - the difference this time being that Sir Alex Ferguson will not be in charge of United. Can Arsenal, the current holders, balance the scales and reach the last four? Manchester United will face Arsenal in the FA Cup for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson's (right) retirement . Manchester United 0 Arsenal 2 - FA Cup fifth-round, February 2003 . Goals either side of half-time saw Arsenal bag a comfortable win over their top-flight rivals. Edu opened the scoring for the Gunners in the 34th minute with a free-kick which deflected off the shoulder of David Beckham and wrong-footed Fabien Barthez. The visitors struck another blow to United's comeback hopes when Sylvain Wiltord took the ball around Wes Brown before converting a well-placed shot for Arsenal's second in the 52nd minute, putting the game out of reach.

United secured their place in the final by beating Arsenal at Villa Park, where Paul Scholes fired home the only goal. It came just after half an hour when Ryan Giggs squared a ball in from the right to an unmarked Scholes, whose fierce shot sailed past Jens Lehmann. Arsenal did have their chances, however, with Edu and Patrick Vieira both hitting the woodwork and frequently forcing Roy Carroll into action. The defeat ended the Gunners' 18-match unbeaten FA Cup run, which stretched back to their 2001 defeat to Liverpool in the final.

Arsenal held on for a goalless draw after a dominant Manchester United performance in the Wembley final, which the Gunners went on to win 5-4 on penalties. United were unable to beat in-form goalkeeper Lehmann, who made crucial saves throughout before saving Scholes' penalty to clinch the cup. United came close with chances from Wayne Rooney, who hit the post, and Ruud van Nistlerooy, whose effort was deflected onto the bar by Freddie Ljungberg. Come the shoot-out, Arsenal, who had Jose Antonio Reyes sent off in the final minute of extra-time, maintained their composure and scored all five penalties, the fifth converted by Vieira.

A dominant first-half performance saw Manchester United ease to victory over Arsenal in the fifth round. United were 3-0 up by half-time thanks to headed efforts by Rooney and Darren Fletcher which effectively put the game out of reach after 20 minutes, with Nani netting a third just before the break. The Gunners' luck worsened shortly after the restart when Emmanuel Eboue was sent off for a foul on Patrice Evra, ruling out any glimmer of a comeback. The match was finally put to bed in the 74th minute when Fletcher headed in his second and United's fourth.

Manchester United 2 Arsenal 0 - FA Cup quarter-final, March 2011 . United secured a comfortable win over Arsenal in the last eight, silencing a few of Ferguson's critics. The veteran Scottish manager had come under pressure prior to the game thanks to league defeats at Liverpool and Chelsea, resulting in a drastic squad reshuffle which saw seven defenders start against the Gunners. United went in at half-time 1-0 up thanks to Fabio's goal, with Rooney putting the game out of reach at the start of the second half.

"Louis van Gaal  has filled his players’ heads with so much information this season they look shackled. In a dressing room where everything is analysed, the players look unable to break free. If ever a fixture can change that, it’s this one. Manchester United against Arsenal is a game to inspire any player and, with a potential trip to Wembley, you can see players like Wayne Rooney falling back on their natural attacking instincts. If they do break from Van Gaal’s mould, those creative personalities could come flooding through. Wayne Rooney and his Manchester United team-mates have looked shackled under Louis van Gaal's regime . PLAYING AT PACE . United have dominated possession recently but Arsenal won’t be troubled if United play keep-ball. The win at City shows how they are now just as happy hitting teams on the counter as they are keeping possession. With Alexis Sanchez, Danny Welbeck and Theo Walcott, they have pace to burn and with no Jonny Evans it means another change in the United backline, which will only increase uncertainty. Arsenal speedsters such as Theo Walcott can cause United's defence all sorts of problems at Old Trafford . WATCH OUT FOR WELBECK . Danny Welbeck would have been smarting when he was sold by Van Gaal. He is a good finisher, a mature player and there is no way he will want to see United troop out for a Cup final in May. Danny Welbeck will be looking to prove a point to Louis van Gaal who moved him on from Old Trafford . THE FORTRESS IS CRUMBLING . When Arsenal last played United in the FA Cup, Sir Alex Ferguson’s side won 2-0 in 2011. Since he left, Old Trafford has not been the same. In a season and a half, United have lost nine league games at home. That’s as many as Ferguson lost in his last six seasons. Teams don’t fear going there and even the home fans don’t know what to expect these days. Arsenal will hope to exploit any doubts. Old Trafford has not quite been the fortress of old since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure . Van Gaal's  side have played 33 games this season, nine fewer than Arsenal, so should be fresher. In the table of minutes played by both squads, only two United players are in the top 10 and one is goalkeeper David de Gea. MINUTES PLAYED . Per Mertesacker, Arsenal: 3150 . Santi Cazorla, Arsenal: 3121 . Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal: 3081 . David de Gea, Man Utd: 2970 . Calum Chambers, Arsenal: 2392 . Wayne Rooney, Man Utd: 2383 . Kieran Gibbs, Arsenal: 2287 . Wojciech Szczesny Arsenal 2279 . Nacho Monreal, Arsenal: 2266 . Laurent Koscielny, Arsenal:  2194 . MY MEMORIES OF A CLASSIC RIVALRY . There has always been a great rivalry between these sides, but I never played at Old Trafford with any fear. I went there as a youngster in 1986 and won with Arsenal and during the Wenger years we had a team that could go and win anywhere. We were a physical team but we could play, and it was almost a compliment when United tried to match our physicality. In 1999, Ryan Giggs scored that classic FA Cup goal and it turned the season. Arsenal could have won the double but United went on to win the treble. Andy Cole made a run to drag me out of position, but sometimes you just have to admire moments of genius. The other game people love to remind me of is the ‘Battle of Old Trafford’ in 2003. In the little black book of opposition players, Ruud van Nistelrooy was one not to be trusted. He was a top player and a fighter, but he would look for any reason to go down. Perhaps I overreacted, but the whole team was infuriated by him. And I’m still not convinced I deserved to give away the penalty that Ruud eventually missed!

"Papiss Cisse was banned for seven games for his part in the spitting storm that also involved Manchester United defender Jonny Evans. Evans himself is facing a ban of six matches if found guilty after the Football Association charged both men. The incident came during United’s 1-0 win at Newcastle on Wednesday night when the pair spat at each other following a first-half tangle. Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored Newcastle United striker . Papiss Cisse subsequently retaliates, and appears to aim spit of his own back at the Manchester United man . Evans (left) and Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Everton (a), March 15 . Arsenal (h), March 21 . Sunderland (a), April 5 . Liverpool (a), April 13 . Tottenham (h), April 19 . Swansea (h), April 25 . Leicester (a), May 2 . Both Newcastle striker Cisse, who admitted the charge, and Evans released statements on Thursday in which they disagreed on the intent behind the disgusting scenes. Bizarrely, Evans claimed he was shocked by the allegations and protested his innocence. Cisse responded by apologising but said he was provoked when Evans spat at him. Indeed, Sportsmail understands that Cisse is furious that the Northern Ireland international has not admitted his guilt, and is adamant the defender spat at his leg. And Cisse will inform FA disciplinary chiefs that Evans intentionally spat at him when questioned about the incident. Cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the FA on Thursday . This season, FA guidelines  dictate that the punishment for spitting should be in line with FIFA's six game ban for the offence. Cisse faces an additional one game ban because he has already been sent off for violent conduct after elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman (above) in December. Having conceded he was wrong to react by spitting in Evans’s face, Cisse will be fined a week’s wages of around £40,000 by Newcastle, who will now be without their 11-goal top scorer until May. FA rules were changed in the summer to bring them in line with FIFA guidelines which state a player found guilty of spitting at an opponent will be suspended for six games. However, Cisse has already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing Everton’s Seamus Coleman and as a result will be hit with an additional one-game suspension. He will not return until the final three matches of the campaign. Evans, meanwhile, could miss crucial Premier League fixtures against Spurs, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea should he be found guilty. But the 27-year-old will contest the charge, to which he must respond by 6pm on Friday evening. The Senegalese striker points the finger at United defender Evans after the ugly incident . Newcastle managing director Lee Charnley said: 'Both ourselves and Papiss agree that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable. 'In life, when you do something wrong you have to front up, admit your mistakes and accept the punishment. Papiss was proactive this morning in making a full and heartfelt apology, which he did in advance of any notification from the FA regarding this charge. 'This was something he felt strongly about and we fully support him in quickly accepting the charge. 'Papiss is known to many of our region's schools, community groups and junior football teams for his involvement in the work of the Newcastle United Foundation. 'He has this evening expressed to us his strong desire to engage in additional community activities during the period of his ban. 'He is particularly keen to use his position as a role model to encourage young and influential fans to engage in sport and learn lessons about the importance of fair play and personal conduct.' Evans’s statement read: ‘Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night’s match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. ‘I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. ‘During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. ‘It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.’ Tempers threaten to boil over as team-mates from Newcastle and United gather on the pitch . Cisse was banned for an extra man after beinf sent off for elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman in December . The FA were waiting for referee Anthony Taylor's report. As he missed the incident between Jonny Evans and Pappis Cisse, and it wasn't included in his report -  the FA were within their right to retrospectively punish the pair. Hull striker George Boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, the FA have issued new guidelines to move in line with new FIFA guidelines meaning Evans and Cisse could now be banned for six games. Cisse responded less than an hour later by saying: ‘I have apologies to make to a lot of people today. Firstly to my team-mates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny. ‘I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be a positive role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down. ‘I hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry. Perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake, not copy it.’","Jonny Evans appeared to spit at Papiss Cisse on Wednesday night .

"Majid Haq, Scotland’s leading wicket-taker and most capped player, has been forced to fly home from the World Cup after a controversial tweet . One of Scotland’s most successful cricketers has been sent home from the World Cup in disgrace after suggesting his axing from a match was racially motivated. Majid Haq, the country’s leading wicket-taker and most capped player, was ordered to fly back early from Australia for breaching the team’s code of conduct. Haq was not selected for the team that lost to Sri Lanka in Hobart yesterday and later tweeted: ‘Always tougher when your in the minority! #colour #race’, before later deleting the post. After the match, Cricket Scotland broke the news in a brief statement that 32-year-old Haq was coming home early, adding: ‘No further statement will be issued until internal processes have been completed.’ The Paisley-born cricketer now faces a disciplinary hearing which could decide whether his distinguished ten-year career continues or is brought to an ignominious end. The spin bowler, who made his first-class debut with the national team in 2004, suffered mixed fortunes in the World Cup in which Scotland has lost all five pool matches so far. It has a last game on Saturday in which to register a win, but that’s a tall order against four-time champions and co-hosts Australia. Haq took three wickets in Scotland’s first four matches, and was dropped after bowling figures of 0-49 and scoring only one run in the defeat to Bangladesh at Nelson in New Zealand on March 5. In the match against England on February 22, offspinner Haq dismissed opener Moeen Ali to claim a record 257th wicket for Scotland. Former England all-rounder Ian Botham and ex-coach David Lloyd ruffled feathers when they branded the Clydesdale Cricket Club bowler a ‘lobber’ in their TV commentary. At the time, Scotland’s director of cricket Andy Tennant, a specialist spin coach, came to his player’s defence, insisting he was ‘world class’. Tennant said: ‘The commentators kept going on about how slowly Maj was bowling but his flight and dip in the air is what makes him a special bowler. Haq was dropped from Scotland's squad for their defeat to Sri Lanka yesterday after bowling figures of 0-49 and scoring just one run in the previous game, but suggested the move was racially motivated . ‘What they portrayed as a weakness is actually a strength. I think the remarks came across as ill-informed. Majid should be rightly proud of what he has achieved for Scotland and I’m sure he’ll go on to take many more wickets for his country.’ Haq holds the Scottish record for most international cricket caps – 209 – and was presented with a trophy for becoming lead wicket-taker following the England match. Coach Grant Bradburn said in a statement: ‘It is a huge honour and fantastic achievement for Majid, who now becomes Scotland’s leading wicket-taker of all time. 'As such a loyal servant to Scotland Cricket, it is especially appropriate for Majid to achieve this milestone during our World Cup campaign.’ Coach Grant Bradburn had previously praised Haq when he collected a record 209th cap for Scotland, but his tweet has since dampened the mood . However, the buoyant mood in the Scotland camp generated by Haq’s achievements has been dampened by his tweet. A Cricket Scotland statement yesterday said: ‘Following a breach of Cricket Scotland’s internal code of conduct, international team member, Majid Haq, is travelling home from the ICC World Cup. ‘No further statement will be issued until internal processes have been completed in due course.’ Haq, whose family is of Pakistani heritage and ran a curry restaurant in Glasgow, was brought up in Paisley, Renfrewshire, attending Castlehead High School and Reid Kerr College. He later graduated in accountancy at the former University of Paisley. He worked part-time as an accountant before switching to cricket full-time six years ago. In an interview last month, Haq revealed that the last World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand, in 1992, helped him fall in love with the game, with Pakistan’s victory in the final against England a seminal moment. BBC radio commentator and former England off-spinner Vic Marks said yesterday he was ‘shocked’ that Haq’s tour should end in such fashion. He said: ‘I understand why any player would be really disappointed about being dropped – it’s a horrible feeling, especially if you are a senior player. 'I can also understand from the Scottish selectors’ point of view that it was an opportunity to blood a talented young offspinner and that might be why they took the step to drop Haq. ‘I guess the authorities were left with no real option once he’d delivered his tweet. They had to take pretty severe action.’","Majid Haq was dropped from Sr Lanka match after indifferent form .

"Mathieu Bastareaud and Thierry Dusautoir's imposing frames may not have delivered for France this Six Nations but they made the day of some young stars of the future on Wednesday. France have just one win from their three this tournament but will be looking to turn that around in Rome when they take on Italy, one of the two team's behind them on the table. Before they got down to business on Wednesday with their preparations ahead of their clash with Italy, Bastareaud, Dusautoir and Co showed their squad remains in good spirits with a pre-training session with local children in Marcoussis.

Les Bleus enjoyed a jovial run with young players at their training base just south of Paris, which included kids struggling to bring down massive centre Bastareaud and Dusautoir appearing to enjoy his customary role of towering over all even more than usual. Once the fun was over though Philippe Saint-Andre was laying down the law as they prepared for their visit to Rome on Sunday where they'll be keen to add to their solitary win of the tournament. France, who are fourth behind Ireland, Wales and England, have been far from convincing so far this campaign, accounting only for Scotland 15-8 in their opening match.

After venting following the Wales defeat, Saint-Andre put his support behind his players this week, saying he had 'faith' in them to turn things around in Italy. 'The team has a lot of potential,' he said. 'Over the last two and half years we've learned a lot. I have a group of professionals, and a good team, but they need to maximise their potential. 'Saturday (against Wales), we were only at 70-80 per cent. As a coach, but also as a lover of rugby, I expect a lot more from this team. I have faith in this squad. 'They have the right values, and they are doing well as a squad. They need to do more on the pitch, as a team and individually. They need to take the initiative. 'But honestly, if we didn't believe in them, we'd have changed lots of players. On Sunday in Italy I expect a reaction because we have a squad with values and they will show it on Sunday.'

"In these disturbing scenes, eyewitnessed by Daily Mail Online, Nick Gordon is seen incoherent and so drunk and high he is unable to walk. Captured on video barely 12 hours before a dramatic intervention by Dr Phil McGraw Gordon, 25, is shown falling down drunk and being helped to his feet in his hotel, the Ritz Carlton in Buckhead, Atlanta. The beleaguered fiancé of Bobby Kristina Brown believed he was to be interviewed by Dr Phil the following day. Gordon has now admitted to taking heroin, Xanax and drinking heavily since Bobby Kristina, 22, was found face-down and unresponsive in her bath-tub on 31 January. He had wanted to tell his story publicly because he felt he was being ‘vilified’ and depicted as a ‘monster.’ Breakdown: With his mother, Michelle, by his side Nick Gordon struggles to stay coherent . Troubling preview: A trailer for the interview of Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon by Dr Phil McGraw was released Sunday night. Swinging from crying  to flying into a rage, the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by Dr Phil . Blame game: Michelle said her son 'cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt. He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.' Hugs: Before he left for rehab, Nick and his mother embraced. She said her son was at 'the breaking point'. But on learning of Gordon’s spiralling mental and physical state Dr Phil decided that he could not proceed with the interview, ‘in good conscience.’ Instead, with Gordon’s life ‘hanging in the balance’ he staged an intervention. In the show, due to broadcast Wednesday, a weeping and wailing Gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed: ‘I’m so sorry for everything.’ Asked if he still intended to kill himself he said: ‘If anything happens to Krissi I will.’ He said: ‘My pain is horrible. My heart hurts. I have panic attacks.’ In recent weeks Gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of Xanax, alcohol and prescription sleeping pills. Gordon had agreed to meet with Dr Phil believing that he was there to be interviewed. According to Dr Phil: 'He felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster.' Instead, on learning of Gordon's rapidly deteriorating mental, emotional and physical state, the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab. Dr Phil stated: 'I don't think he has any chance of turning this round. Left to his own devices he will be dead within the week.' Gordon's mother, Michelle, was by her son's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive – at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed. She described her son as 'at breaking point.' She said: 'He cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt. 'He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.' Leaning towards Gordon's mother, Dr Phil said: 'You and I have one mission with one possible outcome and that's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression, his guilt…and to get clean and sober.' He added: 'His life absolutely hangs in the balance.' Questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of January 31st that led to Bobbi Kristina, 22, ending up face down in her tub. Just two days ago Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Leolah Brown, made a series of explosive Facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had 'strong evidene of foul play' relating to Gordon's role in events. She posted: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!' Leolah made her claims in response to being invited onto Dr Phil's show. Tough to watch: The young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . In her message she wrote: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece….We have strong evidence of foul play.' Marks were found on her face and arms, marks that Gordon has explained as the result of CPR which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived. And speaking to Dr Phil, Gordon insisted: 'I did everything possible in the world to protect them [Whitney and Bobbi Kristina].' Railing against the decision by Bobbi's father, Bobby Brown, to ban him from his fiancée's bedside at Atlanta's Emory Hospital, Gordon said: 'My name will be the first she calls.' According to his mother, Michelle, Gordon cannot forgive himself for his 'failure' to revive Bobbi Kristina. His guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier. 'I hate Bobby Brown!' His tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend's father Bobby Brown, who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . 'Are you drinking?' The emotional man's anger only increases as Dr. Phil asks about Nick's sobriety . Refuses to go: The 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . Resigned: Ultimately, Gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . Then, on 11 February 2012, it was Gordon who tried to resuscitate Whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath-tub just hours before she was due to attend a Grammy awards party. Speaking to Dr Phil, Michelle said: 'Nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed Whitney. 'He administered CPR [to Whitney] and he called me when he was standing over her body. He couldn't understand why he couldn't revive her. He said, ""Mommy why? I couldn't get the air into her lungs."" Gordon has now entered a rehab facility in Atlanta. Meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma. It is now six weeks since Bobbi Kristina – Krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub of the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia. Unlike Whitney's death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Nick, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. In an interview with The Sun  a friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone. Sounding eerily similar to Bobbi's mother and father's drug-dependent relationship, the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on. 'Bobbi and Nick would spend a lot on drugs every day, it just depended on how much money they had. It wasn't unusual for them to spend $1,000 a day on drugs. 'There were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours, just lying there on the bed. There were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice. She was always covered in cigarette burns.' Their relationship was also very volatile. 'When Whitney died Nick was left with nothing, so he knew he had to control Krissi to get access to the money. She'd do whatever he told her. 'He was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her. They would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around.' According to Stepho: 'But Krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother. She was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her. Nick knew this and took advantage of it.' Troubled relationship: A friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone .","Captured on video barely 12 hours before a dramatic intervention by Dr Phil McGraw, Nick Gordon was totally out of it .

"Joe Schmidt has made just one change to his starting line-up for Wales on Saturday, fit-again Jamie Heaslip returning in place of Jordi Murphy. Injured on February 14 against France, Heaslip has timed his recovery from the three vertebrae fractured by Pascal Papé perfectly. It was anticipated that the problem, treated like a soft tissue injury, could come right in four weeks and the medics have been proved spot on, Heaslip taking part in full training all week to put himself in the frame to resume against Wales. Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt (above) has made one change to the side that beat England . Jamie Heaslip (centre) is back after being injured by Pascal Pape against France on February 14 . Jonathan Sexton (left) has recovered from the hamstring problem that he had for Ireland . R Kearney (Leinster), T Bowe, J Payne (both Ulster), R Henshaw (Connacht), S Zebo (Munster), J Sexton (Racing Metro), C Murray (Munster), J McGrath (Leinster), R Best (Ulster), M Ross, D Toner (both Leinster), P O'Connell (capt), P O'Mahony (both Munster), S O'Brien, J Heaslip (both Leinster). Replacements: S Cronin, C Healy, M Moore (all Leinster), I Henderson (Ulster), J Murphy, E Reddan, I Madigan (all Leinster), F Jones (Munster). Murphy will consider himself unlucky not to have held on, given his impressive show in helping subdue the vaunted English back row, but Heaslip has been true to his word after saying last Friday that he was ‘pretty confident’ he would be declared fit for the Millennium Stadium. Murphy instead takes a place on the bench at the expense of Tommy O’Donnell who demonstrated his worth for the second time this spring, coming on as an early replacement against England for the concussed Seán O’Brien and again not looking out of his depth. Elsewhere, with Jonathan Sexton shaking off his hamstring problem, and O’Brien and Jared Payne both coming through concussion protocols, Schmidt’s team is as expected as they seek to set up a Grand Slam trip to Murrayfield on Saturday week. Jordi Murphy is expected to make way for the return of Heaslip against Wales on Saturday . Jack McGrath is set to keep his place in the Ireland team for the Six Nations game against Wales . It means Schmidt has continued to reward Jack McGrath for his consistently good form, keeping Cian Healy, who started his first game for Leinster in six months last Saturday, on the bench for the third Test in a row. There was concern about replacement out-half Ian Madigan’s control of the closing 25 minutes against England, but he is again back-up to Sexton.

"France head coach Philippe Saint-Andre reverted to his favoured halfback pairing of Sebastien Tillous-Borde and Camille Lopez when he named them on Thursday in a reshuffled team to face Italy in the Six Nations on Sunday. Scrumhalf Tillous-Borde and flyhalf Lopez started all three November tests but the Toulon player missed the first two Six Nations games through injury before starting on the bench for the third. France started with a 15-8 home win against Scotland before losing 18-11 in Ireland and went down 20-13 against Wales at the Stade de France. France scrum half Sebastien Tillous-Borde returns to the starting line-up for their Six Nations clash with Italy .

"Everton boss Roberto Martinez has stressed there has been no decision yet and that the 'right' one will be made with regard to Ross Barkley's possible participation for England Under-21s at the European Championships in June. Earlier this week it was reported that Martinez would rather 21-year-old Toffees midfielder took this summer off to recharge his batteries than be part of Gareth Southgate's Young Lions squad for the tournament in the Czech Republic. Martinez in January said he did not think Barkley, given he has already featured for England's senior side at the 2014 World Cup, then being involved in tournaments like Euro 2015 could be 'positive for him or the rest of the (Under-21) squad'. Roberto Martinez has said he will work with the FA to ensure the 'right' call is made for Ross Barkley . But the Spaniard was also not ruling anything out, emphasising Everton's close relationship with the Football Association and Southgate. And when asked about the matter on Wednesday, Martinez said once again: 'Our relationship with the FA is very good. Barkley could be part of the Young Lions squad that will travel to the Czech Republic in the summer . Martinez has previously said he is not sure whether Barkley moving to the U21s would be a positive move . 'At the end of the matter it is going to be (about) what's best for the player and for the Under-21s in general. 'We are facing the most important period of the season for the team and for the player, so you can imagine that there is no decision that can be taken now. 'But our relationship with the FA and Gareth Southgate in this case is very close, and we are going to make the right decision based on what is going to happen between now and the end of the season and the needs that there are from the England team.'","Ross Barkley could play for the England U21s in June .

The 40-year-old former Old Trafford favourite has been helping Warren Joyce with United's under 21's but has been keen to take on more coaching responsibility.

"A raucous group of Paris St Germain fans have posted a spoof video on the internet lampooning Chelsea following the London club's humiliating exit from the Champions League. Short video, which was uploaded earlier today, shows a dejected 'John Terry' standing on the platform of the Paris metro as a train pulls into the station. The carriage is packed with a gang of PSG fans, who are chanting 'Here is Paris' in a good humoured fashion at the man, who is wearing a replica  shirt bearing the Chelsea captain's name. A dejected 'John Terry' stands on a Paris Metro station following his side's Champions League exit . The man, wearing a Terry 26 jersey waits for the speeding train to stop before he can board . Unfortunately, the carriage is full of jubilant Paris St Germain fans who are through to the next round . As the fake John Terry attempts to board the train, he is pushed back by the smiling fans. The video is a response to a video featuring Chelsea fans on the Paris metro where a black man is prevented from boarding the train. As the train pulls away from the station, the sad-looking John Terry lowers his head as he contemplates the end of his Champions League dream. In a final barb to Chelsea fans, the video features a shot of a sign with the Champions League logo and Berlin 2015 - where the final is being held. Chelsea had offered the victim of the Paris metro racism row a free trip to last night's second leg. But the victim, Soulemayne S said he could not go to the game because of the impact of last month's incident. He said: 'This offer to go, this invitation, is just an attempt to make things up. For the moment I don't want to come because of what they've caused, the team and their fans. 'The Chelsea supporters have destroyed me. Even when I drive my car I feel like I'm being followed. I don't know if I am being followed by Chelsea fans, or police or the media. The John Terry-a-like is stopped from boarding the train by a group of fans who are chanting . The John Terry character tries several time to board the train without any success . The train departs leaving the spoof John Terry, like the real version, going nowhere in Europe this season . 'Even when I go and see my lawyer I am followed, when I go to see my therapist I feel like I'm being followed, and I've never had that in my life. 'The only problem I have in my life right now is because of Chelsea and their fans.' Meanwhile, five men linked to the incident have been served with summonses to appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders'. Football banning orders are issued by courts following a conviction for a football-related offence after a complaint by the Crown Prosecution Service or local police, the Home Office website says. They can last for between three and 10 years. Breaches of the orders can result in a sentence of up to six months in prison.

"Need some inspiration deciding who to back at Cheltenham? Sportsmail's Marcus Townend and Peter Scudamore reveal their favourites while Sky Sports News HQ presenter Alex Hammond and other celebrities have also shared their tips for the Festival. PETER SCUDAMORE . PTIT ZIG . (JLT Novices’ Chase, 1.30) I can forgive him his fall on his last run at Ascot — it was a typical novice mistake. But his form otherwise looks pretty strong and he can also boast some top quality Grade One-winning hurdle form. He is taken to fend off the strong Irish threat led by Apache Stronghold and Valseur Lido. BEST ODDS: 7-2 . Ptit Zig, pictured at the Christmas Meeting at Ascot, is Peter Scudamore's tip for the JLT Novices' Chase . DON COSSACK . (Ryanair Chase, 2.40) This gelding, trained by Gordon Elliott (below), looks a much more complete racehorse this season and has won all his four races since being beaten by AP McCoy’s Gold Cup hope Carlingford Lough at the Punchestown Festival in April. He fell at this meeting last year but I would not hold that against him. Plus trainer Elliott already has a winner on the board with Cause of Causes on the first day. BEST ODDS: 3-1 . UN TEMPS POUR TOUT . (Ladbrokes World Hurdle, 3.20) An expensive recruit from France who has not yet quite reached the heights expected of him. He did, however, run a very promising first race of the season when third to Thursday’s opponent Saphir Du Rheu in the Cleeve Hurdle in January. That was his first run since May so he is entitled to improve significantly and play a big part in a very open race. Confidence will be increased in his chance now that trainer David Pipe has had a winner at the meeting. BEST ODDS: 12-1 . BUYWISE . (Brown Advisory & Merriebell Stable Plate, 4.0) This Evan Williams-trained eight-year-old was an easy five length winner at Ffos Las on his last run and looks a horse who still has a little in hand with the handicapper. BEST ODDS: 7-1 . Buywise was an easy five length winner at Ffos Las and looks to have a little in hand with the handicapper . MARCUS TOWNEND . TRUSTAN TIMES . (Pertemps Hurdle, 2.05) Sybarite looks a good option here but, at even longer odds, this Tim Easterby-trained stayer looks worth a punt. He was fourth in the race 12 months ago, beaten less than half a length in a blanket finish, and he races off a marginally lower handicap mark this afternoon. His stable is in decent form with a couple of winners in its last six runners. BEST ODDS: 25-1 . EDUARD . (Ryanair Chase, 2.40) Lacks a little match practice for such a hotly-contested event as this but there is no doubt the Nicky Richards-trained gelding possesses talent. He would probably have beaten Wishfull Thinking, a rival again on Thursday, in the Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon last time but for an error at the final fence. BEST ODDS: 16-1 . COLE HARDEN . (Ladbrokes World Hurdle, 3.20) Has failed to win since his first race of the season at Wetherby at the start of November and could be regarded as disappointing. But the positives are that his stable has emerged from a quiet spell and he has had a breathing operation since being beaten behind Saphir Du Rheu here in January. Will be staying on better than most at the finish. BEST ODDS: 16-1 . Cole Harden has failed to win since his first race of the season at Wetherby at the start of November .

Among the players making good progress up the leaderboard from the later group was Spaniard Eduardo De La Riva, who opened with an eagle on the par-five first hole before finding birdies on the third and fifth.

"A funeral has been held for the newborn found dead at a Michigan recycling center after his mother allegedly left him freeze to death. Dozens attended the service for the boy, known simply as Baby Henry, whose body was discovered almost two months ago at a recycling center in the city of Roseville, near Detroit. Morgue employees named the child 'Henry Alexander Macomb,' after the county's namesake, Gen. Alexander Macomb. The newborn's lifeless body was discovered in January at the recycling facility - his mother Angela Alexie, is charged with felony murder and first-degree child abuse. The 24-year-old relinquished her rights to bury the baby. A funeral has been held for the newborn found dead at a Michigan recycling center after his mother allegedly left him freeze to death . Dozens attended the service for the boy, known simply as Baby Henry, whose body was discovered almost two months ago at a recycling center in the city of Roseville . Morgue employees named the child 'Henry Alexander Macomb,' after the county's namesake, Gen. Alexander Macomb. 'I don't know what to say. I'm standing here representing the church, and I'm just as confused as most of you,' said Richard Shubik, a deacon at St. Paul on the Lake Catholic Church in Grosse Pointe Farms who presided over the service. 'But I think it's fitting, and I'm proud of all of you that are here today so that we can send Baby Henry off to the kingdom in the proper way.' Shubik, along with a number of those in attendance at Resurrection Cemetery in Macomb County's Clinton Township, became emotional during the brief service, pausing in the middle of a prayer to compose himself. The service also featured a bagpiper in addition to the procession led by the honor guard. Clinton Township fire Lt. Paul Brouwer, who walked behind the baby's casket, said he and his fellow firefighters were moved by the baby's story. Donald Ross plays bagpipes at the funeral service on Wednesday . Mourners pay their respects at the casket of a newborn. 'I don't know what to say.

The burial plot in an area of the cemetery devoted to children, as well as the casket and a viewing held Tuesday evening all were donated. 'He was here for just such a short time that it was a tragedy to say the least. Hopefully with this his spirit can rest easy,' Brouwer said. The burial plot in an area of the cemetery devoted to children, as well as the casket and a viewing held Tuesday evening all were donated. Clinton Township Supervisor Robert Cannon, who helped organize the effort, said 'we adopted the baby as a community.' 'He started out without anybody loving him. Now, we all love him. And I want the world forever to know that,' Cannon said. Alexie,  gave birth to the baby  alone in a garage in Eastpointe, Michigan, on December 22, 2014, and cut the umbilical cord with her teeth. The mother-of-three, whose children are all in foster care, claims she didn't have the strength to take the baby to authorities as she was embarrassed and didn't know if her boyfriend was the father. Wrapping the child in a blanket, Alexie left the him on the floor of the open-windowed residential garage for two days as she slept inside, checking on him every two hours. She attempted to breastfeed him, she says, but he never latched on. She did not bring him formula. Angela Alexie, 24, (pictured in February  allegedly delivered the baby boy on her own in the unattached garage of a friend's house that she was residing in and then put the baby in a recycling bin after he had died . On Christmas Eve, John died, and Alexie posted on Facebook 'RIP Baby', which she claims referred to somebody else's child. Alexie placed the body in a plastic bag and left him on the floor of the garage for another week before somebody placed the bag in a recycling dumpster, the court heard in February. The court also heard from Cyndee Johnson, a worker at ReCommunity Recycling who saw John's body come down the conveyor belt on January 14. He was blue, covered in snow, and curled up as if he were trying to stay warm, Johnson said. 'When I first saw, it scared me,' Johnson said tearfully. 'I jumped back. I moved back. I realized this was an actual baby.' It is believed that the child was born on or around December 22 in the garage of a friend's house in Eastpointe (pictured) and died Christmas Eve night, but the Macomb County Medical Examiner's Office is still working to confirm the timeline . 'It just grabbed my heart. I knew something wasn't right.' 'I said, 'That's a real baby. Stop the line! Stop the line!'' she testified. There is no official cause of death but authorities believe hypothermia played a major role. 'She did nothing. She let that child freeze to death,' Macomb County Assistant Prosecutor Bill Cataldo said, according to Detroit Free Press. 'He died when there were a number of ways to save him.' Alexie said she concealed the pregnancy from her boyfriend and pretended to have miscarried. Authorities released an appeal to find the mother, which prompted a response from Amy Lesniak, who is caring for two of Alexie's children. She said she suspected Alexie was pregnant when she started missing visits, claiming to have the flu or stomach problems. When she heard a baby was found in the dumpster, she called police saying she believed the child was Alexie's. Steven Kaplan, Alexie's attorney, said she has a 'severe lack of parenting skills, limited intelligence and lack of family support' in court yesterday. Kaplan will not seek a competency exam because it appeared to him that 'she has sufficient cognizance to assist her attorney in the hearing'. He plans to request a forensic evaluation regarding the issue of criminal responsibility or culpability, which he believes could lead to an insanity defense. Alexie relinquished her rights to bury the baby. Eastpointe Judge Carl Gerds set bond at $1 million.

I guess it’s the culture,' Rice said. 'You feel like you have to be out there on the field. It’s the competition that’s instilled in you. You love it, you want to be out there, but it’s very important that you pay attention to what goes on when you get a concussion.' 'There are a lot of issues that stem from brain injuries and it's not just professional athletes. This affects everybody,' Weatherford said. 'A lot of my team-mates and a lot of close friends have dealt with concussions and the depression that comes with that,' he added.

"Eddie Hearn has submitted a formal proposal for a summer blockbuster between Carl Frampton and Scott Quigg. Significant hurdles remain in making a June bout between these super-bantamweight world champions, most notably because they are backed by different broadcasters, with Frampton enjoying huge exposure on ITV while Hearn's fighters, including WBA (regular) champion Quigg, operate on Sky Sports. The dilemma is between the lure of terrestrial television and the greater prize purses that would most likely be generated by a box office event on Sky. For his part, Hearn has now tabled a proposal and is waiting on a reciprocal suggestion from Barry McGuigan, who manages IBF champion Frampton.

Of course the finances have to be right and we have submitted a proposal that will pay both fighters huge money. They (Frampton and McGuigan) will talk with their broadcaster and see what's on offer and then hopefully we will sit down as soon as possible. 'After that, we can push negotiations on. I'm not sure if we will ever find an agreed split - I would be happy for a 60-40 purse split in favour of the winner. If you really fancy it I can't see a problem with that. Let's see. Frampton celebrates after his victory over Chris Avalos in Belfast, Northern Ireland in February . Frampton spins to address the crowd after stopping Avalos in the fifth round last month . 'We can talk about world titles and legacy and exposure but ultimately this is a super fight – and in a super fight it is only right that these two great fighters get the best deal possible financially.' Venues for what would likely be the biggest fight in Britain this year are currently under consideration in Belfast, where Frampton is from, as well as Manchester and the O2 Arena in London. Hearn added: 'If we can all reach an agreement, then I would love to make this fight in June. We'd be happy to fight in Belfast if the numbers were right, but likewise Manchester would be brilliant and so would the O2 Arena in London. There is a long way to go but who wouldn't want to see this fight?' After Frampton's thrilling ITV debut against Avalos on February 28, in which he extended his record to 20 wins from 20 fights, McGuigan said: 'Eddie thinks of the numbers all the time, let's think of the game, let's think of it being free-to-air and millions and millions of people enjoying watching it because it will be a great fight.'","Eddie Hearn tells Sportsmail he wants the fight sorted for Scott Quigg .

"With scenes echoing Brett Favre, the NFL's latest will-he, won't-he scenario appears to be over with Peyton Manning set to take a $4million pay cut and remain with the Denver Broncos. The five-time MVP will make a $15m base salary for the 2015 season -  his 18th in the NFL. After being plagued with thigh injury down the stretch, the deal will be sealed after the 38-year-old completes a medical, which should happen in the next 24 hours. After meetings with general manager John Elway, Manning, who turns 39 this month, agreed to the cut in wages with the money to be used on strengthening the Broncos roster. Peyton Manning will begin his fourth season in Denver after agreeing to a $4m pay cut . Elway has been aggressive in free agency in the recent past and the Broncos used the franchise tag and $12.823m on wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. Speaking at last month's combine, Elway addressed Manning's legacy. 'I do think that the one thing he can add is another Super Bowl championship. I think with where Peyton is, as I told him in our meeting, I said, ""You don't have to throw for another yard and you don't need to throw for another touchdown pass because your legacy is going to be one of the all-time greats as it is as we sit here now."" Where he can really add to his legacy is to win a Super Bowl. I think that's our goal, as it is for 31 other teams, but we feel like we've got a real good football team and Peyton Manning is the best player for us.' Following the departure of former head coach John Fox and offensive coordinator Adam Gase to Chicago, Manning will now start afresh with new head coach Gary Kubiak and OC Rick Dennison.","Manning will receive $15m in wages for the 2015 season - a cut of $4m .

"An Australian court has cleared the way for Dutch Formula One driver Giedo van der Garde to compete in this weekend's Melbourne Grand Prix after his legal challenge was ruled successful on Wednesday. Van der Garde won the challenge to get a spot in Sunday's race with Swiss F1 team Sauber, who removed him as a driver late last year despite having a contract. Justice Clyde Croft in the Supreme Court of Victoria said Van der Garde's application was successful. Giedo van der Garde, pictured at testing in 2014 was the reserve driver for Sauber last season . Lawyers for Sauber argued Van der Garde was an unacceptable risk because he wasn't trained in the team's car and he did not have a custom seat, but van der Garde's lawyer Tom Clarke said his client was ready to work with the team to get a seat fitted before racing begins. Sauber said in a statement 'the outcome is unfortunately not as expected.' 'We are disappointed with this decision and now need to take time to understand what it means and the impact it will have on the start of our season,' Sauber team chief executive Monisha Kaltenborn said. 'What we cannot do is jeopardize the safety of our team, or any other driver on the track, by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers.' But Van der Garde said outside court he was ready to race. Practice begins Friday. 'I'm very fit and very strong. I'm looking forward to going back to the team, work hard and do our best for the weekend,' he said. 'I'm the fittest ever. I've been training the last three months flat out.' Van der Garde also said that despite the legal battle, he was keen to work with Sauber again. Dutch driver  claimed he was offered a race seat for the 2015 campaign but Sauber reneged on deal . 'I'm looking forward to going back to the team. I had a very good relationship, I still have a very good relationship, with the team,' he said. One of Sauber's current drivers, Marcus Ericsson or Felipe Nasr, would have to miss out for Van der Garde to race in one of the two team cars. 'Well, I think it's up to them what they're going to do, and up to the team. It's not my thing,' he said. Van der Garde said he would be on track at Albert Park later Wednesday to catch up and prepare for the race.","Giedo van der Garde was Sauber's test driver last season .

"SAPHIR DU RHEU (Cheltenham, 3.20) has a good way to go before being mentioned in the same breath as World Hurdle legend Big Buck’s, but he can begin to write his own chapter in history with victory on Thursday. The festival sprung to life for Paul Nicholls on day two and the son of Al Namix, who sports the same colours as his illustrious predecessor, has undergone an unusual preparation for the hurdling feature following three starts over fences. It was a path also trodden by Big Buck’s and Nicholls will be hoping lightning strikes twice for the six-year-old who displayed great tenacity to land the Cleeve Hurdle from Reve De Sivola in January. Saphie Du Rheu can being to write his own chapter in history with a win at Cheltenham on Thursday . The bare form of that performance is arguably short of what is required but if his handler has managed to extricate some improvement he should be thereabouts. Monksland and Jetson appeal as outsiders capable of outrunning their prices. Having backed HIDDEN CYCLONE (Cheltenham, nb, 2.40) for the Champion Chase, I was frustrated to see him rerouted for Thursday’s Ryanair Chase, but it still looks a smart move by connections. Shark Hanlon’s gelding was runner-up in the race last year when outstayed by Dynaste and I wonder, with hindsight, if jockey Andrew McNamara may have employed a more patient ride as he became a sitting target late on. A recent Punchestown romp should have put the selection spot-on and he could go one better this year and end the Irish hoodoo in this race. With the Willie Mullins stable carrying all before them, Vautour will be a popular order in the JLT Novices’ Chase. However, he will be priced accordingly and VALSEUR LIDO (Cheltenham, 1.30) looks a sound alternative as he was reported to be a little ring-rusty when edged out by Apache Stronghold at Leopardstown last time. Hidden Cyclone, pictured during the Paddy Power Gold Cup in 2013, was rerouted for the Ryanair Chase . The selection had previously beaten that foe by an impressive eight lengths at Fairyhouse and appears to jump a shade more fluently than Noel Meade’s charge, who remains one of the chief dangers. There will be plenty of tips doing the rounds for the Pertemps Network Final but TRUSTAN TIMES (Cheltenham, nap, 2.05) is a solid conveyance for a race of this nature and may run well at a big price. The nine-year-old lacks the profile of a number of his rivals, but was a creditable third in the race last year — beaten by just a nose and a neck — and looks to have been campaigned with just one race in mind all season.","Saphir Du Rheu backed for the 3.20 at Cheltenham on Thursday .

"Scotland centre Alex Dunbar could miss the Rugby World Cup – after collapsing with suspected ligament damage to his left knee in training on Thursday. Dunbar had been named in the XV to face England in Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash at Twickenham. But, running on his own just an hour before selection was announced this morning, he changed direction and his knee simply gave way. The damage is being scanned at a private hospital in Edinburgh, while a specialist will need to examine the images before making a final diagnosis. Alex Dunbar faces a race against time to be fit for the Rugby World Cup after injuring his knee at training . While Scotland coaching staff are hopeful that he may only have torn his cartilage, putting him out of action for around six weeks, there is a real fear that Dunbar has sustained damage to his ACL – which means up to six months on the sidelines. Matt Scott, who had been due to start on the bench, will take Dunbar's place in the starting line-up on Saturday. Scotland centre Dunbar was due to start against England in the Calcutta Cup on Saturday . David Denton, Jim Hamilton and Dougie Fife will all start for Scotland against England on Saturday after Vern Cotter made five changes to his starting XV. Stand-off Finn Russell also returns to the Dark Blues line-up for the penultimate RBS 6 Nations clash at Twickenham after suspension ruled him out of the 22-19 defeat to Italy at Murrayfield two weeks ago. The Scots are desperate to restore pride in the Calcutta Cup meeting following three straight defeats to France, Wales and the Azzurri. Edinburgh number eight Denton - the only player among the incoming five not to have featured in this year's competition - replaces Johnnie Beattie after shaking off the calf strain which has kept him out of action so far. Denton's Gunners team-mates Fife - a try-scorer against France in round one - and Matt Scott replace injured wing Sean Lamont and centre Alex Dunbar, who are both ruled out with knee complaints. Russell, meanwhile, starts in place of Peter Horne while experienced Saracens lock Hamilton takes the place of benched forward Tim Swinson. Cotter said: 'Jim comes in and will bring his physicality and understanding of English rugby to our forward pack. 'It's good to have Dave Denton back as he provides us with strong ball-carrying and strong defence. He's also a very good lineout forward and will give us a bit more physical density against a big forward pack. 'It's been tough on Finn to sit out and it's great to have him back. He's slotted straight back in to the structure we're looking for. 'Finally, Dougie came on and played well against France and has had a couple of games with his club. 'We're looking for him to bring his enthusiasm, energy and high work-rate, particularly in kick-chase and receipt.' Tighthead prop Euan Murray, meanwhile, will equal Allan Jacobsen's all-time appearance record for a Scotland prop when he collects his 65th cap. Dunbar, here showing his disappointment after Scotland's loss to Wales, awaits results of scans on his knee . He will partner Alasdair Dickinson and fit-again Ross Ford, who has recovered from the back spasm suffered against Italy to start in an experienced front-row. Jonny Gray remains in the second-row to pack down with Hamilton, while Blair Cowan and Rob Harley start together for the sixth consecutive time in the back-row, alongside Denton. Captain Greig Laidlaw will again partner the returning Russell from scrum-half, with the back-line completed by Glasgow Warriors trio Mark Bennett, Tommy Seymour and Stuart Hogg. Hogg, Fife, Bennett, Scott, Seymour, Russell, Laidlaw. Dickinson, Ford, Murray, Hamilton, Gray, Harley, Cowan and Denton . Subs: Brown, Grant, Cross, Swinson, Beattie, Ashe, Hidalgo-Clyne, Tonks . Cotter added: 'This is a very important game. 'It will be played away from home at a very intense level and will allow us to assess further our ability to operate away from home in a hostile environment. 'Our focus, however, has been on ourselves and how we can perform better, by identifying the areas that we can control - like improving our skill sets and reinforcing our cohesion - to withstand the difficult times and also apply some pressure.'","Alex Dunbar was running on his own when his knee gave way on Thursday .

"It was a weekend when Andy Murray was full to bursting with emotion, but he struck a note of pragmatism after leading Great Britain to Davis Cup victory. The din of what is the closest he can get to a home-town crowd was still ringing in his ears as he considered the implications of a 3-2 victory over America - one that has again put Leon Smith’s squad into the last eight of the sport’s premier team competition. Wimbledon’s host nation may not be able to raise a quorum when it comes to volume of players in the world’s top 100, but where there is Murray, there is hope. Andy Murray celebrates as his win over John Isner leads Great Britain into the Davis Cup's last eight . Murray celebrates during his straight sets win over Isner that clinched the Brits a quarter-final place . Murray produced the right results in points at key moments to overcome the fancied American . He showed that again as he held off a ferocious challenge from 6ft 10in John Isner to win 7-6, 6-3, 7-6 and push Britain into a July quarter-final against France. Yet he was cautious about whether that could actually lead to GB winning the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936. ‘To win the event is an extremely difficult thing to do,’ he said. ‘Even with someone like Federer, such a great player, it’s taken him to have a top five in the world partner (Stan Wawrinka) to help him to do that. We’re playing at the limits of our level right now.’ If he was merely being realistic there was not, after all, a great deal of time for heady celebration. Such are the demands of the tour that he was flying back to London on Sunday night and then flying on Monday morning to Los Angeles for the season’s first Masters level event at Indian Wells. Accompanying him will be James Ward, without whom none of this weekend’s triumph would have been possible. Murray was the star but this was truly an Anglo-Scottish enterprise at a time when such things are under threat. James Ward turned the tie in Great Britain's favour with his own victory over Isner on Friday . Ward took the first two sets in the dead rubber against Donald Young but retired to protect his knee . Ward’s Friday night epic against Isner turned this match in the home side’s favour - just as he had 13 months ago in the corresponding first-round match against America, when he defeated Sam Querrey. The 28-year-old Londoner is one of those players who grows an extra three inches in the team environment, but it is expecting a lot of a player outside the world’s top 100 to keep the upsets coming. Ward even took the first set against Donald Young in the dead rubber after Murray’s victory on Sunday but then conceded the match to protect his sore knee. When asked about his side’s potential, Smith said: ‘We have still got a bit of work to do but we are getting closer. We can trouble most teams. You’ve seen the spirit we have.’ The victorious Great Britain team smile with clenched fists after their 3-2 win over the United States . The Brits gather on the court after their win which sets up a clash with France in the quarter-finals . This was another triumph for Smith. In an era when big-name ex-players are all the rage as coaches, he continues to land blows for the lower-profile professional. For the second consecutive time he has got the better of former world No 1 Jim Courier in the captain’s chair. Murray is not only among the planet’s best tennis players, he has also shown what a team man he is this weekend with his passionate support from the sidelines. If there is a worry, it is that it may all have sapped him. It helped that the 7,700 capacity crowd was intent on dragging him over the line. No wonder the debate over the next month will be whether the advantage of grass in the next round is outweighed by the passion of playing in Scotland on a hard court. Murray, embracing GB team captain Leon Smith, praised the 'effort and attitude of everyone in the team' Great Britain captain Smith celebrate as their talisman Murray wins a crucial point against World No 20 Isner . Murray said: ‘I knew that James was extremely tired and I knew it would be a very tough ask for him to come out and win that match (yesterday’s final singles) after me. There is pressure to help your team-mates out and I wanted to try and finish the tie there. ‘I was very emotional all weekend — it is quite draining. I was proud of the team, the way they performed and fought in this arena under so much pressure.’ Isner was desperate to make amends for Friday and had come out swinging in the first set against Murray, backing up his enormous serve with early strikes in rallies designed to prevent any long exchanges. He forced seven break points en route to the tiebreak including three set points at 5-4, which saw him taking huge cuts at Murray’s more vulnerable second serve. What it came down to was Murray’s greater sangfroid in the tiebreak, which Isner began with a double fault. That first set settled the nerves of Murray and the crowd and he broke for 4-2 in the second with an exquisite lob — no mean feat against a giraffe-like opponent. To Isner’s credit, he kept fighting. But the second tiebreak followed much the same pattern as the first and was sealed 7-4 with a swinging ace which met with a cacophony that nearly blew the roof off. It was the kind of supreme effort from Murray that is all too easily taken for granted. Big American Isner fell to Murray after James Ward come from two sets down to beat him in an epic tussle . Isner took responsibility for the loss saying 'This one's on me' after his loss to Ward . Isner, however, says there were ew players in the world who could have conquered Murray in Glasgow .","Andy Murray beat John Isner in straight sets to secure GB win over US .

"The cheer for an AP McCoy-ridden winner this week might be loud but the decibel level could be matched if a runner trained by Sandra Hughes reaches the winner’s enclosure. And Thursday might be that day as the Hughes-trained Lieutenant Colonel is 8-1 third favourite for the Ladbrokes World Hurdle, while The Tullow Tank is no forlorn hope in the opening JLT Novices’ Chase. Both will also carry a wave of sentimental support from the Cheltenham crowd as Hughes took over the family stables close to the Curragh after her father, Dessie, lost his fight against cancer in November. Sandra Hughes celebrates victory at Fairyhouse with Lieutenant Colonel and jockey Bryan Cooper . A Festival legend, Dessie’s eight wins as a jockey included the 1977 Gold Cup on Davy Lad and the 1979 Champion Hurdle on Monksfield. They were matched by eight winners as a trainer, headed by the back-to-back Champion Hurdle victories of Hardy Eustace in 2004 and 2005. Appropriately, the track have named the prize for this week’s top trainer in Dessie’s honour. It is a tribute that the Hughes family appreciate but securing a winner with what Sandra refers to as ‘dad’s horses’ would be even more special. Hughes, whose Thunder And Roses unseated its jockey in the NH Chase on Tuesday, said: ‘It is great to get dad’s horses here because that is what he would have wanted. He just loved Cheltenham. Everything he did each season was working towards it, so to be honoured is lovely. Trainer Dessie Hughes, who passed away in November last year, celebrates with Cooper in the winners enclosure after Our Conor's win in the Spring Juvenile Hurdle . ‘We always came as a family so it is quite tough not having him here, but I feel he is looking down on me. And to see the warmth and the love people had for him was genuinely overwhelming. There is a big contingent over with us, the usual crew. The head of the ship is missing but we are here to make him proud.’ With Sandra this week is Dessie’s widow, Eileen, and his son, Richard, the three-time Flat racing champion jockey who last week announced he will be setting up training in Britain next year. But it was always the plan that Sandra would take the helm at her father’s stable. She said: ‘I thought it would be in 10 or 15 years’ time. I never realised it would be this quick. But things happen and you just have to get on with it. Our whole life revolved around putting the horses first and that is what we had to do. ‘Me and Richard are very close. It is great to have him for advice, even if it is at the end of a phone call. Thankfully, I inherited a fabulous team of horses and a fabulous staff and it is working so far.’ Jockeys line up to observe a minute's silence at Cheltenham racecourse after the death of trainer Hughes . The Tullow Tank is so called because it is the nickname of Ireland rugby forward Sean O’Brien. Owner Barry Connell said: ‘I bought the horse from a friend of Sean O’Brien and he was there at Fairyhouse when he won his beginners chase. We had a couple of drinks and a good chat. ‘He is keen enough on his racing. His day job is a farmer when he is not playing rugby. ‘The horse won first time out and disappointed on his next two runs but we identified reasons for that. We are hoping he will put up a good show and is on his way back.’ A win for The Tullow Tank would be popular as Connell suffered the blow of losing Hughes-trained Our Conor in a fatal fall in last year’s Champion Hurdle. The hand of Dessie is also very much behind the path steered by Lieutenant Colonel this season. He had always wanted a six-year-old he felt was some way off maturity to have another season over hurdles so, after he was beaten in his first steeplechase at Naas in November, Sandra was delighted when his owners, Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary and his racing manager brother Eddie, suggested he switch back to the smaller obstacles. It has been a highly successful decision with two Grade One wins snapped up — the Hatton’s Grace at Fairyhouse a few days after Dessie died and the Christmas Hurdle in December, beating Jessica Harrington’s Jetson on both occasions. Sandra added: ‘He ran in a beginners chase and he was a little bit disappointing but it was always dad’s plan to keep him over hurdles for an extra year. He thought it would make a man of him. ‘So I was delighted when Eddie and Michael suggested going back over hurdles again, and Plan A kicked in again. It was what dad wanted.’ Hughes fits first-time cheekpieces on Lieutenant Colonel, who will be ridden by Bryan Cooper, and is also optimistic The Tullow Tank will run well. ‘I am very happy with him. His jumping has been a little bit of an issue but he jumped well at Leopardstown last time and we feel we have him spot on. This was the race he was trained for all year so hopefully we will get it right.’","Trainer Sandra Hughes looking to win at Cheltenham for father Dessie .

"Joe Schmidt is poised to make just one change to his starting line-up for Wales on Saturday, fit-again Jamie Heaslip returning in place of Jordi Murphy. Injured on February 14 against France, Heaslip has timed his recovery from the three vertebrae fractured by Pascal Papé perfectly. It was anticipated that the problem, treated like a soft tissue injury, could come right in four weeks and the medics have been proved spot on, Heaslip taking part in full training all week to put himself in the frame to resume against Wales. Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt is likely to make one change to the side that beat England . Jamie Heaslip (centre) is expected to be back after injuring himself against France on February 14 . Jonathan Sexton (left) has recovered from the hamstring problem that he had for Ireland . Murphy will consider himself unlucky not to have held on, given his impressive show in helping subdue the vaunted English back row, but Heaslip has been true to his word after saying last Friday that he was ‘pretty confident’ he would be declared fit for the Millennium Stadium. Murphy is now expected to take a place on the bench at the expense of Tommy O’Donnell who demonstrated his worth for the second time this spring, coming on as an early replacement against England for the concussed Seán O’Brien and again not looking out of his depth. Elsewhere, with Jonathan Sexton shaking off his hamstring problem, and O’Brien and Jared Payne both coming through concussion protocols, Schmidt’s team will be along expected lines as they seek to set up a Grand Slam trip to Murrayfield on Saturday week. Jordi Murphy is expected to make way for the return of Heaslip against Wales on Saturday . Jack McGrath is set to keep his place in the Ireland team for the Six Nations game against Wales . It means Schmidt will continue to reward Jack McGrath for his consistently good form, keeping Cian Healy, who started his first game for Leinster in six months last Saturday, on the bench for the third Test in a row. There was concern about replacement out-half Ian Madigan’s control of the closing 25 minutes against England, but it is thought he will again be back-up to Sexton. Felix Jones is likely to be given the No 23 shirt once more, despite pressure from in-form Munster colleague Keith Earls.","Ireland lead Six Nations standings after beating England in the last game .

"Kumar Sangakkara dismissed talk of prolonging his one-day international career after becoming the first man to hit centuries in four consecutive ODIs as Sri Lanka swept aside Scotland. The 37-year-old is due to retire from the 50-over game following the World Cup, but proved on Wednesday that he is still an elite performer at the top level with his 124 against Scotland following on from tons against Australia, England and Bangladesh. Sangakkara's sublime knock helped his side hammer the minnows by 148 runs. He was instrumental in making 363-9 before the Scots were bowled out for 215. Kumar Sangakkara celebrates after scoring a century for the fourth consecutive World Cup game . Sangakkara hit 124 from 95 balls against Scotland, the highest innings of the tournament so far . Freddie Coleman offered some resistance for Scotland but they were eventually soundly beaten . Calum MacLeod was bowled all ends up as Scotland could only muster 215 in response to Sri Lanka . Next week's quarter-final could therefore be his final ODI outing but, despite his prolific form, Sangakkara insists he will not play on after the tournament Down Under. 'It is never about whether you can play or not,' he told the BBC's Test Match Special. 'Retirement is not about form, it is about time and place and whether it feels right.' The wicketkeeper admitted in the post-match presentations following the 148-run win against the Scots that his body was finding it harder and harder to cope with the demands of modern cricket. 'It becomes hard, of course, now that I'm 37,' he said. 'I get a bit slower, the joints start creaking and aching. 'I'm pretty happy that I'm still playing, I consider myself pretty lucky to be part of such a good side. 'When everything is going well, things look bright.' Sangakkara has scored 14,189 runs in 403 one-day internationals, adding 12,203 in 130 Test matches in a near 15-year international career. After beginning steadily, Sangakkara accelerated as Scotland struggled to contain him. He cleared the ropes four times and added 13 fours, reaching his ton with a prod through third man. He eventually fell edging Josh Davey to wicket-keeper Matthew Cross. Angelo Mathews plundered 51 from 21 balls down the innings, including sixes from each of the four deliveries he faced immediately before being dismissed when going for another maximum - caught just inside the ropes by Freddie Coleman off the final ball of Matt Machan's costly fourth and final over. The 37-year-old also hit 100 against Bangladesh, Australia and England earlier in the tournament .

"Alberto Contador will end his career with Tinkoff-Saxo in 2016, the multiple grand tour winner has announced. The Spanish rider has committed to the squad for his final season before retiring at the end of 2016. Contador wrote on Twitter: 'Hello all, happy to announce that in 2016 will continue being rider of @tinkoff-saxo'. Multiple Grand Tour winner Alberto Contador has announced he will end his career with Tinkoff-Saxo in 2016 . The 32-year-old Spaniard is one of just six riders to have won all three Grand Tours . Tinkoff-Saxo team boss Oleg Tinkov said on Twitter: 'Best stays with the best'. Contador is among the favourites for the 2015 Tour de France, which begins on July 4 in Utrecht. The 32-year-old is one of six riders to have won all three grand tours - of France, Italy and Spain. In 2014 Contador crashed out of the Tour de France, but responded by winning the Vuelta a Espana. Contador won the 2007 and 2009 Tours de France - he was stripped of the 2010 title for an anti-doping infringement - the 2008 Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta in 2008, 2012 and 2014. Contador lifts the Giro d'Italia trophy in 2011 while riding for the Saxo Bank team . Contador celebrates winning the Vuelta a Espana in 2014 - it was his third time winning it .

'Unfortunately, he decided he would retire at the end of next year which means he will race with my team for two full seasons. I would have, obviously, preferred him to stay longer but that was his personal decision. 'However, I am very proud that Alberto's impressive career will conclude in my team and I hope he takes the Tinkoff-Saxo colours to the top step of the Tour de France podium in 2015 and 2016.'

"All-rounder Chris Jordan has admitted his England team-mates have been left 'gutted' by their early World Cup exit. England have lost four of their five games, and have rarely been competitive, with Monday's 15-run defeat to Bangladesh sending them crashing out at the group stage. 'Everyone is gutted. Gutted for the fans that came over and the fans at home watching,' Jordan said. 'There was probably a bit of anger inside some people (in the dressing room after the game), thinking about every single moment in the game that could have affected it - could they have done something different? That's only natural.' England captain Eoin Morgan (left) talks to coach Peter Moores during Wednesday's nets session . England players huddle around Moores as they come in for fierce criticism for their World Cup performances . So premature has been England's demise that their hopes of qualification have ended even before their final group game against Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday. The match looms as a potential banana skin for a team low on confidence and who know that a long plane journey home will follow where the recriminations have already begun. 'Because of that result you want to get back on the horse quite quickly and try to put in a performance that rectifies what we did the other night,' Jordan said. 'That's the only way to deal with it at the minute. 'Friday is just an opportunity first of all to put that right and just put in a good performance for England.' England will be without all-rounders Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali after they were ruled out with injuries suffered against Bangladesh. Woakes left the Adelaide Oval with a protective boot on his left foot after first feeling the problem as he hit an unbeaten 42. Moeen suffered his problem while bowling and while he was able to continue on he will not play in Sydney. 'Scans (on Wednesday) revealed Chris Woakes has a left third metatarsal stress reaction and Moeen Ali has a left sided abdominal strain,' an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) spokeswoman said. Moores throws down a ball during the nets session ahead of England's final game against Afghanistan . Chris Jordan was downbeat as he addressed the media the day after England's defeat by Bangladesh . 'Both players have been ruled out of the match against Afghanistan on Friday and will be reassessed when the team returns to the UK.' England are due to name their squad for the Test tour of the Caribbean on Tuesday and both players could now be in some doubt. That would come as a blow to coach Peter Moores, who will hope to take a full-strength to the West Indies as pressure mounts on his job following the World Cup debacle. ECB managing director Paul Downton has already confirmed a major review will be conducted into England's failings Down Under and he himself has come under some pressure to keep his job, while senior players such as James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ian Bell might have reason to feel uneasy with suggestions England's embarrassment may prompt a clear-out for younger players. Jordan is the type of player who might expect to be immune to such a cull and the 26-year-old admits he intends to use the pain of his first World Cup to make sure England do not repeat the same mistakes when they host the tournament in four years' time. 'We've had a few lows and you can only draw on these experiences in the future to make you stronger and to motivate you to get up every morning, to get your body in order and get your game in order,' he said. 'If I'm still around in four years' time hopefully I'll be somewhere close to the finished article and making sure days like the other day don't happen again.' Jordan dismissed suggestions that major changes now need to be made if England are to catch up with the best sides in the world. 'I don't think so. There's loads of talent not just in that dressing room but in the whole of England,' he said. England vice captain Jos Buttler looks dejected as he leaves the field after England's latest reversal . Takin Ahmed of Bangladesh celebrates after taking the wicket of James Taylor . Bangladesh celebrate their victory over England to compound Peter Moores' side's misery . 'We've beaten some good teams in the past and we will beat good teams in the future. I don't think there needs to be wholesale changes. 'I can't put my finger on what exactly went wrong but hopefully in the future it won't happen again and we can put that right.' The Sussex all-rounder was also supportive of Moores, who has already been given backing from Downton to remain in charge ahead of the Test tour of the Caribbean next month. 'Pete has done a brilliant job,' he said. 'He comes in with enthusiasm every day and gets the boys up for training, gets the boys up for games. It's just a bit disappointing that us as players didn't put in the performance we should have done. That's all I can say really.' England will play their first-ever one-day international against Afghanistan, who did not have a national team until 2001. The Asian nation's rapid rise has been one of the feel-good stories of this World Cup and, after securing a maiden win at the tournament in a thrilling contest against Scotland, they will bid to finish their campaign by knocking over England. 'They don't have anything to lose,' Jordan said. 'We have footage on every single player. It's not a game we will be taking lightly at all. We will be preparing thoroughly and looking for weaknesses to attack them.' Bell also missed England's training session on Wednesday, but is expected to be fit to play after falling on a ball while fielding in Adelaide.","England crashed out of World Cup after fourth defeat in five matches .

"Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright is giving his Twitter fans the chance to play alongside him at Wembley in his last ever football match. Wright won the FA Cup twice and the League Cup on the hallowed Wembley turf during his legendary Arsenal stint. He also suffered heartache at the Twin Towers as Crystal Palace lost the replay of the 1990 FA Cup final to give Sir Alex Ferguson his first Manchester United trophy. Having hit one million followers on Twitter the former England striker, who scored nine goals in 33 appearances for the Three Lions, decided to give something back to the fans. Ian Wright celebrates winning the FA Cup with Arsenal with a 2-0 win against Newcastle at Wembley in 1998 . Wright gets emotional as he celebrates his goal in front of the adoring Crystal Palace fans . Wright said: 'I've watched all the FA Cup Finals from 1970 up to the present day, and Wembley is such a special stadium. I never dreamed that I would actually get to play and score there. 'Because it all happened to me at Wembley, I wanted to have a game there and give my Twitter followers the chance to be a part of it. 'It's my last, ever game of football…I wanted to do something really special for the million. I thought to myself I would love to have one more game, I can't even remember the last time I played. 'It's going be special for me but I want it to be special for them. It's going to be something they remember for the rest of their lives. They've got the opportunity to play at Wembley simply because they follow me.

"England's woeful showing at the cricket World Cup in Australia might make you feel sick, but it's the performance of an ex-England star that is turning stomach's down under. Andrew Flintoff was always known as a brave sportsman, whether with the bat or ball, or even in his short-lived career as a boxer, but Freddie is showing a new type of bravery as he takes part in the Australian version of I'm a Celebrity... Get me Out of Here. The former England all-rounder took part in a 'Tuker Trial' on Tuesday, and completed it by eating a cockroach with such nonchalance that the show's presenter ended up vomiting. Scroll down for video . Former England cricketer Freddie Flintoff devoured a large, brown Madagascar hissing cockroach . Flintoff's hair resembled that of Keith Flint from the Prodigy (right) during the trial . Host Dr Chris Brown lost his lunch as he watched former England cricketer Freddie Flintoff devour a large, brown, Madagascar hissing cockroach. The cheeky ex-cricketer was given the task of devouring seven courses of critters, and as Chris watched on he couldn't hide his unease. Putting his good table etiquette on show, the 37-year-old picked up the at least two inch long insect on chopsticks and tried to psych himself up about eating it. 'I'm going to do it and I'm going to crunch it and enjoy it,' he said to himself before he chomped down hard. Flintoff happily chewed the live cockroach, before expressing his disgust at the taste of the insect . Flintoff's meal caused the show's host Dr Chris Brown to lose his lunch . The crunch was heard echoing throughout the jungle, while Freddie sat back on his chair like he'd just bit down on a T-bone steak at a Michelin star restaurant. But it wasn't long before he acknowledged the true extent of the disgusting encounter. 'Oh the back end! Jesus... It's horrible!' Freddie roared. Showing of his veterinary skills, Chris, 36, knew exactly why Freddie was having such an issue with 'the back end'. 'That's a female... The white stuff inside your mouth is the egg sack of the cockroach... It's her eggs,' Dr Chris told him as he held one hand over his mouth and clutched his stomach. Unable to handle watching Freddie crunch down on the critters, Chris keeled over and started dry retching. He then had to walk away from the challenge to vomit in the bushes. 'Oh the back end! Jesus... It's horrible!' Freddie roared as he showed his competitive streak .

"The England and Wales Cricket Board are set to conduct a 'major review' into the reasons behind the national team's early World Cup exit, although managing director Paul Downton does not expect any changes in the short term. Coach Peter Moores' position has most significantly come under fire after a campaign in which England were rarely competitive, losing four of their five games, to crash out of the tournament with Friday's final group game against Afghanistan still to play. Downton has the power in his hands to end Moores' second spell in charge but in the wake of Monday's 15-run defeat to Bangladesh he has so far sought to back the man he described as 'the outstanding coach of his generation' when he appointed him last April. Peter Moores' place as England coach is safe in the short-term, says ECB managing director Paul Downton . Eoin Morgan's position as captain is in question after England's early exit from the World Cup . It is high praise that Downton still believes Moores is worthy despite an unconvincing record, albeit with a remodelled team, soured further by events over the past month. 'As far as his ability is concerned I still feel he is a very high-quality coach, so, no nothing has changed since we appointed him 11 months ago,' Downton said. Downton says no decisions on the future of players or staff, including Moores, would be made immediately but a review will take place . 'You don't become a bad coach overnight but the scale of the issues we have got to deal with are significant as everybody has seen.' England fly out to the Caribbean for a Test series early next month and while it appears any fall-out from the ECB review is unlikely to strike before then, Downton did baulk at the opportunity to guarantee that Moores would remain in charge. 'All I have said is that we're still within the first year of his appointment,' he said. 'We clearly will have a major review of what's happened in the last six months but particularly during the World Cup. 'Everybody is extremely raw from yesterday's experience but we still have a game left in the World Cup, so no decisions are going to be made in the short term. 'In less than a month we will be in the West Indies playing Test cricket so I don't envisage any short-term changes.' The upcoming review could also leave Downton to feel at some unease. The 57-year-old was not employed by incoming chairman Colin Graves or Tom Harrison, who was appointed as the ECB's chief executive officer last October. Downton will be answerable to both although he has not felt the need to ask for any assurances after revealing they had met for discussions as recently as Monday while England's tournament-ending defeat was ongoing in Adelaide. 'I've worked with Colin Graves on the board for the last year. He's been extremely supportive of everything we've done,' he said. Bangladesh players celebrates after their victory over England that eliminated Morgan's side from the Cup . Downton says incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, who did not appoint him, has been supportive . 'Tom has been with us for two months and we've spent a lot of time together. Both have been extremely supportive in what we're doing.' England fans had been warned to expect tough times ahead after last winter's Ashes whitewash and Moores was tasked with an unenviable task of rebuilding a side that had lost the considerable experience of Jonathan Trott, Graeme Swann and Kevin Pietersen following his well-publicised falling out with the ECB. The former Lancashire coach has attempted to bring young players through and England's performances immediately suffered as they succumbed to a first-ever home Test series defeat to Sri Lanka. They bounced back strongly to beat India after falling behind in that series, but since then England have struggled in the one-day arena, losing 18 of 27 games under Moores, and the gulf in class between them and the best nations was powerfully illustrated during the World Cup. 'We're in the middle of a very significant rebuilding phase,' Downton said. 'We offered six new central contracts during the summer. My first job when I came in here was to try to re-establish a Test side which we made progress with in the summer. 'The next job was to get to the World Cup with as competitive a side as we could. We always knew we coming from behind. England vice-captain looks dejected after top-scoring with 65 in their loss to Bangladesh on Monday . Moores endures the post-match press conference after his side fell 15 runs short of their target . 'All I will tell you is that there are no quick fixes in this situation. Look through history, look at any very successful side which has broken up, how long it takes sometimes to rebuild again. 'I am very confident that in a year's time, in two years' time this group of players will be battle-hardened and will be more competitive.' While one-day cricket will take a back seat over the next 12 months, when England will embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 Tests, the ECB will use the review to look into ways to ensure the national team can be competitive when the World Cup comes to these shores in 2019. England's senior players are set to be consulted and Downton suggested the possibility of a specific selector for ODIs would be discussed. Meanwhile, all-rounders Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali are fitness doubts for the match against Afghanistan after they both suffered injuries in the defeat to Bangladesh. Woakes left the Adelaide Oval with his left foot in a protective boot after feeling pain during his late bid to save England's World Cup while Moeen suffered side injury while bowling.

"Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak has accepted an FA charge for violent conduct and has been banned for four matches after elbowing West Ham striker Diafra Sakho. Jedinak had until 6pm on Tuesday night to appeal against the charge - a move which would have made him available to face Southampton - but he decided to accept it at the risk of a lengthier ban for a frivolous appeal. As the 30-year-old Australian has already been sent off this season - against Sunderland - he has been given a four-match ban, the FA confirmed on Tuesday afternoon. Mile Jedinak's elbow clearly makes contact with the face of Diafra Sakho after the ball had gone . As well as missing the trip to Southampton on Tuesday night, Jedinak is banned for Palace's home match against QPR on March 14, an away fixture at Stoke on March 21 and Manchester City's visit to Selhurst Park on April 6. The incident occured in the 87th-minute of Palace's 3-1 win at Upton Park on Saturday and was picked up by Sky Sports' TV cameras. Manager Alan Pardew on Monday bemoaned the extra scrutiny added to games that are shown live on TV. Jedinak celebrates with Jason Puncheon (right) and Glenn Murray after Palace's first goal on Saturday . 'The punditry seems to be having a greater effect on the decision process at the FA.

"Alan Pardew has called for more consistent punishments after Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak was retrospectively banned for four matches. Video footage showed the 30-year-old to have elbowed West Ham striker Diafra Sakho towards the end of the Eagles' 3-1 win at Upton Park on Saturday. Jedinak was charged with violent conduct by the Football Association - a decision which irked manager Pardew, although the Australia international accepted it. Alan Pardew isn't happy with the FA after their decision to ban Mile Jedinak for his elbow on Diafra Sakho . The midfielder missed the Eagles' late 1-0 defeat at Southampton as a result and will also sit out the upcoming Premier League matches against QPR, Stoke and Manchester City. 'Well, you kind of know as a manager that (given) the way it was sort of damned on TV that something was going to happen and that's where we are,' Pardew said. 'We haven't appealed so we will take the decision, but we want some consistency in it. The Palace captain (15) caught Sakho with his elbow during their win over West Ham at Upton Park . Although the officials didn't see the incident, the TV cameras did and Jedinak was condemned by the pundits . 'I could name three or four incidents this year where Crystal Palace should have had a player sent off against them retrospectively. 'But it wasn't highlighted by the media and therefore it went under the radar, so to speak. This one didn't.' Asked another question on the subject, Pardew retorted: 'I don't want to go any further.

"Vincent Kompany and Fernandinho could be back in Manchester City’s line-up at Burnley, with the club playing down reports they were dropped after a dressing-room spat. The pair became embroiled in a heated argument at half-time during the champions’ 2-1 defeat at Liverpool earlier this month. Both were omitted from the starting XI for the following match against Leicester. But City say the row had nothing to do with Manuel Pellegrini’s selection and the warring duo could be back in the line-up for Saturday’s match at Turf Moor.

Others had to get involved to stop it.’ According to reports, Pellegrini sided with the Brazilian, which prompted more fury from Kompany before team-mates stepped in.

Brazilian Fernandinho, a £34m signing from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, was left out of the squad altogether. Manchester City declined to comment on the incident. However, they are understood to be happy that there is no lingering animosity, believe the row was over as quickly as it started and are of the opinion that it was similar to disagreements that happen on a regular basis in dressing rooms across the country. They are also keen to point out that it had nothing to do with Kompany not playing the next game.

"Arsene Wenger has revealed that he was spat at whilst playing football in France - but that in those days he extracted his own revenge on the pitch. The Arsenal manager says that United defender Jonny Evans - who will be banned for the FA Cup quarter final against Arsenal on Monday - cannot expect any mercy in the modern age of global TV scrutiny. However, Wenger says the practice was more prevalent in former days when he played for RC Strasbourg in France, but that the lack of TV coverage meant it used to be less of an issue. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger reveals he was spat at while playing football in the French leagues . Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates . Wenger said: 'Today the television makes it worse. I've been subject personally to spitting. Maybe my tackle was not good enough. At the time nobody spoke about it. 'When I played in France, it happened before but you didn't see it on television. When you see it on television it of course makes it worse. I was angry (when it happened) but I could control myself.' Asked whether spitting deserved a six-game ban, Wenger said: 'I applied the sentence myself. I don't know the rules well enough. It is rules. We have to respect the rules. They have to apply the rules. Evans and Papiss Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Manchester United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA after the ugly incident . Cisse already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing Everton’s Seamus Coleman in December. As a result, the Newcastle striker gets an additional one-match suspension after admitting his guilt, while Evans gets six. But Wenger insisted that the likes of Evans and Papiss Cisse have to accept that their actions will incur punishments now that all games are scrutinised by millions of viewers worldwide. 'We have to pay a price for that. We are popular. We are watched all over the world. It gives us some responsibility as well. When you do not live up to it, you have to pay for it. How much it (the punishment) is, I do not care but you cannot say: 'Ok, it's nothing' when you see in on television. When little boys are watching the game, if your boy says to you: 'Is that right?' You cannot say: 'Yes.' 'We have to accept that. There are cameras everywhere, that means we are spied on always basically, from morning until night, and that's a little bit less freedom to go over the line sometimes. 'It's good, it's good. You know it's like now the doping story that is coming out in cycling now. Even if it's 10 years later, 15 years later, people will be less inclined to do it today because they think: 'Oh, for the rest of my life that could come out, so I won't do it.'

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers praised Jordan Henderson after the midfielder's second goal in as many games helped set the side on their way to a 2-0 win over Burnley. Henderson, standing in as captain for Steven Gerrard as he works his way back to fitness from a hamstring injury, opened the scoring just before the half-hour with a neatly-taken strike and then provided the cross for Daniel Sturridge's header early in the second half. 'It was a great strike and that gave us greater confidence in the game and his ball for the second goal was terrific,' said Rodgers. Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson celebrates scoring the opening goal for his side against Burnley . The midfielder lashed in a right-footed attempt from outside the box as Liverpool continue their charge . 'He has great technique and precision and it was a great finish by Daniel. 'He is improving all the time and as he matures even more tactically he will become even better. 'He has always had athleticism, he is born with a natural gift to run, and tactically he is improving all the time and his passing is improving and he is becoming one of the real leaders of this team. 'It was a wonderful performance by him and the team in general. 'We controlled the tempo of the game and whatever we had to deal with defensively we did. 'As good as the performance was at the weekend (a 2-1 win over Manchester City) this was equally as good.' Rodgers also had praise for Emre Can, who began the match as one of three centre-backs but, not for the first time in recent weeks, moved into midfield late in the second half. Daniel Sturridge loses his man and leaps to score a headed goal and give Liverpool a 2-0 lead . Reds boss Brendan Rodgers stands  on the touchline with Burnley counterpart Sean Dyche . The Germany Under-21 international had a tough start to his first season in the Premier League but since coming into the team on Boxing Day, coincidentally at Burnley, has been nothing short of superb. 'I look at him and I think if you give him another couple of years he could play in any team in world football - that is how highly I rate him,' added the Reds boss. 'Whether he is central or wide you can see his football intelligence, he breaks through lines with his power and pace and he has great composure. 'The crowd love him because he does the dirty work as well. I really think he will develop into a real world-class player.' Burnley boss Sean Dyche had no complaints about the result, which leaves his side next-bottom three points from safety. Rodgers was full of praise for goal scorers Sturridge and Henderson after the game . Rodgers also revealed how highly he rates summer signing Emre Can, who played in defence again . 'They (Liverpool) were very good tonight. They are an expensively-assembled side with top-class players who have found that run of form and belief,' he said. 'At 1-0 you never know but second half we gave away a really poor goal - the first one can happen with high-quality players. 'It is a different side to the one we played on Boxing Day. They are right in the zone and high on confidence. 'It is possibly too late for this season but if they carry on that you have to fancy they will be up there (challenging for the title) next season. 'We knew it would be a stern task to come here tonight to get a win but we keep learning. We have a 10-day window to put it back together. 'We will be relentless all the way down the line.'","Liverpool beat Burnley 2-0 at Anfield on Wednesday night .

"It took a full and frank exchange of views to rejuvenate Nir Bitton’s Celtic career. The Israeli midfielder has emerged as one of Ronny Deila’s key players this season. A likely candidate for a lucrative future transfer. Yet the penny took time to drop. Omitted from the Celtic manager’s early first-team squads, a conversation between the pair became unavoidable. Israeli midfielder Nir Bitton has become a key player for Celtic after struggling to adapt at first . The Norwegian talked. Bitton listened. Crucially, he also learned what it would take to salvage his Celtic career. ‘I prefer the conversation between me and the gaffer to stay between me and him,’ said Bitton. ‘But at the beginning of the season there were a couple of things I didn’t understand in terms of what he expected from me. ‘Sometimes you need a conversation with the gaffer to understand what he wants from you. To understand what he expects from you as a player and a professional.’ Bitton needed a conversation with manager Ronny Deila before the penny finally dropped for him . The temptation for any player out of the team is to blame the coach but Deila told Bitton to look a little closer to home. Speaking in recent weeks, the Celtic boss said: ‘If you put everything on the coach then you are lost, you are finished. ‘You have to go into yourself and ask “Why am I not playing? Why is that guy in front of me?” and when you find that out you have to think “OK, what do I do to get better?” ‘It’s not the other way around, that the coach gives you a chance and then you play well. ‘You have to show in training that you are good enough and then you get your chance, and Nir has done that.’ Pushed on the issue, Bitton will plead guilty on all counts. ‘Of course I had to look at myself,’ he admitted. ‘When you don’t play the first thing you say is: “It’s the gaffer.” 'That’s what everybody says. ‘But after you go home you think honestly: “OK, what am I doing wrong?” ‘I understood that I needed to change myself, that I needed to improve. It’s difficult sometimes to be honest if you have the wrong attitude. But if you want success you must change to do things the way the gaffer wants. ‘I said to myself, if I don’t change I will find myself out of this club. ‘It’s not easy when you are not playing so you need to have a good attitude and a strong mentality — you need to show the gaffer you want to change.’ Bitton is keen to play in the Scottish League Cup final this weekend, but is struggling with injury . In his first season there were glimpses of promise, yet he admits the culture shift and weather were difficult to negotiate. ‘This is one of the reasons it was hard last season. In Israel, 80 per cent of the days are 24 or 25 degrees. Then you come to Scotland and... it’s not quite the same.’ His wife is in Glasgow now and, with regular games, he has adapted to Scottish football to a point where Charlie Mulgrew faces a battle to resume his midfield partnership with Scott Brown. Learning to press and harry was one of the aspects he had to improve, conceding: ‘The gaffer wants to play a certain way. ‘Before I thought, “OK, I’m a good player, I don’t need to change everything. If the gaffer wants me to play he will, if not I will sit on the bench, I don’t care”, stuff like that. ‘But everyone wants to play. You can train 10 times a day but it’s not the same.’ The midfielder has had some swelling on his ankle, after suffering an injury against Dundee United last week . With the inhospitable climate and culture the Israeli admits he could have returned home. Or tried his fortunes elsewhere. ‘The easiest thing would be to not care and just go back to Israel and not want to be here any more,’ he added. ‘But that’s not me. I just want to show everyone I deserve to play.’ The battle ahead of Sunday’s League Cup Final is of a different kind. Bitton suffered ankle swelling against Dundee United in the Scottish Cup last weekend and is fighting to prove his fitness for Hampden. ‘I still have another four days. We will see. ‘At the end of the day I will take the final decision. ‘If I feel I can play and help the team I will play. ‘If I feel I can play but not at 100 per cent I will take the decision to protect it for the next games. But we have four more days before the game and that’s a long time. I hope I will be fine.’ Bitton has admitted that it took some time to adapt to life - and the weather - in Scotland . The opportunity to win his first domestic trophy at the national stadium as a Celtic player beckons. Yet he is adamant he won’t put his own interests before those of the team adding: ‘I have to be honest with my team-mates. If somebody cannot give 100 per cent for the team there is no reason he should play. ‘If I can give 100 per cent I will play. If not I will be ready for the next games.’ Sunday marks the first step towards a Treble Deila has very publicly and vocally targeted. The norm is to talk down domestic clean sweeps to lessen expectations, yet Bitton accepts that — whatever people say in the public domain — the onus is on Celtic to win everything. ‘Of course it’s hard. ‘Everybody just expects us to win all the titles. But everybody saw the game on Sunday and it will be very difficult for us. ‘We all need to do our jobs as well as we can. But we don’t think about what they say outside the club, we just need to play our game. If we do we can do it.’","Israeli midfielder struggled after moving to Scotland this season .

"Events in Dublin on Sunday served as a jolting indication that England remain a work in progress and are running out of opportunities to establish momentum going into the World Cup. The RBS 6 Nations title is now Ireland’s to lose and it is Joe Schmidt’s team — on the back of 10 successive victories — who are emerging as Europe’s primary challengers at the global showpiece on these shores later this year. On Monday, 200 days before the tournament begins at Twickenham when the hosts confront Fiji, England dropped a place to fourth in the World Rugby rankings, behind their Irish conquerors. Stuart Lancaster and his assistant coaches are running out of time to prepare for the World Cup . Stuart Lancaster and his assistant coaches have some key issues to address this week as they seek to orchestrate a prompt revival. First up, major Tests are running out . Arguably, the really momentous occasions England need to sharpen preparations for the World Cup have already passed. Facing Ireland on Sunday was the last such encounter. The national team now have home games against Scotland and France, who are in a state of near-disarray, which will not challenge them to the extent they were challenged in Cardiff and, especially, in Dublin. England's players look dejected after they conceded the opening try of the match against Ireland . Chris Robshaw couldn’t set the same authoritative tone as captain that he had in wins over Australia . There are home-and-away clashes with the French in August but by the time England take on Ireland the following month, both countries will be keeping their powder dry. There are also no short-cuts. Lancaster is attempting to fast-forward the evolution of a squad largely made up of young players. But what the defeat on Sunday proved is the importance of nous and experience, which the Irish had in abundance. England have a glaring caps deficit against most of the leading nations and it is too late to rectify that. The coaches must hope their rookies learn fast. Lancaster struggled for nous and experience in the defeat to Ireland as he fastracks a young Lions squad . Slow starts are another problem, with England falling behind in all three of their Six Nations matches this season. They were under siege early on in Dublin and Cardiff. Fundamental errors keep occurring in the opening minutes which leave them playing catch-up. Against Wales, they managed to do just that — impressively so — but Ireland never let them back into it. Lancaster and his team will review the tone of their match build-ups to see if they can find a way of ensuring the players start at the right pitch of emotional intensity. Decision-making under pressure has become a major issue. The men charged with steering the English ship struggled in Dublin. Minds were scrambled and execution levels dipped.

Chris Robshaw couldn’t set the same authoritative tone as captain that he had in wins over Australia, Wales and Italy, while half-backs Ben Youngs and George Ford were eclipsed by Conor Murray and Jonny Sexton. England need calm heads. Lancaster is reluctant to deploy Danny Cipriani from the bench but he will be far more willing to turn to Owen Farrell when the injured Lion is available again. Ireland’s air and ground assault exposed English shortcomings, not just their aerial blitz, but also with their work at the breakdown. The visitors’ kicking often lacked accuracy and threat, and they were beaten to the ball in the air far too often for comfort. That is a concern, given the prowess of World Cup pool rivals Australia and Wales in that area. Those nations also have the personnel to cause trouble at the ruck and England cannot afford to regularly concede the initiative in the battle over the ball. They have predatory runners like Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson out wide, but without quick ball, they are hampered. As for selection conundrums, there were no hindsight-driven grumbles about the make-up of the team in Dublin, it’s just that the chosen men couldn’t deliver. Richard Wigglesworth of Saracens is seen as the leading scrum-half in the country in terms of his tactical kicking game, so he may come into consideration for a starting place. Dylan Hartley had a couple of costly lineout-throwing lapses but he has performed well enough to be given the benefit of the doubt at hooker. Dylan Hartley had a couple of costly lineout-throwing lapses in the disappointing defeat to Ireland . George Kruis was less prominent than in the previous two matches and Courtney Lawes will be back on the radar, as will another Northampton forward, Tom Wood. Meanwhile, Mike Brown is likely to return at full-back against Scotland if he is over his concussion. Finally, there is the question of what to do with Manu Tuilagi. There will soon come a time when Lancaster and his assistants have to confront the issue of what to do in midfield when the Leicester centre is fit again. Joseph has been a revelation in this championship but he couldn’t force his way into the game on Sunday, as the pack and inside backs were under the cosh. The coaches have suggested Tuilagi could play at inside centre, but that does not appear to be a natural, instant solution and England’s whole attacking approach will hinge on the balance of their selections at 12 and 13. Leicester’s wrecking-ball runner is a match-winner, but so is Joseph and both are better in the thick of the action, rather than out wide.

"A monument chronicling 124 years of England's footballing hurt by listing every defeat suffered by the team between 1874 and 1998 has sold at auction for a staggering £425,000. Starting with a 2-1 defeat to Scotland, the magnificent granite sculpture charts more than a century of England's footballing failures, finishing with a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Romania in the 1998 World Cup. The gloomy untitled piece was created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan and was being auctioned by Sotherby's as part of their Bear Witness art sale, which has already generated £26.5 million. The granite sculpture details all of England's losses between 1874 and 1998 . The piece, created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, has fetched an incredible £425,000 at Sotherby's . Among the most memorable defeats will be Diego Maradona's Hand of God goal at the 1986 World Cup . Space remains for a few more of England's more recent losses to be added . Mr Cattelan said: 'Carved into it are all the defeats of England's national football team. I guess it's a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death.' Among the defeats etched into the enormous black structure is the infamous 2-1 loss to Argentina in 1986, immortalised by Diego Maradona's 'Hand of God' goal, and the shock 1-0 to the USA in 1950. It was first exhibited in 1999 and its sale comes in the wake of one of England's worst performance at an international tournament in recent memory, after they crashed out of the 2014 World Cup without a single win. Mr Cattelan is known for his satirical art pieces and is the mastermind behind other works such as a sculpture depicting Pope John Paul II being hit by a meteorite. Defeat by Germany after Gareth Southgate's penalty miss at Euro 96 is a late entry on the list .

"England will intensify their preparations for Euro 2015 by spending a week at their summer base later this month.

"England will unleash their 'special' force of nature, Courtney Lawes, against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday to add clout and dynamism up front following the crushing loss to Ireland. Northampton's 26-year-old lock returns to the starting XV as one of two changes from the setback in Dublin which dashed hopes of a Grand Slam for yet another year. The other sees Harlequins full back Mike Brown reinstated as Stuart Lancaster announced his line-up on Wednesday for the latest installment of an increasingly one-sided Calcutta Cup rivalry. Courtney Lawes will make a welcome return for England against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday . Backs: M Brown (Harlequins); A Watson (Bath), J Joseph (Bath), L Burrell (Northampton), J Nowell (Exeter); G Ford (Bath), B Youngs (Leicester) Forwards: J Marler (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton), D Cole (Leicester); D Attwood (Bath), C Lawes (Northampton); J Haskell (Wasps), B Vunipola (Saracens), C Robshaw (Harlequins, C) Subs: T Youngs (Leicester), M Vunipola (Saracens), K Brookes (Newcastle), G Parling (Leicester), T Wood (Northampton), R Wigglesworth (Saracens), D Cipriani (Sale), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester) Lawes will add clout and dynamism up front to Stuart Lancaster's side reeling from their loss to Ireland . Head coach Lancaster said: 'There's always a lot of competition for places and having experienced players like Courtney, Tom and Geoff available after playing well for their clubs in the last few weeks adds to our options. 'It's been an intense two weeks of training as everyone wants to be on that field on Saturday and we've had to make some tough selection calls.' Lawes will win his 37th Test cap against the Scots, having proved his fitness with the Saints after being out for two months with an ankle injury. Two comeback club matches have been enough to convince the England management that he is primed to reignite their championship campaign. Reuniting Lawes with Dave Attwood in the second row means George Kruis of Saracens is out of the match-day 23, for the time being. Having dipped against Ireland after storming displays in the wins over Wales and Italy, the rookie has made way, with Leicester's Lion, Geoff Parling, coming on to the bench along with flanker Tom Wood - another back from injury - and prop Kieran Brookes. Full back Mike Brown will also be back when Lancaster announces his side on Wednesday . Brown takes part in full training at Bagshot on Tuesday as England prepare for the Calcutta Cup . Forwards coach Graham Rowntree said: 'Courtney is a special player. He's been good for us. He's really maturing as a player and as a person. You can't hide what he can bring for us physically. I've watched his last two games for Northampton and he's played well. This time last year, on the summer tour and in the autumn series, he played exceptionally well and he's back to his best. 'We've got a lot of athletes in the second row. I've been very pleased with the progress of the guys who have been performing in the absence of Courtney and Geoff over the last few months. But we have a lot of riches in that area now.' For many years, Lawes has been acclaimed for his destructive impact as a tackler and athletic ball-carrier but Rowntree insisted he is equally adept at doing the unglamorous duties required from a tight forward. Lawes reunites with Dave Attwood while Geoff Parling (pictured) comes back onto the bench . Flanker Tom Wood (pictured) also returns from injury, as will prop Kieran Brookes . 'He is capable of the 'grunt' work,' he said. 'That area of his game has significantly improved, his work-rate. That's what you get with Courtney: high work-rate but also a lot of stand-out moments.' The reshuffle of the impressive lock stocks extends to a recall for Parling as a replacement after the first half of his season was disrupted by concussion. He has forged a reputation as a supreme lineout operator but Rowntree also paid tribute to his carrying efforts in recent seasons, and his leadership as an experienced figure who was a mainstay of the Lions' success in Australia in 2013. Forwards coach Graham Rowntree describes Lawes as 'a special player' for what he brings physically . Rowtree expects a high work-rate along with some stand-out moments from Lawes on Saturday . England's defeat in Dublin was notable as a rare off-day for captain Chris Robshaw, who had been leading the side with increasing authority of late. Rowntree didn't duck the fact that the skipper needs to raise his game again. 'I've been happy with Chris this last six months,' he said. 'He did well in the autumn, against Leinster too, injured his shoulder then came back to be outstanding against Wales. He played well against Italy but, among a lot of other guys, did not have his best game in Ireland against a very good outfit in terms of breakdown and set-piece. Chris Robshaw had a rare off day against Ireland but Rowntree expects the England skipper to bounce back . 'We have had frank reviews and I'm sure we will have a reaction from Chris this week. This group are very good at putting their hands up. Chris leads that. One of his greatest qualities is his honesty.' Robshaw acknowledged the collective need to lift standards back up to where they were in Cardiff. He will be hoping Wales scupper Irish Grand Slam hopes before trying to deal with the expectation of a resounding home win against Scotland. 'There are different pressures,' he said. 'We're favourites going into that game at home. 'You want to deliver and set the standard of how you want to play. Hopefully we win, but hopefully we do it in the right manner.'","Courtney Lawes returns for his 37th England cap against Scotland .

"Australian Grand Prix organisers have dismissed suggestions a number of Formula One teams are threatening to boycott the race over safety fears surrounding McLaren. Fernando Alonso's crash during the second pre-season test last month in Barcelona, which rendered the Spaniard unconscious and resulted in a three-day stay in hospital, has left many observers perplexed. To avoid the prospect of second-impact syndrome, Alonso is to sit out next weekend's season-opening grand prix in Australia, returning for the subsequent race in Malaysia on March 29 . Fernando Alonso leaving hospital last month following his crash during testing with McLaren in Barcelona . Alonso was flown away by helicopter following the crash at the Circuit de Catalunya Barcelona . McLaren have categorically made clear there was no car or systems failure that led to the incident at the Circuit de Catalunya on February 22, instead blaming a freak gust of wind. The explanation is seemingly unconvincing to some and it has led to suggestions of concern from other teams, to such an extent talk of a boycott has apparently been mentioned. But Australian Grand Prix Corporation CEO Andrew Westacott has refuted such gossip. Alonso in pre-season testing with McLaren  before his crash in Barcelona last month .

"Fernando Alonso ‘woke up in 1995’ after his crash in testing at Barcelona’s Circuit de Catalunya, according to reports in Spain. The extent of the double world champion’s memory loss has been revealed in El Pais, a daily newspaper close to Alonso and his management. They reported that when asked who he was, Alonso replied: ‘I’m Fernando, I drive go-karts and I want to be a Formula One driver.’ Fernando Alonso waves as he leaves hospital but it has been reported he was confused when waking up . In 1995, Alonso was a 13-year-old pupil at Holy Guardian Angel School in his home town of Oviedo, northern Spain. When doctors pressed him further, Alonso, 33, could not remember his debut with Minardi in 2001 or his world championships for Renault in 2005 and 2006. The reports in Spain came 48 hours after Sportsmail revealed concerns that Alonso may have an underlying condition that caused him to crash a week last Sunday and which throw his future career into doubt. Alonso gives the thumbs up after his crash. McLaren have refused to comment on his medical state . Despite MRI and CT scans during three nights in hospital in Barcelona and further tests in Oviedo on Monday, there are no assurances from his doctors, management or McLaren team that he will return for the Malaysian Grand Prix on March 29. He has already been ruled out of the opening race in Melbourne on Sunday week. The concussion he suffered in Barcelona means he cannot be exposed to a second knock to the head, which doctors fear could kill him, regardless of the wider questions about his health. A McLaren spokesman said: ‘As regards Fernando’s medical situation, McLaren will not and indeed should not take the lead, since his medical care is being handled by the people best equipped for that task, namely his doctors. ‘So all we can say is that he is making good progress, and that we hope and expect he will soon be back to his brilliant best.’ Alonso is reported by El Pais to have said: 'I'm Fernando, I drive go karts and I want to be a Formula 1 driver' White screens are lifted as Alonso is treated and taken to an air ambulance following his crash . Medics act quickly to ensure Alonso is secure as he is wheeled closer to a waiting air ambulance . McLaren staff are not necessarily close to Alonso, after he left the team in 2007 following a season of infighting, and may not even know their driver’s condition as well as do some reporters in Spain do. Confusion has, therefore, surrounded the situation, not least after McLaren chairman Ron Dennis said that Alonso had not been concussed, a misunderstanding that was corrected by the team’s official statements. David Coulthard, a former McLaren driver, said: ‘My experience of getting knocked out or having big shunts is that you remember the bit before, the bit after but not the bit in the middle. When you get knocked out it does not come as a warning; it just happens. The McLaren MP4-30 of Alonso is recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck following the crash . ‘The brain is a fairly complex bit of kit, so if they are not able to see any brain injury of any sort it seems a bit medically confusing for me, so there is probably more from the story to come out over time. It is unusual for drivers to miss a grand prix over such a thing.’ Whatever the cause, Alonso’s predicament is a blow for McLaren, whose form in testing suggested they are struggling very badly indeed for reliability and speed. They signed him on a £28million-a-year contract at the start of their new relationship with Honda, yet will replace him with Kevin Magnussen, their 22-year-old Danish reserve driver, at Melbourne’s Albert Park. A helicopter was used to transport Alonso from the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya to hospital on February 22 . Gary Hartstein, Formula One’s former chief doctor, has speculated that the most probable reason Alonso might have passed out would be arrhythmia — an irregular heartbeat. If so, he would require a pacemaker. Another possibility, said Hartstein, would be carotid sinus hypersensitivity, whereby pressure on the main artery to the brain causes the heart rate to drop, blood pressure to fall and the sufferer to blackout. Hartstein told the BBC that this was ‘surprisingly common’, and not totally unexpected at a fast corner in a Formula One car, such as Turn Three at Barcelona, where Alonso was travelling at 134mph. Alonso was flown away by helicopter following the crash at the Circuit de Catalunya Barcelona . But, then again, he was braking and changing down gears as the accident unfolded, so how is this consistent with his having passed out? The questions nag. Alonso will need the FIA’s medical team to give him clearance to race in Malaysia, as well as the go-ahead from his own doctors. He has been outwardly relaxed about missing the Melbourne race, saying from his father’s house in Oviedo, where he is recovering: ‘A second impact in less than 21 days (the stipulated period of rest) — NO.’ Alonso may have been less sanguine if McLaren were quicker, but both team and man will be mightily relieved when, he is back, even if it is towards the back of the grid for now.

"Johnny Herbert believes McLaren could find themselves at the back end of the grid when the new Formula One season gets under way. The Woking-based marque have struggled to put in the pre-season testing miles due to a number of issues with their new car - with Honda returning to the sport and providing their first attempt at a current F1 power unit. With other teams pounding around Jerez and Barcelona collecting valuable data and information ahead of the season opener in Melbourne on March 15, McLaren have often found their car back in the garage with one fault or another. The McLaren car could struggle at the start of the season, reckons Johnny Herbert . Herbert fears for McLaren . Add to that the fact two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will not be racing in Australia after crashing out at high-speed in Barcelona and it has not been the best reunion for McLaren and Honda - with Herbert tipping them to really struggle in the opening rounds. 'There is definitely a chance of that,' Herbert said when asked if the eight-time constructors' champions could find themselves behind a host of other teams this year. 'So many cars have improved. The middle of the pack seems very close. Lotus seem better, Sauber look better. Ferrari look faster than they were last year as well - Red Bull and Toro Rosso, also. 'The middle pack is tight but we haven't seen the McLaren setting their best times so we don't know where they will be. 'The run of over 100 laps (from Button in Barcelona) put them in the middle of that pack - is that a true showing of their pace? We really don't know. 'We don't know the whole grid order because I don't think everyone has shown their full hand and, unfortunately for McLaren and everyone else, I don't think Mercedes have either.' With the news that Alonso, re-signed to the team after the Spaniard left Ferrari, will be sitting out of the curtain-raiser after his mysterious crash has only added to McLaren's issues - with Herbert questioning why the rekindled relationship with Honda has got off to such an underwhelming start. 'McLaren have been a disappointment so far,' the former Benetton and Stewart driver told the Press Association. Fernando Alonso will miss the curtain-raiser in Australia after his horrific crash in Barcelona . 'You were thinking ""Honda have come back and are back with McLaren again. They had all the success in the late 80s and they had last year to look and see what was going on - they saw other manufacturers having to overcome issues whilst they were working on their engine. 'All of these issues they have had have made it really difficult for them to get any serious running whatsoever. They have had a mass of problems that haven't helped them. 'It is sad news that Fernando will not be in Australia - everything has gone against them so far. 'The preparation is something that maybe wasn't to the high standards than Ron Dennis is always after. 'This is something that should have been ready, the new Honda relationship and moving it forward with Jenson and Fernando. 'If it all comes together they might get a good result but it is going to be hard in the opening couple of races - the hardest of their careers.'","Johnny Herbert believes McLaren could find themselves at the back end of the grid when the F1 season starts .

"West Ham striker Carlton Cole has accepted a Football Association charge over a Twitter exchange with a Tottenham supporter. Cole had until 6pm on Thursday night to respond to the charge of making a comment which 'was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper and/or brings the game into disrepute'. A FA independent commission will now meet to decide his sanction, with no limit to the possible punishment. West Ham United striker Carlton Cole has admitted an FA charge for a tweet that the FA deemed abusive . Cole tweeted back to a Tottenham fan who had insulted him on Twitter, telling the  supporter: 'F off you c***' The charge related to Cole's involvement in a Twitter altercation with a Spurs fan following West Ham's 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw at White Hart Lane on February 22. The 31-year-old, who has 122,000 followers on the social networking site, was responding to a message from Spurs supporter Stuart Hardy that read: 'Hi @CarltonCole1 when your own team-mates don't kick the ball out when you're lying injured for 2 mins, you think it's time to call it a day?' Cole replied: 'F off you c***' before later deleting the tweet. Cole could have left West Ham in January's transfer window but a move to West Bromwich Albion fell through . The former Chelsea striker has been in trouble before for previous postings on social media and this may be taken into account in his punishment. He was fined £20,000 by the FA in April 2011 for a tweet he posted during England's friendly against Ghana that read: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap! 'The only way to get out safely is to wear an England jersey and paint your face w/ the St George's flag!'

"England forward Danny Welbeck is set for a 'great future' at Arsenal, but manager Arsene Wenger warned all his players their first duty is to serve the club - whether that is on the pitch or on the bench. Welbeck joined the Gunners on transfer deadline day from Manchester United, where he had become frustrated at a lack of opportunities in his preferred central striker role. Since the return to fitness and form of Olivier Giroud, who spent four months out with a broken leg, the 24-year-old has found himself deployed on the flank of a front three along with Alexis Sanchez, rather than down the middle. Danny Welbeck joined Arsenal from Manchester United last summer after growing frustrated at bit-part role . The striker was left on the bench for Wednesday's Premier League match against QPR . Welbeck was a late substitute for both of the previous two Barclays Premier League matches, but could face his former club in Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford. Wenger is convinced Welbeck, who has seven Arsenal goals, can play a big part in the future of the team, but like everyone else has to earn their place in the starting XI. 'Danny Welbeck puts big team effort in, he plays very well for me and is an exceptional player who will have a great future here,' said Wenger, who confirmed centre-back Gabriel Paulista was set for 'two to three weeks' out with a hamstring injury suffered in the midweek Barclays Premier League win over QPR at Loftus Road. 'The subject is raised because he is a former Man United player, (but) I am very, very happy that I bought him.' Wenger continued: 'Welbeck is very important and has played many, many games since the start of the season. The England international was also absent from the starting line-up against Everton last Sunday . Arsene Wenger says Welbeck has a bright future at Arsenal but faces a lot of competition . 'His position is one of the three up front, central, left or right. He can play anywhere.' England forward Theo Walcott is another who has watched on from the bench in recent weeks, as Wenger finally enjoys the luxury of strength in depth. The Arsenal boss added: 'We have a lot of competition going on in the team, especially up front - we have plenty of offensive potential. It makes every decision more difficult. 'People always raise these kind of questions when (either) you do not have enough players, or when you do have enough players. '(However), we have chosen a job where competition is part of our job. That means we can't complain about that, because we have made that choice. 'Our job is to serve the club and to compete with other people to do as well as we can to serve the club. The 24-year-old could return to the side for Monday night's FA Cup clash against former side United . Wenger confirmed he will be without defender Gabriel for up to three weeks due to a hamstring injury . 'The only important thing is what the club achieves - all of us are only here for that.' Arsenal have a poor record at Old Trafford, not winning since September 2006 and suffering an 8-2 thumping there in August 2011. Wenger, though, sees no reason why the Gunners, who are ahead of United in the Premier League table, should not be able to produce the required performance this time around. 'I don't believe too much in history, I just believe in the performance on the day,' he said. 'At the moment we are doing very well away from home. The size of the pitch is exactly the same everywhere, it is just down to how much we turn up and how much effort we put in to win the game. 'Both teams will think if we get over this hurdle, we have a good opportunity to win the competition. Wenger was forced to defend Mesut Ozil after criticism from former United midfielder Paul Scholes . 'We are confident from our Premier League run, so we go to Manchester United to qualify and to give absolutely everything.' Wenger, meanwhile, rejected criticism of Mesut Ozil by former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, who claimed the German playmaker was only 'going through the motions' at Arsenal. 'I think a player like Paul Scholes would have loved to play with Mesut Ozil,' Wenger said. 'We are all in a job where in every single game we have to prove a point. 'I believe Ozil has the quality, he puts a lot of effort in to help the team and he works much harder than his style shows. 'You can be cheated a little bit by his style of play, because he is fluent, easy, subtle and he does not look like he puts the effort in, but he does.'","Danny Welbeck joined Arsenal from Manchester United last summer .

"Marseille climbed above Paris Saint-Germain into second-place in Ligue 1 with an emphatic 6-1 victory at struggling Toulouse on Friday to reignite their title challenge. Marseille had not registered a league victory since January 31 as their title push faltered but the visitors were 3-0 up after 20 minutes and 4-0 up at the break in a rampant first half display. Belgian forward Michy Batshuayi fired Marseille into a second minute lead with a superb long-range strike before Baptiste Aloe doubled their advantage after he converted Benjamin Mendy's shot in the sixth minute.

The hosts improved after the break and pulled back a goal in the 76th minute when Wissam Ben Yedder's low shot beat Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. The four-goal lead was restored two minutes later, however, when the lively Ayew slotted home from a seemingly offside position.

"With five minutes gone Sergio Aguero embarked on one of his thrilling mazy runs deep into Leicester territory only to be flattened on the edge of the area. By David Silva. If Gary Neville was watching, he may well have given a knowing nod. The former Manchester United star spoke at length in the build up to this match about how City are unbalanced in a 4-4-2 when they play Aguero, Silva and Yaya Toure. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero cuts a frustrated figure during Wednesday's 2-0 victory over Leicester . David Silva jumps for joy and punches the air after giving Man City the lead at the Etihad Stadium . Silva proved his point - literally - sending the Argentine tumbling to the floor before many had even taken their seats. Neville's wider point was that the trio - breathtaking when on the front foot but seemingly out of breath when asked to defend - are a luxury Manuel Pellegrini can ill afford when up against the cream of Europe. With all due respect to Leicester they are not the cream of Europe, rather the dregs of the Premier League, but they proved his point more than once at a pancake-flat Etihad. From the kick-off Toure wandered into the visitors' half. It was where he would spend most of the match. The Ivorian's lack of an appetite for hard work did not go unnoticed among the blue-collar faithful. After one run, in which he was felled on the edge of the box but failed to win a free-kick, he stayed down for what seemed like an eternity. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure appeared to go down for what seemed an eternity during the match . Aguero is surrounded by the Leicester defence as the Man City frontman bids to make an opening . By the time he got up, Leicester were on the attack in the City half. It was all too much for one punter in front of the press box who wasted no time in getting to his feet. 'Get up you lazy g**' was his frustrated shout. Nobody told him to shut up. Against cellar dweller opponents who have four wins from 26 attempts it was unimpressive stuff and perhaps an indication of why, before this encounter, City had just nine points from a possible 21 in the Premier League. It would be remiss, however, to deny that when it works (and it has won them two titles) it works well. For the opener, Toure's surging run ended with a pass to Silva in space. His flick found an overlapping Aleks Kolarov and after some ping pong in the Leicester box Silva prodded home. Silva prods the ball home past a sprawling Mark Schwarzer to give City the lead in first half injury time . Toure gestures in the direction of midfielder Jesus Navas during Wednesday's victory at the Etihad Stadium . Silva also lofted two delightful balls over the visitors' defence, one for a misfiring Wilfried Bony and one for Sergio Aguero. Both strikers put their efforts over the bar but it would be very difficult for any manager to drop the graceful Spaniard. Neville's point, however, was reaffirmed on 74 minutes. At 1-0, Nigel Pearson's plucky visitors should not have been in with a sniff. But in the midst of host of missed opportunities for the home side Riyad Mahrez hit a post. Had that gone in it could have been title race over. As it turned out, sub James Milner made it 2-0 after Silva had been replaced by Frank Lampard. Better opposition, however, would have reinforced Neville's point even further.","Manchester City defeated Leicester 2-0 on Wednesday night .

"A self-made millionaire from Northern Ireland will put £30million of his personal fortune into Formula One’s phoenix team, Manor. Stephen Fitzpatrick, a 37-year-old entrepreneur, made that commitment at a press conference. With that injection, plus £28m in prize money, the team will run on a total budget of £58million. Manor will take part in the opening race of the season in Melbourne on Sunday week, subject to their cars passing crash tests. Briton Will Stevens is one of their drivers. Ovo founder Stephen Fitzpatrick (left) has joined forces with former Sainsbury CEO Justin King (right) Manor, who as Marussia went into administration last October, will be chaired in the interim by Justin King, former Sainsbury’s chief executive. Fitzpatrick, a former JP Morgan trader turned founder of energy company OVO, revealed he was a Formula One fan. He attended the Singapore Grand Prix, watching from the outside, ‘figuring out a way to get over there’ (on the inside of the sport). He then spoke to King about resurrecting the team. With stability and sponsorship the initial aims Fitzpatrick joked: ‘We’re unlikely to win any races for the first half of the season.’ Britain's Will Stevens has been announced as the renamed Manor team's first driver for the 2015 season . The team, formerly known as Marussia that went into administration at the end of October and missed the final three races of last season, will continue to be run by sporting director Graeme Lowdon and team principal John Booth. Manor has been preparing their cars at their old base in Dinnington, South Yorkshire, which comply fully with the 2015 regulations. Lowdon claims the cars, which are being crash tested this week, are 'a new concept of car with a very high degree of carry over (from 2014), with a lot of safety upgrades for 2015'. But the team will definitely be heading to Melbourne for the first race on March 13-15, with the majority of the freight on its way to Albert Park on Friday. Fitzpatrick, who previously worked as an investment banker at JP Morgan, concedes when he first approached Lowdon the team's cause appeared 'almost hopeless'. Former team Marussia will return to Formula One under the name of Manor this season . Fitzpatrick added: 'It was one of those situations that needed more time to understand everything, so it seemed too late, with no realistic possibility of reviving the team. 'But it was ironic that after making it through a hard first five years, claiming ninth in last year's championship and reaching the first rung of financial stability - if there is such a thing in Formula One - and then running out of steam, it seemed like too good a story to end there. 'So I looked to see if there was a way to help this team cling to life, to survival. 'After speaking to Graeme, who was very straightforward and we had some frank discussions, there was just one long list of challenges, top of which was to re-establish credibility with the main suppliers, like Ferrari. 'It was a very complex landscape, with a lot of legal and financial challenges, and now in 10 days' time we will be in Melbourne with a solid business platform on which to operate. 'For me, Justin has been a huge help in navigating the landmines, especially as this is the first company I've bought.' King has confirmed he is only on board in an interim basis and that he will assist in looking for a full-time chairman before taking on a non-executive directorship. King said: 'I know from the years I spent at Sainsbury's that with the right people, right values and sheer hard work, you can turn any business around. The F1 team will enter a Company Voluntary Arrangement that will see them emerge from administration . 'In Graeme and John we have all three and I'm fully confident we can help Manor be competitive at the highest level of racing.' Lowdon concedes people will be unaware of the hurdles that have had to be cleared over the past few months in order for the team to be on the brink of racing again when it seemed they would fold. Lowdon and Booth have moved heaven and earth to ensure the marque would continue in F1, holding numerous negotiations, notably with the long list of creditors owed a combined total of £60million. It resulted in deals being struck and Manor obtaining a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA) on February 19, allowing them to exit administration and press ahead with plans to return to the grid. Power-unit supplier Ferrari, the main creditor owed £16.5m, was one of the key players in Manor's ability to acquire the CVA. 'The last few months have been a bit of a rollercoaster,' said Lowdon. 'It's important to say in getting back to racing we've had a huge amount of support from the FIA, FOM, Bernie (Ecclestone), our suppliers, partners and staff, with many of them back on board. 'I have to pay particular thanks to Stephen who has a passion for the sport, but what really struck me is that he also has a passion for business challenges. 'He is driven by solving problems, and I've been incredibly impressed by his ability in doing that. This team would not have been saved without his input.' Manor confirmed last week young Briton Will Stevens as one of their drivers, with the 23-year-old given a taste of F1 in the final race of last season in Abu Dhabi when he drove for Caterham in their bid to emerge from their own administrative process. No announcement has been made yet as to the second driver.","Marussia will return to Formula One under the name Manor .

"Kolo Toure always knew that Liverpool would turn things around after a difficult start to their Premier League campaign and has cited manager Brendan Rodgers as the reason. Despite coming within two points of winning the title last season, the Reds initially struggled this term after losing Luis Suarez and bringing in a raft of new signings - losing four of their opening five league games. However, Liverpool have been the form team of 2015, winning seven and drawing two of their league games to challenge for a Champions League place while reaching the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. Kolo Toure (left) trains ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final clash with Blackburn on Sunday . The defender insists he always knew Brendan Rodgers would come good for Liverpool this season . Toure has hailed 'intelligent' Rodgers for making Liverpool the Premier League form team of 2015 . Speaking to The Independent, Toure said: I'm not surprised by the turn around because the manager is great, really intelligent in working out problems. 'He pays attention to every detail, tries different things, pushes players so you don't get lazy. We had a lot of new players coming in, especially young ones from abroad who had to settle in. 'I moved to England when I was 21 so i know it takes time to fit in, to learn. I knew that eventually it would all come together, and that is what the boss kept telling us as well.' Liverpool face Blackburn Rovers on Sunday for a chance of boosting their season even further by reaching the FA Cup semi-finals . Toure, who has returned from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast, could become the first player in history to win the FA Cup with three different clubs, having already collected the trophy with Arsenal (2003, 2005) and Manchester City (2011). Toure could become the first player to win the FA Cup with three clubs, having won it with Arsenal (above) and Manchester City previously . The 33-year-old celebrates winning the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast in February . Although the 33-year-old has been used as a substitute in Liverpool's last two games, he understands that he is not guaranteed playing time at Anfield. 'When you're with a big team like Liverpool, you can't expect to start every game, especially because I was a way with the Ivory Coast for almost a month. 'But I am always ready to contribute whether it is on the pitch or in the dressing room. We have a team that's hungry for success, with exciting young players that I help guide with experience. The winning mentality is really, really strong.'","Liverpool face Blackburn in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday .

"Typical Paul O'Connell. Ireland are chasing down a possible second Grand Slam in six years and, instead of the narrative being exclusively about how Joe Schmidt's side will fare in jumping hurdle number four at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, the skipper's 100th cap for his country is providing a smokescreen for teammates glad of a diversionary topic. O'Connell wouldn't be of a mind to mention his milestone within camp himself. But still, as a topic for his comrades to pass the time with during short media sessions, it falls into perfect, anything-but-Wales, territory. Take Devin Toner, the Leinster giant who has become O'Connell's regular second-row sidekick over the past few seasons. Paul O'Connell is preparing for his 100th cap for his country at the Millenium Stadium on Saturday . Joe Schmidt are chasing down a possible second Grand Slam in six years at the Millenium Stadium . Ask about the general mechanics of the Irish lineout and the response is brief. 'I don't want to give anything away about lineout strategies,' he says. Enquire about the centurion, though, and there's, eventually, much greater pep to his patter. 'There's not much more to be said that hasn't already been said about Paulie. He's a world-class player and I don't think I'd be the player I am today without having played with him. 'I've learned so much from all the second rows I've played with, especially Leo Cullen and Paul. He's a massive leader in the squad, just a massive player on the pitch and players look up to him,' says Toner, who admits to closely watching O'Connell's ruck clear-outs as something he'd like to replicate. O'Connell gets angry during the Ireland training session at Kingspan Stadium  in Belfast, Northern Ireland . 'Just to get to 100 caps is a huge testament to how he has looked after himself and to play at the top level for that long (since his debut against Wales in 2002) is unbelievable. 'It was more intimidating playing against him for the first time because I didn't really fancy it to be honest,' continues Toner, adding that this provincial level fear has eroded now that they are Test colleagues. 'He wouldn't be in my head now… but he's kind of like Joe (Schmidt) in that you need to know your detail or he gets on top of you. That's a hugely good thing. 'More players should be doing it. He has driven standards along with Joe… the two of them just drive the squad. You don't want to disappoint either of them.'

O'Connell looks on after his teams victory during the RBS Six Nations match between Ireland and England . 'He has always led from the front. He might look a bit mad from the sidelines but he has always got this calm head. If things are going south, Paulie is a good man to bring everything back under check,' says the veteran tighthead about his fellow 35-year-old. 'When he was playing for Young Munster, I was over in Fermoy playing Junior Two or something like that. The first time I came into contact with him was at a Munster Under 20s training session. He has always stood out,' recalls Ross. 'I remember watching him take the park for a pre-season friendly, coming on for Mick O'Driscoll. He was an impressive physical specimen even then.

However, while they now still have everything to play for after three championship wins stretched their overall unbeaten run to a record equalling 10 matches, Toner doesn't feel there is a different dynamic to 2015's round four preparations - even though 'Grand Slam' is the phrase on every Ireland supporter's lips. 'I don't think there is much difference. If we look at it now, it's semifinal and final time, so we are in a good place. 'It's similar to last year. If we win the two games, we win the championship and the Grand Slam,' says Toner, adding that the growing hype outside their secluded Carton House base is largely passing him by, save for last Sunday's visit to his old North Kildare stomping ground. 'I don't really read the newspaper or see much that goes on. Obviously people want to talk about it but I'm just naturally relaxed about it. It doesn't really faze me.

"By the time AP McCoy traipsed in, ninth in the first race of his last Cheltenham Festival, the acclaim for his great friend and rival was ringing in his ears. The sound of rolling thunder from the crowd, packed 50-deep on The Lawns along the final two furlongs of the closing straight, concluded with Ruby Walsh’s name being chanted. Suddenly the people’s hero seemed quite incidental. It was not to get a great deal better for the man who transcends National Hunt racing, and whose farewell to its biggest meeting dominated the build-up to this event. AP McCoy rides Jezki to a disappointing fourth in the Champion Hurdle on day one of Cheltenham . In truth, McCoy has known plenty of days like this at Cheltenham before, and while he will have felt disappointment, his supporters in a record opening-day crowd of 63,000 had much to compensate them. The thought of this Festival helps sustain some people through the long winter months and, when it finally arrived, it could hardly have been more glorious. Cleeve Hill almost shimmered in the background as springtime attempted its own burst to the front. Amid the drama McCoy fought hard to try to fulfil the expectations placed upon him, perhaps more from a wider sporting public who have come to revere his sustained excellence. The cognoscenti know that there is little low hanging fruit for him at Cheltenham this year, but there are still three days left to make this a fitting valedictory appearance. The fantasy ending remains victory on Friday, either in the Gold Cup or the meeting’s final race, which has been temporarily renamed in his honour. He might be a far more sanguine character than when he first started racking up the champion jockey titles, but frustration was etched into his features as he went in and out of the weighing room. McCoy had considered Jezki (above) as his best chance of a winner at Cheltenham this year . You do not become the nation’s most durable sportsman without defeats continuing to sting. On Tuesday these came in the form of finishing ninth, last, fifth, fourth and pulling up in his five races. It is a strange day when American Rich Ricci, uber-wealthy banker and the pantomime villain of racehorse ownership, gets more cheers in the parade ring than someone deemed a national treasure, but this was one of them. McCoy has admitted that he is anxious about the prospect of retirement, but afternoons such as on Tuesday might serve to ease the fear. No defeat hurt more than coming fourth on Jezki in the Champion Hurdle, and the horse’s trainer Jessica Harrington revealed he had been quick to take responsibility. McCoy looks dejected after the final race, the Chaps Restaurants Barbados Novices’ Handicap Steeplechase . ‘AP was blaming himself, saying he took on Faugheen at the top of the hill, and in chasing the winner it probably cost him second or third and he finished fourth,’ she said. ‘If he had ridden him to be second to Faugheen then he may well have been second.’ The latter scenario was never likely to happen, especially as McCoy had identified Jezki, the defending champion from last year, as probably his best chance in 2015. He was not to add to his comparatively modest Festival tally of 30 winners, a total exceeded not just by Walsh but Barry Geraghty, too. He has tasted glory here — the Gold Cup win on Synchronised and the masterclass on Wichita Lineman in the 2009 William Hill — but it is 17 years since he was the leading jockey at this Bacchanalian jamboree. McCoy, riding Bold Henry, pulled up with two fences left in the final race of the day . McCoy, riding in his last Cheltenham Festival, did not have the day he would have hoped upon arrival . Some revellers had gone home as he set off in the last race, the exotically-named Chaps Restaurants Barbados Novices’ Handicap Steeplechase, on Bold Henry. They were never in it and pulled up with two fences left. Afterwards McCoy had what looked like a lengthy inquest with the owner JP McManus before fairly sprinting back to the weighing room for the last time. He was not in the mood to discuss the afternoon’s events, saying only ‘it was all right.’ Perhaps he could merely have pointed to the name of the horse who had started favourite and just come second in the final chase. For AP it had been a Thomas Crapper kind of day.","The 2015 Cheltenham Festival got under way on Tuesday .

"For Dundee United and Celtic, the trilogy becomes a quadrilogy. Already facing each other three times in three competitions at three different venues across the third month of the year, one final blast of beleaguered referee Craig Thomson’s whistle at Tannadice ensured yet another instalment of this saga. In the movie business, each successive film in a franchise tends to be markedly poorer than its predecessor. And as the dust settled on this breathtaking and at times bewildering contest of almost incessant controversy, the suspicion lingered that nothing that lies ahead in March could possibly match this blockbuster for drama, action and utter high farce. For on an astonishing Scottish Cup afternoon on Tayside, nine-man United fought to a valiant 1-1 draw against their 10-man visitors. This was a game scarred by two early red cards, ultimately three in total, but, in truth, there could have been five. One, dished out to the luckless Paul Paton, was a monumentally unjust case of mistaken identity. Leigh Griffiths wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1-1 draw with Dundee United . Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (right) was sent off after only nine minutes of the Scottish Cup quarter-final . In a case of mistaken identity, the referee also sent off Dundee United's Paul Paton . Adding to the scandal, Nadir Ciftci, the United striker who opened the scoring from the spot after team-mate Aidan Connolly appeared to dive to win a penalty, should not have been on the park at all after kicking out at Scott Brown. The Celtic captain was, himself, lucky to escape red for a quite awful challenge on the Turkish forward in the first place. And even after all that drama there was still room to plot in a villain-to-hero story, as Leigh Griffiths missed a penalty then scored an equaliser to break the heart of outstanding United keeper Rado Cierzniak. Griffiths’ beautiful header secured a replay at Parkhead on March 18 – the second of three games in a week between the teams – although the Celtic striker may now relinquish penalty duties. ‘I had the chance to get us back in it with the penalty but he saved it,’ said Griffiths. ‘I’d been practising in training all day yesterday [Saturday] and never missed a single one. I apologised to the fans because I never scored. It was my fault and if Kris Commons is back in the team next week he will be back on them because he’s No1 penalty taker. But if not I will put my hand up to take one because I am always confident. ‘Their goalie’s had one of those games, he saved everything we threw at him. I hope he’s not in that form in the final next week or we could be in trouble. But it was nice that I picked myself up to score.' The referee points to the spot after Aidan Connolly was brought down in the Celtic box . Celtic keeper Craig Gordon fails to stop Nadir Ciftci from giving Dundee Utd the lead . Dundee United's Nadir Ciftci celebrates scoring the opening goal with a penalty . The tone for a bizarre afternoon was set on nine minutes when Brown went in hard on Ciftci. He retaliated with a kick towards the Celtic skipper’s head. In the same melee, Calum Butcher slid into Virgil van Dijk, who appeared to stamp down on the United man as the pair tangled on the ground. And yet, after a three-minute discussion between referee Thomson and his assistant Graham Chambers, red cards were issued to van Dijk and, astonishingly, the apparently blameless Paton instead of Butcher. As he trudged off, Paton’s face was the picture of incredulity. This season he has already been banned for two games for allegedly spitting at Aberdeen’s Johnny Hayes – despite his ‘victim’ protesting that Paton was innocent. Paton recently insisted he was the victim of unfair treatment from the SFA because he elected to play for Northern Ireland over Scotland. That, of course, remains a nonsense but he was right to feel aggrieved. As half-time approached, United nearly took the lead when Butcher’s mis-hit shot was diverted past Craig Gordon by Ryan Dow but the ball bounced back off the inside of the post and was hacked away to safety. Then, after a lighting break, Celtic raced up to the other end and great play from Stefan Johansen saw him cleverly slip the ball in for Anthony Stokes. The forward was clean through on goal, and took two touches before picking his spot. Unfortunately for him, however, the spot he chose was the bottom left post and the ball was cleared by United’s relieved defence. Whether or not the ball took a bobble on the pitch, only Stokes will know, but it looked a real sitter. Worse was to come for the Irishman when young Connolly drove at the Celtic defence and appeared to throw himself to the ground with Stokes nearby. Dundee United have a second player sent off after Paul Dixon (3rd left) receives his marching orders . Griffiths missed his chance to equalise for Celtic from the penalty spot . It looked a dive but Ciftci didn’t care about that as he ruthlessly cracked his spot kick low and hard beyond the diving Gordon. As the teams left the park at half-time Emilio Izaguirre was furious at the award of the spot kick. But it was the Honduran’s misplaced clearance into the path of Connolly that had put his team under pressure in the first place. It was a crazy conclusion to the first half but the second period immediately brought fresh madness. Within three minutes, Dundee United were down to nine men when Griffiths’ shot struck Paul Dixon on the arm as the United defender attempted to block. Griffiths caught the ball well but United goalkeeper Cierzniak, so often criticised, pulled off a wonderful save to prevent Celtic levelling. With United moving to a 5-3-0 formation, it was like the Alamo at times but there were great saves to come from Cierzniak - from both Stokes and substitute John Guidetti. Griffiths makes up for his penalty miss by drawing Celtic level with a header . Celtic captain Scott Brown celebrates with Griffiths as the game finishes in a 1-1 draw . Despite the one-way traffic, however, Gordon had to look lively to stop Butcher scoring on a rare United counter. Just as it looked like Celtic’s treble dreams could come unstuck on an unacceptably poor Tannadice pitch, Griffiths gained his redemption. Running on to Stefan Johansen’s beautifully-flighted ball, he nodded expertly beyond Cierzniak. From then on in, United nine men battled valiantly to remain in the hunt for a semi-final spot. ‘It will be a tough game at Hampden against Inverness or Raith,’ nodded Griffiths after the draw was made. ‘Either side will make it hard for us - but that’s only if we get through by finishing the job at Parkhead. But we know Dundee United will make it tough for us.’ At the end of a quite thrilling encounter, United had sent out a clear message ahead of the sequel, next Sunday’s League Cup final at Hampden. Beware the Ides of March.","William Hill Scottish Cup quarter-final ended in a 1-1 draw at Tannadice .

"Hull KR prop Michael Weyman has announced his retirement with immediate effect at the age of 30 after failing to recover from a knee injury. Weyman made 24 appearances for the Robins after joining them from St George Illawarra at the start of last season but has missed their opening four Super League matches of 2015, and after undergoing knee surgery a fortnight ago has now decided to hang up his boots. The former Canberra and New South Wales forward, who was a Grand Final and World Club Challenge winner with the Dragons, will now return home to Australia with his family. Michael Weyman has been forced to retire from rugby league after failing to recover from a knee injury . 'It has meant a lot to me to play for Rovers and I would like to thank the supporters and everybody at the club for making my family and I feel so welcome over the last 18 months,' said Weyman, who was runner-up to Josh Hodgson as Rovers' player of the year in 2014. 'We've really enjoyed our time here and we've met some great friends who we'll continue to stay in touch with after we move back to Australia. 'It's a sad way to end my career but unfortunately these things happen and I've been lucky enough to achieve what I have in the game. It's now time to look at the bigger picture and think about my family. The prop (right) signed for Hull KR last season and made only 24 appearances for the club . 'My knee isn't responding to treatment and I wanted to do the right thing by the club as well. I don't want to be sitting in the stands for most of the year.' Hull KR coach Chris Chester said: 'We are disappointed to lose a player of Mick's calibre but he has been a great servant to the club during his time here and he leaves with our best wishes for the future. 'He's been a great leader for this club and this is not the way he would have wanted to end his career, but he's played at the highest level and can be rightly proud of what he's achieved in the game. 'We've already begun the search for a replacement for Mick and we're looking both in this country and overseas. We now have a full quota spot to play with but we won't be rushing into any decisions. We have a really close-knit squad this year and whoever we bring in will have to fit in both on and off the field.'

"England's cricket calamity has sharpened the minds of their rugby counterparts, who know they are next in line to carry the nation's hopes into a World Cup. Events in Australia on Monday registered strongly at the Red Rose HQ in Surrey — serving to highlight the pressure that will come with the global tournament on these shores later this year. While there are still two rounds of RBS 6 Nations matches to go, Stuart Lancaster is mindful of September's showpiece. England's failure to beat Bangladesh in the Cricket World Cup has got Stuart Lancaster feeling the pressure .

'It's hugely disappointing to see the cricket guys go out and you understand the expectation and the stakes,' said the head coach. 'I have a massive game on Saturday and another one the following Saturday, but you can't help thinking ahead to what September is going to look and feel like. With it being in our own country, the pressure and expectation is going to be huge.' Asked if he empathised with England cricket coach Peter Moores, who faces a fight to save his job, Lancaster said: 'I've met him a couple of times but we haven't spoken recently. 'Any coach can empathise with another from their country who has had a difficult World Cup. It reinforces the need for us to be as prepared as we can be for our big challenge in six months.'

"Roy Hodgson would have left Loftus Road with a warm-tingly feeling yesterday. It had nothing to do with the mid-March sunshine, however. It was because of Tottenham striker Harry Kane.

Wayne Rooney            24                   10 . The Spurs striker won the battle at a canter. That's not a slight on Austin, who also would have impressed Hodgson. But when the England manager names his squad for the games against Lithuania and Italy on Thursday, in Kane he has a striker who has every hallmark of an international footballer. For Austin, the jury is still out. Kane was, essentially, the difference between the two teams at QPR. It wouldn't have come as surprise to Rangers boss Chris Ramsey, who played an influential role in nurturing the striker in the White Hart Lane academy. Spurs striker Kane celebrates as his goals keep Tottenham in the hunt for a top four finish . Rangers star Austin is denied from adding to his impressive goals tally by a save from Hugo Lloris . QPR striker Austin watches as his shot beats Lloris only to crash off the crossbar . 'He has polished himself, I was fortunate to have worked with him,' said Ramsey. 'Would I pick him for England? Yes, I would - but the way I'm going...' Two goals against QPR took his tally for the season to 26. That's a record you simply cannot ignore. Hodgson certainly won't. The only question for the England manager now is if he utilises the striker in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania or ease him in during the friendly against Italy. His first goal against Rangers showed great bravery, risking a hefty blow to the head to glance home Andros Townsend's free kick. His second showed great composure, skipping round Rob Green before finishing into an empty net. He ticks every box. But his goals only tell part of the story. Kane's heat map (right) in the opposition half showed he posed a greater threat than Austin (left) Twice he showed excellent vision to set up marauding right-back Kyle Walker with goal scoring opportunities, executing both passes with unerring accuracy. Had it not been for Green's heroics in Rangers' goal, Kane could easily have had four by the time Craig Pawson blew the final whistle.

Youngs revealed All Black and 2011 World Cup winner Brad Thorn - now a Leicester team-mate - told the 25-year-old not to fear any Six Nations disappointment will creep into the tilt towards the Webb Ellis Cup. 'I spoke to Brad Thorn and New Zealand lost to Australia in the Tri Nations in 2011 but no-one remembers that,' said Youngs. 'He told me not to beat myself up too much. You haven't won the Grand Slam but the title is still up for grabs. He had been there in 2011. 'We are disappointed not to get the result but we will be delighted if we were to win the championship because it is a very hard thing to win. 'It is really important (to finish the Six Nations strongly). And it is not too dissimilar to how it was coming into Samoa and Australia after losing our first two games in the autumn. Youngs has challenged England to set the World Cup standard in their last two competitive Twickenham .

Youngs insists England have not given up hope on stealing the Six Nations crown, but did admit the Ireland loss is 'a blow'. Alex Goode (second left) and Mako Vunipola leave the field at full-time as the Irish team celebrate their win . 'We need to get the result now, as well as the performance, get back to the levels of the second-half in Wales,' said Youngs, ahead of hosting Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday. 'That means playing on the front foot, playing English rugby, being powerful, getting over the top of teams, being good at the breakdown, beating teams round the corner and being really direct.

'You've got real good momentum and your confidence is great. 'It's a real dampener when it doesn't work out but it's a good test of character to see how you react to it. We can go either one way or the other. 'The way we've got to continue to see it is that we're still very much in this championship. 'Chris (Robshaw) spoke really well after the game.

A 19-9 loss in Dublin has left the red rose on the periphery of the RBS 6 Nations title picture, needing Wales to intervene by beating the reigning champions in Cardiff this weekend. It was an alarming performance at the Aviva Stadium just five matches out from the World Cup with a pack that has excelled over the last year failing to cover itself in glory. Forwards coach Rowntree expects Scotland to feel the full force of England's anguish when the Championship enters its penultimate round. 'There is lots we have to put right because the Ireland game was immensely frustrating and disappointing,' Rowntree said. 'I've just got over it, if I'm honest. We had a long week last week pulling it apart. 'We're playing a team at Twickenham who have just lost at home and have a lot to prove themselves. I expect a reaction from us. We have an honest group of lads and we're not satisfied at all with that performance. But we have this week to put it right.' The pack were subdued against Ireland, lacking the Celts' ferocity as they came off worse in just about every department of the game. He added: 'We just couldn't get our game going and that comes down to a multitude of reasons. Ill-discipline was one. It was a very good Ireland performance. They stifled our game and fair play, the best team won. 'The way they quickly amassed points on the scoreboard was frustrating, but at half time we were still very much in the game. 'It was a clinical performance from Ireland, but we came back strongly and that was important.

"England full-back Mike Brown is expected to be available for the RBS 6 Nations showdown with Scotland as he enters the final stage of his recovery from concussion. Brown's tenacity and watertight defence were missed in Sunday's 19-9 defeat by Ireland after he suffered a double setback during the return to play protocols having been knocked out against Italy. The 29-year-old will undertake full contact training on Thursday and is on course to be given the green light 24 hours later to face the winless Scots at Twickenham on March 14. Mike Brown has been suffering from concussion and missed England's defeat in Ireland last week . Brown was knocked out while tackling Italy's Andrea Masi at Twickenham last month . 'We're pretty confident about Mike. He's had a reasonable amount of time now and certainly all the signs from everyone, including from Mike himself, is that he's back to 100 per cent,' head coach Stuart Lancaster said. 'He has to tick the final box and then I'm sure he'll be training on Friday. He has been symptom free since last week.' Alex Goode deputised for Brown on the afternoon England's Grand Slam dream evaporated at the Aviva Stadium and while he produced some fine moments, he was out-jumped during Robbie Henshaw's try in the key moment of the match. Goode will play for Saracens at Wasps on Sunday, after which Lancaster insists he will make a call on who starts at full-back against Scotland when the Red Rose seek to revive their title aspirations. 'Both Mike and Alex will compete for that 15 shirt next week,' Lancaster said. 'Mike has a lot of experience and does bring a lot to the team, but Alex had a good game against Ireland and dealt with the high balls well. 'If you see Johnny Sexton against other teams, he always seems to find grass with his tactical kicking but Alex managed to cover all those eventualities. 'There was a lot of work that came Alex's way and he did well. I'm keeping an open mind until next week.' Brown is set to return to training in a much-needed boost to England boss Stuart Lancaster . Alex Goode will compete with Brown for the No 15 jersey after filling in against Ireland . Inside centre Luther Burrell has a calf injury but Lancaster is 'reasonably optimistic' he will resume training on Tuesday. Lancaster's immediate impression after England had been kicked into submission by Sexton and his Lions half-back partner Conor Murray was one of a 'tight Test decided by small margins'. And having reviewed a defeat that has halted the momentum generated after Wales and Italy were swept aside in an encouraging start to the Six Nations, Lancaster voices his exasperation at failing to deliver during key moments. Luther Burrell has picked up a calf injury but Lancaster is hopeful that the centre will be fine for Scotland . Lancaster is adamant that Johnny Sexton was the reason between defeat and victory in Ireland . 'There's frustration that we hadn't delivered the level and quality of performance that we'd hoped to,' Lancaster said. 'We knew how difficult it was going to be. It was right up there alongside the Wales game, if not tougher because of the quality of the opposition and the run they were on. 'They're a high-quality team across the board. They have a simple gameplan that they execute well, primarily when Jonny Sexton is on the field. It changed when he came off. 'We needed to be at the very top our game to have got a win over there. We weren't quite and that was the frustration. 'There were moments in the second half when they got the try on the back of an advantage from a penalty. That left us with a big hurdle. 'We came back and there were definitely some key moments around the 70th minute when we had a try disallowed. 'You have to be able to control the big moments and we didn't get enough of those to win the game.'","Mike Brown is ready to return to training on Friday .

"The commission that has investigated doping in cycling will not be recommending that Lance Armstrong’s lifetime ban from competitive sport is reduced. The American stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for using performance-enhancing drugs was hoping the Cycling Independent Reform Commission would be more sympathetic after he twice gave evidence to the three-man panel. But CIRC, who submitted their report to the UCI last Friday and are due to hold a media briefing in Switzerland next week, are not planning to recommend to the United States Anti-Doping Agency that they reduce their ban. Lance Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for using performance-enhancing drugs . Armstrong waves from the podium after winning the 16th stage of the 2005 Tour de France . Some reports suggested on Sunday that lawyers representing Armstrong placed certain limitations on what CIRC could ask, which in turn was being given as a reason for the stance CIRC have now adopted. But Armstrong’s legal team vehemently deny that, insisting that no restrictions were placed on CIRC in their two interviews with the Texan. Only recently Armstrong suggested to the BBC that he had answered all CIRC’s questions candidly. ‘At this point in my life I’m not out to protect anybody,’ he said. ‘I’m out to protect seven people and they all have the last name Armstrong.’ Armstrong told the BBC that he is out to protect seven people - 'and they all have the last name Armstrong' The American leads ahead of Bradley Wiggins during Stage 17 of the 2009 Tour de France . Armstrong is sure to be angered by the fact that a number of his contemporaries – who have also been guilty of doping offences – did not even cooperate with CIRC and yet remain senior figures in the sport. Brian Cookson, the UCI president, had warned that such a lack of cooperation would be frowned upon and it will be interesting to see if he sticks to his promise of introducing a fit-and-proper-person test for cycling team officials in the wake of the CIRC report. Cookson has said the report will make ‘uncomfortable’ reading for his sport. ‘When you open a can of worms you find a lot of worms,’ Cookson said last month at the world track cycling championships in Paris. ‘I think it’s going to be very interesting - there will be a lot of uncomfortable things there.’ Brian Cookson, the UCI president, has said that the report will make for 'uncomfortable reading' Chris Froome revealed to Sportsmail that he has spoken to the CIRC about the problem of doping . But he also took a swipe at Armstrong, accusing him of having an ‘agenda’ for revealing he had spoken to CIRC in the first place. Armstrong obviously does have an agenda; he wants his ban reduced when other dopers from his era have not been hit with the same severe sanctions. But criticising anyone for revealing they have spoken to CIRC seems a curious position to adopt when the promise of anonymity might yet protect those who haven’t come forward. Only last week Chris Froome revealed to Sportsmail that he too has spoken to CIRC, having wanted to give a senior rider’s perspective on the problems that continue to undermine the UCI’s efforts to clean up the sport. Particularly at a time when the UCI are pushing for the racing licence of the Astana team – that boasts current Tour de France champion Vicenzo Nibali – to be revoked.","Lance Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for using performance-enhancing drugs .

"If this was the last-chance saloon then Rafael was the life and soul of the party with a standout performance as Manchester United's Under 21s drew 1-1 with Tottenham. The Brazilian right back, 24, is said to be fighting for his future at Old Trafford after struggling to impress manager Louis van Gaal. He has made just nine appearances this term and was an unused substitute for the 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Arsenal on Monday after being left out of the squad altogether for the previous two matches against Sunderland and Newcastle - despite overcoming injury. Rafael impressed for Manchester United's U21s against Tottenham at Old Trafford on Tuesday . Rafael was an unused substitute during United's FA Cup quarter-final defeat to Arsenal on Monday . Rafael was United's star performer in their 1-1 draw against Tottenham's U21s at Old Trafford . Rafael is congratulated by United team-mate Tom Thorpe after scoring the eqauliser on Tuesday . But he showed no sign of rustiness in the kind of all-action display that has seen him become a cult hero at Old Trafford. In a first-half in which he, unlike fellow senior Radamel Falcao, rarely put a foot wrong Rafael brought the house down with a delightful goal. With United trailing to Kenny McEvoy's neat opener, the defender intercepted a throw from Spurs keeper Luke McGee, chesting it down before clipping a delightful lob over the same man from 30 yards with his left foot. It brought a youthful house down - and was a timely reminder of his attacking talents in front of a watching assistant manager Ryan Giggs. United assistant manager Ryan Giggs (second left) and U21 Nicky Butt (third left) watched on in the stands . Antonio Valencia's misplaced back pass on Monday night saw United crash out of the FA Cup . United are understood to be open to offers for Rafael with a number of clubs in his homeland said to be leading the charge. But pressure will be growing on current incumbent Antonio Valencia after his poor performance in Monday's 2-1 home FA Cup quarter final defeat to Arsenal. Rafael will have done his cause no harm, although remaining on the field for 90 minutes would not appear to be a good omen.

"Wayne Rooney admitted Manchester United's quarter-final exit to Arsenal was 'hard to take' as his wait for an FA Cup winner's medal goes on. The England captain has never lifted the famous trophy, arriving at Old Trafford a matter of months after their last triumph in 2004. Rooney drew United level with a header from Angel di Maria's perfect cross just four minutes after Nacho Monreal had given Arsenal the lead on 25 minutes. A downbeat Wayne Rooney applauds the fans after Manchester United's FA Cup loss to Arsenal . Rooney talks to United assistant manager Ryan Giggs after the defeat at Old Trafford . Rooney had headed United level four minutes after they'd fallen behind to Nacho Monreal's opener . But a weak backpass by Antonio Valencia led to former United player Danny Welbeck rounding goalkeeper David de Gea and slotting home Arsenal's winner just after the hour mark. A bad night for Louis van Gaal's men was compounded late on when Di Maria was shown a red card for manhandling referee Michael Oliver. Rooney told MUTV after the match: 'I want to win the Cup for and with the team; it's not about me wanting to win the FA Cup. 'That's why it's so sad for us to get knocked out today, we knew we'd have a great opportunity if we'd won tonight.' Rooney converted with a flying header from Angel di Maria's perfect right-wing cross . Rooney's 29th minute goal was his 11th of the season for United in 26 outings . Manchester United fans hold up a banner in homage to Rooney during the match at Old Trafford . Reflecting on the game, he added: 'We're obviously disappointed. Going into half-time having equalised, we felt that we'd create enough chances to win the game, but it wasn't to be. 'Conceding the second goal the way we did in the second-half meant that we were always chasing the game afterwards. They made it difficult for us and defended well. 'It was a close game, it could have gone either way. Mistakes happen, but it's not nice when you're on the receiving end of one which costs you a goal. Louis van Gaal reflects on a disappointing night for United at Old Trafford as their hopes of silverware faded .

"Roberto Di Matteo admitted he was finding Schalke's Champions League exit hard to take in after his side scored four at Real Madrid on Tuesday but still failed to make it past the holders and into the  quarter-finals. Schalke produced one of the best performances of the season to claim a 4-3 victory at the Bernabeu but were eliminated 5-4 on aggregate after losing last month's last 16 first leg in Gelsenkirchen 2-0. 'On the one hand we are of course very happy that we managed to win but at the same time it's a bit hard to take in that we scored four goals in Madrid and didn't get through,' Italian Di Matteo told a news conference. Roberto Di Matteo issues instructions to his players from the touchline during the 4-3 win against Real Madrid . Former Chelsea boss Di Matteo admitted Schalke's Champions League exit was hard to take after netting four . Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored twice against his former club as Schalke were eliminated . Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, a former Real player, struck twice for the Bundesliga side, including an 84th-minute stunner that put them within a goal of pulling off a remarkable comeback. It was Real's first Champions League defeat at home in 22 games since Barcelona beat them 2-0 in April 2011 and was only the second time they had conceded four goals in a European game at the Bernabeu. However, a Cristiano Ronaldo double and a Karim Benzema strike were enough to secure a place for Real in the draw for the last eight on March 20. The Dutch striker's brace was not enough to see the Bundeliga outfit though after a 2-0 defeat in the first leg . 'I was hoping we could go into the break 2-1 up but we unfortunately didn't manage it. That would of course have made the game more interesting for us,' added Di Matteo. 'Perhaps we just didn't have that little bit of luck tonight that you need to get through such ties.' Schalke return to action in the Bundesliga with a game at Hertha Berlin on Saturday. They are fifth with 10 games left, three points behind third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, and have a good chance of winning a berth in Europe's elite club competition again for next season. Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice for Real Madrid as they made it through to the Champions League last eight . The Portugal forward heads the ball past Schalke goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther at the Bernabeu . Di Matteo said the quality of Real's forwards had been the difference between the two sides, who met at the same stage last term when Real won 9-2 on aggregate on their way to a record-extending 10th European crown. 'We didn't allow Real Madrid to get into a rhythm but they have such quality in the team and they showed that both in the first leg and tonight,' Di Matteo said.

"Wayne Rooney admits he is desperate to lift the FA Cup - the one major trophy that has eluded him throughout his club career. The England and Manchester United captain says Monday night's quarter-final against Arsenal is 'massive' - and it is so especially for the 29-year-old who has twice been on the losing side in the final. United have the benefit of home advantage but the Gunners are in better form - and are defending the trophy. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney says he would love to win the FA Cup this season . Rooney looks dejected during the final at Wembley in 2007 - a 1-0 defeat to Premier League rivals Chelsea . Rooney watched Everton lift the FA Cup in 1995 and the memories of that make him even more determined to match his old club's achievement. He said: 'We have an FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal on Monday and that is massive for us. 'We haven't been to a final for a few years, we want to try to win that game and we are looking forward to that. 'Of course, I think it is a massive trophy. It is a trophy that, growing up as a youngster, I used to love watching and I was fortunate enough to see Everton lift the FA Cup in 1995 when I was nine years old. It is something which I would love to do and hopefully it can be this year.' United were 2-0 winners over Arsenal in 2011, the last FA Cup meeting between the sides since the 2005 final in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, when the match finished 0-0 but the Gunners won after a penalty shoot-out. Rooney says he was inspired by Everton's FA Cup winners in 1995, after they beat United . Rooney scored in that shoot-out, as did Robin van Persie - for Arsenal. Van Persie and Juan Mata are the only members of the United squad to have FA Cup winners' medals, but both came with other clubs. Rooney, who has nine major honours with United, was also on the losing side in 2007 when Didier Drogba's goal in extra-time earned Chelsea a 1-0 triumph at the new Wembley Stadium. With so many of the top Premier League teams out of the competition whoever wins on Monday will have a huge chance to go all the way. Louis van Gaal said: 'It is a game, 11 v 11 on a high level.

"Evergreen Paul O'Connell can still scale new heights ahead of notching his 100th Ireland cap in Saturday's pivotal RBS 6 Nations showdown in Wales, according to Sean Cronin. Veteran lock O'Connell will equal Mick Galwey's record as Ireland's oldest captain of all time at exactly 35 years and 145 days at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. The Munster talisman will become just the fourth star to hit 100 Tests for Ireland, joining Brian O'Driscoll, Ronan O'Gara and John Hayes in the century club. Sean Cronin believes veteran Paul O'Connell (above) still has a long career ahead of him . Leinster hooker Cronin hailed O'Connell's 'intensity and physicality' as the crux of Ireland's relentless pursuit of ever-higher standards under taskmaster boss Joe Schmidt. 'It's a phenomenal achievement: I think he's getting better with it even as the years go on,' said Cronin, as Ireland look to home in on a second Grand Slam in six years this weekend. 'But he's the kind of player that, whenever he's playing, he nearly makes you play better because that's the enthusiasm, the passion, the physicality that he brings. 'He kind of instils that in the players around him, it's great to play under him. 'He sets the standard and you've got to get up there with him. 'He'll demand it off you one way or another, so it's great to play with a person like that, because it raises your standards as well.' O'Connell will equal Mick Galwey's record as Ireland's oldest captain of all time on Saturday . O'Connell will stride past a multitude of milestones in Cardiff this weekend, as he aims to mark his 50th Six Nations performance by setting Ireland a new winning Test run of 11 matches. Wales and Scotland block Ireland's path to Grand Slam glory and a third career Six Nations crown for O'Connell. As the teams complete preparations in the Millennium Stadium's bowels this weekend, O'Connell will launch into a trademark tub-thumping team talk. Cronin acknowledged the legend around O'Connell bringing team-mates to tears with his unbridled pre-match passion - but admitted the Munster stalwart's rhetoric far more fearsome than emotive. The 35-year-old is put through his paces during an Ireland training session at the Kingspan Stadium . 'I've nipped out a couple of times to dot the eyes during his talks!' joked Cronin of myths O'Connell can invoke raw emotions. 'No, but seriously, he scares me more than makes me cry to be honest with you. 'He brings a certain level, you see him doing it, his intensity, physicality, attention to detail. 'So when you see him doing that, you're saying to yourself 'I need to get to that as well'. 'If 15 or 23 lads get to that level, we're hard to beat. 'He's similar to Joe (Schmidt) in some ways. 'Paul isn't going to get to the heights of Test rugby that he has without hard work and accuracy. 'He's got great influence on the squad, the lads buy into that and he's fantastic to have around.'","Paul O'Connell will equal Mick Galwey's record as Ireland's oldest captain .

"If you were wondering what the prototype of a Louis van Gaal player is you need not do so any longer. It is Ashley Young. The versatile winger-turned-wing-back, who netted the winner in United's 1-0 victory at Newcastle United on Wednesday, is the Dutchman's kind of guy. 'He is a player who wants to perform what you say,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'I think he fits good in my profile.' Ashley Young celebrates his goal against Newcastle United, and he is a favourite of manager Louis van Gaal . Young sprints towards the Manchester United support at St James' Park after scoring in the 89th minute . Manager Van Gaal has been frequently picking Young, and United have lost just once with him in the side . So there you have it. Not Wayne Rooney, not Robin van Persie, not even £60million man Angel Di Maria. Ashley Young. The news may not go down well with legions of United fans who have spent the best part of a season doing their best Alan Turing impressions and trying to decipher Van Gaal's fabled philosophy. That Young, who has often flattered to deceive, is a cornerstone of Van Gaal's style may puzzle even further. The statistics, however, tell a different story. Aside from defeat in their home opener against Swansea, United have not lost with Young in the side. At St James' Park, albeit from a chance laid on a plate, he scored United's late winner for all three points . In the 17 matches he has been involved in since they have won 11 and drawn six. At St James' Park, albeit from a chance laid on a plate by the generous hosts, he scored United's first late winner since Boxing Day 2012. Under Van Gaal, Young appears to have recreated himself. His form at both wing-back and in his traditional slot further up the field is expected to win him a new contract and the Dutchman heaped further praise on the former Aston Villa man. 'We have played also with wing-backs and I think that is his best position,' said Van Gaal. 'Now I use him as a winger and he does a very good job. I am pleased with him.' This season has seen Young as a regular at Old Trafford, playing both on the wing and at wing back . Personality-wise, Young is also a good fit for Van Gaal. He is known as one of the most down-to-earth players at the club and in 2013 responded to an appeal on behalf of a terminally ill United fan to fulfil his wish of seeing his beloved Reds for the final time by handing over his box at Old Trafford. Such gestures are not lost on Van Gaal, who regularly encourages his men to engage with fans. Meanwhile, Jonny Evans is considering entering a not guilty plea after the FA charged him with spitting at Newcastle's Papiss Cisse, who has already accepted the same charge. The Northern Ireland man maintains that he spat at the floor, not at Cisse, and the club are set to give him their backing. He has until 6pm to respond to the charge. Young prepares to fire in a shot against Sunderland last weekend as United chased a top four place .","Manager Louis van Gaal says Ashley Young 'fits good in my profile'

"Roman Zozulya's first-half strike edged Dnipro to a crucial win against Dutch champions Ajax at the Kiev Olympic Stadium. Having squandered a series of early chances the hosts took the lead on the half hour mark when Zozulya collected Yevhen Konoplyanka’s cut back to send a left-footed strike across Jasper Cillessen and into the net. Dnipro, playing in their first ever last 16 tie in the Europa League, kept Frank De Boer’s side relatively quiet and head to Amsterdam next week in a promising position.

However in first-half stoppage time Joel Veltman spurned a glorious chance to level the contest when standing all alone at the back post, but the centre-back blasted a volley way over the bar from a few yards out.

Hayne could play at full back or centre in rugby league and is expected to be a running back for the 49ers . 'There is no community football for that high-level of athlete. Rugby league is the perfect sport for him and we now have Jarryd as a first-hand role model.' Illfield has invited Hayne to be a guest of honour at the USARL fixtures in their 14-club competition over the summer, adding: 'We are looking at every source for increasing performance outcomes for the USA national team leading up to the 2017 Rugby League World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.'","Jarryd Hayne quit the NRL in October to try and get into American Football .

"England's Matt Ford will take a narrow lead into the third day of the Africa Open after carding a second-round 66 at East London Golf Club.

That left the 36-year-old 11 under par and one ahead of Spain's Eduardo de la Riva, who also returned a 66 containing eight birdies and two bogeys. England's Matt Ford will take a narrow lead into the third day of the Africa Open at the East London Golf Club . Ford tees off on the eighth hole during the second round of the Africa Open at East London Golf Club . Ford, who was about to spend a winter working for Royal Mail before coming through November's European Tour qualifying school at the 10th attempt, said: 'I don't think you can ever get all of it out of the round. 'I missed a short one on 17 and hit a poor tee shot off nine, so those were a couple of mistakes, but you're always going to make a few of those. I would have taken 11 under at the beginning of the day. 'I missed a couple of putts but I holed a couple and I holed a wedge (from 119 yards for his eagle on the par-four 12th) so I played some good stuff. I've been hitting it pettty steady all year and the way the golf course is suits me; you are not hitting full out shots, you are hitting quite a lot of half shots. I've had good control of the ball so far this week.' Andy Sullivan missed the cut after a disappointing 77 in the Africa Open left him five over par . Both of De la Riva's bogeys came in his first three holes, but the world number 369 responded with a flurry of birdies to keep Ford well within in his sights. 'I played a very good round today with good golf and good putts. I am very happy with the first two rounds,' he said. South Africa have provided all five previous winners of this event and four home players were inside the top seven on the leaderboard, with Jaco van Zyl and Erik Van Rooyen three off the lead on eight under alongside France's Gregory Havret. Newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke carded six birdies and two bogeys in a 68 . Van Zyl, who finished joint second the Joburg Open on Sunday, also shot 66 and said: 'Yesterday was really tough out there and I was very chuffed to pull two under out of it. I got it a lot easier this morning and when that happens you try to capitalise.' Van Zyl's compatriots Neil Schietekat and Trevor Fisher were one shot further back along with English pair David Howell and John Parry, Chile's Mark Tullo and Germany's Max Kieffer, whose 63 was the lowest score of the day. Ireland's Kevin Phelan, who shared the overnight lead with Ford, could only add a 72 to his opening 67 to remain five under, one ahead of newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke, who carded six birdies and two bogeys in a 68.

"So now we know. Not only can Rory McIlroy play golf better than anyone else, he can throw clubs further than anyone else as well. With perhaps the most extraordinary act of frustration we’ve seen on a golf course in recent years, the Northern Irishman left no-one in any doubt as to what he thinks about his current erratic form. After a wild three iron plunged into the water at the par five 8th on Friday, the world No 1 hurled his club 60 or 70 yards into the adjacent hazard. World No 1 Rory McIlroy threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on Friday . McIlroy swings and releases his club after finding the water during the WGC-Cadillac Championship . The Northern Irishman watches as his club soars into the air and towards the lake . The 25-year-old's club makes a splash as it lands in the water on Friday afternoon . Maybe when he’s finished breaking golfing records he will take up the javelin. Of course it was conduct terribly unbecoming and will lead to an inevitable fine. But the vast majority of golfers will have recognised what was going on. ‘It was just heat of the moment stuff and not one of my proudest moments,’ admitted McIlroy. ‘I’ve never done anything like that before. I probably wouldn’t have done it here but I knew I didn’t need a three iron for the rest of my round. So I thought: ""Yeah, why not?”’ His playing partner knew exactly what was going on. Henrik Stenson is a prince off the golf course but on it the Swede has broken more than his fair share of clubs in anger. ‘It was an impressive release from Rory,’ he said, smiling. ‘You know, for a small guy he’s got a strong throw and he had good speed on that one.’ Worried perhaps that one or two of the American press might not get the joke, he added: ’Be nice to him. He’s a good guy.’ For those who would rather bounce up and down with righteous indignation, here’s what the great American amateur Bobby Jones said almost 100 years ago: ‘There are some emotions that simply cannot be endured with a golf club in your hands.’ The game might be unrecognisable from Jones’s day but in that regard it remains the same. Of more concern for McIlroy followers is what it says about his current state of mind. Under Plan A, he’s only got six more competitive rounds at most to play before the Masters, when he will be trying to complete the career grand slam. Clearly, his game is not where he wants it to be but at least he’s not lost his sense of humour. McIlroy takes his tee shot on the seventh hole of the second round in Florida . McIlroy missed the cut in the Honda Classic last week and struggled to an opening 73 at Doral . Asked what will he do for a three iron on Saturday, he replied: ‘There’s one on the way, but I’m not sure if it’s courtesy of Nike or a scuba diving team.’ The curious thing was he seemed to play better with 13 clubs than 14. This was McEnroe-esque rather than McIlroy. With the frustration no longer pent-up, he made a birdie with his second ball at the 8th, before birdieing the 10th and 12th holes. Another birdie at the 17th meant he finished with a 70 and, on one under for the event, stands on the fringes of the top ten. ‘What’s annoying me is there’s no sign on the range of the sort of shot I hit on the 8th,’ he said. ‘So it’s a little bit of a mental thing and a bit physical and something I need to work on.’ McIlroy is eight shots off the lead held by American JB Holmes, who double-bogeyed his last hole to give everyone a break. He is now just two shots ahead of fellow American Ryan Moore, with Adam Scott lurking in third place, a further shot behind. Then come Stenson and Masters champion Bubba Watson at five adrift. Scott is not only playing his first competitive round for three months, he is also using a short putter in competition for the first time in four years. You could say it is working. So far he has had 30 putts inside 12ft….and holed 28 of them. Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up in this event last year, is seven behind after a 72. Alongside McIlroy on one under is Lee Westwood, who is playing in his 50th WGC – the first man to reach that milestone since the four events to enjoy such status were conceived in 1999.","Rory McIlroy competing in Cadillac Championship at Trump National Doral .

"Andy Murray would ideally prefer to play Davis Cup quarter-final opponents France on grass - but he recognises the need for a strong atmosphere after an emotional victory over the United States. Proud Scotsman Murray admitted playing in front of a capacity 7,500 crowd at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow was among his best experiences in tennis after his straight-sets win over John Isner helped Great Britain into an unassailable 3-1 lead. The reward for the thrilling World Group first-round victory is a last-eight home tie with France on July 17-19, at the end of the grass-court season.

'It's a surface I really like, it's a good surface for Dom (Inglot) as well with his serve,' the 2013 Wimbledon champion said. 'I wouldn't say the French players love the grass outside of (Jo-Wilfried) Tsonga. He would be their best player on the grass. I don't think (Gael) Monfils is as comfortable on that surface, (Gilles) Simon I don't think is that comfortable on it. (Richard) Gasquet I think can play well but I don't think he has played amazing in Davis Cup in the past. Smith embraces Murray after the Scot's straight sets win secured GB's quarter-final berth . Murray is the centre of attention after securing a tie against France . 'Grass might be a good surface but we will have to see because playing in front of a crowd like this makes a difference and it helps. If we can't guarantee that at a grass venue then maybe it makes sense to play it at a venue where we can get that. 'Having the crowd with you makes a big difference. For some reason people think in tennis that playing in front of a home crowd is crippling in a way and makes people incredibly nervous. 'It can make you nervous but if you look at the Olympics, London was our best Olympics ever and there was a reason for that. The crowd makes a big difference. 'I don't have an ideal venue. It's not up to me.

"The Chinese are certainly doing things by the book when it comes to their bid for world football domination. The most populous nation on the planet is in the process of producing a series of textbooks for children aimed at teaching them how to play the beautiful game. Football-mad president Xi Jinping has already made the sport a compulsory part of the national curriculum for schoolchildren, with the aim of turning his country into a football powerhouse. Xi Jinping kicks a football during a 2012 visit to Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland, when he was China's vice president. The football-mad leader wants to make set his country on the road to being world champions . Thirty football 'experts' are involved in the drafting of the books, including 'football education specialists' Young players, teachers and coaches will be able to access online football tutorials linked to the books . 'We paid particular attention on gender ratio when we did the 3D pictures for the textbooks because we didn't want to let male players dominate the books', says the man in charge of their creation Chen Keqi . Xi Jinping has been a football fan since he played for his school team and is said to be very keen to see his country climb the world rankings . And now China's young players will hopefully have everything they need to become future World Cup winners thanks to the new tools at their disposal. According to the Chinese People's Daily, the first series of football textbooks for students in primary and secondary school will be completed at the end of this month by the People's Education Press (PEP). Chen Keqi, director of the Sports Office at the PEP, says 30 football 'experts' are involved in the drafting of the books, including 'football education specialists' and primary and secondary school PE teachers. The texts feature tips on individual skills such as ball striking, dribbling and passing, but also place great stress on teamwork in order to 'cultivate students' will and character'. Mr Keqi said, 'Given the nature of this sport, the textbooks will highlight students' awareness of teamwork and cooperation. It is hoped the 3D young footballers will encourage China's budding players to become world beaters . Pupils will be taught basic skills including 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps . 'It will aim to cultivate their hard-working and optimistic spirit. All that reflects the educational value of football. 'We aim to improve students’ overall ability and make them well-developed both in mind and body. 'Students’ awareness of duty and responsibility can be raised in this process of learning.' 'Any type of education must take building people’s characters and passing knowledge on to students into account, and PE education is no exception.' There are seven volumes of textbooks, four of which will be for primary, middle school and first year high school students, while the remaining three are teaching guides for primary and secondary school coaches. Pupils from primary grades 3-4 will be taught basic skills including 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps, while students from secondary grades 5-6 will be learning some more 'complex' skills such as keeping a ball in the air using different parts of their feet. The books feature 3D pictures to help teach positional play and develop 'attacking strategy'. China's men's team. For a country of 1.37billion people their ranking of 82 does not sit well with Chinese fans . China's men take on Uruguay at the Wuhan Sports Center Stadium in October 2010. President Xi wants the country to qualify for a World Cup again, like they did in 2002, and eventually win the competition . They also have green QR codes which readers can scan with their mobile phones to access online football tutorial videos. Mr Keqi said: '3D technology brought football skills to life and graphics can be easily understood by students. 'We paid particular attention on gender ratio when we did the 3D pictures for the textbooks because we didn't want to let male players dominate the books. 'In addition to publishing paper textbooks, we will introduce CD and online video tutorials to help teachers learn more about the sport. 'We will organise some training if possible to ensure teachers are best able to use the set of textbooks.' Prince William meets Mr Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing earlier this month. The Aston Villa fan mentioned the Chinese president's love of football during their talk . Mr Xi is a massive fan of the beautiful game and he and many of his 1.37billion countryman are said to be ashamed at the lowly number 82 ranking of the Chinese men's national team. He dreams his country will again qualify for a World Cup – they last did so in 2002 but went out after failing to score – will have the opportunity to host the tournament and, most optimistically, will one day win it. At least China's women's team has a much better chance of doing that any time soon as they are currently ranked a much more respectable 13th in the world. On his recent visit to China Prince William bonded with Mr Xi over their mutual love of the round ball game. William, who is an Aston Villa fan, told the president: 'I also gather you're quite a football fan. I'm looking forward to learning about China's football'.","Xi Jinping wants to make country of 1.37billion into a football powerhouse .

"Glasgow could yet host Britain’s glamour Davis Cup quarter-final with France in July – if Team GB opt to put atmosphere ahead of a desire to play on grass. Andy Murray led the home team to victory over USA in front of 7,500 passionate fans at the Emirates Arena on Sunday and, with all three days sold out in a matter of minutes, there is an obvious desire to see Scotland’s greatest active sportsman in action again. Murray himself expressed a preference for facing the French on grass – but said: ‘I think grass might be a good surface, but we’ll have to see, because playing in front of a crowd like this also makes a difference and it helps.

If it’s indoor hard, why not here – or somewhere near here? Something like this, it definitely worked in Scotland.

"Fast bowler James Anderson has warned all of England's World Cup flops will face battles to salvage their limited-overs careers. England boss Peter Moores has faced the brunt of the criticism and Anderson recognises his former Lancashire coach is under close scrutiny, after defeat to Bangladesh on Monday ended hopes of reaching the quarter-finals.

'I want to carry on,' he said in his column for the newspaper. 'I came into the World Cup as the number four-ranked one-day bowler in the world so my form in the last couple of years has been good.'

England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton has promised there will be no knee-jerk reaction to the team's failure, which may mean Moores is safe in his job for the medium term.

"West Brom's Chris Brunt has requested a personal hearing after being charged by the Football Association for allegedly verbally abusing a match official. The midfielder is alleged to have used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour in the tunnel after Saturday's 2-0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat to Aston Villa. Referee Anthony Taylor sent off Albion's Claudio Yacob and Villa's Jack Grealish during the game, which saw Villa progress through to the semi-finals where they will play Blackburn or Liverpool. Chris Brunt (right), pictured disputing a decision with Anthony Taylor, has been hit with an FA charge . Aston Villa fans celebrated by racing on to the pitch following their 2-0 victory over West Brom at Villa Park . Baggies boss Tony Pulis steered well clear of getting involved at Thursday's press conference ahead of their game against Stoke. 'That's with Richard (Garlick, director of football administration) and the powers that be,' he said. 'That's in the if, buts and maybes for Saturday. 'We don't know if he'll be charged or if he's banned. We're not sure yet, they're still talking.'

West Brom are working with police after footage emerged of supporters appearing to let off fire extinguishers . West Brom supporters threw seats into sections of the Villa fans during the second half with Pulis insisting the day after the match that anyone found guilty should be banned for life. Pulis remained detached from all disciplinary issues on Thursday, ranging from Brunt's case to the crowd trouble and whether his winger Callum McManaman was struck in the tunnel after the game. 'That's ongoing and it's something I'm not involved in,' he said about the disturbing scenes. 'That's down to the powers-that-be who are above me. It's up to them to sort that out and we'll see where that takes us. But at the moment I don't think there's any comment from ourselves or the FA.'

Tony Pulis has called for supporters to behave themselves, or be punished properly . Pulis did, however, reiterate the need for common sense from supporters. 'You want derbies to be passionate and committed but there are certain levels, certain rules, that we should all stay and work within,' he said. 'If people have broken those rules then they should be punished and punished properly, because you can't have a situation like we've had 20 or 30 years back where it's just chaos. We've moved on as a country from that and we have to make sure we don't allow it to come back in.' As for possible lifetime bans for supporters, Pulis said: 'That's down to the club.'","Brunt faces a charge of using insulting words in the tunnel after West Brom's defeat to Aston Villa in the FA Cup .

"Robbie Henshaw believes Ireland's fledgling centre partnership faces its toughest RBS Six Nations test yet in Wales on Saturday against Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies. Connacht battering ram Henshaw has rubbished the suggestions that Warren Gatland's Wales are past their peak that surfaced after the 21-16 home defeat to England. Ireland's 21-year-old midfield sensation will pair up with Jared Payne in the centres for just the fifth time in Test action at the Millennium Stadium. Ireland's newest sensation Robbie Henshaw (left) believes Wales will give him the toughest test of his career . Roberts and Davies will combine from the start for the 38th time on Saturday, at the heart of an unchanged line-up following victory over France in Paris. 'I think it could definitely be the toughest test for me and Jared,' said Henshaw of the challenge against Roberts and Davies. 'Wales are very direct but also they run decoy lines with Roberts coming up, only to throw it out the back and go wide. The centre scored a crucial try during their victory of Six Nations rivals England at the Aviva Stadium . 'It's going to test us big-time, so we've got to be prepared and stay connected in defence, and just keep our communication up all day.' Racing Metro centre Roberts will win his 68th Test cap for Wales this weekend while Clermont's Davies will make it 47 in Cardiff's pivotal Six Nations clash. Ireland can remain on course for a second Grand Slam in seven years with victory on Saturday, with a trip to Scotland still ahead. Jared Payne (left) celebrates with the scorer as Ireland look in pole position to win the Six Nations . Ruthless boss Joe Schmidt this week omitted veteran centre Gordon D'Arcy from his 36-man training squad for the remaining two Six Nations contests. D'Arcy and Brian O'Driscoll set a world record 55-Test centre partnership in their wide-ranging careers. Henshaw has long been touted as the now-retired O'Driscoll's natural successor at outside centre, but has instead found himself replacing D'Arcy at 12. The Athlone native is gearing up for just his ninth cap in Cardiff, with New Zealand-born Payne in line for his fifth Test bow. The new Irish sensation is being touted as the player to replace legend Brian O'Driscoll (centre) So from boasting the world's most experienced centre pairing en route to last year's Six Nations title, Ireland will concede 101 caps to their midfield rivals against Wales this weekend. Henshaw has vowed he and Payne 'won't hold back' however, buoyed by his first Test try that clinched Ireland's 19-9 victory over England on March 1. 'This Wales team is absolutely not past its peak,' said Henshaw. 'The fact that they are at home and that they play their best rugby at the Millennium, they're going to cause a massive threat for us. 'So we're going to have to be squeaky clean on the day in terms of our discipline and we're going to have to take all the chances we get. Henshaw knows he's in for a tough afternoon when he comes up against the experienced Jamie Roberts . Wales centre Jonathan Davies (centre) has formed an impressive partnership with Roberts over the years . 'It might be more open than the England game, but we want to stick to our game plan and follow through on what the coaches want from us. 'It's not going to be more than a two-score game though. 'They are not predictable either: they have a lot of different options available to them with Dan Biggar at 10. 'He gives them a good attacking threat and good aerial skills in the team. 'We're just going to have to be prepared for anything. 'I think the Welsh centre partnership is up there with one of the best in the world. Jonny Sexton (left) is Ireland's danger man with some labeling him as the best fly half in the world . 'They have a really physical threat and massive size in that 10, 12 channel from Jamie Roberts, and then a very good ball player and direct runner in Jonathan Davies. 'They are going to test us big-time this week but we are fully prepared for what they are going to throw at us.

Head coach Joe Schmidt (centre) is closing in on winning the Grand Slam with Ireland once again . 'I'm constantly learning, growing into it more and more, getting a bit more confident with every game, especially with Jared outside and Johnny (Sexton) inside.

"Jordan Rhodes shrugged off the fierce speculation over his future by snatching an injury-time winner for Blackburn at Ewood Park. This derby was drifting towards a goalless draw when Tom Cairney sent over a corner with 15 seconds remaining of the four added minutes. Doneil Henry flicked on and Rhodes stuck out a boot to score his 14th goal of the season from close range.

Middlesbrough have offered to take Rhodes to the Riverside on loan for the rest of the season with a view to signing him permanently for a fee of £8million, potentially rising to £10m. Their Championship promotion rivals Derby, Norwich, Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest have also registered an interest in Blackburn’s record £8m signing who still has four-and-a-half years left on his contract at Ewood. But having rejected a £12m offer from Hull City last summer, Blackburn’s owners Venky’s are reluctant to sell while their club still have an outside chance of reaching the playoffs following this win, as well as the prospect of a FA Cup quarter-final replay with Liverpool next month. Asked if he has been given assurances that Rhodes will not be sold, manager Gary Bowyer replied: ‘Yes, it just wouldn’t add up. Why would you loan out your top goalscorer? My five-year-old nephew might be able to work that one out. ‘I can’t answer on behalf of Middlesbrough but Jordan has just scored the winner and he will be starting at Charlton on Saturday. ‘He just handles the speculation enormously well. I was quietly confident of him scoring tonight, to be perfectly honest, because that’s what he does when there’s all the talk.’ Bowyer described this as Blackburn’s best win of the season after the physical and mental energy his players exerted in Sunday’s goalless draw with Liverpool at Anfield. They lost Corry Evans and Markus Olsson to injury in the first-half but Ben Marshall should have put them ahead in stoppage time when he headed over from Craig Conway’s cross. Substitute Craig Davies wasted Bolton’s best chance when he raced clear only to shoot straight at Jason Steele, and Rhodes should have scored with a 79th -minute header from close-range before making amends at the death. Conceding another yet another late goal was a sickener for Bolton who are still not free of relegation danger.

Goalscorer Fabian Delph, who was surrounded at the final whistle, said: ‘That was very, very scary. ‘My armband got nicked, someone got my left boot, but I could appreciate the relief the fans are feeling after a result like that. It was dangerous. Someone tried to take my boot off. People tried to kiss me and were biting me. It was scary.’ Hundreds of fans had spilled on to the pitch from the Holte End minutes before the final whistle — forcing their way past meagre numbers of stewards — prompting Villa players to appeal for them to return to the stands. Those who remained in their seats booed loudly, chanting ‘*******’. The West Brom goalkeeper attempts to make his way off the field following the full-time whistle . West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill is mocked by an Aston Villa fan following the home side's second goal . Leicester coach Kevin Phillips slammed the disturbances, calling for the Football Association to punish his former club. Phillips, who played for both Villa and West Brom, said: ‘I can see West Brom players still on the pitch which for me is very dangerous. For me this has been very badly policed. Why are there still away players on there? They should be punished for it. ‘These people on the pitch are not true supporters, the true fans are the ones who are booing to get them off.’ Former Liverpool star and TV pundit Mark Lawrenson added: ‘It’s like a scene from the 1980s all over again. Absolutely ridiculous.’ Albion winger Callum McManaman was visibly shaken and Myhill reacted angrily at fans trying to film him by snatching one phone and flinging it to the ground. It took stewards more than 20 minutes to march the fans off. West Brom fans also ripped out several seats and confronted Villa fans when Scott Sinclair scored a second.

"Europa League broadcasters ITV have pulled off a coup by persuading the injured Everton and England defender Leighton Baines to be part of their panel for tonight's important tie between Roberto Martinez's men and Dynamo Kiev at Goodison Park. Baines has been ruled out the first leg because of a knock to his quad muscle and will join 1980s Everton legend Peter Reid for the live television coverage to see if his side can salvage some respect for the Premier League after a dismal European campaign for our leading clubs. Leighton Baines takes a free-kick for Everton against Swansea City earlier in the season . Manager Roberto Martinez oversees Everton training at Finch Farm on Wednesday . Everton may be the only English club who will end up qualifying for the quarter-finals of either European competition. Chelsea crashed out of the Champions League against Paris St Germain on Wednesday while both Arsenal and Manchester City have to overturn first-leg deficits when they travel to Monaco and Barcelona next week. Roberto Martinez's side are the only English survivors in the Europa League following exits for Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur in the last round and ITV have chosen to show the match from Goodison on their main channel ITV1 rather than ITV4 where most Europa games are screened. Clive Tyldesley and Andy Townsend will commentate with presenter Mark Pougatch – who recently replaced Adrian Chiles – joined by Baines and Reid. Baines, 30, rarely does interviews but is known to hold thoughtful and incisive views on football. A huge music fan, he disembarked from the plane that brought back England's players from last summer's World Cup clutching a guitar he had taken with him to South America.

The left-back, who was wanted by Manchester United at the start of last season before he signed a new contract with Everton, has only played once since the end of January because of injury and received a knock to the quad muscle on his leg last month. He has returned to training though and may make his return in Sunday's Premier League game against Newcastle United. Everton have so far saved their most impressive performances for Europe and qualified for the knockout stages from a difficult group that included Wolfsburg, Lille and Krasnodar.

"Everton are flying the flag for England in the Europa League and take on Dynamo Kiev in the first leg of their round of 16 clash at Goodison Park on Thursday night. Blues fans and perhaps even Roberto Martinez may have been happy to avoid giants such as Roma and Inter Milan, but face a Ukranian side who are unbeaten in their domestic league. The Premier League strugglers may be the last British team left in Europe after next week's Champions League fixtures. So, do we know enough about their opponents? Everton manager Roberto Martinez faces a tough challenge when Dynamo Kiev visit Goodison Park . Star players . Andriy Yarmolenko . Kiev's captain had a three-game ban reduced after an appeal so he can play in Thursday night's game, and his presence could be crucial for the visitors. A creative winger, Yarmolenko loves cutting in from the right-hand side onto his favoured left foot and has impressed for Ukraine against England over the years. Martinez said: 'It is a blow from our point of view because Yarmolenko is one of their best performers.' Andriy Yarmolenko (left) has had his ban reduced and will be aiming to fire the Ukrainian side to victory . Aleksandar Dragovic . Linked with Arsenal and Tottenham, the defender is seen as a rising prospect of the game but is already a key player for Kiev. Their manager Sergei Rebrov confirmed as much. 'You are asking about one of the best players in my team and I don't want to lose this player. 'He is a top-class player and I hope he will stay with us.' Aleksandar Dragovic (right) is seen as a rising prospect in world football as a defender . Miguel Veloso . A mainstay in a talented Portugal team, it was somewhat of a surprise when this central midfielder opted for a move to Ukraine when leaving Genoa last year. Veloso has played at Goodison Park before, and will be hoping to prove his 52 international class convert to class on the field, too. Miguel Veloso has been capped 52 times by Portugal and is a classy player in midfield . The manager . Sergei Rebrov should know all about Everton having played in the Premier League for five years with West Ham and most notably Tottenham. The striker cost Spurs around £11million in 2000 but only scored 10 goals in 60 games... he will be hoping for better luck on English soil on this occasion. The 40-year-old won the Ukranian Cup early on, and now looks to be on his way to more success this season. He said in his pre-match conference: 'Any success for Dynamo is success for the whole of Ukraine. I hope people from outside can see that life is continuing here.' Former Tottenham flop Sergei Rebrov has impressed in his first stint as manager with Kiev . Form . Thirteen wins from 16 games helping them establish a seven-point advantage over Shakhtar Donetsk in the league is one thing, but Kiev have brought that style to the Europa League, too. The Ukrainian giants stormed through their group and beat Guingamp 4-3 on aggregate in their round of 32 fixture, despite going down to nine men in the first leg.","Everton play Dynamo Kiev in Europa League round of 16 first leg .

"Veteran striker Miroslav Klose helped himself to two goals as Lazio crushed Fiorentina 4-0 in Serie A on Monday, a result that boosted their chances of reaching next season's Champions League. Lucas Biglia set Lazio on their way and an Antonio Candreva penalty put them in complete control as they went joint third with Napoli on 46 points. Fiorentina, whose Champions League hopes took a hefty blow as they dropped four points behind their opponents in joint fifth, were unrecognisable from the team that won 2-1 at Juventus in the Italian Cup on Thursday.

"Numerous coffees have been shared between Jamie Roberts and Johnny Sexton in the cafes of Paris but all cordialities will be pushed aside when Wales take on Ireland this weekend. Roberts describes Sexton, the Ireland No 10 and his Racing Metro team-mate, as an ‘angry man’ who has become one of the world’s finest players under the tutorship of Ronan O’Gara. Wales will be keeping close tabs on the fly-half on Saturday and Roberts is planning to use his inside knowledge to minimise the 29-year-old’s impact at the Millennium Stadium. Racing Metro's Jamie Roberts is adamant Wales can nullify the threat of club team-mate Johnny Sexton . ‘We are good mates in Paris and he’s a guy who demands high standards,’ said Roberts. ‘He’s an angry man. The first time I played with him — I remember it well — was on the Lions tour and he was shouting his head off at me and barking orders. It took me by surprise a bit. ‘He’s a bloody good player and a very clever thinker about the game. He’s got Ronan O’Gara as his mentor in Paris who is passing on a lot of information and helping him develop into a wonderful player. ‘He is the commander-in-chief of the Ireland team and a guy we need to stay one step ahead of.’ Ireland's Johnny Sexton has won his battle to be fit to face Wales in the RBS Six Nations on Saturday . Few have attracted such far-flung praise during this year’s RBS Six Nations as Sexton, who has overcome a hamstring injury and is expected to be named in Ireland’s starting XV at today’s team announcement. The Leinsterman has an all-round repertoire but his kicking has been particularly important within the gameplan of Ireland coach Joe Schmidt. Off the back of a dominant breakdown, Sexton was able to pin back England last week with his accurate footballing skills. It was aperfectly executed strategy and an afternoon that enhanced Schmidt’s reputation as one of the game’s most thorough tacticians. Ireland often rely on their choke-tackle routine in defence but the Kiwi coach neglected it against England to avoid scrummaging against a powerful pack. It could return on Saturday and Roberts is prepared for more tactical twists in Cardiff. Sexton was in fine form to inspire Ireland to a 19-9 win over England in Dublin last time out . ‘They are happy to put bombs up in our 22 if they have to,’ said Roberts. ‘They always come up with a trick or two, so we have to be prepared for that. You’ve seen them have a two- or three-phase set play where they bring their full back near a ruck after phase three or something like that. ‘There is usually a trick in there. Joe Schmidt is a clever coach; he is a guy who obviously thinks about the game a lot.’ Throughout the week, Warren Gatland and his Wales coaching staff have emphasised the importance of playing their own game. That means providing front-foot ball for strike-runners, rather than being kicked into submission by a disciplined Irish set-up. With Sexton’s accuracy from the kicking tee, Gatland must also ensure his players keep their penalty count to a minimum, having seen his side concede 37 in the opening rounds. ‘It’s who blinks first but it’s also who dares wins,’ said Roberts. ‘These big games are like chess and you try to work each other out in the opening exchanges. They are very clever defensively. They pick and choose their rucks. We have got to be very clever in that respect. Wales coach Warren Gatland, at training on Wednesday, is adamant his side must play their own game . ‘The contact area is more important than it ever has been and so is the referee’s interpretation. You watch Ireland’s games against France and England and both sides have given them easy outs from their half with cheap penalties, which gave them a strong foothold in opposition territory.’ Wales are not underestimating their opponents and there have been no verbal barbs from Gatland. He is hoping to reverse a worrying trend in Cardiff, where the Irish have lost only twice in 32 years, with retired back-row Alan Quinlan yesterday writing in his column that ‘Wales don’t scare us like France and England’. ‘That Celtic love and hate is quite evident,’ said Roberts. ‘There is always that edge to it. Looking back on a personal note there have been more lows than highs against them and that’s something I am quite keen to rectify. ‘I’ll never forget watching Ireland win the Grand Slam in our stadium in 2009. That is one of those moments that motivates you I suppose. It’s something you never want to happen again.’","Ireland are still on course for a Six Nations Grand Slam .

"Dodging Bullets clinched glory in the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham for trainer Paul Nicholls. Winner of the Tingle Creek at Sandown and the Clarence House Chase at Ascot already this season, the seven-year-old was third in the betting at 9-2 for the two-mile championship behind former winners Sprinter Sacre and Sire De Grugy. Dodging Bullets travelled with zest throughout in the hands of Sam Twiston-Davies and loomed up ominously running down the hill. Dodging Bullets (front) delivered a second winner of day two for jockey Sam Twiston-Davies . The front-running Special Tiara and big outsider Somersby made him work for it, but the Nicholls runner - who was bred by Frankie Dettori - found plenty after the final fence to clinch victory. Somersby ran a tremendous race to fill the runner-up spot, beaten a length and a quarter. Defending champion Sire De Grugy was under the pump a long way from home, while Sprinter Sacre, so brilliant in this race two years ago, did not jump well and appeared a shadow of his former self after stopping quickly from the home turn and being pulled up. Twiston-Davies and Dodging Bullets successfully clear a fence on their way to victory . Twiston-Davies laps up the applause as he is led in after winning the Queen Mother Champion Chase . Twiston-Davies said: 'What a horse, Harry Derham and the team have done a great job - Harry rides him all the time wouldn't let Frankie Dettori ride him at home when he came down the other day, which says a lot. 'I need to get my breath back, I'm shaking a bit! 'I missed two out a bit, I was almost going too well.' Nicholls said: 'That was absolutely awesome. 'It's good for the owners and good for the team. 'The progress he's made has been absolutely phenomonal. 'He's got better and better.' Dodging Bullets returned at 9-2 after landing the Queen Mother Champion Chase . Twiston-Davies celebrates with the Queen Mother Champion Chase trophy . Dettori said: 'Sam gave him a fantastic ride. He jumped like a stag. 'He was meant to win a Derby but this is second best. 'My legs were shaking a little bit. What a horse.' Nicholls went on: 'He should have been favourite on form. 'I couldn't see why the other two (Sprinter Sacre and Sire De Grugy) were ahead of him in the market. 'Progressive horses usually come out on top. 'We know where we are going with him now. He's such a special horse.' Winning owner Martin Broughton said: 'The anticipation is almost too much, and when you get to the race itself, you just want them to come back safe. 'All the way round I got more and more confident. It was all going exactly to plan. 'This is fantastic. I'm absolutely ecstatic. 'It's all been Sprinter versus Sire. I'm happy under the radar.' It was all smiles for the connections of Dodging Bullets . Nicky Henderson said Sprinter Sacre will be given a thorough check-up before he can consider any notion of retirement for the former champion chaser. Henderson said: 'His heart is OK, which is the main thing. 'He'll be scoped and then we'll know a lot more after that. 'Barry said he was a bit noisy going up the back and it sounds like it's something internal. 'We'll scope him now. There was a trace of blood after Ascot, so you would have to be suspicious in that department. 'Once we've done the tests we'll let everyone know. 'We've only just unsaddled and are trying to gather our thoughts. 'I don't think we can make any predictions today as to the future. 'If there's a switch we can find that gets rids of what is affecting him today, who knows.' Frankie Dettori (second right) couldn't hide his excitement after Dodging Bullets' victory . Mick Channon, trainer of Festival veteran Somersby, said: 'He's been in great form, it was only really the race at Ascot (Clarence House) where he disappointed. He has run pound for pound to his Tingle Creek form and run his race - I'm delighted for everybody.' Trainer Gary Moore felt a brisk surface counted against fourth-placed Sire De Grugy. 'The ground wasn't soft enough for him,' said the West Sussex handler. 'He showed at Chepstow how good he was when it's deep, but on ground like this, he wants two and a half miles these days.' Henry de Bromhead was thrilled with the effort of Special Tiara. He said 'I'm delighted with that run, Noel (Fehily) gave him a super ride. He got him filled up coming round home turn and coming to the second-last he thought he might win, but then he just petered out. 'To be fair he is better on a flatter track, but he has run a blinder and we are delighted. 'He's a good ground horse and we will look at Sandown or Punchestown, whichever one Dodging Bullets doesn't go for.' De Bromhead also saddled former winner Sizing Europe, who was seventh, beating home Mr Mole. He said: 'Johnny (Burke) didn't knock him around when he knew he was beaten. I have thought about retiring him, but I'm not going to make any decisions until I have spoken to the owners. 'The fact he has come back so many times just shows how he has stood the test of time.'","Dodging Bullets wins race on Ladies Day at Cheltenham 2015 .

"Manchester United outcast Nani headed home the winner as Sporting Lisbon beat Penafiel 3-2 in the Portuguese league on Monday night. The Portugal winger, who is on a season-long loan at his first club, took his Sporting goal tally to eight in 23 appearances since returning from Old Trafford. The result kept them third in the Primeira Liga and on course for Champions League qualification, though their chances of bridging the 12-point gap to leaders Benfica are slim. Nani celebrates his headed winning goal as Sporting Lisbon beat Penafiel 3-2 on Monday night . They were made to work hard by bottom-of-the-table Penafiel, who fought back from two goals down to draw level after Sporting centre-half Tobias Figueiredo was sent off. Having come into the match off the back of a 3-0 loss to Porto, Sporting needed a positive start and goals from William and Islam Slimani had them two the good inside eight minutes. But Figueiredo's red card gave the visitors hope and they replied through veteran midfielder Bruno Braga in the 12th minute. The Manchester United loanee celebrated his 70th-minute winner with a trademark flip . And they levelled three minutes shy of half-time through Vitor Bruno. However, Sporting were still too strong and Nani's winner - a firm header from 12 yards following a right-wing cross - proved decisive. Frustrations ultimately boiled over for Penafiel, who are four points adrift at the bottom, as both Dani and Pedro Ribeiro were shown second yellow cards in the closing stages.","Nani scored 70th-minute winner as Sporting Lisbon beat Penafiel 3-2 .

"The challenges of taking a penalty in football are so well documented - a baying crowd, pressurised responsibility and psychological isolation - it's no wonder that most clubs tend to dedicate time on the training ground to how to deal with them. Austrian third division side FC Pinzgau have decided to try out a rather strange technique to practice their spot-kicks. Players were tasked with scoring from 12 yards after having spun their entire body around 20 times. Players were made to spin around 20 times before taking their shots from 12 yards . The unique penalty practice resulted in several hilarious failed attempts as players fell to the ground . The rationale behind this exercise is unclear, but one could assume that if a player can take a penalty while dizzy, then he can probably manage it in a game. Right? What followed was hilarious. Unsurprisingly, a number of Pinzgau players failed to score with their attempts and some even to make contact with the ball, instead landing bottoms up on the turf. This player doesn't even make contact with the ball before he goes crashing into the turf . After falling over twice more, he eventually manages to get his shot away and scores in the open goal . The challenges of taking a penalty are difficult enough without having to be dizzy as well .","Taking a penalty is one of the hardest things to do in football .

"Warren Gatland has compared Saturday’s tie between Wales and Ireland to a sibling rivalry but insists there is no ‘bad blood’ between the Celtic neighbours. During his early years as national coach, Gatland said his squad ‘dislike the Irish players the most’ - remarks that he later described as a ‘backhanded compliment’ - because of the competition between the Welsh regions and Irish provinces. But the Kiwi on Tuesday played down any animosity ahead of the RBS 6 Nations tie, insisting his players are no longer hung up on Leinster and Munster’s dominance in European competition. Wales captain Sam Warburton prepares to become his country's most-capped captain against Ireland . Warren Gatland says there is no longer bad blood between Celtic Six Nations rivals, more a sibling rivalry . ‘Some of our players had been used to being regularly dominated by the Irish provinces,’ said Gatland. ‘But it has been pretty even over recent years and there are no hard feelings or bad blood between the two teams, just a very strong rivalry when you know each other so well and play each other so often. ‘It’s like playing against your big brother in the back yard. You want to beat him as often as you can and Saturday will be no different. Last weekend was the first time since 2010 that all four Welsh regions won against Irish provinces. It was a big boost for us and for the players; they came in this week with a spring in their step.’ Warburton leads his side into a must win encounter that could keep their Six Nations hopes alive . Wales centre Jonathan Davies will be part of an unchanged starting XV to the one that beat France .

"Luther Burrell has revealed that England's 'Mr Angry' is intent on releasing a month's worth of pent up frustration when Scotland visit Twickenham on Saturday. Mike Brown was knocked unconscious against Italy on February 14 and was forced to sit out the defeat by Ireland after suffering a setback in the return to play protocols for concussion. Now restored to full fitness, Brown returns for England's tilt at reviving their RBS 6 Nations title challenge and Burrell will be only too pleased to hear the fiery full-back barking orders once again. Mike Brown wants to let out all his frustration when he returns to face Scotland according to Luther Burrell . 'It's always good having an angry man behind you, shouting and doing his thing. He's an exciting player,' Burrell said. 'He's constantly on us and is a good leader. He's been itching to get himself right and back out there, just to release some of his anger. Off the pitch he's just as angry. He's just always angry.' England missed the comfort blanket Brown provides at full-back as their Grand Slam quest ground to a halt in Dublin in a result that has seen Ireland reinstated as title favourites. Burrell (centre) is looking forward to having 'Mr Angry' back for their crucial Six Nations clash . Among the combinations that took a step backwards at the Aviva Stadium was the centre partnership of Burrell and Jonathan Joseph, who disappointed after encouraging outings against Wales and Italy. The centre duo were hardly alone in underperforming amid an inexplicably subdued England display, but with only five games remaining until the World Cup - three of them warm up matches for the tournament - opportunities to reassert themselves are running out. Joseph excelled against Wales and Italy, forcing Burrell to take a back seat, and the inside centre's place in the team was under threat until Brad Barritt was ruled out against Scotland by a sprained ankle. The full back has been an ever-present for Stuart Lancaster's side and his loss was a real miss for the squad . Brown (15) was knocked unconscious against Italy and didn't feature in England's defeat in Ireland . Burrell, who has shaken off a calf problem to retain his place in the starting XV, points out that he has taken a selfless approach as his understanding with Joseph grows. 'It's always nice scoring tries, but it's just as nice getting the applause from Jonathan and others for creating that space and doing the hard graft that some people might not pick up on,' he said . 'On and off the field we have a good relationship. We get on really well. We had last weekend off but we've still been speaking to each other. 'It's good to have that relationship because we have a group that has got each other's backs and look out for each other. Jonathan Joseph (left) has arguably been England's most impressive player in the tournament . 'It's important that I create that space for JJ to do his thing, which is obviously something we've seen already in this Six Nations. Given a bit of space, he can be electric in that 13 channel. 'And vice versa if I want the ball in my hands early from him, he now knows to do that. It's pretty exciting. 'We've worked hard on it in training and while we're still building in these early stages, we're happy with how each other's roles are.' England's final training session on Wednesday afternoon in preparation for the penultimate round of the Six Nations was full-blooded, releasing the angst that had built up after the no-show against Ireland. Stuart Lancaster took charge of a full bloodied training session at Pennyhill Park on Wednesday . Head coach Stuart Lancaster was forced to blow the whistle early, fearing the consequences as the intensity of the exchanges between the rival XVs at the squad's Pennyhill Park training camp escalated. 'With a session like that it sets us up nicely for the weekend. It's about trying to replicate that intensity of Test match rugby,' Burrell said. 'It gets a bit feisty at times which is always good and healthy because that shows people care and want the shirt.' England still have a chance of winning the Six Nations but know they can't afford to slip up .","Luther Burrell said Mike Brown is ready to release hell on Scotland .

"The Football Association is urging supporters to report sexist abuse at games after footage emerged of fans directing obscenities at Chelsea club doctor Eva Carneiro. Recordings of fans at Manchester United and Manchester City chanting and shouting abuse at Carneiro were broadcast by the BBC on Thursday night, prompting the Blues to call for an end to sexism in football. A spokesman for the Premier League leaders told the Guardian: 'The issue of equality is one we take extremely seriously and we abhor discrimination in all its forms, including sexism. Such behaviour is unacceptable and we want it eradicated from the game.' Recordings of fans at Manchester United and Manchester City were shown on BBC on Thursday night .

FA board member Heather Rabbatts described the abuse as 'horrible' and urged supporters to notify officials if they witness such behaviour, telling the BBC: 'We are absolutely encouraging people to report incidents like this.' Campaign group Women in Football is launching an anti-sexism social media drive on Friday and has also contacted all 92 Premier League and Football League clubs asking them to champion female members of staff in their matchday programmes ahead of International Women's Day on March 8. Minister for Sport Helen Grant is supporting the initiative. She said: 'It is absolutely right that we champion and celebrate women who work in the football industry and play vital roles in making the game the success that it is. 'I want more women to get involved in football across the board and to see it as a great industry to work in. Sexism, in any shape or form, should not be tolerated so I applaud this push to encourage people to report any incidents of sexist abuse and for the promotion of inclusivity across football.' The incidents come after a study by anti-discrimination group Kick It Out revealed that 13 reports of sexism in English professional and grassroots football were made in the first half of the current season (August-December 2014). Kick It Out went on to reveal that two sexism complaints were made during the 2013-14 season.

But this is the third time it has happened to the French striker and Muamba does not expect him to play again without being cleared by a number of medical experts. Speaking to the Daily Express, Muamba said: ‘I am sure he will not be allowed to play for a couple of weeks or even a couple of months. ‘I am 100 per cent sure he’ll see a specialist. He will probably see three specialists and two of them need to give him the all-clear before he can play again. ‘It’s very different to what happened to me.

"The Football Association said it was willing to investigate after a victory for England Women over Australia was followed by allegations that a group of spectators from the British Army shouted sexist abuse during the game. An Army contingent based in Cyprus attended England's 3-0 win at the low-profile Cyprus Cup tournament in Nicosia on Friday. Two female England supporters who were at the game said the troops targeted Australian defender Servet Uzunlar throughout the match, as well as the Australian team's substitutes as they took off their tracksuits before entering the field. Australian defender Servet Uzunlar was allegedly  the target of sexist abuse throughout the match in Cyprus . Rachel O'Sullivan and Sophie Downey, who cover women's football for www.girlsontheball.com, said the majority of the alleged abuse was made towards the Australian players and substitutes, whose bench was on the side of the pitch where the soldiers were sitting. Downey said: 'We've been to lots of games before and we can engage in banter, but this wasn't banter - it was constant, gender-specific abuse. 'There were around 50 troops watching the game and a group of around 10 of them were directing constant insults - they were on the side of the Australian dugout so it was more focused on their players. The FA will invesigate allegations that a group  from the British Army shouted sexist abuse during the game . 'We weren't sure whether to tweet about it because it's the Army and we didn't want to offend people - I'm a very proud English person and I'm very proud of what the Army do - but I was ashamed of them today.' O'Sullivan added: 'One Australian player, number six (Uzunlar), they were harassing her over and over and over again, throughout the game. 'They were making horrible comments, shouting at her, whistling - it was uncomfortable to hear. These are teenage girls and they were sexually objectifying them.' Spectators at the game said the abuse directed at the players was sexually objectifying and horrible . The commander in charge of the troops said he was unaware of the abuse and apologised . An MoD spokeswoman said: 'Behaviour of the kind described is totally unacceptable and is not tolerated in the Armed Forces where abuse, bullying and discrimination have no place. 'We are investigating these claims and if it is found that any UK personnel have fallen below the high standards we expect then appropriate action will be taken.' Downey and O'Sullivan said they complained to the commander in charge of the contingent at the end of the match and he apologised, saying he had not heard the abuse. The England players said that none of them had heard any of the abuse and would not make a complaint . An FA spokesperson said: 'We've spoken to the (England) players, manager and assistant manager after the game and none of them have said they heard anything during the game worthy of reporting or complaining about. 'They appreciated the British Army's support and were happy to have photographs taken with the Army boys at the end of the game.' The FA spokesperson added: 'The FA will investigate all allegations of discriminatory abuse. If anyone did experience any form of discriminatory behaviour we would urge people to report it by calling 0800 085 0508, emailing reportdiscrimination@thefa.com or downloading the Kick It Out app from the App store of Google Play.' Demba Ba is treated for a broken nose by Carneiro after being kicked in the face against Newcastle . An Australian supporter at the match, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'This was a stunning one-off that I've never heard before in women's football. 'They were calling the girls t****, telling the referee 'I'd like to blow you'. 'I said something to the Army sergeant, 'This isn't a complaint as an Australian supporter, it's a complaint as a woman'. It was beyond the pale. Blues first team doctor sits on the bench during the Chelsea's match against Aston Villa in March 2012 . 'He was apologetic after the game and offered to apologise to the players.

"Tim Sherwood says Aston Villa are ready for the home straight and wants to avoid a photo finish in the relegation battle. The boss takes his Barclays Premier League thoroughbreds to Sunderland on Saturday for a crunch clash. The Black Cats are a point and a place ahead of fourth-bottom Villa, who themselves are just three points above the drop zone. Tim Sherwood hopes the Premier League relegation battle does not end up being a photo-finish . And with the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Friday, Sherwood is hoping Villa, who have never been relegated from the Premier League, can avoid being unseated. He said: 'I think it'll be a photo finish and I hope we're not in it. 'We're probably just coming around the corner but it's probably the longest run-in in racing history. 'All we're looking at is the next fence and that's Sunderland. After that we hope we can stay in the running. There might be a few who fall along the way and we're hoping that's not us.' Villa have won their last two under Sherwood, beating West Brom twice in the league and the FA Cup to reach the semi-finals. They were the new manager's first wins since replacing Paul Lambert in February and Sherwood has been impressed with the squad's attitude. 'They've been good and a win makes an awful lot of difference. They have been focused and up for the fight,' he said. 'They haven't dwelt on the position. It's about looking forward now, what we have done previously counts for nothing.' Sherwood, before becoming head coach, was at Tottenham as assistant first-team coach under Harry Redknapp and worked with Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe at White Hart Lane. The 32-year-old returned to England in January after a year with Toronto in Major League Soccer and Sherwood believes Defoe is the Black Cats' chief threat. He said: 'If they are going to survive it's going to be Jermain Defoe who keeps them in the Premier League, that's why they forked out that sort of money for him. 'He didn't have to go, he went for a lifestyle change to Canada but he still has that appetite to come back and play for Sunderland, in a relegation battle. 'Jermain can score goals on his own but he prefers people to slide the ball across the six-yard box for him to be in the right place at the right time, that's what he's done all of his career.'","Aston Villa are battling to remain in the Premier League .

"A temporary order by a Superior Court judge is keeping a man from smoking inside his home in the District of Columbia - even though it's completely legal. WJLA-TV reports that Edwin Gray's next door neighbors in northeast Washington have filed a civil suit claiming they're being harmed by smoke that sneaks into their home through a hole in the basement. The family moved into the home next to Gray last year and have one child, and another on the way. No smoking zone: Edwin Gray has been ordered not to smoke inside his home, which his family has owned for the past 50 years . Complaints: The temporary injunction was ordered by a Superior Court judge after one of Gray's neighbors in northeast Washington, DC filed a lawsuit saying smoke was leaking into their home . A judge issued a temporary injunction last week saying neither Gray nor any family or guests may smoke in the home the family has owned for 50 years. The family has vowed to fight the order. In court filings and a statement, the neighbors say they tried to work with Gray and his sister Mozella Johnson, but that the mediation attempts failed and they decided to file the suit. 'You want me to stop what I've been doing in my house, all my life,' Gray remarked. In addition to seeking an injunction on smoking at the house, the neighbors are also asking for $500,000 in damages. The lawsuit does set a precedent for other complaints in the DC area. A columnist for the Washington Post said the Gray lawsuit could lead to hundreds of others, from neighbors hoping to control the activities of other residents. 'We were floored,' Gray's sister, Johnson, said. 'If this judge has done this, who will be next? What other neighbor will be next?'","A Superior Court judge has temporarily ordered Edwin Gray and the rest of his family to stop smoking inside their Washington, DC home .

"Bafetimbi Gomis was given a clean bill of health on Thursday after revealing his shocking mid-game collapse was caused by the stress of his father’s ill health. The Frenchman was discharged from hospital in London in the morning having fainted eight minutes into Swansea’s 3-2 defeat against Tottenham at White Hart Lane. There were distressing echoes of Fabrice Muamba’s collapse at the same ground three years ago, with Spurs’ substitute goalkeeper Brad Friedel admitting he ‘feared the worst’ as he watched the striker slump to the ground. Bafetimbi Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham . Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness . Concerned Tottenham players look on as the Swansea forward is attended to my medical staff . But hospital tests through the night have found no deeper cause for concern beyond the 29-year-old’s vasovagal condition, which the Welsh club insist they have been aware of since before they signed the player from Lyon last summer. A senior club source told Sportsmail that knowledge of at least three previous episodes involving Gomis in France meant they were ‘extra rigorous’ in testing him during his medical and cardiology exams. A source close to the player confirmed those tests took place in a specialist facility in Cardiff ahead of Gomis’s Bosman move to south Wales. The Frenchman tweeted to insist he was feeling better, claiming he fainted because of the anxiety caused by his father’s illness. He said: ‘I wanted to reassure you concerning my health. It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. Gomis, who has a history of blacking out, is taken off the field on a stretcher at White Hart Lane . Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentaleb (right) holds his head in his hands as Gomis is taken off on a stretcher . Players from both sides appear shocked as referee Michael Oliver prepares to restart the game . ‘I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father’s health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. ‘I was disappointed that I couldn’t help my team tonight (Wednesday), but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.’ The striker will not return to training until Tuesday, though the time off was agreed for the whole squad ahead of Wednesday’s incident, with Swansea not playing again until Monday week’s clash against Liverpool. He is expected to return to France imminently. Club officials were adamant on Wednesday night that Gomis has suffered no previous issues with fainting since his arrival at the Liberty Stadium, though the dressing room had been made aware of a condition that is understood to have first affected the striker when he was 14. A vasovagal syncope, which is what Bafetimbi Gomis suffered on Wednesday night, is caused by a sudden decrease in blood pressure or heart-rate, triggered by emotional or physical factors. Reduced blood flow to the brain makes a person faint. It can be prompted by extreme exertion or anxiety. On the physical side, there are numerous tests that can be done when a player has a medical and it appears Swansea knew all about Gomis’s history. They will have checked the flow through his blood vessels under exercise stress, though emotional triggers are harder to quantify. It is a rare condition for a professional sportsman and is more common in older people. It is not something I have encountered in any other footballer. Thankfully, it is not an especially dangerous condition in isolation. The risks are low beyond what happens when you fall. You could hit your head or suffer trauma damage to another part of the body on landing. Often there is a stimulus that the person will recognise and they can act, by sitting down. Most sufferers feel fine in a matter of moments. Gomis has a history of fainting and can be seen here collapsing during France national team training in 2009 . It has been reported in France that Gomis previously fainted during a friendly for Lyon against Deportivo La Coruna in August 2009, before this episode in training . Gomis is helped by French goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso after the collapse in Guincamp . The French striker is understood to have resumed playing within 10 to 15 minutes of the episode . It has been reported in France that he previously fainted during a friendly for Lyon against Deportivo La Coruna in August 2009, before it happened again in training for the France national team two months later. On each occasion he is understood to have resumed playing within 10 to 15 minutes of the episode. Gomis is believed to have collapsed a third time in a Ligue 1 match for Lyon against Monaco in August 2010. Such episodes are caused by low blood pressure to the brain, usually brought on by emotional or physical distress. Medical experts told Sportsmail that the main risks associated with the condition would come from falling, though Swansea claim Gomis is able to detect when a problem occurring and acts accordingly. AUGUST 2, 2009 - LYON 2-2 DEPORTIVO . WHAT HAPPENED? In one of his first games for Lyon, Gomis both scores and faints in a pre-season friendly. However his new club are not overly concerned. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? Club doctor Emmanuel Ohrant said: ‘Since 14-years-old, Bafe has been the subject of such vasovagal episodes, comparable to a drop in blood pressure. At St Etienne, he used to faint. We got his whole medical file, and I can testify very exhaustive medical examinations have been . OCTOBER 7, 2009 - FRANCE TRAINING . WHAT HAPPENED? After meeting up with the French squad, a training session was dramatically halted after Gomis collapsed to the ground. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? Gomis regained consciousness within a matter of minutes. Incredibly, after just 15 minutes on the sidelines, the striker was able to re-join his team-mates for training. AUGUST 7 2010 - LYON 0-0 MONACO . WHAT HAPPENED? Gomis collapsed early in Lyon’s Ligue 1 home game against Monaco, just metres away from the home dugout. The striker was seen on the ground with his eyes rolled back before club doctor Emmanuel Orhant intervened. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? However, Gomis quickly regained consciousness and continued playing until he was subbed off in the 76th minute. He later said: ‘I had an [incident] early in the game. I often do early in the season. I have immediately felt good after that. I think it was related to stress.' The 29-year-old is helped by a member of the French national team's medical staff after he collapsed . Players and staff call for help after then-Lyon striker Gomis collapses during a match in 2010 . Gomis also collapsed in a friendly match between Lyon and Deportivo La Coruna in August 2009 . Friedel was in the stands when Muamba collapsed with a cardiac arrest and said: ‘Anyone who was at that game probably thought the worst immediately. 'It's not normal for someone to be standing there and collapse and you know it's going to be something serious. 'But after a minute or so the word got back, so that's why you didn't see the panic on the players' faces because everyone knew he was all right. 'It was something that had to be dealt with, of course, but it was nothing in the stratosphere of what went on with Fabrice.’","Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed during first half of Swansea's match at Spurs .

"Graphic cell phone footage has emerged of brutal attack on a school girl that took place in Brooklyn after class on Monday afternoon. The three minute clip shows an unfair fight that begins with a small girl in a light blue hoodie being set upon by at least four other students. As the girl is mercilessly pummelled by the gang her blonde hair extensions are ripped from her head as she is repeatedly punched and kicked. Graphic cell phone footage has emerged of brutal attack on a school girl that took place in Brooklyn after class on Monday afternoon . The vicious fight is cheered on by dozens of other youths who jockey for a good view of the senseless violence. The video, posted on Facebook, captures the afternoon brawl at a McDonald’s  near Erasmus Hall High School on Flatbush Avenue. Despite being outnumbered, the small girl gives as good as she gets and at one point she pulls a black hoodie off one of her attackers to reveal a bra. Towards the end of the video - which has been shared more than 19,000 times and viewed more than 740,000 - the smaller girl is left cowering under a table. Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off. Bystanders can be heard saying, 'She’s dead,' and, 'You murdered her.' One of the main protagonists in the fight is left stripped to her bra, while the girl being picked on is so weak at the end that she collapses on a bench . A few students then intervene, pick the small girl up and sit her on a nearby bench. Immediately she collapses and so the students help her to lie down. NYPD have reviewed the video, but there is very little they can do because it doesn’t appear that anyone has filed a complaint, reports the New York Daily News. Brooklyn community activist Tony Herbert hopes the victim comes forward and is demanding her assailants be arrested. 'The message has to be sent very clearly, that this kind of violence will not be tolerated whether in a mall or in restaurants and those involved should turn themselves in to authorities immediately so as to face the consequences of their violent actions,' he said. Anyone with information about the fight is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1-800-577-TIPS.

"If history and a tilt at the career grand slam at the Masters seems a world away for Rory McIlroy amidst the water torture of Doral, then this is the week when it will all come into blessed focus. Forget the frustrated figure he cut on Friday when he created a YouTube highlight with his highland toss of his three iron into one of the many hazards that give the Blue Monster its name. This week it will all feel like stale news when he makes the ultimate golfing road trip. How does a couple of days behind closed doors at Augusta sound, with your dad for company, a couple of mates, a club member who knows all the course secrets and an athlete who is even more celebrated in America than the world No1? Rory McIlroy plays a shot on the sixth at the the WGC-Cadillac Championship on Saturday . McIlroy plans to link up with four-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady at Augusta . All that awaits the 25-year-old as he combines a bit of rest and recreation with a touch of sharp prep work with the first major of the season now just a month away. ‘To be honest, Augusta National is probably even nicer without the crowds than it is during the Masters, so it’s going to be a great experience,’ he said. The much-decorated athlete? None other than Tom Brady, quarterback with the New England Patriots and a four-time Super Bowl champion. He has played Augusta once before and shot a 77, so he is clearly no mean competitor. For a massive fan of virtually every sport like McIlroy, the appeal of linking up with Brady is obvious. As for the club member, Jeff Knox accompanied McIlroy when he was first man out in the third round of the Masters last year. Acting as marker, the 52 year old actually outscored him shooting 70 to McIlroy’s 71, with the latter describing Knox’s performance on the greens as ‘the best I have ever seen at Augusta’. World No 1 McIlroy threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on Friday . It is not rocket science, therefore, as to why McIlroy would seek him out in a more friendly setting in an attempt to pick his brain. At the season’s first major, McIlroy will be attempting to complete not only the career grand slam but a third major victory in a row, following his successes in The Open and the USPGA last year. As for Doral and the WGC-Cadillac Championship, McIlroy began his third round yesterday eight shots adrift of the leader JB Holmes. He actually made up three strokes on Holmes on Friday despite his three iron following his golf ball into the water at the par-five eighth. McIlroy played a lot better once he had let off steam, with the result that there were only nine players ahead of him at the halfway stage. Among them were some powerful hitters, including Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson and Bubba Watson. Welshman Jamie Donaldson was ninth. Australian Adam Scott turned in a remarkable opening two rounds to be just three off the lead. The Australian was not only playing his first tournament for three months, he was using a standard-length putter for the first time in four years.","Rory McIlroy created a YouTube highlight by throwing club into water .

"Vince Wilfork's 11-year spell as a New England Patriot looks to be over after the franchise informed the defensive tackle they will not be picking up the option on his contract. Due a $4million roster bonus on Tuesday, the move was widely expected, but nevertheless drew an emotional statement on the popular defensive tackle's Twitter feed. 'I'm in a good place, he wrote. 'I have a great relationship with the Patriots organization. Please know how blessed my family and I have been to be able to play 11 years in New England for an amazing organization,' said Wilfork, who bookended his time at Foxborough with two Super Bowl wins.

After signing a three-year, $22.5m deal last year, Wilfork played 766 snaps last season, and he hinted that he will continue playing as there is 'lots of gas still left in the tank'. The move gives the Patriots $8.06m in cap space, but the parties could yet reach a new, reduced, agreement for Wilfork to remain in New England.","Vince Wilfork bookended his 11-year career as a Patriot with two Super Bowl wins .

"It was a night to forget for Manchester United as Arsenal advanced to the FA Cup semi-final and out-of-sorts winger Angel di Maria was sent off for pulling at referee Michael Oliver's shirt.

"The Internet Watch Foundation sounded the alarm that younger and younger children are now posting photographs and videos online from their bedrooms and bathrooms (file picture) Teachers are to be issued new guidance this week to help children cope with the ‘unimaginable’ pressures of the modern digital age, including cyberbullying, sexting and ‘revenge porn’. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said last night that Personal, Social and Health (PSHE) lessons needed to be improved – and placed at the heart of the curriculum – to give young people the tools to cope with these growing demands. Children will also be taught about consensual sex to help vulnerable girls ‘spot, report and tackle abuse’. Mrs Morgan, addressing the Conservative think-tank, Bright Blue, said the new guidance will be published later this week, in conjunction with the PSHE Association. She added: ‘Let’s be clear, the internet and advance of the digital age are things to celebrate and to embrace. ‘But let us not deny they bring new pressures that require new responses. ‘The pressures young people face today were unimaginable to my generation.’ Mrs Morgan highlighted research that showed two in three 11 to 16-year-olds reported having friends who had been bullied online. She said the bullying can take many forms but there were increasing incidents of abuse, sexting and so-called ‘revenge porn’. She added: ‘The evidence base is still small but in a survey conducted last year, just eight police forces reported 150 allegations relating to revenge porn over a two-year period.’ Explaining the focus on teaching about sexual consent, Mrs Morgan said: ‘In this modern world where many young women, and for that matter many young men, are exposed to so many pressures day in and day out, surely we have a duty to make sure they know they can say no and know how to do it. ‘It does mean telling young people the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship, about when something crosses the line, what they can do about it.’ Some 82.5 per cent of the images and videos examined featured children and young people aged 16-20 years old, while 17.5 per cent featured those aged 15 and under . ‘If the revelations of recent weeks have shown us anything it’s that the stakes are too high to let our young people leave school without this knowledge. ‘I don’t pretend for one minute that lessons on consent would have been enough to stop the horrific abuse in Rotherham or Oxford. But I will not rest until I know that we have done everything we can to arm young women and particularly the most vulnerable young women with the information they need to spot, report and tackle abuse.’ Mrs Morgan said she was concerned that children were growing up in a world that places ‘huge value on style and arguably not always as much value on substance’. She added: ‘The democratisation of communications opens the world up but brought its own pressures too. In research conducted at the start of this year, a third of 11 to 16-year-olds said they felt the pressure to update their social media profiles with pictures or postings that make them look good.’ It has already been revealed that schools are to teach pupils as young as 11 about rape and consensual sex. Claire Lilley, head of child online safety at the NSPCC, said: 'The truly worrying problem is the number of very young children who are being coerced into providing material which is almost certainly finishing-up in the hands of sex offenders. 'Many of them are primary school age and are being forced to commit acts which are at the most serious end of sexual abuse. It's apparent some are being 'directed' to do things they find extremely distressing by strangers sitting at the other end of a webcam who will then no doubt pass on the material. 'This is a horrifying situation for the young victims who will be scared and bewildered by what is happening. To protect them there must be more investment in crime enforcement agencies so they have the manpower and latest technology to prevent this hideous abuse. 'Some older children may be willingly taking part in making sexually explicit videos because it might seem edgy or exciting. But they should be aware they are also likely to have no control over the final destination of such images. They could be shared countless times and remain in existence for many years to come, with consequences they will live to deeply regret.' Jacqueline Beauchere, chief online safety officer at Microsoft, which sponsored the study, said: 'The data are disturbing and suggest increased attention needs to be brought to this issue. 'For its part, Microsoft will seek to create and deploy appropriate technology, raise awareness and help to educate the public, and continue to partner with organisations like the IWF to ensure strategies and proposed solutions are research-based.'

"Four years after undergoing brain surgery, American JB Holmes has a golden opportunity to put the seal on his heartening recovery by claiming the biggest title of his career on Sunday. The huge-hitting Kentucky native served notice he was bang in form when he opened up the WGC-Cadillac Championship here with a startling round of 62 – described by Johnny Miller on American television on Saturday as one of the great rounds of the last 20 years. It seemed to catch up with Holmes when he put four balls into the water on Friday and started with an ugly three putt from just 5ft at the first hole of his third round. JB Holmes acknowledges the crowd after making a hole-in-one during Saturday's round . Holmes, who leads the WGC-Cadillac Championship by five shots, had brain surgery four years ago . For the first time since Thursday he did not own the lead outright and, with players of the calibre of Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson and Masters champion Bubba Watson lurking, there were fears he would fall back still further. But the 32 year old showed commendable resolve to put that opening hole mistake behind him and play wonderfully patient golf thereafter to finish up with a 70 on Saturday and establish a commanding five shot advantage. With Johnson and Watson his nearest pursuers, Holmes won’t be spending the mammoth £1.25 million first prize just yet. But the manner in which he finished off his round, with four birdies in a row from the 14th hole, augurs well for his chances. Lee Westwood is best placed of the Brits in 8th place but a long way off the pace, at eight shots behind. Rory McIlroy is no fewer than 11 strokes adrift and admitted he had little to play for but a top five finish in the final round. The big-hitting Holmes looks delighted after becoming the second man to ace the 14th in 30 minutes . After a difficult start on Saturday Holmes remained patient to hold onto his lead going into the final round . ‘I felt like I hit it a little better but my iron play is still not as sharp as I would like it to be,’ said the world No 1. An unusually wet and windy third round made it tough for the players, with only Johnson (69) managing to break 70 among the last 12 groups. Yet there were a remarkable number of perfect shots played. Take the par three fourth, a hole so long and difficult there hadn’t been a hole in one there for 26 years. Yet on this day, almost unbelievably, there were two in the space of 30 minutes, as first Johnson holed his tee shot, to be followed by the leader himself shortly afterwards. He might have had an ace but Holmes would get to the 14th without a birdie on his card. At that point, however, he broadened his shoulders and put together his brilliant finish that has left the tournament as one for him to win or lose on Sunday. Dustin Johnson, who is Holmes' closest threat, eyes up a put during Saturday's round . Johnson also aced the 14th, but is five shots behind Holmes, alongsided Masters' champion Bubba Watson . After shooting an 80 in the USPGA Championship in 2011 Holmes withdrew and, suffering from vertigo symptoms, went to see a neurologist. He was eventually diagnosed with structural defects in his cerebellum and underwent two gruelling bouts of surgery. Last May, Holmes confirmed his full recovery with an emotional victory in the Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina. Now he has the chance to register an even more prestigious victory. The huge advantage this Blue Monster course offers the big hitters was made plain by the identities of the top three. In fact, they might be the three biggest hitters in the modern game. Lee Westwood is the best-placed Brit, but his eight shots back and tied for eighth place after three rounds . Johnson and Watson are showing just why they will be heavily favoured at the Masters next month, when the latter will be trying to win a third green jacket in four years. If he shows the same gossamer touch as he has here, he must have a great chance. He is the only player in the field to break par in every round. Westwood is playing in his 50th WGC event but it is a long shot that it will end in his first victory. Still, he is showing good form as well heading to Augusta. Sergio Garcia stands alongside Westwood, with Irishman Shane Lowry a further shot off the lead. But Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up here last year, fell away following a disappointing round of 76.","American big-hitter JB Holmes leads WGC-Cadillac Championship .

"The 'phenomenal success' of the recent Davis Cup tie in Glasgow shows the huge appetite for tennis in Scotland and highlights the massive opportunity which exists to grow the sport, according to Judy Murray. The Great Britain Fed Cup captain said neither she nor her sons, Andy and Jamie, had ever experienced an atmosphere like the one at the Emirates Arena at the weekend, where Great Britain beat the US to line up a World Group quarter-final home tie against France. Coming after a huge year for sport in 2014 - in which Scotland hosted the Commonwealth Games and golf's Ryder Cup - Judy Murray believes there has never been a better time to capitalise on the 'buzz' about the sport she has worked to promote for 25 years. Judy Murray says success of the recent Davis Cup tie in Glasgow shows  huge appetite for tennis in Scotland . Great Britain's team celebrate their 3-2 victory over the USA at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow . But she stressed that good public facilities and a workforce of people who can enthuse others and bring on talent are essential if tennis is to continue to grow north of border. 'There is talent everywhere in the country, but talent without opportunity doesn't come to anything,' she said. Murray was speaking as she prepared to address about 300 young people interested in exploring a career in sports development or coaching at the Dundee Academy of Sport, a project led by Abertay University. The talk included her reflections on her rise from being a volunteer coach in Dunblane to working at tennis's elite level with her sons and the GB women's team. Andy Murray celebrates during his  win over John Isner that clinched the Brits a quarter-final place . She says it shows  huge appetite for tennis in Scotland and highlights  massive opportunity for sport to grow . Speaking ahead of the event, she said: 'I was a young mum when I started out volunteering at our local club and we had no track record of success in tennis in Scotland - in fact, we had very little tennis in Scotland and no indoor courts when I started out. 'Now there is a massive, massive opportunity to capitalise on the buzz about tennis that's been created by Andy and Jamie's success, and of course I really want to try to grow the game up here.' Former Wimbledon champion Andy Murray sealed the Davis Cup quarter-final place for Great Britain at the weekend with a straight-sets win over American John Isner. 'The Davis Cup was a phenomenal success,' said Judy Murray. 'The atmosphere at the Emirates Arena was incredible, there was about 8,000 people there. I've never seen anything like it and Andy and Jamie said they'd never played in an atmosphere like that. Murray was quick to stress that Scotland was full of talent but it needed to be nurtured in the right way . James Ward acknowledges the crowd after being forced off injured during day three of the Davis Cup . 'You can see there's a huge appetite for it in Scotland, and for tennis it's the perfect time to capitalise.' She added: 'For them to play it in Scotland was very, very special. I think it was the first time Andy had played in Scotland since he won his Grand Slams. He found it very emotional. 'I think he gets fantastic support from Scotland, but he's rarely in the country to feel it because when he does something big or is in a big final, obviously he's not here. 'I think when he walked out and heard that roar, it was goosebumps for him.' Murray said it is a 'huge time for sport' following a major 2014 for Scotland. She said: 'I think last year with the Commonwealth Games and the Ryder Cup - massive events in our country, run extremely successfully and extremely popular - and with what we saw last weekend at the Emirates, we have a lot of role models in Scotland and it is the perfect time to invest in sport and physical activity.' One of the Academy's aims is to develop the region's workforce by providing training and professional development to those working in the leisure industry. The importance of growing an accomplished sporting workforce and encouraging more women to think about careers in sport are also topics close to Murray's heart. Andy Murray watches on while his brother Jamie serves (left) and the GB team discuss tactics (right) She believes Andy Murray is a brilliant example of the talent Scotland has from a country with no track record . She said: 'Andy and Jamie were just two wee boys from a local club in Dunblane, in a country where there was no track record of tennis, who went on to both win Grand Slam titles. 'I think what that shows is that anything is possible if you have the talent, somebody creates the opportunity and then you work your socks off to get as far as you can. But we've got to believe and we've got to be ambitious. 'Nothing is impossible. Don't accept mediocre. Reach for the stars but keep your feet on the ground.'","Just Murray believes Davis Cup success shows huge appetite in Scotland .

"Glasgow's chances of hosting Britain’s Davis Cup quarter-final against France appear to be on rise following initial talks with the LTA. Although Andy Murray immediately expressed a desire to play the July tie on a grass court, the fact that neither Wimbledon nor the Queen’s Club will be available is believed to be pushing decision makers towards a return to the Emirates Arena. Andy Murray celebrates extravagantly during his straight sets win over John Isner on Sunday . Great Britain supporters would relish supporting Murray and Co in Glasgow again in July . All three day's of Davis Cup action at the Emirates Arena were sold out in a matter of minutes . The only available outdoor grass arena with a big enough capacity is in Eastbourne - but neither the players nor captain Leon Smith are keen on playing at a venue renowned for a lack of atmosphere. The noise and passion of the Scottish crowd played a huge part in the weekend win over the USA, sparking a debate within the LTA over whether that X factor may outweigh any disadvantage that comes from not playing on grass. While Murray prefers it to the indoor hard court, he would be favourite to beat any of his French opponents on any surface – while British No 2 James Ward is actually better when he moves on to the artificial surface, potentially the decisive factor when the final call is made. GB captain Leon Smith doubts the chances of Glasgow being able to create a larger grass-court venue .

But a return to the Emirates, which hosted over 21,000 fans over three days, is very much on the cards. Although no one from Glasgow Life would comment on their plans yesterday, a spokesman said: ‘The atmosphere at the weekend was electric and Glasgow proved, once again, why we are one of the world’s top sporting cities. Any decision on hosting future Davis Cup ties would be for the LTA.’","Great Britain face France in the Davis Cup quarter finals in July .

"A Michigan soccer player who killed a referee with a single punch to the face was sentenced to eight to fifteen years in prison today. Bassel Saad, 36, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter last month after admitting he struck John Bieniewicz during a game at a Livonia park. The 44-year-old referee was about to call a penalty that would have booted Saad, who already had a yellow card, from the match last summer when he was dealt the blow that would eventually kill him two days later. Scroll down for video . Bassel Saad, 36, was sentenced to eight to 15 years in prison after he admitted to punching referee John Bieniewicz (right) in the face during a soccer game last summer. The father-of-two died from his injuries . Bieniewicz's widow Kris pulled out a red card, as Saad's back was turned,  on the stand and said 'the one final thing that I want to do is I would like to serve Mr Saad with the red card that he was entitled to' Bieniewicz's widow Kris pulled out a red card as she spoke on the stand to symbolize her husband's last action before his untimely death, and said she will always see the act as murder. ‘Before I go the one final thing that I want to do is I would like to serve Mr Saad with the red card that he was entitled to,' she said in her closing remarks. Bieniewicz previously told reporters that she hoped Saad 'never sees the light of day', and that she believed her husband's life was 'worth more than eight years'. Saad faced second-degree murder charges before he took a plea deal. He will be eligible for parole after eight years and his maximum punishment is 15 years in prison. He was also ordered to pay more than $9,200 for restitution and the father-of-two's funeral expenses, according to the Detroit News. Bieniewicz's mother and three sisters were also present in court. Saad told them and Mrs Bieniewicz through tears that he was sorry from 'the bottom of my heart'. Bieniewicz previously told reporters that she hoped Saad 'never sees the light of day', and that she believed the life of her husband, pictured here with his two sons, was 'worth more than eight years' Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Saad . Mrs Bieniewicz said her only consolation was knowing that her husband died doing something he loved. Wayne County Judge Thomas Cameron told Saad during sentencing that his 'childish and senseless act' had destroyed both the Bieniewicz family's life - as well as his own. Saad, an auto mechanic and a native of Lebanon, has lived in the US legally for 15 years but is not a citizen. The father-of-three could face deportation after he serves his time. A number of players testified in court last year that Saad had been issued a yellow card, or an official warning, following a foul in the first half of the June 29 game. Bieniewicz was about to issue him a second yellow card for being verbally abusive. That's when the referee was struck, the players said. Saad's punch landed in the head and neck area, causing Bieniewicz to fall and stop breathing. Saad sobs during a probable-cause hearing in July in Livonia, Michigan. Wayne County Judge Thomas Cameron told Saad that his 'childish and senseless act' had destroyed both families . Witness Scott Herkes, left, demonstrates with defense attorney Ali Hammoud how he said Saad punched Bieniewicz, during a court hearing in the summer . Dr. Jamal Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other. In soccer, a yellow card is held aloft by the referee to caution a player following a foul or other misconduct. A red card is shown by the referee when a player is being thrown out of the game. Two yellow cards given in the same game equal a red card. A skirmish erupted between players following the attack. Saleh said he quickly checked on Bieniewicz and the referee initially was not breathing but had a pulse. Saleh said he performed CPR and told the unconscious Bieniewicz: 'Wake up, buddy. You're going to be OK.' Mrs Bieniewicz said her only consolation was knowing her husband died doing something he loved . Player Scott Herkes testified that Saad removed his jersey and left the field with another man as Bieniewicz was being tended to. Herkes said he followed the men into the parking lot and took down the license plate number of the vehicle in which they left. In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that he repeatedly struck another player in the head. Saad pleaded not contest in that case and was sentenced to five days of community service and 12 months of probation. Mrs Bieniewicz recently testified at Michigan's Capitol in support of proposed legislation that would make it a felony to assault a sports official in the state. Referees ‘are out there on an island with no one to defend them,' she said. 'Something more than a misdemeanor should be in place.' Mrs Bieniewicz, a basketball coach, said she has tried to establish some normalcy for her two sons in the eight months since their father was killed .","Bassel Saad, 36, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter last month .

"Experienced amateur jockey Tom Weston was airlifted to hospital after being kicked by horses following a fall at the Cheltenham Festival. Weston, who turned 28 this week, was on board Benbane Head in the penultimate race of the day, the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup for amateur riders, when he fell at the fourth from home. Benbane Head was in the middle of the field, and the jockey appeared to be struck by several following horses. Tom Watson, pictured in 2010, was airlifted to hospital after he was kicked by horses . He was immediately treated by doctors before being taken to the course’s medical centre and then flown by air ambulance to Bristol’s Southmead Hospital. Cheltenham spokeswoman Sophia Brudenell said that he was conscious and breathing at the time, and that he was subject to ongoing assessment and treatment. Benbane Head is trained by Gloucestershire-based Martin Keighley, who said shortly afterwards: ‘Tom’s not quite with it at the moment, but at least he is conscious and he seems much better than he initially did.’ The accident caused a 15-minute delay to the running of the final race of the day, the St Patrick’s Derby, which is run in aid of the Injured Jockeys’ Fund. While the horse escaped unscathed, a further update on Weston’s condition is expected on Friday morning. Two years ago in the same race, leading amateur jockey JT McNamara, from Limerick, was left paralysed after suffering a serious neck injury when thrown from his horse, Galaxy Rock. McNamara fractured two vertebrae and underwent rehabilitation at the North West Regional Spinal Injuries Centre in Southport, Merseyside. He only returned home to Ireland last June after being discharged from the unit.","Experienced amateur jockey Tom Weston was airlifted to hospital after being kicked by horses following a fall at the Cheltenham Festival .

"Andy Murray and James Ward headed off to California on Monday, knowing that they may well have sacrificed the first Masters level event of the year in the British cause. After sealing GB's win over America in the Davis Cup, they have a ridiculously quick turnaround before the ATP tournament starts later this week in the desert setting of Indian Wells. Ward is expected to play in the qualifying event on Tuesday, while at least Murray gets a few days' grace before the main draw begins. Andy Murray described leading Great Britain to Davis Cup victory over the United States as 'very emotional' British No 1 Murray was pumped up by his home Glasgow crowd as GB secured a 3-1 win over the USA . Murray celebrates during his straight sets win over John Isner that clinched the Brits a quarter-final place . Individual compared to team environment, altitude compared to sea level, the desert dry heat compared to Glasgow's cold, the seven hour time difference – it could hardly be more contrasting. Murray, now back up to No 4 in the world, said: 'It's going from playing on an indoor court with heavy tennis balls to playing in the desert with very fast balls in very quick conditions in terms of how the ball moves through the air there.' The British No 1 said it is far more realistic for him to do well in the Miami Open that follows later this month. 'That would be a target for me to have a very good run,' he admitted. The dates and structure of the Davis Cup continue to be a problem and those like Murray and Ward, who have chosen to play for their country, will be at a considerable disadvantage over the next 10 days. As Murray reflected, this is one reason why the likes of Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka sat out the first round of a competition which, as the weekend demonstrated, is a showcase for so much that is good about the sport. James Ward acknowledges the crowd after being forced off injured during day three of the Ryder Cup . The British GB team celebrate the victory over the USA, with Ward (second left) and Murray (second right) Murray, embracing GB team captain Leon Smith, praised the 'effort and attitude of everyone in the team' Murray will be reunited with coach Amelie Mauresmo for these two hard court events. He is also not far from appointing an assistant to her, who will be important in the weeks that she is unable to travel. Referring to his search he commented: 'I'd say it's fairly close. Over the next few days I'll try to arrange someone to do a trial period in the next month or so. 'Amelie is next not with me at the beginning of the clay-court stretch (in April). I get married the week after Miami. I'm not 100 per cent sure what I'm going to do afer that.' As Glasgow was the latest Davis Cup tie to show, there can be a real passion for tennis outside Wimbledon in the UK: 'It's up to the LTA to capitalise on it, that's not my job,' said Murray. 'I think it's valuable. You see the enthusiasm and the passion that people clearly have for tennis right now. That's great. The 27-year-old (right) wants to appoint an assistant coach to aid Amelie Mauresmo . 'I'm just happy that when we've been able to play the big events of the last few years, the crowds have been absolutely fantastic every time. 'Again in the summer I'm sure we can fill another big arena. But we need more than just putting these sort of events on.' He also revealed that LTA Chief Executive Michael Downey has still not had a proper conversation with him about improving tennis in Great Britain after 14 months in the job. They had 15 minutes together in Glasgow which, Murray confirmed, was their longest meeting to date: 'I haven't given my opinion or thoughts on how that should be done. 'I just listened to what he had to say,' said the 27-year-old Scot, sounding distinctly non-plussed. 'He sort of took me through a one-page plan, strategy, in terms of how they were going to get more people playing the game. Getting more people playing is obviously important. 'But it's one thing saying it, putting it down on a piece of paper. It's another thing doing it.' It is astonishing that Downey, who is Canadian, has not taken the trouble to thoroughly consult Britain's finest player since Fred Perry. What a criminal waste of Murray's experience, sharp intelligence and obvious passion for British tennis.","Andy Murray helped Great Britain beat USA 3-2 in the Davis Cup .

"The Tartan Army (officer class) march on Twickenham in a mood pitched somewhere between resignation and outright dejection. In the circumstances, none but the most blinkered of uber-patriots would castigate the fans for losing a little faith . With even some in the camp sounding as if there may be no beginning to their ambitions on Saturday evening, it’s hard to foresee anything but a handsome home victory. It is almost impossible to imagine this young – in parts - visiting side succeeding where so many hardened men have failed. Oh, if ever we needed a touch of the gallus swagger that plays such a beloved part in our nation’s sporting mythology, it is today at Rugger HQ. Somewhere amid the mix of technique and aggression required to stifle England, it would be awfully nice if someone from the current crop showed some inspired – maybe even swashbuckling – leadership. Vern Cotter's squad need to find a new source of inspiration if they are to triumph at Twickenham . Jonny Gray may only turn 21 on Saturday, but he has emerged as a key leader in this Scottish squad . Stuart Hogg (second left) is all smiles ahead of Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash in London . Greig Laidlaw is captain, of course. A tidy enough scrum-half well positioned to make split-second decisions on how to use the ball, he has plenty to concern himself with. Among the forwards, an increasing burden is falling on Jonny Gray, who turns 21 on Saturday. Many happy returns and all that. A member of Vern Cotter’s ‘leadership group’, the man to whom Laidlaw hands his armband when replaced, the youngster is involved in calling line-outs and directing the pack. The risk, of course, is that the burden of responsibility dulls the energy and skills that make Gray such an exciting prospect. Would it be better, perhaps, to leave him to concentrate on his own game? Scotland know they will need to be strong in the battle up front if they want to be in touch towards the end . Scotland hooker Ross Ford leads a passing drill during Scotland's final preparations for Saturday's game . ‘Ideally, yeah, you may think that,’ admits Scotland assistant coach Jonathan Humphreys, the former Wales captain adding: ‘But I compare him to Alun Wyn Jones, who I coached at a very similar age. ‘These kids, they want it, they demand it. It is a growth within them. And, with Jonny, he doesn’t see it as a burden. He wants to grow, he wants to learn. ‘What I’ve seen from him, he’s a 20-year-old kid, I’ve seen a huge growth in him in terms of how he handles himself within the group. He will use the experience of the last game, losing to Italy. He is a kid who will not repeat errors. He learns all the time. What Scotland will get out of this is just a phenomenal leader and a phenomenal character.’ If it’s obviously asking a bit much for Gray to emerge chrysalis-like from his cocoon in time to out-think and overpower a hugely effective English pack today, this might also be a perfect opportunity for the kid – winning only his 12th cap – to provide some firm and effective direction. The Scotland players have spent part of this week watching video footage of last season’s humiliation at the hands of England, as well as dissecting the horror show against Italy just a fortnight ago. Scotland go through their paces at Twickenham on Friday - it's an important game for them to restore pride . Humphreys warned: ‘If you go into a game just with passion and heated fervour then that lasts maybe 15 or 20 minutes. It is about process, the technicalities of what you are trying to do. ‘That’s the thing about getting it right. I don’t think we got that wrong last year, it was just systematic errors that are still in our game at the moment. We need to learn from them and eradicate them. We need to get smarter as a group. ‘We have a young group who need to understand that being on the wrong end of the penalty count does exert a lot of pressure on yourself. How do we eradicate that and make sure we are a little more disciplined in those areas? ‘Obviously, you pull apart a game piece by piece. That’s what we’ve done with the Italy game. We obviously took a step back in that game.’ The last thing we wanted, heading into this penultimate Six Nations weekend, was a loss of momentum. Twickenham is a tough enough venue for visitors on a high, never mind those struggling for confidence. Scotland coach Jonathan Humphreys says Gray is thriving under the pressure, just as Alun Wyn Jones did . Scotland fly half Finn Russell (left) and full back Stuart Hogg work on their kicking on Friday . Those of us who have been making this pilgrimage, on and off, since the dying days of the amateur era can remember when Scotland’s miserable streak here – only four wins in history, the most ‘recent’ in 1983 – felt odd, given that both sides were usually closely matched. With each passing loss, though, the sequence of results becomes more of a reflection on the gulf between these former rivals. England have moved on, found new best enemies, chucked us. Stick on the mournful Adele numbers and weep into your cloudy local ale … . Today, they *shouldn’t* need to do much more than bully the Scottish forwards, a unit so effectively driven about Murrayfield by their Italian tormentors. ‘The game will be based around scrummaging for penalties and driving lineouts,’ said Humphreys, seeking no prizes for predicting the obvious. ‘We defended 19 driving lineouts at Murrayfield last year, so we are aware of the strengths and how they want to play.’ They will take some stopping. At the end of a week when even head coach Cotter has spoken about keeping things tight and staying in the game until the final 20 minutes, it feels like Scotland will do well to avoid being absolutely flattened. Unless … unless. Ah, we’re not going to go down that road again. Are we?","Scotland haven't beaten England at HQ since 1983 .

"When Adam Scott waved a short putter to magical effect during the first round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday, he effectively consigned to history one of the most contentious subjects the game has known. Nine months ahead of the official death knell for long putters, the great and good have seemingly imposed their own sanction. The banishment was started by Ernie Els and Webb Simpson, who snapped his over his knee to ensure he would not be tempted any more. Then came Keegan Bradley, leaving Scott as the last man standing in terms of players who won majors using a long putter. Australian Adam Scott putts for birdie on the eighth green during the WGC-Cadillac Championship . Scott watches his tee shot on the 14th hole in the second round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship . It was this group who forced the hands of the governing bodies when they claimed all four majors between them in the space of just 18 months, from Bradley's PGA Championship triumph in 2011 through to Scott's Masters victory in 2013. The authorities were persuaded by the powerful evidence that less nerve was needed in anchoring a long putter to the body and the plain inequity that such a crutch could prove decisive at a major. Hence the ban on anchoring which, by extension, meant the end for long putters. Scott was the most high-profile since his long putter was the ugliest contraption of all. As long as he kept turning up with it in his bag, the subject rumbled on. It was during a three-month break that the genial Australian decided it was time to change. His caddie Steve Williams had announced his retirement while Scott's wife had given birth to their first child, Bo. 'Everything was getting a little boring so I thought why not change everything completely and ditch the putter as well,' said Scott (right), wryly. At home he experimented with a range of 50 different putters. He tried various grips and methods. By the time he arrived in Miami, Scott was confident enough to announce he was going back to the short putter he last wielded in competition in 2011. Scott plays his second shot on the 10th hole in the second round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship . The Australian chips the ball out of the bunker and onto the 11th green at the WGC-Cadillac Championship . The 34-year-old admitted to some first-hole nerves and genuine concern as to how it would hold up over long putts. As things turned out, it went better than he could have imagined. Using the 'claw' grip favoured by Sergio Garcia, the putting stroke looked pure and he had just 27 putts in an opening round of 70. 'I'm really pleased,' Scott said afterwards. 'I've tried not to clutter my mind and I've shown myself it is not that big a deal. It helps that I used a short putter for years, so the adjustment was really to do with muscle memory.' One or two middle-ranking players such as the Swede Carl Pettersson and South African Tim Clark still use long putters. But even here they will surely take encouragement from the example of those at the top. As for Scott, did he ever feel like following Simpson's example and snapping his putter in two? 'It treated me pretty well, so I don't think it deserves a snapping,' he said, smiling. Scott's two-under-par round left him in the top 10 but still eight strokes behind runaway leader JB Holmes, who carded a 62. 'That's the most unbelievable round I have ever seen,' said Ian Poulter, who opened with a 74 — one worse than world No 1 Rory McIlroy. For Holmes, it was another heartening milestone in his remarkable recovery from brain surgery three years ago. The 34-year-old Scott watches his tee shot on the 12th hole at the WGC-Cadillac Championship .","Adam Scott is now using a short putter at the WGC-Cadillac Championship .

"After the Lord Mayor’s Show on Saturday afternoon in Cardiff — where their title hopes will be crushed or resurrected — England will set about further diminishing the value of the old Calcutta Cup at Twickenham. Stuart Lancaster’s team cannot lose. The notion of defeat is unthinkable, in an increasingly downgraded fixture. Last year, the Red Rose raiders left Murrayfield with a 20-0 victory and the scoreline fairly reflected the poverty of the Scottish display. If anything, it flattered them. England go through the motions in training as Courtney Lawes offloads the ball at Twickenham . Tom Wood passes the ball as England ran through their moves for the final time before the Scotland clash . England will be wounded after their defeat to Ireland, and are sure to bounce back by beating Scotland . Chris Robshaw lifts the Calcutta Cup aloft after winning it at Murrayfield last year . Stuart Lancaster's men need a win against Scotland, and should get it against the wooden spoon candidates . Since then, Vern Cotter has brought Kiwi steel and some encouraging results, but Saturday's visitors are bottom of the RBS 6 Nations table after three straight defeats — the last at home to Italy — and they have not won in south west London for two generations. Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister the last time Scotland left Twickenham as conquerors, in 1983. Since then, they have endured 32 years of failure at the home of their ‘Auld Enemy’ and this does not appear to be the occasion when that dire run is destined to come to an end. Andy Farrell summed up England’s mood on Friday, saying: ‘I’ll be disappointed if we don’t get the performance this week — and with that hopefully we could be able to keep the record going.’ So, at the end of a week which began with Stuart Hogg bemoaning a lack of English ‘respect’ for Scottish rugby, the Lions full-back and his team-mates have a prime opportunity to regain it, by claiming a win which would amount to one of the upsets of the era. They will be desperate to salvage a crumbling campaign but England are also in wounded mode after their beating in Dublin, which derailed the Grand Slam bandwagon for the umpteenth year. Given the vast gulf in playing resources between the two nations, England would have the clout to prevail with three or four entirely different line-ups. James Haskell goes for a run with the ball as England prepared for the must-win fixture at Twickenham . George Ford works on his kicking as Danny Cipriani watches on during the final training session . Ben Youngs throws as pass as England's forwards look on, ahead of a game they should win easily . England could beat Scotland with three of four different XVs, and will have more than enough on Saturday . Scotland go through their paces at Twickenham on Friday - it's an important game for them to restore pride . That is not to denigrate the Scots; it is just a reflection of stark reality. Cotter’s side have dropped to 10th in the World Rugby rankings, six places behind England who have shifted clear of fifth-placed Australia. Another defeat for Scotland would leave them in danger of being over-taken by Japan, while losing further ground on Samoa above them. So if Lancaster and his squad have any pretensions of mounting a meaningful World Cup challenge, this is a fixture with no safety net. They cannot lose, because to do so would shatter all hope of going into the tournament with their stadium regarded as a place where visiting teams fear to tread. Defeat would wreck the quest to create that fortress-feel at Twickenham and would also ensure that England could not rely on telling momentum to propel them into the showpiece event in September and October. It is quite feasible these nations will meet again in a World Cup quarter-final at the same venue on October 18. The thought of losing that one would be enough to give Lancaster sleepless nights for the next seven months. The last time Scotland beat England at Twickenham in 1983, Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister . John Beattie celebrates a Scotland try, but the Calcutta Cup has been devalued by England's dominance since . Fortunately for the head coach, he has a squad who are driven by a fervent desire to make amends for their loss to Ireland, and more than enough trump cards to ensure this is an occasion devoid of tension and a nasty shock at the end. What is crucially absent from the English armoury is an ability to shape their own championship destiny. In the hours before kick-off, they must decide whether to stay true to their pre-match plan involving a black-out of all news from Cardiff, where Wales can do them an almighty favour by ending Ireland’s Slam crusade at the penultimate stage. Instead of being distracted by a game elsewhere which will all but confirm whether they remain in the title hunt, England will abide by one of their favourite mantras: ‘control the controllables’. The coaches will expect the returning Courtney Lawes to galvanise the home pack and shore up the line-out operation, while Mike Brown’s recall after injury will add nous to the back line. There will be blunt demands for a better start, better discipline, more assurance under the high ball and more collective conviction at the breakdown — with a particular onus on captain Chris Robshaw in that department. Stuart Lancaster's side could face Scotland in the World Cup quarter-finals, which may worry them more . Scotland present more of a creative threat than in the recent past, despite the cruel injury to one of their stellar centres, Alex Dunbar. Matt Scott is a fine replacement, while Hogg can run amok from deep and Finn Russell is a daring orchestrator at No 10, alongside the canny Greig Laidlaw. But none of them can function without the ball. Despite the imposing size and abrasive streak of the Scottish pack, they should be out-gunned up front. If the hosts’ set-piece holds sway, which is likely, and Billy Vunipola can get his side on the front foot, George Ford has the tools to unleash an array of predatory outside runners. England must win and they will win. The Calcutta Cup is no longer the cherished prize that it once was, so retaining it is a minimum requirement.","England's fate is not in their own hands, but they have to beat Scotland .

"New Zealand seamer Trent Boult is not taking the threat of Bangladesh lightly as his side look to keep building momentum for the World Cup knockout phase. The tournament co-hosts have won their opening five matches and are guaranteed to finish top of Pool A, regardless of their result against the Tigers at Seddon Park in Hamilton. Yet the Black Caps will want to end the pool with a flourish and enter their quarter-final in the best possible frame of mind. Trent Boult, who has taken 13 wickets already this World Cup, appeals successfully for an lbw decision . On home soil, they have won all six of their previous one-day international meetings against Bangladesh but it is the Asian side that triumphed 3-0 when the teams last met on the subcontinent in late 2013. Boult told New Zealand Cricket's official website: 'Success is there for us when we are playing them in their own backyard but when we have travelled there we have struggled a little bit. 'They are full of some world class players and we know that they will be a tough candidate come Friday night.' New Zealand have won all five games so far, including beating co-hosts Australia, to secure top spot in Pool B . Boult has played a starring role in New Zealand's stellar start to the tournament with 13 wickets in five matches, including a spectacular five-for against Australia. It is quite an achievement for the 25-year-old, who had made just 16 ODI appearances before the tournament got under way. 'The success that we have been having has been pretty special and [this World Cup] is something that I will look back on and be really proud of,' he added. 'I am sure that I speak for the majority of the group there as well. A World Cup in my home country, it's not hard to get motivated for that.' Boult and the Black Caps attack have been unstoppable, but he says they won't take Bangladesh lightly . Another pillar of New Zealand's success has been the largely excellent starts they have made to their batting, thanks to opener Brendon McCullum's masterclass in power hitting. The Black Caps captain has made 249 runs at an average of just under 50 in his five matches and his staggering strike rate of 193.02 has laid the foundations for his side. Bangladesh spin bowling coach Ruwan Kalpage has admitted they have options to try and stifle McCullum. Bangladesh are already into the quarter finals after beating England on Monday to get out of the Pool stage . 'He has not had to start against spinners,' Kalpage told Cricinfo. 'It will be tough for us but we have plans for him as well. I'm pretty sure it will help the spinners.' The Tigers proved they were not among the also rans of the tournament by beating England to book their place in the quarter-finals and could finish as high as second in the pool if they win on Friday and Scotland record a shock win against Australia. The Tigers could still finish as high as second in the group if they pull off an unlikely victory over New Zealand .","New Zealand have won all five of their matches so far in home tournament .

"Connor Wickham has admitted Sunderland's misfiring strikers deserve the criticism they are getting. The Black Cats have managed only 23 goals in their 28 Barclays Premier League fixtures to date this season, a return which has left them perched perilously close to the relegation zone as the season reaches crunch-point. Perhaps even more worrying is the fact that Gus Poyet's pool of frontmen has contributed just nine of those goals, a record Wickham knows simply has to improve if they are to avoid a second successive scramble for top-flight survival. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe has only managed two goals since his January arrival from FC Toronto . 'I wouldn't say the criticism of the strikers is unfair,' admitted Wickham, speaking to the Northern Echo. 'Strikers are going to get the most at any club because they are the money-makers, they are the ones that the fans are relying on to score the goals. That's where the criticism can come. 'Chances come and you do need to put them away. We are creating chances. The way we set up, we are setting up to attack at times when we get the ball. We do try to break as quickly as we can when we get the ball. Connor Wickham, who has scored just three league goals this season, says Sunderland attack must do better . Wickham, 21, scored one of his three Premier League strikes this term against champions Manchester City . 'We have done it in games but we have to get more consistent with it and get in to the box more. We will climb away from the rest of the group down there if we can start to put our chances away.' Scotland international Steven Fletcher is currently leading the way for the strikers with four goals - the same number as midfielder Adam Johnson - with Wickham having managed three and January arrival Jermain Defoe two. Danny Graham is yet to score for the club, while Jozy Altidore, who left the Stadium of Light for Toronto in an exchange deal with Defoe in January, did so having found the back of the net just three times in 52 appearances in all competitions. Sunderland face Aston Villa - the only Premier League club to have scored fewer goals with just 15 to date - at the Stadium of Light on Saturday with three points crucial for both sides. Villa, who ended a run of seven league defeats on the trot with a 2-1 home victory over derby rivals West Brom on March 3, currently sit three points clear of the bottom three with their hosts a point better off.

"Australian rugby league referees are to ditch their pink jerseys, because they believe it jeopardises their authority. With the NRL season due to begin again this week, the Sydney Morning Herald is reporting that officials have been switched out of pink for the coming campaign. Instead, the referees will wear blue or red, depending on the kits of the two teams involved in any game. NRL referees have ditched the idea of pink jerseys after claims they undermined official's authority . The new colours have been chosen as they apparently encourage discipline but the move has come in for criticism. Performance psychologist Chris Pomfret said it was purely a symbolic gesture which wouldn't change how the game was refereed. 'The colour of a uniform is irrelevant to the skill execution of referees, just the same as the colour of a jersey worn by players is irrelevant to their skill execution,' he said. 'In short, the colour of a uniform shouldn't matter as it doesn't directly impact on the performance of a referee, which ultimately has the most influence on their perceived credibility.' Officials will wear red or blue for the new season, which starts this, in a move that has been criticised . There was also a suggestion that the NRL risked alienating the gay community and breast cancer awareness campaigners. Dr Tom Heenean, from the Natonal Centre for Australian Studies, told the BBC it was a move away from 'social inclusion.' 'If you are wanting a more inclusive football community you have to be more aware of the symbolisms of marginal groups within that community,' he said.","Australian NRL officials had been wearing pink jerseys .

"Mike Brown has spoken for the first time about ‘one of the worst experiences of my life’ — missing out on a precious England cap. The 29-year-old full-back returns against Scotand on Saturday, a month after being knocked unconscious 12 minutes into England’s victory over Italy. Brown missed the defeat by Ireland after experiencing headaches while attempting to complete strict return-to-play protocols. Mike Brown is ready to return to England's starting XV after missing the Ireland defeat two weeks ago . Brown was knocked unconscious just 12 minutes into the win over Italy and was ruled out for two weeks . The England full back was treated on the pitch but could not continue as Stuart Lancaster's side won 47-17 . After agonising about owning up to his symptoms, knowing it would see him miss the trip to Dublin, he reluctantly alerted team doctors about his concussion. ‘Pulling out is one of the worst things I’ve ever had to go through in my whole life,’ Brown said. ‘As a sportsman everything you work towards is pulling on your country’s jersey and representing everyone in the country. ‘I went to see the doctor about 8.30 in the morning — I usually get up about 7.30 to 8 — and during that time I was sat in my room thinking should I try the next stage, should I carry on? I’ve trained through headaches before so I could definitely have trained on and seen how it went. Brown is back in training and ready to play against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday . Brown is supporting the RFU's latest concussion awareness initiative after missing the Ireland game . ‘But it wouldn’t have been good preparation for the team or me having that in the back of my mind. And obviously there’s the serious implications of the dangers and the risks involved. ‘The way I am, stubborn, desperate to play for my country, I probably would have (hidden symptoms in the past). But we’re all aware of it now and the example has been set by the England medical team and the coaching staff here for everyone else to see.’ Brown, who wins his 36th cap on Saturday, watched England’s defeat at home with his fiancee Eliza. ‘I was fuming, he said. ‘I wasn’t happy at all. Unfortunately, my fiancee had to go through it with me, poor lady. It wasn’t something I want to be doing too regularly, sat in my lounge, on the edge of my sofa, screaming at the TV!’ The England star admitted it was a bitter blow to be absent for the game in Dublin, but he had to be honest .","Mike Brown was knocked unconscious during England's win over Italy .

"Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben limped off during the 7-0 demolition of Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League last-16 second leg on Wednesday night. Pep Guardiola allayed fears over the pair's long-term health by revealing that neither injury looked too serious. Dutch winger Robben, Bayern's top scorer this season, clutched his thigh as he was taken off in the 19th minute while Frenchman  Ribery followed him off on the hour. Arjen Robben grimaces after feeling his hamstring in the first half of Bayern's crushing win against Shakhtar . The Dutch winger was replaced by Sebastian Rode as the first half drew to a close . Franck Ribery also left the field with an injury after suffering an ankle complaint in the second half . 'We have to see tomorrow what the damage is but doctors said it is not too serious for them,' Guardiola told reporters. With Bayern chasing a treble of titles and a sixth European crown they will need all the firepower they can muster despite some long-term injured players being ready to return, including captain Philipp Lahm, Thiago Alcantara and Javi Martinez. The partnership between Robben and Ribery, nicknamed 'Robbery', is crucial for Guardiola's style of play with the pair's searing pace down the wings. Ribery disappeared straight back to the dressing room after coming off . Pep Guardiola confirmed after the game that neither injuries looked 'too serious' 'It does not seem to be too bad,' Ribery, who scored one goal against Shakhtar, told reporters. 'It is something with the ankle and I hope I can be ready to play on the weekend.' Bayern, who will not play again in Europe until April, are 11 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and take on Werder Bremen on Saturday.","Bayern Munich beat Shakhtar Donetsk 7-0 in the Champions League .

"Spain's Supreme Court has dismissed a second paternity suit brought against former King Juan Carlos, accepting the ex-monarch's argument that the claim had no basis. The court said Wednesday the decision was backed by seven judges to three. Juan Carlos, 77, lodged an appeal after the court in January agreed to consider a claim by a Belgian woman, Ingrid Sariau, that her mother had a relationship with Juan Carlos which lasted into 1966, when she was born.

"One of the teenagers who was captured on video as she violently beat up a fellow classmate at a Brooklyn McDonald's has been arrested. Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested six times since last July, is one of six that were involved in attacking the other girl, who received no help from any of the other teenagers nearby, and is now being charged as an adult for her role in the incident, in which she also stole the victim's purse and cell phone. Her most recent arrest came last month when she stabbed her brother in the arm, and last year she was arrested after she punched her grandmother in the face. Now authorities are trying to identify the other five girls, despite the fact that no witnesses or even the victim herself will give them any information about the incident. The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested six times since last July, was held for the McDonald's attack . Graphic cell phone footage has emerged of brutal attack on a school girl that took place in Brooklyn after class on Monday afternoon . The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her and mock the media response to the fight . According to the New York Daily News, the 15-year-old wrote on Wednesday; 'Everyone Like Im Famous Now.' The graphic cell phone footage emerged earlier this week of the brutal attack  that took place after class on Monday afternoon. The three minute clip showed an unfair fight that began with the victim  being set upon by six other students. As the girl is mercilessly pummelled by the gang her blonde hair extensions are ripped from her head as she is repeatedly punched and kicked. The vicious fight is cheered on by dozens of other youths who jockey for a good view of the senseless violence. The video, posted on Facebook, captures the afternoon brawl at a McDonald’s  near Erasmus Hall High School on Flatbush Avenue. Despite being outnumbered, the small girl gives as good as she gets and at one point she pulls a black hoodie off one of her attackers to reveal a bra. Towards the end of the video - which has been shared more than 19,000 times and viewed more than 740,000 - the smaller girl is left cowering under a table. Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off. Bystanders can be heard saying, 'She’s dead,' and, 'You murdered her.' The 16-year-old in the fight (left) who was stripped to her bra has been arrested, while the girl being picked on is so weak at the end that she collapses on a bench . A few students then intervene, pick the small girl up and sit her on a nearby bench. Immediately she collapses and so the students help her to lie down. NYPD have reviewed the video, but there is very little they can do because it doesn’t appear that anyone has filed a complaint, reports the New York Daily News. Brooklyn community activist Tony Herbert hopes the victim comes forward and is demanding her assailants be arrested. 'The message has to be sent very clearly, that this kind of violence will not be tolerated whether in a mall or in restaurants and those involved should turn themselves in to authorities immediately so as to face the consequences of their violent actions,' he said. Anyone with information about the fight is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1-800-577-TIPS.

"A new parody video takes aim at the wage inequality between genders by introducing a fictional Amazon Prime service that caters to the average woman, who earns just 78 cents for every dollar a man in the same job makes. Comedian and filmmaker Paul Gale created the satirical ad for 'Amazon Prime for Women', which is marketed as the online retailer's attempt to make itself more appealing to its female members, who make less money than their male counterparts. 'We realized that some customers can afford more than others, so we are introducing Amazon Prime for Women, a new service that offers 78per cent of each item for 78per cent of the price,' actress Lauren Ireland says in the YouTube clip. Scroll down for video . Not equal: In a parody ad for 'Amazon Prime Women', actress Lauren Ireland explains that the new service offers 78per cent of each item for 78per cent of the price . Special deal: The video shows that women can buy more than three quarters a box a cereal for 78per cent of the original price . She continues: 'It's perfect for the average working woman who earns 78per cent as much as a man with the exact same job.' Cartoon pictures show that women can now buy three quarters of a box of cereal, books, umbrellas and sweaters – all at a special female rate. 'It's the Prime service you love at a price you can afford when you are taking home three quarters of what a man would for being equally as productive,' she says. Miss Ireland notes that there is also a specific service for black women, who earn 64per cent to every man's dollar, and Hispanic women who make only 54per cent. And while the video appears to poke fun at the current wage gap, the facts behind the funny side of the clip are brutally correct. Women only: The fictional service, which was created by comedian Paul Gale, jokes that females deserve 78per cent satisfaction . Looks like a lady: This cartoon shows a woman utilizing 78per cent of the umbrella she purchased on Amazon Prime for Women . Women's world: This book from Amazon Prime for Women may be missing a chunk of text, but it costs 13per cent less than the full copy . According to the American Association of University Women, the typical white woman working full-time in the United States made 78per cent of men's earnings in 2013, while black women made 64per cent and Hispanic women took home a mere 54per cent. 'Regardless of the exact [wage gap] numbers, there's a systemic inequality embedded in our society, whether it's regarding gender, race, or sexual orientation,' Mr Gale told The Huffington Post. He added: 'To have a platform to point at it in my own way and say 'Hey, this! We should talk about this!' is something I'm grateful to be able to do.' Mr Gale debuted the video on YouTube just days before last Sunday's International Women's Day, which saw the Clinton Foundation's release of We're Not There Yet, a PSA featuring Amy Poehler, Cameron Diaz, Sienna Miller, Padma Lakshmi and Jenny Slate's voices as they discussed issues surrounding gender equality. The video is a part of the Not There Yet campaign, which removed women from ads on International Women's Day, to call attention to the fact  we still have a long way to go before both sexes are truly equal politically, socially and economically.

"One of Britain’s most popular online bookmakers has been branded a ‘rip-off company’ after failing to honour odds offered during a crucial Chelsea match. Furious customers are demanding a bigger payout after placing wagers with Sky Bet that the London side would be knocked out of the Champions League by Paris Saint- Germain on Wednesday night. The firm’s mobile phone app was offering odds of 25-1 for a PSG win in extra time – but when it came to settling the bets, they paid out at just 9-2. It means the winnings for a £10 wager would have been cut from £260 to £55, including the return of the original stake. Scroll down for video .

Sky Bet claims the better odds were offered by ‘mistake’ – and its actions are in keeping with the small print in its terms and conditions. The longer odds were offered while Chelsea were leading 2-1 in extra time. But the French side equalised, despite being reduced to ten men, and won the two-legged clash on away goals. Punters who successfully bet on the result were told they would be paid less than they expected only after the match was over, with an email sent from the company blaming an ‘administration error’. David Luiz celebrates scoring PSG's first goal during the UEFA Champions League Round of 16, second leg match against Chelsea . Emil Bolstad, 26, was expecting to win £150 plus his £6 stake back – but profited by only £27. He said: ‘It’s false advertising. I made the bet based on 25-1 odds, not 9-2. It was only when it came time to pay up that I noticed the odds had changed. ‘If they can do this because of an “error”, they can do it for all their odds. They could triple their odds and after people have bet say, “Oh no, it was a mistake” and not pay out.’ Labour MP Graham Jones called the move 'outrageous' Labour MP Graham Jones said: ‘This is outrageous. What would have happened if a rival firm had better odds but people chose Sky Bet because of the 25-1 odds? Customers would have lost out. You can’t change the price after the sale. ‘Sky Bet are clearly a rip-off company who are willing to take their customers to the cleaners and deceive them. This is typical of the gambling industry.’ Sky Bet’s managing director Richard Flint said the longer odds were ‘clearly’ wrong. He said: ‘Occasionally mistakes happen. In this case a wrong price was displayed for around three minutes, and a small number of customers bet at the incorrect odds. These odds were clearly wrong – we showed odds of 25-1 when the true odds and the odds displayed by all other bookmakers was 9-2. We settled at the correct odds.’ The terms and conditions for the Sky Bet app – which has been downloaded 700,000 times on to iPhones and iPads – reserve the right to ‘correct obvious errors and either settle bets at the correct odds or void bets’.","Sky Bet branded a 'rip-off' after failing to honour odds at a Chelsea match .

"A woman has pleaded not guilty to trespassing charges after she got onto a runway at San Francisco International Airport with plans to stow away on a jet bound for Central America. Prosecutors say Adriana Anabela Monterroso-Santos allegedly walked on a runway Wednesday and waved her arms at a plane. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe says the 42-year-old woman was living in a homeless shelter near the airport. A woman has pled guilty to trespassing after being caught on this San Francisco airport runway in an attempt to stow away on a jet . 'If she needs help, we’ll steer her in the right direction,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle. Wagstaffe said he incident has highlighted a potential security lapse.

"Scott Arfield believes Burnley have it in them to shock Manchester City again when the Premier League champions visit Turf Moor on Saturday. The Clarets pulled off arguably their most eye-catching result of the season at the Etihad in December when they fought back from two down at half-time to claim a 2-2 draw thanks to goals from George Boyd and Ashley Barnes. It epitomised Burnley's against-the-odds fighting spirit and the memory will spur them on this weekend. Burnley midfielder Scott Arfield (right) believes his side can cause an upset against Manchester City . Arfield chases Liverpool defender Alberto Monreno (right) during the Premier League game at Anfield . Midfielder Arfield said: 'It was quite evident the mentality we've got in the squad and obviously coming from two goals down at a stadium like that, backs to the wall, and getting a point, we can take a lot of heart from that. 'We know it's going to be difficult. We're not in a fairyland where we think it's going to be easy, but we know what we've got in the dressing room. We know we're going to work for each other and technically and ability-wise we've got that as well. 'Last time at half-time we knew one goal could change it, and it did, and we had chances to win it as well. First half they were superb and we knew if they got the next goal it was going to be very difficult for us. 'But you get a goal and, no matter who you're playing against, it's going to take its toll. We started getting control of the ball and passing it about and then Barnesy turned up with a wonderful finish.' Burnley followed up the point against City by claiming a draw at Newcastle and then beating QPR but since then times have been tougher. They are without a win in two months after failing to turn good performances into points, although they did hold Chelsea to a draw in a game now better remembered for Barnes' controversial challenge on Nemanja Matic. The fixture list has not been kind, with the Clarets facing Manchester United and Liverpool along with Chelsea over the past month while matches against Southampton, Tottenham and Arsenal follow the City clash.

City's Spanish playmaker David Silva scores the opening goal against Burnley at the Etihad Stadium . City goalkeeper Joe Hart (right) looks dejected after Ashley Barnes (left) scores for Burnley in December . But, far from being daunted, Arfield said: 'Funnily enough it's kind of easier. 'When you're playing against your Cities, Liverpools, Uniteds, they're the games you look forward to at the start of the fixture list, the ones you want to play in. 'Every game's enjoyable in this division but when you're playing the big boys you want to get on the ball and show what you can do.' Burnley's fate is likely to be decided by their home form, and Arfield knows they cannot afford more of the slips that saw them fail to turn leads against Crystal Palace and West Brom into wins. 'It's massive,' said the Scot. 'With the fans behind us, last season it was a fortress at times, people didn't want to come and play against us at home. 'This season we need to get back to that.

"Tottenham Hotspur have been given the go-ahead to build their new stadium after a local firm admitted defeat in its objections to the £400 million development. Archway Sheet Metal Works launched a legal challenge to a compulsory purchase order (CPO) rejected last month but could have appealed. The firm has now decided not to do so, it announced on Friday. How Tottenham's new stadium will look for night games from 2018-19 season onwards . Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is located next to White Hart Lane on the last patch of land Tottenham needed for their stadium development argued that the compulsory purchase order was unlawful . Now that Archway have dropped their case, Spurs have the go-ahead for their new 56,000-plus capacity stadium at White Hart Lane . The company announced in a statement: 'We have always been willing to negotiate with the club on a reasonable and proper basis. 'We will continue to try to achieve a proper settlement by agreement if that is possible.' Spurs have relocated more than 70 local businesses from the site, which is adjacent to the White Hart Lane home they have occupied since 1899. By moving for what is expected to be the 2018-19 season, they will increase their capacity from barely 36,000 to 56,250. Before then Tottenham expect to move elsewhere for at least one season, possibly alternating between Wembley and sharing with League One (third tier) club Milton Keynes Dons.

"Gareth Bale was berated as he left the Santiago Bernabeu after Real Madrid's 4-3 defeat by Schalke  on Tuesday night, with fans caling him an 'a******e' and a 'prostitute' among other names. The Champions League holders made it through to the quarter-finals despite losing the seven-goal thriller, taking the last-16 tie 5-4 on aggregate. But Bale was the subject of boos again with the home faithful seemingly losing patience with the former Tottenham star, and, along with some of his Real team-mates, was met with a wall of noise as he left the parking garage in Madrid. Gareth Bale appeared to be abused by Real Madrid fans as he left the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday night .

Bale endured a frustrating evening on Tuesday night but Real still qualified for the quarter-finals . As he drove away, supporters appeared to abuse him, yelling: 'Son of b*****s! A******e! Gay!' before one said: 'Male prostitute Welshman.' Bale became the most expensive footballer in the world upon signing for the Galacticos in an Â£86million deal and was impressive in his first season, netting crucial goals in Copa del Rey and Champions League final victories. But as his second campaign has worn on, he has been labelled as a 'ball-hog' by sections of the Bernabeu crowd, with many voicing their anger when he doesn't pass to team-mate and Balon d'Or holder Cristiano Ronaldo. After the shock defeat on Tuesday night some supporters were waving white handkerchiefs in a form of protest, while Bale was criticsed after dragging a shot wide when in a good position in front of goal.

"Rangi Chase turned on the style in front of Australia national coach Tim Sheens as Salford continued their revival with a 24-18 win over Wakefield to climb into Super League's top eight. The Red Devils have collected five points out of a possible six since Sheens arrived to take up a short-term advisory role at the club and it was Chase, who was given his NRL debut by Sheens as a teenager at Wests Tigers, who once more stole the show on Adrian Morley's 300th Super League appearance. The former Castleford and England stand-off scored one try and provided the scoring pass for Salford's three others to further underline his return to the form that earned him the Man of Steel title in 2011. Rangi Chase put in a stylish performance for Salford Red Devil in their win over Wakefield on Sunday . The Red Devils, who were led out by Morley, were virtually at full-strength with the return of major close-season signings Ben Jones-Bishop and Michael Dobson, and showed signs of becoming a force this year. Wakefield, who gave 18-year-old Jordan Crowther his second appearance, had their moments but were left to contemplate a third successive defeat after starting the season with back-to-back wins. Chase scored a try and set up three for his side as Salford moved into the Super League's top eight . Chase had the chance to help his side open the scoring when he re-gathered the ball from Dobson's high kick but his trademark ""no-look"" pass found a defender instead of a team-mate and Wakefield went on to dominate the rest of the opening quarter. Impressive full-back Craig Hall's 40-20 kick set up the position for left winger Chris Riley to go over only to be brought back for a forward pass, while centre Reece Lyne had a try disallowed for a double movement before loose forward Danny Washbrook's break paved the way for stand-off Jacob Miller to score the opening try. Hall's conversion made it 6-0 but the Red Devils struck twice in a five-minute spell to turn the tables on the visitors. Chase picked off a pass by his former half-back partner Tim Smith to get winger Greg Johnson away for an 80-metre try and then produced a short pass for second rower Weller Hauraki to score his first try for the club. Josh Griffin added both goals to make it 12-6 and was then denied a try by being held up over the line. Salford looked to be firmly in command when Chase dummied his way over for a solo try three minutes into the second half, Griffin making it 18-6, but Wakefield were in no mood to roll over. Hooker Paul McShane, just back on the field for the injured Pita Godinet, caught the Salford defence napping by forcing his way over from dummy half for his side's second try, which Hall goaled. Morley then produced arguably the highlight of the match, a 50-metre break, to set up the position for Chase to get centre Junior Sa'u over for a fourth try, with Griffin maintaining his 100 per cent with the boot. Wakefield battled to the end and were rewarded with Hall's opportunist try but Salford never looked like surrendering their lead.","Former Man of Steel Rangi Chase scored a try and set up three in win .

"A nine-year-old boy was locked in a tiny cage then forced to stand half-naked in a pond as punishment for stealing. Jin Hung's cruel castigation by neighbours caused outrage in China after pictures were shared on social media. Locals Yuan Kang, 35, and Cheng Yeh, 40, decided to mete out their own justice after accusing him of stealing food and money from the village, the People's Daily Online reports. Caged: Neighbours decided to lock up the nine-year-old themselves so he could learn his lesson . Shivering: Nine-year-old Jin Hung was stripped to his waist and forced to stand in a pond while locals shouted abuse at him for stealing . He was first locked in a cage so small he could not stand up and told to reflect on his crime. When this failed to make him cry, he was stripped down to his waist and made to stand in the pond while villagers hurled insults. His ordeal only ended when Jin's parents called the police and the neighbours were made to let the shivering youngster go and fined £20 each. Counting the cost: Jin Hung counts money after being caught stealing by angry neighbours in China . But Yuan remained unrepentant, arguing it would teach the child a lesson. He said: 'We all knew in the village that there was somebody stealing, if it wasn't eggs from our henhouse or vegetables, it was cash from inside empty properties. 'When he was caught red-handed we went round to his house and demanded to see inside his room, where we found a jar filled with money hidden under his bed. Cold punishment: Villagers shout insults at Jin Hung while making him stand half-naked in a pond . 'This was obviously his ill gotten gains, and he needed to be taught a lesson that stealing is wrong.' Pictures of the boy's ordeal were later published on Weibo sparking a debate.

"A non-league football match had to be postponed after a groundsman demolished the goalposts while mowing and rolling the pitch. The groundsman was dragging a heavy roller around the goal-mouth part of the pitch at the home of Brokenhurst FC when the bulky contraption firmly struck the left-hand post. Such was the force of the collision it caused the goal frame to snap at the join of the crossbar, leaving it dismantled on the turf. Brockenhurst's home clash against Bournemouth Poppies was postponed when the groundsman demolished the goalposts with a heavy roller - the home team were unable to get replacement posts in time . The damage to the goalposts was so bad it meant yesterday's Sydenhams Wessex League clash between Brockenhurst and Bournemouth Poppies had to be cancelled. Pete Lynes, chairman of Brockenhurst FC, told MailOnline: 'I heard about it on the day itself and at first I didn't believe it. 'But when I went down I saw the damage to the post and I immediately telephoned the manufacturers to see if they would be able to provide replacements. 'But they could not deliver new ones until the middle of next week, so we had to call the game off. It's just one of those things.'

'We tried to be really persistent in attack but they had a lot of people defending. We tried really hard but we couldn't score. They created a lot of danger but I believe we still had opportunities to get the game won.' George Boyd scored Burnley's winner with a sweetly struck shot into the bottom corner .

The result increased the pressure on manager Manuel Pellegrini, whose position has come under scrutiny during a faltering spell.

Their hopes of rescuing their season - and taking the heat off Pellegrini - could now come down to the small matter of overturning a 2-1 deficit at Barcelona at the Nou Camp in the Champions League on Wednesday. 'It is time to think about the next game,' Navas said. 'We have to prepare very well and try to get to the next round.'","Manchester City paid the price against Burnley, admits Jesus Navas .
