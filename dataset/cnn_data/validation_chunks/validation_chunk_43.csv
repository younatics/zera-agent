"John and Margaret Ross were 'absolutely devastated' when they found what they thought was their missing cat lying dead in the road, before sending him for cremation. But two weeks later the couple from Hackney, east London, were stunned to receive a phone call from a vet who said their 19-year-old feline Amigo had been discovered alive and well. Mr and Mrs Ross, both 73, immediately realised that they had cremated somebody else’s pet cat - which looked identical to their own white, black and tan Maine Coon. He's back: Margaret and John Ross with their 19-year-old cat Amigo - who they thought they had cremated . Found: The couple received a phone call from a vet in London to say their cat of 15 years was safe and well . Retired barrister Mr Ross said: ‘It was exactly the same cat as ours, same colour, same everything. It had been badly injured and was definitely dead. We picked him up and took him home. ‘We said “this is our cat, he has been killed, can we have him cremated?” We didn’t check the microchip. We thought there was no point checking the chip of our dead cat.’ The couple, married for 52 years, asked a vet to send the cat to the Cambridge Pet Crematorium in Thriplow Heath, Hertfordshire, on January 17 - which was 12 days after he vanished. But last Tuesday - two weeks after paying £130 for the cremation - they received a phone call from the Wanstead Veterinary Hospital in east London to say their cat of 15 years was safe and well. Presumption: Mrs Ross said the couple 'never suspected' the dead animal 'might be somebody else's cat' Missing feline: Mr Ross said the dead cat was 'exactly' the same as Amigo - 'same colour, same everything' Mr Ross said: ‘Three weeks later we got a call from the veterinary hospital to say they found Amigo but I said “we’ve cremated him, it can’t be”. We shot off to the hospital and there was Amigo. ‘We said “Is he completely deaf? Has he got cysts on his back?” The vet said “yes”, and we knew he was our Amigo. We couldn’t believe we got him back. 'But then it struck, we’d cremated the wrong cat. We rung the crematorium and said if somebody wants the ashes of that cat then please give them the ashes.’ Mrs Ross, a retired English lecturer, added: ‘We never suspected it might be somebody else’s cat - if it had been an ordinary moggy then maybe, but Maine Coons are really quite rare. It had been a messy accident but it had the same white paws and white fluff as ours.’ A crematorium spokesman said the ashes of the unidentified cat would be scattered in its gardens.","John and Margaret Ross  found what they thought was their missing cat .

"A Philadelphia folk musician and environmental engineer was killed by a falling tree while hiking the Appalachian Trail in Maryland this weekend. The National Park Service says 36-year-old Jason Parish died Sunday morning when high winds brought down a dead tree near an overnight shelter in Maryland. The park service says Parish and two companions began hiking north from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, Friday. Recording studio owner Ernest Tokay says Parish was a talented member of Philadelphia's folk music scene who released his debut album, A Mountain and a Hill, in January. Tragic: Jason Parish (left and right), a folk musician from Philadelphia, died Sunday when a tree fell on him on the Appalachian Trail near Brunswick, Maryland . Freak accident: High winds brought down a dead tree near an overnight shelter in Maryland, killing the hiker . Tokay says Parish often went camping, even in the winter, sometimes at a moment's notice. ‘It was his thing,’ Tokay said. ‘He seemed to enjoy what the rest of us would call very torturous conditions.’ According to the park service, the call about the deadly accident came in just after 9am Sunday. The accident took place along Yourtee Road off of Route 67 in Washington County between Yarrowsburg Road and Brownsville Road, on a steep and rocky section of the trail near the Ed Garvey shelter. Agency spokeswoman Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles says an off-duty park ranger who was nearby performed CPR on Parish, but to no avail. Wanderlust: Parish, 36, is pictured here on a beach along the Pacific Ocean in 2009 with his dog Kodiak . Parish was an environmental engineer who enjoyed making music and traveling in his free time . The 36-year-old hiker was pronounced dead at the scene by first responders with Brunswick Volunteer Ambulance and Rescue Company. Seasoned outdoorsman: A friend said Parish often went camping, even in the winter, sometimes at a moment's notice . Parish's Facebook page includes several breathtaking photos from his travels, including one of him sitting on a bluff overlooking George Washington National Forest in West Virginia. Parish is survived by his parents, a brother and a sister.","Jason Parish, 36, was fatally injured when high winds knocks down a dead tree near overnight shelter near Brunswick, Maryland .

"The family of the six-year-old Oregon boy forced into eating his lunch behind a screen because his parents dropped him off one minute late to school have been gifted a brand new minivan. Hunter Cmelo's parents, Nicole Garloff and Mark Cmelo were presented with the $30,000 Chrysler minivan after local Medford businesses heard he was late because their car was old and unreliable. The photograph which was taken by his mother and posted to Facebook by his grandmother attracted global attention and shamed the school to change its policy on publicly punishing students in the same way. Scroll down for video . The family of the six-year-old Oregon boy forced into eating his lunch behind a screen because his parents dropped him off one minute late to school have been gifted a brand new minivan (pictured). Hunter Cmelo's parents, Nicole Garloff and Mark Cmelo were presented with the $30,000 Chrysler minivan . Even though Nicole and Mark's broken-down Dodge Durango was repaired by a friendly local mechanic, a local reposession firm, Rapid Repo and Collections, donated the minivan to them to make sure Hunter would always get to school on time. ""When I handed dad Mark the key to the minivan, he was speechless and extremely grateful,' said McClease Kelly, who organized the generous donation. Last month, Hunter's picture was shared around the Internet as Nicole and Mark shared their outrage at their son's treatment. Lincoln Elementary School in Grants Pass was forced to change its tardiness policy after the image of the punishment was shared thousands of times on Facebook - sparking hundreds of complaints. Alone: Six-year-old Hunter Cmelo was forced to eat alone behind this cardboard divider after his parents dropped him off late to his elementary school. He was left feeling humiliated, his family said . Embarrassed: The school district said that the system is supposed to give children the chance to catch up on work they have missed by being late - but staff have now agreed to stop using the screen . In the photograph, Hunter Cmelo, a first grader at the school, can be seen sitting alone behind a cardboard divider at a cafeteria table. Close by is a cup with a large letter 'D' for 'detention'. His grandmother, Laura Hoover, shared the image to her Facebook page last Wednesday. 'This is my grandson, Hunter. He's a little first grader,' she wrote. 'His momma's car sometimes doesn't like to start right up. Sometimes he's a couple of minutes late to school. 'Yesterday, he was 1 minute late and this is what his momma discovered they do to punish him! They have done this to him 6 times for something that is out of his control! They make a mockery of him in front of the other students.' She said that his mother found Hunter crying and took him home. His parents said they were devastated when they found out what their son was going through. 'They are shaming him for something that's not in his control,' his father, Mark Cmelo, told KOIN6. 'It is our fault that he is late.' Hunter is pictured with his mother, Nicole Garloff, who admitted he is often late to school due to car troubles and because she suffers from osteoporosis, which makes it hard for her to get going in the morning . School: The principal of Lincoln Elementary School in Grants Pass, Oregon has now met with the boy's parents and reached 'an appropriate resolution', the district said . His mother, Nicole Garloff, said the punishment has left her son anxious about going to school, and that a few days ago, he began 'flipping out' because they were running late. She said that she has experienced car troubles and suffers from osteoporosis, which can set her back in the mornings. 'It causes a lot of pain and in the mornings it's especially hard for me to get going,' she said. The boy is unable to ride the school bus because they live within a mile of the school, but they are unable to walk because the road is too busy. School superintendent John Higgins and principal Missy Fitzsimmons started receiving threatening calls after the photo was shared on Facebook, according to Newswatch 12. Higgins told the channel he believes the system gave students a chance to catch up on missed work. The 'protocol was communicated to parents via newsletter and is intended to provide the students with an above average level of tardiness, supervised additional learning time in a non-distracting setting,' the district said in a statement. 'It was never intended to isolate or stigmatize students.' The principal immediately reached out to the parents after receiving complaints. They met on Thursday and agreed to stop using the partition as a punishment. 'We are pleased to report the meeting was productive,' the district said. 'The parents' concerns were politely discussed and, ultimately, the issues were resolved to the satisfaction of both parents and the school. All parties involved believe that an appropriate resolution has been reached.","Photograph of Hunter Cmelo eating alone was shared online last month .

"A would-be motorist, who has spent more than £5,000 on 250 lessons over a 14-year period has been blacklisted from her local driving schools due to her failure to pass the test. Janine Mars, 31, has had five different driving instructors only to fail her practical test four times. Yet, despite the intensive instruction, Ms Mars is still unable to pull away from a junction without stalling her car. Janine Mars, pictured, has spent more than £5,000 on driving lessons over the past 14 years without success . Ms Mars, pictured, said she lacks confidence when she gets behind the wheel of a car . Ms Mars, left, said her mother Radha, right, will give her money towards a car if she passes the driving test . She said, now the situation is so bad, she cannot find an instructor near her home in Chatham, Kent, willing to take her because of her poor motoring skills. It is estimated that during her driving lessons, Ms Mars has driven the equivalent of a road trip between London and Perth in Australia. According to Ms Mars: 'After a few years I stopped counting how much I’d spent. 'It’s definitely more than £5,000 now, which is crazy. I could have bought a brand new car for that! 'I can’t give up now though, I’ve invested too much to stop.' Ms Mars started driving as soon as she was old enough, but changed instructor after 15 lessons because they didn’t get on. When she moved to her second teacher, she had more than 100 lessons before realising he wasn’t going to put her forward for a test. In 2012 she chose a third instructor, before moving to a fourth expert - even sitting double lessons - without success. Eventually she tried a fifth instructor in August last year, but failed her most recent test. Ms Mars said: 'Every year since 2001, passing my driving test has been my New Year’s resolution. 'I took a break after my last test in October but I want to do an intensive week course. 'I reckon that’s the only way I can pass now. 'The last time I tried to get an instructor in Kent nobody would take me because they know how bad I am. 'It’s as if I’ve been blacklisted. I don’t blame them though!' But Ms Mars, pictured, said she is having difficulty finding a driving instructor willing to take her on . Radha, left, said her daughter, right, is 'the world's best backseat driver' constantly offering advice . Despite her inability to pass her test, Ms Mars has never had an accident and believes her problem is a lack of confidence. 'Driving doesn’t come naturally to me. I can’t quite master using both legs and hands at different times. I’ve had the same problem for the last 14 years. 'I’ve never had a crash or accident. Everything will be going really well, calm driving, and then suddenly I fall to pieces. It might only be a minor thing, like I miss a junction or turn, and I’ll be thrown completely off course. 'Everyone tells me I’ll get over that - but 250 lessons later and I’m still waiting.' Now Ms Mars plans ahead before each driving lesson, having developed a routine to help get her into the correct frame of mind. She revealed: 'Before I get in the car, I eat a big breakfast and drink a mug of tea. 'Then, without fail, I play Happy by Pharrell to get myself into a more relaxed mindset. I’ve experimented with different music, but some of them would get me too pumped up. Even with doing that I still have the same issues.' Ms Mars' mother Radha, 62, has even tried to encourage her daughter with the offer of cash towards her first car. She said: 'I can’t wait for her to pass. “She’s a real diva in the car. Despite the fact she hasn’t passed her test she’s the world’s best backseat driver. She’s always saying ""Mum, don’t do that"" or ""go here"". 'I’m so desperate to stop carting her round, I’ve promised I’ll go halves on a new car once she passes!' Ms Mars said she has not given up her dream of owning her own car. She added: 'Maybe I’m just one of those people born to be driven. I’m fed up of planning my life around train and bus timetables too. It takes almost twice as long as driving. My mum has promised to go halves on a new car once I pass so that’s even more of an incentive.' Ms Mars said she might be the type of person who is 'born to be driven' but still plans to continue trying .","Janine Mars has spent more than £5,000 on driving lessons over 14 years .

"He's the man who is currently setting social media alight every Sunday evening - and whose chiselled abs and Mr Darcy smoulder have won him a legion of female fans. But while Aidan Turner was unknown to many prior to his turn as the troubled Ross Poldark in the BBC drama of the same name, the 31-year-old is no stranger to success. Yet although he may look familiar to some, others might find him hard to place - unless you're a fan of fantasy films and supernatural drama that is. Turner plays Ross Poldark who's lost his love, Elizabeth (played by Heida Reed, left) to another man . Irish actor Aidan Turner, who plays dashing Captain Ross Poldark, sets pulses racing on the BBC show . For before donning the tricorn hat and brooding scowl of the landowner who returns to Cornwall to find his true love is engaged to another man, Turner was busy fighting evil in Middle Earth. The 5ft 10in Turner was digitally shrunk for his role as Kili, one of two dwarf brothers who set out alongside Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins in a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy. But with Martin Freeman playing Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage's brooding dwarf chieftan stealing all the screen thunder, you might have missed Aidan's fantastical role - had he not also enjoyed a plotline that involved flirting with Tauriel the elf, played by Evangeline Lilly. Action stations: From left, John Callen, Dean O'Gorman, Aidan Turner, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Adam Brown, Jed Brophy, Peter Hambleton, Ken Stott and Stephen Hunter in a scene from The Hobbit: the Battle of the Five Armies film . He became famous as vampire John Mitchell in the BBC3 supernatural housemates dramedy Being Human . But it seems training to play the warrior dwarf may have helped sculpt the abs that have become famous in their own right. Turner told Empire about the prep needed for the trilogy: 'A lot of going to the gym; a lot of movement classes. Dwarves are just weighed down by everything,' he said. 'They’re not sluggish, they just have this work-horse mentality. When they get going they’re unstoppable.' Turner even popped up in The Tudors in one episode as a richly-dressed character called Bedoli . As John Schofield, Hattie Jacques' lodger and lover, Turner had to don Sixties clothing . Aidan Turner and Dean O'Gorman as brothers Kili and Fili respectively in a scene from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey . Since graduating from The Gaiety School of Acting in 2004, the Dubliner has enjoyed an eclectic range of parts and notched up a number of award nominations. His career in television began in 2007 when he embraced 16th century-style costume to appear in one episode of the television series The Tudors. More period work was to follow when he was chosen to play pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the six-part BBC series the Desperate Romantics, followed swiftly by appearances as Ruairí McGowan on The Clinic. But Turner finally had a change of pace in 2008 when he was cast as the undead John Mitchell in the supernatural drama Being Human, about a werewolf, vampire and a ghost who share a house. With his hair slicked back, his face deathly pale, an all-black wardrobe and a set of menacing fangs, the actor earned a new army of fans.

Aidan Turner (second from right) dons period costume as Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the six-part BBC series the Desperate Romantics alongside (from left) Samuel Barnett as John Millais, Sam Crane as Fred Walters and Rafe Spall as William Holman Hunt . But for Hattie, the 2011 TV film about   Hattie Jacques' life, Aidan returned to period costume again - this time from the Sixties - as the Carry On actress's lodger and lover, opposite Ruth Jones. Now that he's back in breeches for the BBC remake, Aidan is now appealing to a new class of Poldark fans. Not only are hoards of viewers tuning in to see him and learn of Poldark's adventures for the first time, fans from the original 1975 drama are also turning on their television sets to see how Aidan's portrayal of the charismatic hero differ. For the first time he may have become the stuff of female fantasy - rather than fantasy films. Aidan Turner is setting pulses racing with his portrayal of the troubled Ross Poldark in the new BBC series .","Irish heartthrob has set pulses racing and social media alight .

"Drones have been banned from parks near Buckingham Palace and other senior Royals’ homes amid fears they could be used by spies or would-be terrorists. The remote-controlled aircraft cannot be used in any of the open spaces near the Queen’s London residence. Signs have gone up in every Royal park across the capital warning: ‘The flying of drones or model aircraft in the park is prohibited.’ Ban: The new signs (pictured) forbidding the use of drones or model aircraft in the Royal Parks in London . Their proximity to historic buildings, including Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, has prompted speculation that the gadgets pose a risk to the Royal Family’s security. But a Royal Parks spokesman insisted the signs could also be found far away from palaces, including Richmond Park and Greenwich Park. He said: ‘They can have a very negative impact on the wildlife in the parks and interfere with the safety and comfort of park visitors.’ Insiders say there have already been ‘a handful of incidents’ involving drones inside London’s biggest parks. Just before Christmas a man was given a warning after flying a drone over the Winter Wonderland fairground inside Hyde Park, while videos posted online show tourists flying drones, most of which carry high-definition cameras, close to landmarks including Buckingham Palace. Insiders say there have already been ‘a handful of incidents’ involving drones inside London’s biggest parks . An image of Buckingham Palace taken using a drone and uploaded to Youtube in 2013 by its pilot . Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed that the Metropolitan Police – who are responsible for security in the Royal Parks – want the power to seize unmanned aircraft being flown illegally. Drones are already banned from the parks, under existing legislation that prohibits the use of ‘any kite or model aircraft’. Under aviation law, it is also illegal to fly them within 50m (164ft) of a building or person.","Drones can't be used in any open spaces near Queen's London residence .

"An extra 500 free schools will be opened by 2020 under a Conservative government, David Cameron announced today. The Prime Minister promised a major expansion of the policy which allows schools to be set up by community groups including parents, charities or teachers. But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan revealed she had blocked plans to allow profit-making in schools, which predecessor Michael Gove had advocated. David Cameron talks with school children during a visit to The Green School for girls in west London today . Free schools were introduced in 2010 to allow parents and community groups to set up their own schools. They are independent from local authorities but must still undergo Ofsted inspections. Supporters say they help to drive up standards by creating competition with existing schools, but Labour has opposed their creation in areas with a surplus of places where they are not needed. The new plan to open at least 500 of the schools by 2020 mean an extra 270,000 places. In a speech in London, Mr Cameron said: 'If you vote Conservative, you will see the continuation of the free schools programme at the rate you've seen in the last three years. 'That means, over the next parliament, we hope to open at least 500 new free schools resulting in 270,000 new school places. 'Remember - we're the only party that is committed to this. The only party that's opening up the education system so we can get more good places for your children. 'And isn't that what every parent wants - a great education for their child? You deserve the security of knowing your child is getting just that. And with the Conservatives you should expect nothing less.' He also backed the idea of existing grammar schools. Taking questions from the audience, Mr Cameron was asked about comments he made in 2007 that a 'pledge to build more grammar schools would be an electoral albatross'. He insisted: 'I have never said that grammar schools are an albatross, grammar schools are good schools and I like good schools. I want there to be good schools for people to send their children to. 'What I've said about grammar schools is, like other schools that are good, if they want to expand they should be able to expand. I have been very consistent about that.' The Prime Minister was joined by the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (left) during a visit to The Green School for girls in west London . Mr Cameron said his party would pledge five hundred new free schools if the Conservatives win the general election in May . It comes as the government announces that 49 more schools have been given the go-ahead, taking the total created under the coalition to more than 400. Mrs Morgan, the Education Secretary, said: 'Free schools give pupils the chance to attend an excellent local school. 'They are providing more choice than ever before to parents and ensuring that children have access to a high-quality school place and the best possible education that prepares them for life in modern Britain.' Ms Morgan said she wanted each school to 'make the right choice for them' about whether to become a free school or academy. Asked if she could rule out a Tory government allowing free schools to make a profit, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Yes I can rule it out, I think having for profit education is something that would make me feel very uncomfortable and it is not something that is needed. 'We have excellent sponsors like charities and others or parent groups wanting to run schools and they are doing an excellent job up and down the country.' Free schools were introduced in 2010 to allow parents and community groups to set up their own schools. They are independent from local authorities but must still undergo Ofsted inspections . Mrs Morgan's insistence that there would be no profit-making schools for the whole of the next parliament suggests a shift in policy from her predecessor. Mr Gove, who lost his job as Education Secretary in July, had advocated allowing profit-making to encourage companies to set up successful free schools. In May 2012 he said: 'It's my belief that we could move to that situation but at the moment it's important to recognise that the free schools movement is succeeding without that element and I think we should cross that bridge when we come to it.' Labour has criticised the free schools policy, claiming it can lead to money being channelled to areas where there is a surplus of school places instead of being targeted at areas where classes are overcrowded. Mr Cameron's plans for an expansion of free schools came as a report by the centre-right think tank Policy Exchange claimed they are raising standards for all pupils in areas where they open, even for children who do not attend them. The report suggested that the competitive effect created by a free school leads to improved academic standards in nearby under-performing schools. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: 'This proposal simply masks the deep cuts the Tories are planning for education. Their scorched-earth policy for public services would mean that funding for nurseries, schools and colleges could be slashed by a quarter by 2020.' Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT union, said: 'It is clear that if elected the Conservative Party will continue its obsessive ideological focus on structural change. 'It is scandalous that in the context where the Conservative Party is proposing even deeper cuts to funding post the General Election, it still plans to pour millions of pounds into free schools. 'There is no evidence that structural change raises educational standards.'","Cameron announces plans for 500 more free schools by the end of 2020 .

"A debut at Carnegie Hall meant to showcase a young composer was abruptly canceled after management realized it featured a snippet of a Nazi German anthem. The New York Youth Symphony was set to premiere the orchestral work on Sunday at the prestigious concert hall but the orchestra's management removed it, saying that such an explosive musical reference required a longer conversation. No one has suggested any Nazi sympathy by composer Jonas Tarm, a 21-year-old Estonian American, who intended for the work to deplore war including recent bloodshed in Ukraine. Composer: The New York Youth Symphony canceled Jonas Tarm's 'Marsh u Nebuttya' after management realized it featured a snippet of a Nazi German anthem . Piece: Tarm uploaded this photograph of his work 'Marsh u Nebuttya,' which is Ukrainian for 'March to Oblivion.' It featured both a portion from the Nazi song 'Horst-Wessel-Lied' and the anthem of Soviet-ruled Ukraine . But the controversy raised a broader question -- how explicitly do artists need to state that allusions to history's darkest chapters are meant to condemn rather than condone? The New York Youth Symphony, which recognizes performers and composers under age 22, said Tarm only informed the management last week that his piece included 45 seconds of 'Horst-Wessel-Lied,' one of the Nazis' main anthems which is banned in modern Germany and Austria. The symphony said that the nine-minute piece could have been 'an important teaching moment for our students' but that Tarm refused to lay out his reasons for using 'Horst-Wessel-Lied.' 'Without this information, and given the lack of transparency and lack of parental consent to engage with this music, we could not continue to feature his work on the program,' the symphony said in a statement. 'We believe deeply in a free creative process. But along with freedom comes responsibility, even more so when young people are involved,' it said. Tarm had entitled his work 'Marsh u Nebuttya,' which is Ukrainian for 'March to Oblivion,' and it also incorporated the anthem of Soviet-ruled Ukraine. He initially explained his work only with a dedication in the program 'to the victims of hunger and fire' and an excerpt from T.S. Eliot's post-World War I poem 'The Hollow Men.' 'Between the conception and the creation / Between the emotion and the response / Falls the Shadow,' runs the verse from Eliot, who is often considered the premier 20th century English-language poet but also faced accusations of anti-Semitism. Disclosure: The New York Youth Symphony said Tarm only informed the management last week that his piece included 45 seconds of 'Horst-Wessel-Lied,' one of the Nazis' main anthems. The song is  banned in modern Germany and Austria . Upset: After Tarm's Carnegie Hall (pictured) debut was cancelled, Tarm spoke more at length, saying he was 'disappointed and confused' by the rejection of a piece 'not meant to provoke, but to evoke . Intent: Tarm has said the piece is 'devoted to the victims who have suffered from cruelty and hatred of war, totalitarianism, polarizing nationalism -- in the past and today' Music speaks for itself? After the cancelation, Tarm spoke more at length, saying he was 'disappointed and confused' by the rejection of a piece 'not meant to provoke, but to evoke.' The piece ''s devoted to the victims who have suffered from cruelty and hatred of war, totalitarianism, polarizing nationalism -- in the past and today,' he said in a statement. 'The old joke about how do you get to Carnegie Hall -- you practice. Apparently, you also have to self-censor. I'm disappointed that this work will no longer have the ability to speak for itself,' he said. Tarm, who is studying at the New England Conservatory in Boston, said that the orchestra had been practicing the piece for weeks without any complaints. The controversy has echoes of a furor last year at the Metropolitan Opera which staged John Adams' 'The Death of Klinghoffer,' about the wheelchair-bound Jewish American Leon Klinghoffer who was killed by Palestinian hijackers of a cruise ship in 1985. Protesters rallied outside and several disrupted performances in part because Palestinian characters in the opera make anti-Semitic remarks as Adams tries to set the context for the killing. Ken Jacobson, deputy national director of the Anti-Defamation League, which fights anti-Semitism and racism, said that he could not judge the canceled Carnegie Hall piece without listening to it but urged reflection before banning artwork that cites offensive material. 'I assume that the New York Youth Symphony did what it did out of good motives. But I would also say that in works of art, one has to be thoughtful and careful before one wants to censor,' he told AFP. The orchestra went ahead Sunday with a performance that featured rising violinist Elena Urioste, who performed Beethoven's Violin Concerto and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's 'Scheherazade.'","The New York Youth Symphony was set to premiere Jonas Tarm's orchestral work on Sunday at Carnegie Hall .

"The Bali Nine duo could have their case delayed for months, after The Indonesian Supreme Court has agreed to review the case of a Filipina drug courier scheduled to be shot at the same time. Indonesian courts have consistently said they will execute all 10 drug felons at the same time, while the review is expected to take months. The Supreme Court said a panel of judges would be appointed this week to review the case of Filipina domestic worker Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, a process which can take up to three months, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . The Bali Nine duo (pictured) could have their case delayed for months, after The Indonesian Supreme Court has agreed to review the case of a Filipina drug courier scheduled to be shot at the same time . The pair may be waiting months for their execution as the review of Filipina domestic worker Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso could take up to three months . Veloso was sentenced to death in 2010 for attempting to smuggle 2.6 kilograms of heroin from Malaysia to Yogyakarta. She maintains she was deceived and did not know the drugs were in her luggage. The family of Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte are appealing for his life to be spared on account of him being diagnosed with schizophrenia. Nine of the ten drug felons set to be executed together have now launched legal proceedings. It comes after Attorney-General spokesman Tony Spontana said all ten prisoners would face the firing squad simultaneously. 'We don't want one to have to wait for another's execution before his own.

The pair's lawyers will return to Jakarta court on Thursday to challenge President Widodo's decision to deny clemency to all drug offenders. Their last appeal was adjourned until March 20 as the president's representative did not have the required legal documentation. Two weeks earlier, the Administrative Court dismissed their argument that President Widodo failed to consider their rehabilitation. The claim was rejected on the grounds that the court had no authority to overturn presidential decree. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions.

"A father-of-two who plastered stickers which said 'Halal is barbaric and funds terrorism' on supermarket chicken has insisted he is an animal rights activist and not racist. Liam Edwards, 29, walked into a Sainsbury's store in Salford, Greater Manchester, with the #BanHalal stickers and stuck them on numerous packets of meat in the chilled goods aisle. He was stopped by security and, after police were called, officers searched his home and found cannabis and a letter addressed from the Beer and Bacon Company of Great Britain which made reference to an 'anti-Jihadi frog'. Scroll down for video . Liam Edwards, 29 (pictured outside court, right), walked into a Sainsbury's store in Salford, Greater Manchester, and plastered the #BanHalal stickers on numerous packets of meat in the chilled goods aisle . The sticker which Edwards plastered on the supermarket chicken said: 'Halal is barbaric and funds terrorism.' However, he has insisted he is an animal rights activist and that the incident was not racially-aggravated . Manchester Magistrates' Court heard how there was also reference that he had browsed patriotsagainstIslam.co.uk on his home computer. Edwards, of Salford, admitted criminal damage in relation to the supermarket incident on February 18 and possession of cannabis. However, he denied that he was 'racially motivated' when he carried out the attack on the supermarket chicken and will face trial in July over the charge. It emerged that £16.50 worth of chicken had to be destroyed as a result of his actions. At the court hearing today, it was said that he was simply drawing attention to the 'inhumane' halal methods of animal slaughter, which involves slitting the animal's throat to allow the blood to drain out. Holly Holden, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant has gone to the supermarket and placed stickers on packets of chicken saying 'halal is barbaric and funds terrorism'. The chicken had to be destroyed because the stickers could not be removed. 'He says he wished to draw attention to the inhumane halal methods of animal slaughter and that was his motivation rather than racial prejudice. 'The point about animal cruelty could be expressed in a different way without the suggestion that halal and terrorism are linked.'

He said: 'He uses the word terrorism but that can't denote race or indeed religion.' Bailing him until a further hearing on July 23, District Judge James Hatton added: 'You have pleaded guilty to some matters but not guilty to the racially-aggravated criminal damage. There will have to be a trial.' Judge Hatton told Edwards that the conditions of his bail including not going near the Sainsbury's supermarket in Salford. Halal involves cutting through arteries in the neck . HALAL . Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse. All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law. Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious. NON-HALAL . In comparison, the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed. It means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death, as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn-out pain and suffering. Once the animal has been killed at the abattoir, it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered.

"Former University of Oklahoma fraternity member Levi Pettit publicly apologized this afternoon for leading a racist chant aboard a bus in a leaked video that shocked the nation. Pettit, who grew up in a wealthy  suburb of Dallas, Texas, started his contrition tour with one of his most vocal critics - state Senator Anastasia Pittman. Pittman accepted his apology, but said it's not enough - that he needs to offer contrition to black church leaders and students, as well. 'Some have wondered why I hadn't spoken out publicly. The truth is I have had a mix of pain, shame, sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions,' said Pettit, whose voice quivered slightly as he spoke. 'I did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country until I first came to apologize to those most directly impacted.' Scroll down for video . Mea culpa: Levi Pettit, one of the University of Oklahoma frat boys who led a racist chant on a bus last month, publicly apologized for his actions Wednesday after meeting with a group of black leaders . What he said: The 20-year-old, who has been expelled from OU, said he was 'upset and embarrassed' that he failed to stop the chant. He also claimed he did not know the words he was using were 'wrong' Addressing Senator Pittman directly, the 20-year-old expelled OU student said: 'You're a blessing to me, my mom, and my dad. I can't than you enough for the way you've embraced me and opened my eyes to things I had not seen before.' Pettit then formally apologized for his behavior, which was captured on camera last month, resulting in the disbandment of OU's chapter of the Sigma Epsilon Alpha fraternity. 'Let me start by saying that I am sorry, deeply sorry. I’m so sorry for all the pain that I’ve caused an I want you all to know that directly from me,' Pettit, dressed in a dark suit and red tie, said from a podium, surrounded by black leaders. 'Although I don’t deserve it, I want to ask for your forgiveness. There are no excuses for my behavior.' The young Texan said he never considered himself to be a racist and added that he was 'upset and embarrassed' that he failed to stop the infamous chant on the bus filled with his fraternity brothers. Apology accepted: Senator Pittman (left) said she believes Pettit's apology is genuine and she has forgiven him . Mending fences: Pittman said she admires Pettit for having the courage to reach out to her . 'All the apologies in the world won’t change what I’ve done,' Pettit said off a podium at an Oklahoma City Baptist church. When asked by a reporter whether he was aware in the moment that the words he was chanting were racial slurs, Pettit pleaded ignorance. 'I knew they were wrong, but I never knew how or why they were wrong,' he insisted. 'The people I've met with...have really opened my eyes to the impact of those words. 'The truth is what was said in that chant is disgusting ... and after meeting with these people I've learned these words should never be repeated,' he stated. Pettit answered only a few questions from reporters but declined to say who taught him the chant or where he learned it. Levi Pettit has gone on an apology tour after he was caught singing 'there will never be a n**** SAE' earlier this month . Pittman, D-Oklahoma City, said she believes Pettit's apology is genuine and she has forgiven him. 'I admire his courage of reaching out to me and saying: ""I want to meet with you face to face and apologize to you directly,""' Pittman said. 'I believe he is sincere.' Going forward, student groups at OU are considering inviting Pettit to participate in panel discussions on race relations at the university – but the events would have to take place off-campus or online because he has been barred from stepping foot on OU grounds after having been expelled. It comes as the high-power attorney hired by the now-disbanded Oklahoma chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon says no other members of the fraternity will be expelled over the incident. Thank you all for being here today. Even though I wish with all my heart today’s meeting was not necessary, I am deeply appreciative to the leaders that joined us. Thank you Senator Pittman for inviting me here today - for you are a blessing to me and my mom and dad. I can never thank you enough for the way you have embraced me and opened my eyes to things I had not seen before. Let me start by saying that I am sorry … deeply sorry. I am so sorry for the pain I have caused, and I want all of you to know that directly from me. Although not deserved, I ask for your forgiveness. There are no excuses for my behavior. I never thought of myself as a racist. I never even considered the possibility. But the bottom line is that the words I said in the chant were mean, and hateful… and racist. I will be deeply sorry and deeply ashamed of what I have done for the rest of my life. Some have wondered why I hadn’t spoken out publicly. The truth is I have had a mix of pain, shame, sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions. I did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country until I first came to apologize to those most directly impacted. So I decided it would be best to wait until the student and community leaders I met with today were back from Spring Break. I think the best way to express the truth about who I am and what I feel is to read to you a letter that I sent to President Boren a few days after the bus ride. The words in that letter are all heart-felt words, and I thank President Boren for accepting my apology. Yesterday, I was humbled by the fact that I had a chance to meet face to face with members of the football leadership team. They accepted my apology and together discussed steps we can take to make sure this never happens again. Over the past week or so, I have met with a number of pastors and leaders in the community to seek understanding of the meaning behind the words I spoke on the bus. Meeting with a few people does not change what I did, but it has begun to change me, and my understanding of those hateful words. Without question, my words on that bus were disgusting and these words should never be repeated under any circumstance. I am also upset and embarrassed that I failed to stand up as a leader and stop this chant. I now have a clearer understanding of what lives behind the words. From this point forward, I will be the leader I should have been on the bus and stand up against racism in any form. Now, before I take a couple of your questions, . Let me just say this: . All the apologies in the world won’t change what I have done. So I will spend the rest of my life trying to be a person who heals and brings people of all races together. That is what I hope and pray will come out of this. Oklahoma state Senator Anastasia Pittman, one of the most vocal critics of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, has arranged for Pettit to meet with black community leaders, including students, for him to apologize . Stephen Jones, who defended Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh says he reached a deal in his legal proceedings with the university. The other details of the agreement are not clear. Before Pettit's brief press conference this afternoon, he met behind closed doors with top black politicians, pastors and students. 'I wanted him to be educated on some of the struggles they've endured,' Pittman said. 'I think that will enlighten him and give him a new perspective on a culture that he is completely unaware of.' Pettit's parents outed him as one of the instigators of the song 'there will never be a n***** SAE,' which he was recorded singing gleefully on a bus full of members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Pettit is one of two students expelled from Oklahoma over the video. The SAE fraternity was also kicked off campus and the brothers were evicted from their house by the university. Parker Rice is the other student identified on camera. Among those scheduled to attend the private meeting on Wednesday is Marilyn Luper-Hildreth, the daughter of the late civil rights leader Clara Luper, an Oklahoma City schoolteacher who led sit-ins at segregated Oklahoma City drugstore counters in the late 1950s. Pettit's parents, who live in the Dallas area, issued an apology on his behalf two weeks ago after the video's release caused an uproar on the university's campus in Norman, which is located about 20 miles south of Oklahoma City. A second student from the Dallas area, Parker Rice, also issued a statement apologizing for his role in the chant. OU President David Boren severed ties with the fraternity, ordered its members to vacate the fraternity house and expelled two students for leading the chant. The university also launched an investigation into the role other fraternity members may have had in the chant, and Boren says further disciplinary action is possible. The national Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity also disbanded its OU chapter and announced it is taking steps to become more inclusive, including requiring all of its members nationwide to go through diversity training and setting up a confidential hotline for people to report inappropriate behavior. Boren also planned to meet later Wednesday with student leaders of the university's fraternity and sorority system to discuss race relations and the reaction of students to the incident.","Levi Pettit has apologized to one of his most vocal critics, Oklahoma state Senator Anastasia Pittman .

"A celebrated sea otter who survived a natural oil slick and was tracked by researchers for six years has been killed by a shark. The seven-year-old marine mammal named Olive was found dead by a beachgoer on March 22 near Sunset State Beach in California. Wildlife biologists retrieved a large, serrated tooth fragment from white shark in a wound on the mother-of-three's body, indicating the cause of death.

Cause of death: Wildlife biologists retrieved a large, serrated tooth fragment (above) from white shark in a wound on the mother-of-three's body, indicating the cause of death . Outside of the fatal bite wounds, Olive was reported to be in good health. Olive made headlines in February 2009 when she was found covered in oil and near death on Sunset State Beach in Santa Cruz County. A  rescue team from The Marine Mammal Center was dispatched to retrieve the oiled otter. Her 'thick and tarry' fur was cleaned with a combination of diluted dish soap and olive oil, hence her name. In early April 2009, when her weight was back to normal and vets had given her the all-clear, Olive was deemed ready for release.

In safe hands: Her 'thick and tarry' fur was cleaned with a combination of diluted dish soap and olive oil, hence her name . She was outfitted with a high frequency transmitter and colored flipper tags so she could be identified and monitored after her release. In July 2012 Olive was re-captured for a health examination. Her blood values and physical examination were consistent with other healthy, wild otters, and it was determined that she was pregnant - the first known pregnancy. Before her death, Olive was most recently seen in mid-February resting in kelp near Capitola. Olive had more than 5,000 Facebook followers, in an account set up by wildlife officials. 'Swimming' was listed as her sole personal interest.

Motherly love: Before her death, Olive was most recently seen in mid-February resting in kelp near Capitola - above, pictured with one of her pups at Seacliff State Beach on September 10, 2012 . Hundreds of followers expressed sadness after reading about her passing. A message left by administrators read: 'Although we are extremely saddened by the death of Olive, we are grateful for the opportunity we had to learn from and about her. 'Olive’s success in the wild after being oiled demonstrated the value of washing and rehabilitating oiled wildlife. 'She thrived in the wild and successfully gave birth to and weaned three healthy pups, making a great contribution to the southern sea otter population, which is listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act. 'Olive also served as an ambassador for her species and other wildlife affected by oil.'

"China has seen the first successful flight of a commercial airplane powered by what's probably the country's biggest threat to food safety - waste cooking oil. The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operated by Hainan Airlines, flew around 100 passengers from Shanghai to Beijing. It meant China joined a handful of countries in the world that possess the research and development ability to create its own biofuel production technology, according to the People's Daily Online. Pioneer: Hainan Airlines flew a Boeing 737 like this one using a biofuel made from cooking oil . But the fact that the new fuel was developed from waste cooking oil - which is in all too plentiful supply in China, leading to many problems with blocked drains and sewers - has prompted excitement in the country. Apart from the environmental concerns surrounding the dumping of cooking oil, there is also widespread concern about how much of it ends up on dining tables around the country after unscrupulous dealers remove it from drains and sell it back to retailers. The carrier informed all the passengers before departure that the aircraft would use a new type of fuel. 'The flight was very smooth. I didn't experience anything unusual,' said Pu Ming, Vice President of Hainan Airlines who was also a passenger on the flight. 'I hope the biofuel could be promoted throughout the country.' 'When I was asked on the phone whether or not I would mind flying with a plane using biofuel, I said of course I wouldn't. I'd love to be a lab mouse,' said one passenger named Ms Zhong. 'The successful flight is a landmark and on one hand the low carbon biofuel significantly reduces greenhouse gasses which helps China realise its 2020 carbon dioxide emissions per GDP by 40-50 per cent,' said Lu Dapeng, spokesman of China Sinopec. 'On the other hand, it could help with altering the route of catering waste oil and help stop the danger of it from ending up on the dinner table.' Food safety: The illegal recycling of waste cooking oil is a constant headache for the Chinese authorities . Fly greener: The government is seeking to promote greater environmental sustainability . Produced by Sinopec, China's state-owned oil and gas company, this particular biofuel uses restaurant waste cooking oil, often known as the 'gutter oil' in China, as the raw material. The cooking oil is then blended at a one-to-one ratio with ordinary jet fuel to create the finished product. Animal fat is the reason why waste cooking oil can be turned into biofuel. Sinopec has spent the past five years researching and developing biofuel, according to researcher Xu Hui, who also stated that the price of biofuel is two to three times more expensive than normal aviation fuel due to the cost of the raw material. Apart from animal fat-based biofuel, China is also developing sugar-based and starch-based biofuels, whose prices are expected to be 15-80 per cent of normal aviation fuel. Waste cooking oil is often collected by underground dealers in China. It's then reprocessed in rudimentary means and will return to millions of dining tables. However, many airlines in China are reluctant to use biofuel due to its high cost, reported People's Daily Online.","Hainan Airlines completed China's first commercial flight using biofuel .

"John Bilardi is a shattered man. He has poured his heart out in an interview about his late son, the troubled youth dubbed ""Jihad Jake"", who died in a suicide mission in central Iraq last week. Mr Bilardi tells 60 Minutes that he cannot come to grips with his son's decisions, to run away from their Melbourne home and join Islamic State, a move which ultimately cost him his life, at age 18. 'He was just a shy, lonely young man,' he tells reporter Michael Usher. The teenager is believed to have converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10, shortly after his mother died of cancer. 'Just out of the blue he said, ""I've gone Muslim"",' his father said. 'I can't imagine how he was feeling.' He recounts his son's final message, sent from the ISIS bunker to his father, as he was convinced to take his own life. It was: 'Hi Dad, I am very happy to be here'. Scroll down for videos . 'He was just a shy, lonely young man,' John Bilardi says of his son Jake who joined Islamic State . The photograph of Melbourne teen Jake Bilardi which was first released to show his allegiance to Islamic State . John Bilardi breaks down as he recalls 'a lonely young man' and what drove his teenage son into the arms of terrorists in the Middle East . And Mr Bilardi issued a chilling warning to other parents about the lure of terrorists to defenceless young Australians. 'It's going on, it's real.' His revelations coming, as an Islamic State propaganda website, geared towards celebrating the sacrifice made by the Melbourne teenage jihadi, did anything but glorify the actions of the 18-year-old suicide bomber. The post, titled as the story of Abu Abdullah Al-Austrālī – the name Bilardi adopted after he travelled to Iraq to join IS – gives the teenager some praise as a devout Muslims who prays and fasts often. But the rant describes Bilardi as having ‘a weak body’ and having 'sold his soul for a cheap price', revealing how misguided his decisions were. Bilardi, who fled to the Middle East last year from his Melbourne home, reportedly died after he blew himself up in a suicide mission targeting the Iraqi armed forces at Ramadi in central Iraq last week. Suicide bomber: ISIS leaked a photograph of 18-year-old Australian Jake Bilardi (pictured) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it . John Bilardi talks with Michael Usher on 60 Minutes on Sunday Night, revealing the possible reasons around his son's fateful decision to flee into the arms of Islamic State . The attack was a failure. Iraqi military official, General Tahssin Ibrahim, said no one was killed and just a few vehicles were damaged in Bilardi's suicide mission. The extremist site sought to praise Bilardi but delivers backhanded comments describing his weakness and ultimately the futility of his sacrifice. ‘He started fighting in Baijī against the ISF Rāfidha and was a lion on the battlefield although he was at a young age and with a weak body, he was like a mountain,’ the post, on a tumblr blog site associated with the Islamic extremist group, said. It goes on to say that Bilardi volunteered for a 'martyrdom operation' - code words for a suicide bombing - and that he was eager to carry out the mission. Earlier social media posts suggested Bilardi had wanted to take part in a suicide bombing in Baiji in Iraq, but that he pulled out of this mission because he got cold feet. Instead he fought in the city before again signing up for martrydom and being sent to Ramadi in Iraq. The post said Bilardi was 'full of happiness as he was finally going to meet his Lord and receive the great rewards promised by Him.' But it goes on to mock his sacrifice. 'This brother originated from an atheist family & ended up selling his soul to Allah for a cheap price,' the post says. Jake Bilardi (pictured, left) in a school photo from Year 10 - the year he converted to Islam according to school friends, and another image of him wearing a Chelsea Football Club shirt (pictured right) An image of Bilardi sitting in front of an Islamic State flag was posted to Twitter, ahead of his suicide mission in Iraq, which authorities labelled 'a failure' The post said that during his time in Ramadi, Bilardi was very devout 'known for his worship of Allah' and would fast every other day. It said Bilardi accepted Islam three years ago ‘even though his parents basically went to war with him at home tried to stop him from reverting’. 'Happy-slapped': Jake Bilardi was bullied while at high school in Craigieburn Secondary College in Melbourne's north, and video emerged of the incident ahead of his suicide mission for Islamic State . The bullying tactic sees a group of people slap their victim and film it on a camera phone before uploading it on-line in order to humiliate them. Here Jake Bilardi is 'happy slapped' while at school . The former Craigieburn Secondary College student, converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10. A video later surfaced from his school days which shows Bilardi being 'happy slapped' - a bullying tactic which sees a group of people slap their victim, film it and upload it on-line to humiliate them. In December, Bilardi reached Ramadi, a city located in central Iraq, and said he 'made hijra (or departed)’ in August. He was considered a well-educated maths genius, who dreamed of one day becoming a political journalist and even founded a children’s soccer charity but by the time he’d reached his 18th birthday Jake Bilardi’s mind had been warped. If you believe his tale of events - detailed in an articulate blog called From Melbourne to Ramadi: My Journey - Bilardi joined Islamic State fighters in Iraq after years of historical research and a final realisation that 'I was growing tired of the corruption and filthiness of Australian society and yearned to live under the Islamic State with the Muslims'. However, the picture Bilardi paints of himself – a scholar and a rational thinker – is very different to the lonely outcast that his former classmates at Craigieburn Secondary College have described. ‘At school he was a ""loner"". He only really had two or three friends from memory but they weren't the type of friends that if he was in need of some help were good at helping,’ a former classmate told Daily Mail Australia. ‘He was obviously a kid that needed some help or guidance and he thought converting to Muslim was right for him,’ they opined. Another classmate, after hearing that Bilardi may be dead, described him as not 'capable of punching his way out of a wet paper bag. He was fragile'. 'The kid (was) angry at the world and wants to take it out on innocent people.'","John Bilardi reveals on 60 Minutes how and when he learned of his 18-year-old son's defection to Islamic State .

"Ross Vodden was spared prison after he was convicted of racially aggravated behaviour after he shouted racist insults at a police officer who confronted him for kissing a stranger in the street . The widower of the woman who inspired the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds has avoided jail after he launched into a racist rant at a police officer. Ross Vodden, 53, kissed a woman who he did not know in the street, and then swore at a policeman, calling him ‘n*****’ and ‘black c***' when the officer confronted him about the incident, Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told. Vodden was convicted of racially aggravated behaviour after a trial last month. He was married to Lucy Vodden, who died in 2009 after a battle with lupus. As a child Mrs Vodden is said to have been the inspiration behind Beatles song 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds', having been friends with John Lennon's son Julian at school. The hit song had been rumoured to be about LSD, but Lennon insisted the song was inspired by a picture of Lucy, drawn by his young son. The court heard that on 14 September 2014 Vodden had caused alarm after he planted a kiss on a stranger in Brook Street, Westminster. Malachy Packenham, prosecuting, said: ‘Police were made aware that the woman had been kissed on the lips by another member of the public as he passed her on the street. ‘An officer went to speak to the male, who immediately became aggressive and confrontational.’ In his rage Vodden called the police officer a ‘f***ing black c***,’ a ‘n*****,’ and a ‘black b******’, as around 20 people stood nearby. Following his conviction Vodden, who appeared at court today wearing a black bomber jacket emblazoned with colourful symbols and multi-coloured leg warmers, was handed a suspended prison sentence for the incident. District Judge Richard Blake warned he would be sent to prison if convicted of another outburst. ‘You have clearly got a lot of issues so bear in mind when things happen there are two ways of dealing with it - turn away and smile or get involved,' said the judge. ‘You have got to come to terms with the gravity of this case and the consequences if it happens again. ‘If there is a repeat of this behaviour, when you are particularly unpleasant, racially abusing people, you will go to prison.’ Vodden (left) was married to Lucy Vodden (right), who died after battling lupus. Mrs Vodden had previously gone to school with John Lennon's son Julian and is believed to have inspired Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds . The Beatles are pictured in 1967 when their Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album was released . Vodden had previously told the judge he thought the case was 'nonsense.' He added: ‘You must consider it real but it happens all the time.’ The court heard Vodden is now living off benefits and is on a waiting list for social housing. He said he is willing to engage with mental health services. He was given a 12 week prison sentence suspended for a year, ordered to pay £120 court costs and an £80 victim surcharge. Lucy Vodden, who was Lucy O'Donnell before her marriage, went to nursery school in Surrey with Julian Lennon, the son of John Lennon, and the pair became friends. When he was four Julian came home from school with a picture, which he showed to his father. He described his drawing as 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds.' At the time Lennon was gathering material for the album, Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, released in 1967. Critics often claimed they believed Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was a reference to LSD but Lennon denied the claim. The song was initially banned by the BBC because of its supposed reference to the drug. Mrs Vodden died of lupus, an autoimmune disease which causes the body to attack its own cells, in 2009. Six months before he death Julian Lennon was made aware of her disease and got back in touch with her. Julian Lennon drew this picture in the 1960s and told his father it was 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds'","Ross Vodden kissed an unknown woman in the street, who told police .

"The woman who stabbed Dr Martin Luther King Jr during a 1958 book signing has died, aged 98. Izola Ware Curry, who stabbed the civil rights leader in the chest with a seven-inch letter opener, died at a Queens, New York, nursing home where she moved several years ago. She died on Saturday March 7, according to The Smoking Gun. Izola Ware Curry, (right in 1958) 98, died on March 7, more than 56 years after she attempted to kill Dr Martin Luther King Jr with a letter opener at a Harlem book signing . Curry attacked the civil rights leader because she had delusions that he and the NAACP were watching her and preventing her from holding a job . Curry was originally sent to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and spent many years living anonymously despite the 1958 attack at Blumstein's Department Store in Harlem. She was also carrying a loaded pistol in her bra at the time. Dr King survived the incident at Blumstein's Department Store, where he was signing his first book Stride Toward Freedom, by fractions of an inch. The knife came close to puncturing his aorta and he could have died at the store if bystanders had taken the weapon out of his chest before his three-hour surgery. He referred to the incident in his I've Been To The Mountaintop speech, the last remarks he gave before his assassination on April 4, 1968 by James Earl Ray. The Nobel Peace Prize winner said that if he had sneezed then he would have died after being stabbed by the 'demented black woman'. Curry, who believed that the NAACP and Dr King had been watching her and preventing her from getting employment, was originally sent to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Dr King had been signing his first book, Stride Toward Freedom, when Curry approached and stabbed him. The attacker was also carrying a loaded pistol in her bra . She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and had an estimated IQ of 70. Dr King, who would accomplish some of his life's greatest work in the next ten years, said he bore her no ill will after the attack. He said that the incident 'demonstrates that a climate of hatred and bitterness so permeates our nation that inevitably deeds of extreme violence must erupt'. Born in Georgia in 1916, she moved between Georgia, Florida, St. Louis, and New York and worked as a housekeeper, factory worker and cook. However, her mentally illness made it difficult for her to keep a job. She remained in state custody at mental health institutions and the 'family care' program in peoples homes. He delusions and imagined voices were reportedly gone by 1980. Long presumed to be deceased during her years of anonymity, a record for voter registration in 2012 led a Smoking Gun reporter to find her last year. Curry is not believed to have surviving family members.

"Angela Patram, 37, gave birth to her fifth child last month and just minutes later, she became a grandmother too. The Florida mother and her 20-year-old daughter Teranisha Billups gave birth on the same day last month, in the same hospital where Patram also works as a nurse. 'We knew our due dates were around the same time, but we never expected that it would happen on the same day,' Patram told People magazine. 'I'm kinda shocked that it played out how it did,' Billups told WTSP. What are the odds? Angela Patram, left, gave birth to daughter Raya, in pink, on the same day that her 20-year-old daughter Teranisha Billups, right, gave birth to son Jerry Michaud Jr, in blue, last month in Tampa. Pictured above with Dr Atef Zakhary, who delivered both babies . Patram was the first to give birth on February 19 at Tampa General Hospital, welcoming daughter Rayna into the world at 6:29pm. Older daughter Billups had been in labor since the day before, but she didn't give birth to son Jerry Michaud Jr until 34 minutes after Patram. Dr Atef Zakhary delivered both babies, as well as two of Patram's older children, and described it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 'I've been in this field for 29 years ... I've seen maybe 14,000 deliveries,' Dr. Zakhary said in a statement on the hospital's website. 'I've never seen a mom and daughter deliver on the same day. And this is as close as you could get.' While Patram is sad she couldn't be with her daughter for the delivery, and be the first to see her new grandson, the mother daughter duo took pictures shortly after they were both rested from delivery. Double the fun: Patram says they knew their due dates were close, but never imagined giving birth on the same day. Pictured above with Angela's son CJ, center . Extraordinary: Dr Zakhary says he's never seen a mother and daughter give birth on the same day in his 29 years delivering babies . With them to mark the occasion was the Patram's other children Angelique, 14; Alicia, 13; and CJ, 4. Billups partner Jerry Michaud Sr and baby Rayna's father were also in attendance on the happy occasion. Patram's mother was frantically running between rooms to make sure both her daughter and granddaughter were supported through the birth. One month after delivery, both babies are doing well and living at Patram's home in Gibsonton, Florida. 'When we sit both babies next to each other, they just look at each other really closely,' Billups said. ""It's weird seeing two babies of the same size in the house."" Billups and Michaud are currently living with her mother while they search for a home of their own nearby. Billups studies biology at Florida A&M University, but plans to transfer to a college closer to home.","Angela Patram, 37, gave birth to her fifth child on February 19 .

"A thousand year-old potion made out of onions, garlic, wine and bile from a cow's stomach can kill hospital superbugs, scientists claim. The potent 10th century brew - used by Anglo Saxons to treat a stye (an abscess on the eyelid) destroyed 90 per cent of the bacteria on scraps of skin taken from mice with MRSA. Interestingly, the ingredients had little effect unless they were all brought together into the concoction, the study by Nottingham University researchers found. The garlic-based 'potion', listed in a thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon manuscript, has been found to kill off the MRSA superbug . Nottingham University microbiologists Dr Freya Harrison and Dr Steve Diggle with the garlic-based 'potion' The ancient remedy, called Bald's eyesalve, originates from a manuscript in Bald's Leechbook - an Old English leatherbound volume in the British Library. The Leechbook is widely thought of as one of the earliest known medical textbooks and contains Anglo-Saxon medical advice and recipes for medicines, salves and treatments. After using the solution on lab animals with MRSA - one of the most antibiotic-resistant bugs costing modern health services billions - the researchers described their results as 'astonishing.' Associate Professor Dr Christina Lee, of the University of Nottingham, said: 'Medieval leech books and herbaria contain many remedies designed to treat what are clearly bacterial infections - weeping wounds and sores, eye and throat infections, skin conditions such as the erysipelas rash, leprosy and chest infections. A strain of the hospital superbug MRSA can be carried by pets and livestock, say scientists who have found evidence the infection can pass from animals to humans. Researchers at Cambridge University have found two separate cases where people were infected with the strain of infection, and livestock were found to be the cause. And genetic tests show cats and dogs have the same strain of the bacterium as people. It means MRSA could spread between animals at veterinary clinics in a similar way to hospital infections. But scientists at the university moved to reassure pet owners, adding there is very little risk of them falling ill as a result of an infection passed from their pets. It comes after cats passed TB to humans for the first time in an outbreak in Newbury, Berkshire last year, feared to have been caused by badgers. Two people from the same household were treated for bovine tuberculosis after they caught the disease from their kitten. 'Given these remedies were developed well before the modern understanding of germ theory, this poses two questions. 'How systematic was the development of these remedies and how effective were these remedies against the likely causative species of bacteria? 'Answering these questions will greatly improve our understanding of medieval scholarship and medical empiricism and may reveal new ways of treating serious bacterial infections that continue to cause illness and death.' The Anglo Saxon expert came up with the idea of trying out the recipe. It describes a very specific method of making the solution, including the use of a brass vessel to brew it in, a strainer to purify it and an instruction to leave the mixture for nine days before use. She enlisted the help of microbiologists who believe the potion's bacteria-killing effect is not due to a single ingredient but the combination used, brewing methods and container material. Further research is planned to investigate how and why this works. Dr Lee said: 'We were genuinely astonished at the results of our experiments in the lab. 'We believe modern research into disease can benefit from past responses and knowledge which is largely contained in non-scientific writings. 'But the potential of these texts to contribute to addressing the challenges cannot be understood without the combined expertise of both the arts and science.' The garlic family of plants make chemicals than interfere with bacteria's ability to damage infected tissues. But researchers found all the ingredients together created the best result . The scientists made four separate batches of the remedy using fresh ingredients each time as well as a control treatment using the same quantity of distilled water and brass sheet to mimic the brewing container but without the vegetable compounds. The remedy was tested on cultures of the commonly found - and hard to treat - bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in both synthetic wounds and in infected wounds in mice. None of the individual ingredients alone had any measurable effect, but when combined according to the recipe, the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) populations of bacteria, were almost totally obliterated. Only about one bacterial cell in a thousand survived. Microbiologist Dr Freya Harrison, also of the University of Nottingham, said: 'We thought Bald's eyesalve might show a small amount of antibiotic activity because each of the ingredients has been shown by other researchers to have some effect on bacteria in the lab. Copper and bile salts can kill bacteria and the garlic family of plants make chemicals that interfere with the bacteria's ability to damage infected tissues. 'But we were absolutely blown away by just how effective the combination of ingredients was. 'We tested it in difficult conditions too; we let our artificial ""infections"" grow into dense, mature populations called ""biofilms"", where the individual cells bunch together and make a sticky coating that makes it hard for antibiotics to reach them. 'But unlike many modern antibiotics, Bald's eye salve has the power to breach these defences.' The findings were presented at the Annual Conference of the Society for General Microbiology in Birmingham.","Bald's eyesalve is a 10th century brew used by Anglo Saxons to treat styes .
Scientists found it killed 90% of bacteria on scraps of MRSA-infected skin .

"An Arizona mother kept her daughter locked in a closet, starved and beat her for years until eventually she killed the little girl, stuffed her body into a suitcase and threw it in the trash, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday as the woman’s trial got under way. Jerice Hunter, 41, is facing murder charges in the death of 5-year-old Jhessye Shockley, who went missing in 2011 from her family’s suburban Phoenix home. Authorities believe the child is no longer alive. Her remains were never found. On trial: Jerice Hunter (pictured left in court Wednesday), 41, is facing murder charges in the death of 5-year-old Jhessye Shockley (right), who went missing in 2011 . Bad parenting: Hunter is accused of keeping her daughter in a bedroom closet at the family's apartment in Glendale, Arizona, depriving her of food and water, and beating her . Harsh: Prosecutor Jeannette Gallagher told jurors Hunter threw her 5-year-old away 'like trash' ‘The defendant threw her away like trash,’ prosecutor Jeannette Gallagher told the jury in her opening statement. 'All that is left of Jhessye is her blood on the carper in her mother's closet.' Hunter has maintained her innocence. She reported Jhessye missing in October 2011. Police say the mother told them she left Jhessye with the girl's older siblings while she ran errands, and returned to the family's Glendale apartment to find the child gone. About 100 police officers who fanned across Hunter's neighborhood knocked on doors and stopped motorists to see if they knew anything about the disappearance. An Amber alert was issued. A 96-day search of a landfill ended without finding Jhessye's remains. Authorities say Hunter was arrested after inconsistencies with her account were mounting and after witnesses came forward. Hunter also came under scrutiny during the investigation for an October 2005 arrest with her then-husband on child abuse charges in California. In that case, the mother pleaded no contest to corporal punishment and served about four years in prison before she was released on parole in May 2010. Her oldest child, then 14, told police his mother routinely beat the children. Criminal record: Hunter (left) was arrested in October 2005 with then-husband, George Shockley, (right) for child abuse . Recovery mission: 280 officers sifted through more than 9,500 tons of trash from early February to late June at a Phoenix land-fill site, but Jhessye's remains were never found . Hunter looked squarely at jurors as the prosecutor laid out her case. She didn't kill Jhessye and believes her daughter is alive, said Hunter's attorney, Candice Shoemaker. ‘There is no body. There is no proof she is dead,’ said Shoemaker, who offered no alternative theory on what became of the child. Shoemaker said two people saw Jhessye at her apartment complex within hours of the report of her being missing. The defense attorney also told jurors to take a hard look at the upcoming testimony of Jhessye's older sister, who is now 17. The teen didn't allege abuse when she first spoke to police, Shoemaker said. The sister was in charge of Jhessye when she disappeared and changed her account because of guilt, the attorney said. While in foster care after Jhessye's disappearance, the oldest daughter was isolated from her siblings and ‘started to internalize those feelings,’ Shoemaker said. The prosecutor said it's unknown whether Jhessye died from malnutrition, dehydration or injuries she suffered. ‘The answer to that question will never be known,’ Gallagher said. In the weeks before the child was reported missing, Hunter explained her daughter's 19-day absence from school by saying she had pinkeye and ringworm, Gallagher said. Hunter's attorney said his client didn't kill Jhessye (left and right) and believes her daughter is alive . The mother also provided inconsistent details to the girl's school on efforts to get her medical treatment, Gallagher said. Authorities say Hunter instructed her other children to falsely tell police that Jhessye left the apartment while the mother went to a check-cashing business. The older sister later revealed she witnessed her mother's abuse of Jhessye, the prosecutor said. The teen said she found the younger girl beaten up and told authorities the closet where Jhessye was held smelled like death, Gallagher said. The prosecutor said Hunter got a neighbor to drive her to a Tempe apartment where Hunter said she was going to sell a suitcase full of clothes and shoes. Once they arrived, Hunter told her neighbor that the buyer wasn't there and that the items for sale could be left in a trash bin, Gallagher said. The neighbor saw Hunter put on plastic gloves before she removed a suitcase from the vehicle's trunk and dropped it in the trash, she said. Authorities believe the suitcase contained the child's remains. The trial is expected to conclude in early May.","Jerice Hunter, 41, is facing murder charges in the death of 5-year-old Jhessye Shockley, who went missing in 2011 .

"Supermarket chain Asda has apologised to an expecting mother who it slapped with a parking ticket for ‘wrongly’ using a parent and child bay while nine months pregnant. Asma Mohiuddin was hit with the £70 ticket just nine days before she was due. She parked in the mother and toddler bay close to the doors of a busy supermarket, because she was struggling to walk. Asma, 33, and husband Nadeem Mohiuddin were horrified when they returned to their car to find the ticket at the Beckton branch in East London. Asma Mohiuddin, 33, and husband Nadeem Mohiuddin were horrified to find the ticket at the Asda in East London. She parked in the mother and toddler bay, close to the entrance because she was struggling to walk . The pair tried to appeal the decision, but they were turned down and almost forced to stump up the cash before a last-minute reprieve from Asda cancelled the ticket. The pair, from Manor Park, east London, welcomed their third child Aiza into the world just 14 days after the February 23 incident. Angry Nadeem, a local authority community warden, said: “I was unaware that a woman who is nine months pregnant could be deemed not to be accompanied by a child. “Considering it’s a free car park, this is crazy - we were quite clearly within our rights to use that space. “This is a moral outrage and an infringement of my wife’s human rights.” The pair tried to appeal the decision, but they were turned down and almost forced to stump up the cash before a last-minute reprieve from Asda cancelled the ticket. Stay-at-home mum Asma said: “It’s mind-boggling that we would get this ticket. An Asda Spokesman apologised to Mr and Mrs Mohiuddin for any inconvenience caused saying the supermarket hoped to speak to them very soon to resolve this matter . “I was quite clearly carrying a child with me - whether she was under my arm or in my womb, it’s not up to Asda to make an arbitrary distinction.” The pair have two older children, seven-year-old Alayna and three-year-old Haiqa. He added: “It has always been a moral courtesy and tradition in our nation to make exceptions for expectant mothers. “On public transport designated seats are provided for the disabled, expectant mothers, and parents with children - there was never a distinction between the three. “Supermarkets and retail parks are using technicalities to target expectant mothers who are just shopping - it’s expensive enough getting ready to bring a child into the world without first getting stung with unnecessary and petty charges. “I strongly believe this is a national disgrace.” An Asda Spokesman said: “We would like to apologise to Mr and Mrs Mohiuddin for any inconvenience caused and we hope to speak to them very soon to resolve this matter.""

"An Australian Muslim woman has spoken out about the trauma she is experiencing as the victim of an international hate campaign led by US white supremacists. However, the victim Mariam Veiszadeh says strangers showing their support worldwide with a viral hashtag campaign, #IStandWithMairam, continually drive her and help her to stay strong. The lawyer became the target of cyber bullies in October when she tweeted her disapproval when Woolworths were exposed for selling a singlet with a racist slogan. A photo of the shirt bearing the Australian flag and the catchphrase 'if you don't love it, leave' was taken at a supermarket in Cairns in far north Queensland. 'I am outraged that #WOOLWORTHS are allegedly selling these bigoted singlets at their Cairns stores,' she wrote. Scroll down for video . When Mariam Veiszadeh (pictured) became the victim of an international hate campaign, people rallied around her by sending messages of support with the hashtag #IStandWithMariam . Ms Veiszadeh was simply one of thousands of people to send a message disapproving on the singlet, pictured on sale at a Cairns supermarket, which read 'If you don't love it, leave' with the Australian flag . Terrifying images, such as the picture above, were photoshopped to make threatening messages to Veiszadeh . It resulted in online backlash against Woolworths and made national headlines. Ms Veiszadeh joined in with many other Australians to speak out against the supermarket giant for their decision to sell such an offensive item. 'The sentiments that I expressed that day on Twitter were expressed by thousands of other people, but it seemed that people took offence to what I said,' Ms Veiszadeh told Lateline. The dedicated advocate for the Muslim community received a barrage of disgusting, abusive messages in response. 'You muslim wh**e. Nobody invited you to Australia. Leave now before we behead your mother and bury you with the pigs,' wrote one vile troll. 'Go back to Afghanistan, you vile sandn***er w***e. 'Your filthy subhuman kind is not welcome in Australia.' Ms Veiszadeh was sent a barrage of abuse, even though many people including Karl Stefanovic spoke out on the topic and thousands made the same comments as the young Australian . A young Queensland woman will face court this week, accused of charging vile messages to Ms Veiszadeh online to 'harass and menace and intimidate' Ms Veiszadeh has sworn that when people try to intimidate her it will only steel her resolve and determination . Alarmingly although five months have passed since her original tweet the hateful messages she is receiving is intensifying. It comes as Ms Veiszadeh has become the target of a hate campaign by US white supremacists. A US Neo-Nazi website wrote a hate piece about her on February 20, calling for people to 'flood this towel head subhuman vermin with as much racial and religious abuse as we possibly can.' 'Stormer troll army, you know what needs to be done,' they wrote online. 'Be as vulgar, hateful, hurtful, extreme and offensive as possible.' Images have been photoshopped to show Ms Veiszadeh in disturbing and humiliating situations. 'They published an incredibly vile article devoting a great deal of attention to me, urging their 5,000 followers to send me as many hateful, religiously motivated offensive tweets as possible,' Ms Veiszadeh told Lateline. 'Their stated objective is to silence me and get me off Twitter. A US Neo-Nazi website wrote a hate piece about Ms Veiszadeh on February 20, calling for people to 'flood this towel head subhuman vermin with as much racial and religious abuse as we possibly can' After launching the Islamophobia Incident Register to help report anti-Muslim behaviour in Australia, the 30-year-old had unfortunately already become accustomed to constantly receiving vile abuse online. However, nothing could prepare her for what was to come. She is now receiving sickening death threats daily, which she admits is having a detrimental impact on her wellbeing. 'The months of ongoing cyber bullying has definitely taken a personal toll and I'd be lying if I suggested that it hadn't,' she said. 'It has affected my physical and mental health, but in saying that it's also made me more determined than ever to continue to fight against it because their stated objective is to silence me and my stated objective is to do the opposite.' On March 7, National Women's Day, she used Twitter to write a brave, honest message, sharing her recent struggle and imploring people to seek help to help and change their lives for the better. 'About a month ago I suffered from prolonged anxiety which manifested itself in several physical illnesses and lasted about six weeks. 'It had a disabling effect on my life... Thanks to the support of family and friends, I managed to overcome it but it has left its scars. When people became aware of the abuse Ms Veiszadeh was being subjected to, they began to send messages of support using the hashtag #IStandWithMariam, to signify that they are in solidarity with the young woman and her fight against injustice. Ms Veiszadeh bravely opened up about her struggle with anxiety after she received so many abusive messages online from anonymous trolls . When people became aware of the abuse Ms Veiszadeh was being subjected to, they began to send messages of support using the hashtag #IStandWithMariam . The messages aim to show the young woman that there are so many people in solidarity with her worldwide . Ms Vieszadeh moved to Australia when she was seven years old from Afghanistan. She was born during the Soviet War and granted asylum under the Special Humanitarian Program . 'The support has been absolutely overwhelming. The outpouring of support and love that has come my way as a result has been extremely heartwarming.' The hashtag was started by her friend Ruth Hazleton but Ms Veiszadeh is receiving messages from all over the world. 'Keep fighting with class and dignity! #IStandWithMariam. Sending you positive energy from the Phillipines!' wrote Darwin Chiong. 'All the way from U S of A. You go girl #IStandWithMariam,' tweeted Hana Khan. 'London, England is with you Mariam,' wrote Yusuf Akram. Others praised her for being such an inspiration with her courage and determination to make positive change. ‘You are so brave and an inspiration to all of us who have faced bullying,’ said Ella Simson. ';In awe and inspired that @MariamVeiszadeh will not be silenced by abhorrent racism & misogyny experienced online #IStandWithMariam,' said Serina McDuff. Ms Veiszadeh promises to continue to work hard to fight for the rights and improve the quality of life of Muslims in Australia, regardless of the abuse she receives. She was the driving force between the beautiful yet powerful campaign #WISH, which saw Christians, Buddhists, Muslims and atheists alike taking selfies in hijabs in a bid to shun Islamophobia and show their support for Muslim women. The hashtag was started by her friend Ruth Hazleton but Ms Veiszadeh is receiving messages from all over the world . Others praised her for being such an inspiration with her courage and determination to make positive change. Some however did choose to send her hateful messages (bottom) using the hashtag . Channel 10's Jessica Rowe and Nova host Meshel Laurie are amongst thousands of supporters of the Women in Solidarity with Hijabs (WISH) campaign. She will also work with police to crack down on the cowardly trolls who send hundreds of vile messages online anonymously, assuming there will be no consequences. An Ipswich woman has already been charged for allegedly sending strings of abusive online messages in a vicious, ongoing attack against Ms Veiszadeh. Police are alleging the 22-year-old woman from Collingwood Park used social media to attack the human rights activist who fled Afghanistan when she was a child. The attacks allegedly began after the tweet regarding the offending Woolworths shirt. The Ipswich woman is accused of calling Ms Veiszadeh a rag-head, and telling her to return to her 'sand dune country'. An Ipswich woman has already been charged for allegedly sending strings of abusive messages in an attack against Ms Veiszadeh. Around 20-30 Facebook messages were sent during the attack . From there the threatening, insulting messages allegedly escalated in frequency and severity. Police have confirmed the woman has been charged with one count of using a carriage service to menace, harrass or cause offence. As for the offending shirt which started the ordeal, it has been removed from stores. The Australian retailer responsible claimed that it was  an extremely unfortunate accident and the shirt had never been intended to be sold in their stores. 'It has come to our attention that two Woolworths stores were inadvertantly stocking a singlet that we consider totally unacceptable,' a company spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. 'The singlet was not one we ordered. It was delivered to us in error and should never been allowed on our shelves. We will review our processes to ensure this sort of error cannot happen again.' 'As soon as we were made aware we immediately withdrew the product from our shelves.' The Woolworths spokesman said the singlet's sentiments did not reflect the company's views.","Mariam Veiszadeh is a lawyer and advocate for fellow Muslims in Australia .

Mechanic David Evans (pictured with the nuts seized from the Honda) said he had 'never seen anything like it' Mechanics at DPE Autosport in Poole Keynes, near Kemble, in the Cotswolds, were left baffled as to the cause of the problem until they removed the cover to the air filter and found the nuts. David Evans, who owns the garage, said he ran a complete set of tests before making the discovery. He said: 'It was rammed solid with nuts. I've been doing this job for 18 years and I've never seen anything like it. I couldn't believe it'. He, along with colleague Helen Plaister, spent an hour sucking the nuts out of the air filter with a vacuum cleaner and collected enough to fill half of a supermarket carrier bag. Mr Evans added: 'I can't be certain, it could have been a mouse, but I think it was more likely a squirrel. 'The owner was as shocked as we were. She'd been leaving nuts on a bird table in the back garden, and somebody had been helping himself to them. 'He'd been getting into the garage, where she parked the car, and had been climbing right inside the engine bay and squeezing himself into the air filter.

"Seven people were killed when a military helicopter that was rescuing a desperately sick baby crashed in Serbia. Official said that the helicopter was evacuating a five-day old child with life-threatening respiratory problems from the south of the country when it crashed near Belgrade. The helicopter had been sent to save the new-born after the ambulance transporting the baby to an emergency hospital in Belgrade got stuck by a landslide blocking the road. Crash: The helicopter was trying to make an emergency landing after allegedly running out of fuel when it crashed and killed all seven on board . The military said all contact with the aircraft was lost at 10.30pm on Friday after it apparently tried to make an emergency landing while running out of fuel near the airport. Serbia's state TV said the Russian-made MI-17 transport helicopter had four crew members and two medical workers on board as well as the sick child. The defence ministry said no-one survived the crash that happened late on Friday night near Belgrade's international airport, approximately 18 miles west of the capital. The crash occurred in dense foggy weather, which had caused several commercial flights to be rerouted to other destinations. Floodlights at two of Belgrade's biggest soccer stadiums were lit to help the pilots to find a spot to land. Serbia's Defence Minister Bratislav Gasic said the helicopter was the only one in the army with advanced medevac equipment and described the dead pilots as two of 'the best' the army had. Tragedy: The crash occurred in dense foggy weather, which had caused several commercial flights to be rerouted to other destinations . According to military officials, the pilot was among the most experienced in the Serbian army, with more than 4,000 hours of flight. Helicopter unit commander Predrag Bandic said: 'The weather conditions were complex but nothing that such an experienced crew in a helicopter equipped as this one could not handle. 'The crew was the best that the Serbian army had to offer for this task, (and) the helicopter was fully functional before taking off.' Aleksandar Vucic, the country's Prime Minister, called for a day of mourning and offered condolences to the families of the victims. Soldiers were today seen guarding the site on the outskirts of Belgrade.","Helicopter crashes close to capital Belgrade, killing everyone on board .

"Forget vivid shades and garish colours, the latest eyeshadow craze is to go nude — earthy and pink tones that mimic the natural colour of our eyelids. They make eyes look bigger and flatter older skin as they don’t crease or highlight wrinkles. The Duchess of Cambridge is a fan — last week she revealed her favourite eye make-up is Urban Decay’s Naked Palette. Here, Alice Smellie puts the latest nude eyeshadows to the test ... KATE’S MAKE-UP . Naked Palette, Urban Decay, £38, urbandecay.co.uk . SHADES OF NUDE: Twelve rich shades from deep cream to charcoal are presented in a fabric case with a mirror. They are applied with a double-ended, scarily large brush. APPLICATION: The cream looks startlingly white on my eyelids, but the bronze shades are easy to blend. Though thick, both ends of the brush are delicate enough to apply to my lids without dropping product onto my face. The thinner of the two ends draws a thick, dark line above and below my lashes. I look in the mirror and my eyes are smoky enough to hang out in a jazz club, but not overly gothic, and it lasts through a dog walk with a sprinkling of sleet, which is impressive. 9/10 . METALLIC MAGIC . La Palette Nude Rose, L’Oreal, £14.99, boots.com . SHADES OF NUDE: A slender compact with ten shades, from beige through rosy tints to a dark purple. Six have a subtle metallic sparkle. APPLICATION: You can’t go wrong with these! The shades are sheer so you don’t need a steady hand to apply it and can layer them on confidently. The darker shades look menacingly gloomy in the compact, yet they are so sheer on the skin that I end up using a dark brown rather than a bronze. The final look is age-appropriate for me in my early 40s, and it is light enough to wear in the day. When I catch sight of myself in changing room mirrors while out shopping, I look ten times less tired than usual. 8/10 . NEUTRAL TONES . Mini Eye Palette, No 7, £11, boots.com . SHADES OF NUDE: Eight Farrow & Ball-style shades: a deep cream, four similar-looking browns and three shades of grey. Application is via a double-ended brush. APPLICATION: The lightest shade looks mask-white on my eyelid. A lot of powder comes away as I swirl the brush over the eyeshadow. I find the brush too thick to apply a line along my lashes and it gives me a bruised look under the eyes. The result is messy. 4/10 . EYESHADOW PRO . Full Exposure Palette, Smashbox, £37, smashbox.co.uk . SHADES OF NUDE: There are 14 daunting looking colours with a double-ended blending brush. APPLICATION: I am amazed at how easily the brush swoops over my eyelids. I play around with three shades of bronze. But then I get over-confident: I attempt to draw a line with the charcoal and end up looking as though I’ve been up a chimney. 6/10 . PORTABLE TOUCH-UP . Eyes Uncovered Nude Palette, Collection, £3.99, superdrug.com . SHADES OF NUDE: The budget option: the case is cardboard with no mirror. The applicator is double-ended, but consists of just two flimsy- feeling foam pads. There are six matte colours, ranging from nude to charcoal. APPLICATION: As I smear the brush around the powder, I gouge a chunk out of the charcoal. The powder sinks into my wrinkles. It looks as though my six-year-old applied my make-up. Not for me. 3/10 .","The latest craze is said to make your eyes look bigger and flatter old skin .

"Her feisty passion helped make Poldark one of the biggest TV phenomena of the 1970s, changing the face of period drama for ever and making sex symbols of its stars. But while the beautiful and headstrong leading lady Demelza won over millions of fans, one man was furious with the depiction: Poldark's original creator Winston Graham. The author was 'livid' with the way the BBC portrayed the impulsive servant from his series of historical novels as promiscuous, and wanted the show pulled from the screens. Anthony Robin Ellis as Captain Ross Poldark and Angharad Rees as Demelza in one of the biggest TV phenomena of the 1970s, Poldark . Demelza was memorably played by flame-haired Angharad Rees. Graham's daughter Rosamund Barteau made the revelation to The Mail on Sunday, as a much-anticipated remake starts tonight. 'Father blew a gasket when he saw the first episode of the original series,' she says. 'He was so angry about the way they had changed Demelza into a floozy that he wanted to get the production halted. 'He was absolutely livid. In the novel she was a spirited tomboy, but the producers had some salacious need to make her sexually loose. Poldark's original creator Winston Graham  was furious with the depiction of character Demelza, pictured is the author's wife Jean Graham . 'In one scene she even offered to pull down her knickers for a shilling. That certainly was not in the books. 'Father, fearing the other episodes would be more like a bad romance novel, tried everything he could to stop the show from airing. But he did not have any editorial control. 'It was not until the second series that he was able to have any input.' But Graham came to embrace the show, which was a runaway success on both sides of the Atlantic. Rosamund – who now lives in Idaho after marrying an American – cannot remember a time when Poldark was not a part of her life. 'As a child I knew it was important not to play too loudly, when dad was locked in his study,' she recalls. 'We lived in a lovely Cornish village and at those times I usually took myself off to my friend's house. 'Father woke up early, went into his study and wrote something every day. And every afternoon would have tea with my mother for an hour, when he would bounce ideas at her.' Remake: The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis . 'Father was the author, but she helped with some of the details because she was very observant. 'She saw everything and remembered it all. She had an eye for detail and could help my father with his writing. She had the most amazing sense of humour, too. Rosamund Barteau is keeping her father's creation alive – by running a Poldark-themed guesthouse in Idaho. The bedrooms, arranged around a central swimming pool, are named after the story's four main characters. 'Americans love themed vacations, and Poldark was a hit on US TV and sold well on video,' she says. 'It has a good following in the States.' 'I was in my late teens when I was old enough to read my father's novels. I am very pleased that they have stood the test of time and a new generation will be able to enjoy the series – and the books.' The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis. He returns from the American War of Independence to find his father dead, his house wrecked and his sweetheart engaged. His romance with Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is again at the heart of the series. 'I've seen the first episode with Aidan and I could sit and watch it again and again,' says Rosamund. 'I think my dad would be very proud of what the BBC have done. Eleanor's Demelza is wonderful and her Cornish accent is good. It isn't too strong but enough to know where she is supposed to be from.'","Poldark's writer Winston Graham was 'livid' with BBC depiction of Demelza .

"Warning: Glyphosate is most commonly used in the popular weedkiller Roundup . A weedkiller used in millions of gardens has been identified as a potential cancer risk. The World Health Organisation’s cancer agency asked a group of 17 international scientists to decide whether glyphosate posed a risk to humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) declared that the chemical, which is the world’s most widely used weedkiller, is a ‘probable human carcinogen’. Glyphosate is most commonly used in the popular weedkiller Roundup, which is made by the American agro-chemical giant Monsanto. The firm – which strongly disputes the IARC’s findings – sells the herbicide to farmers in the US, where crops can be genetically modified to give them immunity to glyphosate. American GM plants like maize and soya beans can then be blanket-sprayed with Roundup to get rid of weeds without killing the crop. Use of the chemical has soared in the past decade, and it has been found in water and food on the shelves in the UK, including bread and cereal bars. The IARC report points out that 750 products contain glyphosate, and its use has increased sharply with the development of GM glyphosate-resistant crop varieties. The research looked at evidence from studies published in the US, Canada, and Sweden since 2001. It concluded that there was evidence that glyphosate can cause tumours in mice and rats in laboratory experiments – and could cause DNA damage to human cells. IARC panel chairman Aaron Blair, from America’s National Cancer Institute, said: ‘There was sufficient evidence in animals, limited evidence in humans and strong supporting evidence showing DNA mutations and damaged chromosomes.’ Dr Blair said concern is growing about glyphosate. But he pointed out that the IARC panel did not prove that glyphosate definitely caused cancer. He went on to say: ‘We have looked at, “Is there evidence that glyphosate causes cancer?” and the answer is “probably”. That is different to “yes”.’ Monsanto has issued a fierce defence of Roundup, accusing the IARC group of relying on ‘junk science’ and calling for the report to be retracted. The firm’s head of global regulatory affairs Philip Miller pointed to a four-year evaluation of glyphosate which was carried out for the EU by the German government, and concluded that the chemical was ‘unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk in humans’. American plants like maize (pictured) and soya beans can be genetically modified to give them immunity to glyphosate. They can then be blanket-sprayed with Roundup to get rid of weeds without killing the crop . He added: ‘Unfortunately this review does not meet the standards used by respected agencies around the world.’ Some academic experts were also critical of the findings. Dr Oliver Jones, from RMIT University, said: ‘This sounds scary and IARC evaluations are usually very good, but to me the evidence appears a bit thin.’ The warning has triggered calls for food watchdogs in the EU to investigate whether they will now need to impose controls on glyphosate. Andreas Kortenkamp, a professor of human toxicology at London’s Brunel University, said: ‘EU authorities must now consider whether measures are sufficient to protect consumers and pesticide applicators from cancer risks. ‘Home gardeners especially should exercise the utmost care when they use weedkillers that contain glyphosate.’","Chemical  used in weedkiller is a 'probable human carcinogen', experts say .

"A couple are facing jail after they blackmailed the Qatari royal family for £600,000 over 'private' photos left in a car. Chauffeur Awad Abdulbagy, 48, found the images on cameras and USB sticks during a visit by the royal family to London in May 2013. Abdulbagy and wife Nasren Mohammed, 34, boasted they could sell the photos to TV stations and enemies of the country and demanded a ‘reward’ through the nation’s embassy in Mayfair. Plot: Chauffeur Awad Abdulbagy, 48, and his wife, Nasren Mohammed, 34, both pictured outside Southwark Crown Court today. The couple face jail after being found guilty of blackmailing the Qatari royal family . The victim of the plot cannot be named, but Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Hajri told jurors it was a 'very sensitive' situation. Abdulbagy and Mohammed, both from west London, were found guilty at Southwark Crown Court today. A third defendant, Syrian-born Khaled Watter, 50, also from London, was cleared. Mr Al-Hajri told the court: 'It is very natural that these are shameful, they are private photographs. 'There are so many enemies of Qatar and these are private photos and you know that can be really very bad in our society - we are very conservative.' Prosecutor Gareth Patterson said Qatar is a 'particularly wealthy state' and explained members of the royal family and the household often come to the UK. On the trip in May 2013 there were not enough of the regular drivers, so self-employed Abdulbagy was given the job and drove a hired Mercedes E Class, jurors heard. Abdulbagy ferried the official photographer for the family around London and took him to Stanstead Airport at the end of the stay. Negotiation: Diplomat Ali Al-Hajri, pictured outside court today, said it was a 'very sensitive' situation . ‘It was sometime during that period  that the defendant Mr Abdulbagy came into possession of camera equipment,’ said Mr Patterson. On the day the photographer left, Abdulbagy made the first of a series of phone calls to the embassy to try and 'extract' money for the images. The prosecution had alleged that Mr Watter was involved in the calls. Abdulbagy described the photos as being ‘like treasure’ and demanded a ‘present or reward’. ‘He said he didn’t have a house, didn’t have any money, said he wanted to do it in the halal way -or the clean way - and he spoke about the value of the photographs,’ said Mr Patterson. At the embassy he was handed a ‘settlement deed’ which he signed agreeing to hand over the cameras and memory sticks in the hope of a ‘finders fee’. But he broke the terms of the legal contract and retained a camera, later taunting the diplomat by sending him a photo of it. Mohammed even text her husband to say she had ‘got a back up’ of the snaps. Mr Al-Hajri told the jury that when he spoke to the couple, Abdulbagy made it clear he wanted money. He said: 'At the beginning it was obvious they wanted money for these photos and naturally my role was to discuss with them, you know what they wanted. 'When I ask them what it is they exactly want and what do they have he said that they wanted to finish the matter in return for some money. 'I asked them how much do they want, he said £600,000 and then I was surprised so I repeated the question, he said £300,000.' He added that Abdulbagy also sent him threatening messages in Arabic. ‘The wording is very clear when he says “I’m not going to wait any longer” - this is clear blackmail,’ he said. Abdulbagy ‘applied pressure in his desire to extract money’, said Mr Patterson. He then resumed the campaign for cash, sending messages and making telephone calls. Abdulbagy and Wattar were arrested following a third and final meeting at the embassy. A search of a car parked at the nearby Dorchester Hotel revealed the missing items. Sudanese national Abdulbagy denied theft and Mohammed denied a further charge of handling stolen goods. Not guilty pleas were entered to both charges following a direction by the judge. Abdulbagy and Mohammed will be sentenced on 1 May.

"Amanda Moss' 7-year-old daughter, Kylee, is 3-foot-10 and weighs only 54lbs, but according to her elementary school, she is overweight. Moss, from Belton, Missouri, said she was outraged when Kylee came home from Hillcrest Elementary School last Friday with a letter from her physical education class stating that her body mass index was too high for her weight and height. ‘She is tiny. She has no body fat at all,’ Moss said of the slender, bespectacled second-grader. Scroll down for video . Body image: Kylee Moss, who is 3-foot-10 and weighs only 54lbs, received a letter from her school saying her body mass index was too high . Lifestyle tips: The note made recommendations for more exercise and healthier snacks . The note also included recommendations for more physical activity and healthier snacks. The mother told the station KMBC when Kylee read the note on the bus, she instantly became concerned about her weight and body image. ‘She goes, “Does this mean I'm fat?” and I said, “No, this does not mean you are fat,""’ Moss recounted. The parent said the school should have sent the note home in a sealed envelope to avoid making children feel self-conscious. Heidi Hicksam, whose 10-year-old son, Kaleb, also attends Hillcrest Elementary, was equally despondent when she got the note indicating that her son's BMI was above average. Hicksam said to Fox4KC Kaleb suffers from a liver disease, and the family did not need a letter reminding them of his health struggles. Students at Hillcrest elementary School in Missouri recieved the notes last Friday after being weighed in and measured by PE teachers . Body mass index is calculated by multiplying a person's weight by 703 and dividing the result by the height. Age and gender are factored in when determining BMI parameters. According to a chart included in the note from the school, a 7-year-old girl's healthy BMI should fall between 13.5-17.5. Kylee's index was 17.9. 'They send home a piece of paper that says, ""Here is a box. Your child doesn't fit into it. Here is what you should do to fit into the box,""' her mother fumed. Belton Superintendent Andrew Underwood said the letters are sent home to parents every year to promote a healthy lifestyle as part of a county-wide program called Healthy Hillcrest. Underwood insisted that it was not the school's intention to be malicious towards students. Going forward, parents will be notified of the weigh-ins in advance and will get the chance to opt out.","Kylee Moss, a second-grader from Missouri, is 3-foot-10 and weighs only 54lbs .

"Cane toads are one of Australia's most invasive pests, and pose a huge threat to native species. But now they could be turned into a successful commodity. Their venom could be effective in fighting cancer, researchers have discovered, and the potency of Australian cane toad's venom is stronger than those in China. This means that potentially millions of toads could be shipped to China, so they could have their venom extracted and turned into medicine, to be sold on the multi-billion dollar traditional medicine market. Millions of Australian cane toads could be shipped to China so their potent venom can be used in cancer medicine . Harendra Parekh, from the University of Queensland's pharmacy department where the research took place, said this discovery could lead to a 'potentially a very lucrative export market'. 'People are killing cane toads by the millions for free, but it’s potentially a very lucrative export market for Australia with the Chinese being extremely interested in naturally derived health products,' Dr Parekh said in an article published by the UOQ. He added that the Australian cane toad has close similarities to the Asiatic species, 'whose venom has been used in Chinese medicine for thousands of years.' The venom would likely be mixed with herbs and sold in tablet form (file photo) Cane toads are a pest in Australia, which were introduced in Queensland in 1935 to control cane beetles . 'We already have several companies interested, as the Chinese value Australian toads because of the environment they enjoy here,' Dr Parekh said. The researcher spoke to the Guardian Australia about how the cane toad's venom could be used as a medicine, and said it would most likely appear in a tablet form. 'We could process the venom for medicine, ideally in a tablet because it tastes absolutely awful if you drink it,' Dr Parekh said. New research shows that the pests could be turned into a huge economic commodity . 'Look at lamb, beef and chicken – these Australian products are seen as premium goods in China. Cane toads would be no different. They’d be premium cane toads.' The can toads would be squeezed for their potent venom which would then be mixed with herbs and turned into medicine. The venom extraction can be done while the toads are alive. Cane toads were first introduced to Queensland in 1935, in an attempt to control cane beetles. However, like rabbits, they quickly multiplied are were deemed a pest. They have since spread to New South Wales, West Australia and the Northern Territory.","Cane toad venom could be used in medicines to battle cancer .

"A 12-year-old boy and his  instructor died after their hang glider crashed onto a dry lake bed in Nevada. The child, whose name has not been released, was visiting with his family from New Mexico and was inside the hang glider tethered to a pick-up truck that plummeted to the ground on Friday afternoon. The adult male instructor, who has not been identified, died at the scene, while the boy's family  was able to transport him to Nevada Highway Patrol troopers who were on the side of the road. However, as troopers performed CPR they were unable to revive him. Scroll down for video . A boy, 12, and his hang-gliding instructor died after their glider crashed onto a dry lake bed in Nevada . During the activity, the hang gliding company, which has not been named, tethers gliders to the rear of a pickup truck to propel them into the air . Stanley Oloff, who was at the scene and is reportedly the child's great grandfather said that the family loved adventure and that it was their first time trying hang gliding . Metro police and NHP troopers arrived at the first scene of the incident, where the glider crashed at the Jean dry lake bed, near Sloan Road and Interstate 15 at 2.50pm, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. The family. from Farmington, was a part of a tour group that was organized to do the activity with the hang gliding company, which has not been named, according to Fox 5 Vegas. Stanley Oloff, who was at the scene and is reportedly the child's great grand-father, said the family loved adventure and that it was their first time trying hang gliding. The boy was the most excited of the group so he was selected to go on the first ride. During the activity, the hang gliding company tethers gliders to the rear of a truck to propel them into the air. Police said the hang glider was in the air when the truck driver pulling them turned around abruptly. The driver is believed to have thought the tether had been released which is ordinarily done by the person inside of the glider, before both the child and the man tragically plummeted to the ground. Authorities are still trying to piece together the cause of the incident and said it was too early to determine if it was a result of a mechanical or operational issue, said Capt. Peter Boffelli . Police said the glider was supposed to release the tether from the truck itself. Apparently, that tether release did not occur . Troopers performed CPR, but the child died while inside of the truck, said Trooper Loy Hixson . Metro police and the Federal Aviation Administration are still investigating the incident . 'The glider was supposed to release the tether from the truck itself. Apparently, that tether release did not occur,' said Capt. Peter Boffelli from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. 'So what occurred is when the truck turned around thinking the tether was released, the glider itself plummeted straight to the ground.' The male instructor died while inside the glider. The boy's family and some of the company's employees placed the child inside of a truck and were headed to a hospital in Las Vegas when they spotted NHP troopers 10 miles away on the side of the road, according to 8 News Now. The troopers performed CPR, but the child died while inside of the truck, said Trooper Loy Hixson.

"Motorsport fans watched in horror on Saturday as two classic racing cars which have been lovingly maintained for decades crashed into each other while driving around Goodwood circuit. The unique Mercedes SLS 300 'Porter Special', worth an estimated £4million, which was being driven by F1 and Le Mans legend Jochen Mass crashed into the back of a Lister-Jaguar Knobbly - thought to be worth around £1million. The one-of-a-kind 1955 Mercedes - originally made out of aluminium - had been transported to the Sussex racetrack from German collector Dr Klaus Lahr especially for the Salvadori Cup race. Scroll down for video . This is the moment a £4million Mercedes from the 1950s crashed into the back of a £1million Lister-Jaguar at Goodwood racetrack on Saturday . Spectators watched in shock as the Mercedes - driven by racing legend Jochen Mass - ploughed into the Jaguar as it exited a chicane . The rear of the Jaguar - which was slowing to enter the pit lane - was wrenched upwards, while the front of the classic Mercedes disintergrated . Driver Mass crashed into the back of the 1959 Jaguar driven by Tony Wood during the qualifying round for the race and the famous racing car had to be winched onto a tow-truck. The Lister, owned by Barry Wood, was entering the pits when Mass powered out of a chicane to find the slowing Lister in front of him. He slammed on the brakes but his wheels locked up, causing the Mercedes to smash into the rear of the Lister. It brought the qualifying period to an abrupt halt with stewards running onto the track to help both drivers and deal with fuel which had leaked onto the Tarmac. Both drivers emerged from their cars unscathed but were taken to the medical room as a precaution. The cars did not fare so well however, with both suffering serious damage. The Mercedes came off the worst, with the front-end badly dented, meaning it could not be moved on its own. The back of the Jaguar was bent out of shape by the force of the impact. It is now known whether the vehicles were insured, but it is feared repairs could cost more than £100,000. At the time, Wood was the second fastest in the Lister while Mass was 22nd. The Mercedes is unique, having been created by a US mechanic in the 1950s, and it is feared it will be difficult to restore to its former glory . The Jaguar fared equally badly in the accident and was left with the rear badly twisted into the air and damage to both sets of wheels . Stewards rushed to deal with fuel which spilled onto the track and the race was stopped. Luckily, the drivers of both cars were unharmed . A statement from Goodwood Motorsport said: 'There was a collision during qualifying for the Salvadori Cup on the afternoon of Saturday, March 21, 2015, involving car 23, a Lister-Jaguar 'Knobbly' driven by Tony Wood and car 8, a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLS ""Porter Special"" driven by Jochen Mass. 'Following the contact between the two cars, both of which stopped close to the pit lane entrance, the session was immediately red-flagged and did not resume. 'In line with our safety protocols, both drivers were taken to the circuit medical centre for precautionary checks and were released shortly afterwards to enjoy the remainder of the weekend. 'Unfortunately, neither car was able to be repaired in time to take part in Sunday's race and neither driver was able to take any further part in the on-track action.' The SLS started out life as a Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing but was modified in the US in 1956 after a being involved in another serious crash. It was once well known in US racing circles as the 'Mercedes-Corvette'. Th accident happened at the 73rd Goodwood Members Meeting, in which  cars from all generations are taken around the track for fans . Stewards were unable to move the classic Mercedes and it had to be lifted on to a tow truck before being removed from the famous circuit . Side-view pictures show the damage to the front of the car, which will be returned to its owner in Germany in a much worse state than it left .","A unique Mercedes SLS 300 had been transported from Germany to be shown off at the Sussex track on Saturday .
But disaster struck as it ploughed into the back of a 1959 Lister-Jaguar as it slowed to enter the circuit's pit lane .
Fans were left stunned as the cars smashed into each other before coming to a halt, badly damaged, on the track .
Neither driver was badly injured, although it is feared the repair bill for the two cars will be well in excess of £100,000 ."
"Devin M. Gesell, 17, from St. Charles, is accused of breaking into the home in November . Three teen burglars stole ashes after mistaking them for cocaine - and only realized after they tasted them. Devin M. Gesell, 17, is accused of breaking into the home in St Peter’s, Missouri,  in November with two others - a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old who can not be named for legal reasons. The trio thought they had come across a stash of cocaine and took it from the house along with a necklace worth $500, a Xbox 360 game system,  bottles of prescription drugs oxycodone and morphine, and over $800 in cash, reports the St. Louis Post- Dispatch. But when they tasted the ashes, which were in a wooden box, they realized their mistake - and threw the homeowner's father's ashes out of the car. Gessel later told the police they could not remember where they threw them out so police have not been able to retrieve them. According to police, the three knew the family who lived at the home and planned the burglary after seeing a Facebook post which indicated they were going to be away. But they were caught after police tracked them through an IP address used on the Xbox. Gesell was charged this week with burglary and two counts of theft. He told police he acted as lookout as the other two went through the house after breaking in through the back door. His bail is set at $10,000 cash-only. His accomplices, ages 15 and 16, were referred to juvenile authorities for charges. Debora Matthews, the victim of the robbery told Kmov.com: 'I just couldn't believe that they would take the ashes.'

"Girls star Lena Dunham has been caught up in an anti-Semitism row after writing a controversial article comparing her Jewish boyfriend and her dog. The 28-year-old prompted the storm after writing a quiz in the March 30 edition of New Yorker magazine - asking readers if a number of statements referred to her dog or boyfriend Jack Antonoff. They included: 'He doesn’t tip', 'he never brings his wallet anywhere' and 'he has hair all over his body, like most males who share his background'. Ms Dunham, whose own mother is Jewish, has been criticised by Twitter users, as well as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) - an organisation which fights anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry. Dog or Jewish boyfriend? 'Girls' star Lena Dunham, pictured here with her boyfriend Jack Antonoff, has been criticised for an article some claim is anti-Semitic . Quiz: Lena Dunham asked: 'Do the following statements refer to (a) my dog or (b) my Jewish boyfriend?' She is pictured with her dog Lamby . Row: Ms Dunham, whose own mother is Jewish, has been criticised by Twitter users, as well as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) - an organisation which fights anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry . Also among the 35 statements were 'my grandma Dottie loves him and says he’s a “good, good boy""' and 'bald men trigger a primal fear in him'. Abraham H. Foxman, ADL national director, said: 'Some will certainly find Lena Dunham’s stereotypes about cheap Jews offensive. Others will take issue with the very idea of comparing a dog and a Jewish boyfriend. 'While we understand that humor is its own special brand of expression and always try to give leeway to comedians, we wish that she had chosen another, less insensitive way to publicly reflect on her boyfriend’s virtues and vices. 'We are surprised that the New Yorker chose to print it.' Twitter users were quick to criticise the piece, while others used it as an opportunity to troll the star. One user wrote: 'I am so glad @ADL_National finally has taken on the task of charging people for their Jewish humor. Mazel tov!' Earlier today, one wrote: 'Whoa...yikes. Besides it being offensive, it isn't even close to funny, let alone original. I get being edgy...but lame.' Choice: Also among the 35 statements were 'my grandma Dottie loves him and says he’s a “good, good boy""' and 'bald men trigger a primal fear in him . Other Twitter users jumped to her defence. One said: 'Isn't Lena Dunham Jewish? What's the big deal?' The New Yorker editor-in-chief David Remnick also baked the publication's use of the piece in a statement released on Saturday and condemned those who had whipped up the storm on social media. It read: 'The Jewish-comic tradition is rich with the mockery of, and playing with, stereotypes. 'Anyone who has ever heard Lenny Bruce or Larry David or Sarah Silverman or who has read ‘Portnoy’s Complaint’ knows that. Lena Dunham, who is Jewish and hugely talented, is a comic voice working in that vein. 'Richard Pryor and Chris Rock do the same about black stereotypes; Amy Schumer does it with women and gender. I don’t mind if one reader or another didn’t find the piece funny. People can differ on that. 'But considering all the real hatred and tragedy in the world, the people getting exercised about the so-called anti-Semitism of this comic piece, like those who railed at Philip Roth a generation or two ago, are, with respect, howling in the wrong direction.' Ms Dunham lives with her boyfriend, Fun guitarist Jack Antonoff, who she met on a blind date organised by mutual friends. It is the latest in a series of controversies involving the star. The quiz in The New Yorker's March 30 edition included statements like 'he doesn’t tip', 'he never brings his wallet anywhere' and 'he has hair all over his body, like most males who share his background' In January she was forced to apologize after suggesting the storm over Bill Cosby's rape allegations is as significant as the slaughter of millions of Jews while speaking to the New York Times. Referring to Judd Apatow's 'obsession' with the revelations, she said: 'It’s sort of like saying someone’s obsessed with the Holocaust. 'This is a huge issue, and it speaks to the way that we abuse power and the way that celebrity allows for injustice.' In December she claimed she was raped by an acquaintance in college, detailed in a passage from her new book Not That Kind of Girl. Some accused her of making it up but she has since stuck by her story. During a chapter she says a 'flamboyant Republican conservative' that she met at Oberlin College in Ohio identified as 'Barry', attacked her at a party. In November it emerged that she was suing Truth Revolt website after they claimed she sexually abused her little sister when they were children. The claim is based on an excerpt from the Girls star and creator's new book, Not That Kind of Girl, and details how she once looked at her sister Grace's vagina when her sibling was a year old and she was seven. Lena defended the action as innocent childhood exploration based on curiosity, but the website Truth Revolt called the memory 'unsettling' and 'disturbing'. The website adamantly declined, with editor Ben Shapiro wrote explaining why they would not heed to the demands of Lena's lawyers. 'We refuse. We refuse to withdraw our story or apologize for running it, because quoting a woman’s book does not constitute a “false” story, even if she is a prominent actress and left-wing activist. 'Lena Dunham may not like our interpretation of her book, but unfortunately for her and her attorneys, she wrote that book – and the First Amendment covers a good deal of material she may not like, the article reads.'

"It's one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar so it's no surprise that visitors to Cheltenham Festival are as well-heeled as it gets. Next week, crowds clad in fur and fancy hats will descend on the racecourse for four days of racing, champagne breakfasts and royal visitors. Among them will be the Duchess of Cornwall who is due to present the trophy to the winner of the  Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase on Wednesday. Prestigious: Cheltenham is one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar and attracts royalty . Glamorous: Cheltenham is famous for its glamorously dressed racegoers - none with fake tan . Chic: Unlike at other races were glamour reigns supreme, ladies at Cheltenham dress for the weather . But Camilla isn't the only glamorous attendee expected at the racecourse next week, with Zara Tindall, Princess Anne and Autumn Phillips among the event's famous fans. So who's who at Cheltenham? Femail reveals which royals and A-listers worth looking out for. CAMILLA, DUCHESS OF CORNWALL . The Duchess has long been a fan of all things equestrian and is an annual visitor to Cheltenham racecourse. Always impeccably, if cosily, dressed, last year saw her arrive on the arm of her food critic son, Tom Parker-Bowles. Royal visit: Camilla, seen here with son Tom Parker-Bowles at last year's event, will be at Cheltenham . Thumbs up: The Duchess of Cornwall is a keen racing fan and is a regular sight come race day . Presentation: Like last year, the Duchess will present one of the prizes on Ladies Day . Camilla, who is due to present a trophy on Ladies Day this year, spent most of the 2014 event ensconced in a box beside her son - and managed to bag a winner. The patron of three equine charities, The British Equestrian Federation, The Brooke Hospital for Animals and Ebony Horse Club, the Duchess has been a rider all her life and used to hunt. Now confined to watching thanks to a painful back, she is almost as enthusiastic about racing as the Queen and last month attended her first race meet of the year when she joined soldiers for the Royal Artillery Gold Cup at Sandown. ZARA TINDALL . A professional rider in her own right, Zara Tindall, 33, is a familiar sight at the Cheltenham Festival, which she attends each year. Runner: This year's Cheltenham Festival will see Zara Tindall's horse Monbeg Dude take to the course . Familiar face: Zara, pictured at last year's event, attended every day of last year's Cheltenham Festival . All smiles: Zara, although an eventer herself, is also a National Hunt racing trainer . Royal approval: Princess Anne, a keen racing fan, is a regular visitor to the Cheltenham Festival . Last year, she was there every single day, bringing husband Mike on day one and spending the rest of the week watching the races alongside her mother, Princess Anne. Although a eventer by trade, Zara is also building up a reputation for training racehorses, most famously her husband's horse Monbeg Dude which competed in last year's Grand National. The horse, which managed a respectable seventh place finish in the event, is also expected to make an appearance at Cheltenham this year, with Zara and Mike set to cheer him on from the sidelines. Zara is also training a horse owned by her mother, who, along with Autumn Phillips, is also expected to be on the guest list at this year's festival. PIPPA MIDDLETON . The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister has become a regular visitor to UK sporting events, among them Wimbledon, Henley and, in 2013, Cheltenham. Looking good: Pippa Middleton proved she knows her way around a dress code when she visited . Big day out: The Duchess of Cambridge's sister, who attended the 2013 event, failed to bag a winner . Sister act: The event also had a visit from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge the same year . Pictured enjoying the races in the company of Tom Kingston, Miss Middleton got the dress code, which encourages colour, spot on in her yellow coat. She topped off the look with a cosy fur hat in a style similar to the one worn by the Duchess of Cornwall a year later. CHANELLE MCCOY . The wife of top jockey AP McCoy, blonde Chanelle is a race day veteran and never puts a (well shod) foot wrong. Always there: Chanelle, the wife of champion jockey AP McCoy, is a familiar face at Cheltenham . Friends: Chanelle at Cheltenham with, left, Zara Tindall, and right, Emma Spencer . A close friend of Zara Tindall, the women were pictured sharing a joke during last year's Cheltenham Festival and were seen together again at Royal Ascot the following June. This year's event is set to be an emotional one for the 38-year-old, thanks to her husband's imminent retirement. McCoy, whose career has spanned more than 20 years, has ridden more than 4,000 winners, including victories in the Grand National and the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Although Chanelle has spoken of her fears for her husband's health in the past, she never fails to turn up to watch him race - always in a suitably glamorous ensemble. Wondering who to have a flutter on? Ladbrokes' Jessica Bridge reveals which horses are set to be first past the post at Cheltenham Festival. TUESDAY - CHAMPION HURDLE . HORSE: Faugheen . ODDS: 11/10 . He's called Faugheen the machine for a reason and it's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on Tuesday, despite the impressive field. Usual jockey, Ruby Walsh, is yet to decide his mount for the race, with stablemate and dual Champion Hurdle winner Hurricane Fly also lining up, but with fingers pointing towards Faugheen it's just another reason to back him. WEDNESDAY - QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE . HORSE: Dodging Bullets . ODDS: 4/1 . Possible winner? AP McCoy, pictured at last year's event, will run his final Gold Cup race next week . All eyes might be on Sprinter Sacre and Sire de Grugy, but Dodging Bullets has easily had the most impressive route to this year's Festival, and although a short price the Clarence House Chase winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting. THURSDAY: LADBROKES WORLD HURDLE . HORSE: Rock On Ruby . ODDS: 7/1 . Old-time favourite Rock On Ruby could make history to become just the third Champion Hurdle winner to also land the World Hurdle trophy. He's been jumping and travelling well, and after comprehensively beating Vaniteux back in January he's stamped his position as a serious contender to the younger guard. FRIDAY - GOLD CUP . HORSE: Carlingford Lough . ODDS: 10/1 . It's impossible to not back AP McCoy's last ever ride in the Gold Cup - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20-time champion jockey. There's still doubts whether favourite Silviniaco Conti can finally make it third time lucky at Cheltenham, but for the old romantics there's only one man that can win this year's Gold Cup, and it's AP McCoy. CAMILLA BASSETT-SMITH . Famous for her flamboyant taste in hats, TV presenter Camilla is a regular visitor to Cheltenham and is based in nearby Gloucester. Hat's a winner: TV presenter Camilla Bassett-Smith is famous for her fabulous hats . High-powered: Along with TV presenting, she is also a gold-medal winning gardener . Most of her work is for BBC Wiltshire, although she also boasts acting and modelling credits to her name. She is also a gold-medal winning gardener, who has shown her work at Chelsea among others, and was part of the production team at Gardener's World. To racing fans, however, she will always be the glamorous girl in the super-sized hats, with spectacular crimson, nude and chocolate numbers deployed in recent years. LYSTRA ADAMS . She's not a celebrity and she's certainly not a royal but to racing fans, Lystra Adams, an equine enthusiast from Staffordshire, has become a familiar sight. Bold choice: Lystra Adams at Cheltenham Festival in 2013, sporting an impressive crimson and black look . She's back! After wowing in crimson in 2013, Ms Adams returned wearing vibrant print the following year . That she has is largely due to her eccentric ensembles which are nearly always colourful and are, without fail, topped by a spectacular hat. Although Royal Ascot and Glorious Goodwood are also on her racing season itinerary, her flair for colour is particularly noticeable during visits to Cheltenham. Most impressive was her appearance on St Patrick's Thursday at last year's event, when she arrived clad head-to-toe in emerald green. Top choice: On St Patrick's Thursday 2014, Ms Adams wore emerald, topped with a peacock feather hat . While Aintree is famous for its scantily clad racegoers and Royal Ascot for its hats, the Cheltenham Festival has become synonymous with an altogether more rural approach to dressing. Eschewing skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and comfortable patent leather boots, the race meeting offers a masterclass in country chic, complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or two. Unlike Ascot, organisers at Cheltenham refuse to impose a dress code on guests and, beyond exhortations to wrap up warm and avoid anything that might offend, say anything goes - up to and including fancy dress. But perhaps a warning isn't required: Although the clothes donned by Gloucestershire's most fashionable might be rural, the looks on show certainly don't lack glamour with oversized sunglasses, pearl necklaces and twinkling diamond stud earrings deployed to up the fashion ante. Fur  is a recurring motif, as are hats that take inspiration from rural life. Like the stylish effort deployed by Zara Phillips on day one of the 2014 event, many come festooned in pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a perennial favourite. Male racegoers aren't immune from the pull of country style either, with most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy blazer and artfully knotted tie. But whether girls in pearls and princess coats or preppy chaps in Prince of Wales check, the Cheltenham Festival is just as stylish as its Berkshire counterpart. But not everyone pulls it off... Cheltenham Festival might have a fairly relaxed dress code  but most, with the March weather in mind, arrive sporting a take on practical glamour. But not everyone gets it right, with everything from thigh-scraping skirts to bizarre hats spotted in the parade ring. Should you need reminding, below are some of the worst offenders from last year. Remember ladies: just because it's tweed, doesn't mean it's classy. Oh dear: It might be tweed but in this case, the short-skirted look certainly isn't classy . Brrr! A patriotic Union Jack ensemble (left) and a shamrock embellished hat (right) Tally ho! A hunting inspired ensemble from 2014, complete with a pheasant feather hat and a pair of gauntlets . Short and sweet: Two 2014 racegoers chose to brave the chill in short skirts more suitable for summer .","Cheltenham Festival has long attracted a well-heeled set of racegoers .
Next week's event will include a visit from the Duchess of Cornwall .

"Another member of the Baltimore Ravens has been arrested this offseason. Running back Bernard Pierce was pulled over in Towson, Maryland, in the early  morning hours of Wednesday and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. This after his teammates Terrence Cody and Victor Hampton were also arrested earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Baltimore Ravens running back Bernard Pierce (above) was pulled over in Towson, Maryland, early Wednesday and charged with driving under the influence . Pierce, a member of the Ravens when they won the 2012 Super Bowl, failed a field sobriety test and was taken in and released from the station after being cooperative with officers . Baltimore County police told The Baltimore Sun that Pierce, 23, was pulled over for speeding around 2am, and after an officer suspected he had been drinking the footballer was ordered to perform a field sobriety test. After failing the test, a cooperative Pierce was taken to the station, processed and later released. According to TMZ, he told police; 'Do you know what happened the last time a Ravens player got a DUI? I'm getting cut tomorrow, not like you care.' Pierce, a member of the team when they won the Super Bowl in 2012, has been charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol, driving while impaired by alcohol, exceeding maximum speed, and driving a vehicle in excess of reasonable and prudent speed on highway. 'We are aware of the situation and learning more about it. We take these matters seriously,' said Ravens spokesperson Chad Steele. This  just weeks after Hampton, 22, was also arrested and charged with driving under the influence after he was recorded driving 100 mph in a 55-mph zone in North Carolina. He was booked after recording a 0.10 blood-alcohol level, and later released when he posted a $2,500 bond. This also comes just weeks after Pierce's Ravens teammate Victor Hampton (above) was also arrested for a DUI, and cut from the team the next day . Tackle Terrence Cody (above) was also arrested this year and indicted on 15 counts of animal cruelty and drug charges by a grand jury . The Ravens released the cornerback the next day. As for Cody, he was indicted on 15 counts of animal cruelty and drug charges by a grand jury in February following an incident in which his pet alligator allegedly ate his dog. He was also found to have  marijuana and drug paraphernalia in his home. The tackle was also dropped from the team prior to his indictement. Cody claims that his dog died of worms, and not because he was attacked by the alligator, which was illegally owned. All this comes after the Ravens had one of their worst year's ever off the field, with star player Ray Rice being caught on video physically abusing his now-wife Janay (above) in a hotel elevator . All this comes after the Ravens had one of their worst year's ever off the field, with star player Ray Rice being caught on video physically abusing his now-wife Janay in a hotel elevator and team coming under fire for their handling of the situation and questioned over how much they knew about the incident before details were leaked to the public. He was soon cut from the team, but appealed the decision and ultimately won the right to be reinstated in the NFL. He then sued the team for the $3.5million he lost in salary, with the two sides settling out of court before a trial could begin.","Baltimore Ravens running back Bernard Pierce was pulled over in Towson, Maryland, early  Wednesday and charged with driving under the influence .

"First lady Michelle Obama's recent trip to Cambodia this month cost taxpayers $242,500 – for hotel rooms alone – allowing her to perform her offical duties at two events for a total of 33 minutes. That's $7,348 of lodging costs for every minute on the job. A government contracting document shows that the State Department authorized spending nearly a quarter-million dollars so Mrs. Obama – traveiling with an entourage of high-ranking government officials and their security detail – could promote the 'Let Girls Learn' initiative, which girls' access to education. Transcripts provided to media by the White House Press Office indicate that Mrs. Obama spoke with a group of 10 girls at Hun Sen Bakorng High School for 21 minutes. After that appearance, she spoke at a Peace Corps Training Round Table event for 12 more minutes. That second appearance took place conveniently at the luxury five-star Sofitel Angkor Phokeethra Golf and Spa Resort in Siem Reap, Cabodia, where she was staying. The government booked 85 separate rooms for 14 nights, even though the first lady only stayed there for two. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE CONTRACTING DOCUMENT .

The US first lady left Siem Reap's international airport on March 22 after two nights at the five-star resort as part of a five-day Asia trip highlighting the importance of girls' education . FIVE STARS: Mrs. Obama's lodgings were among the finest Cambodia has to offer international tourists . The State Department ruled on March 3 that there was no time to solicit competitive bids for the March 21 trip, and ruled that the 'unusual and compelling urgency' of the first lady's travel justified a no-bid contract to the Sofitel resort. In addition to the 85 guest rooms, her trip to Siem Reap required five office suites, five 'sleeping suites' and a conference room. If Mrs. Obama stayed in one of those 'sleeping suites,' she had her own butler. They come standard. 'The Siem Reap hotel, which elegantly combines Khmer and French architectural design, features landscaped gardens, 5 restaurants and bars, meeting facilities, a luxury spa and the largest free form swimming pool in Cambodia,' the resort's website boasts. 'The leading luxury resort in Siem Reap also boosts a world-class 18-hole golf course at the Phokeethra Country Club, which is only a 25 min[ute] drive from the hotel.' Mrs. Obama made the most of what became the first trip by a sitting US president's wife to Cambodia, visiting Angkor Wat temple in Siem Reap province . And for tourist-minded spouses of world leaders, the hotel 'is close to the Angkor Temples, spectacular sunsets at the Bakheng Hill, Siem Reap River, Old market, 20 minutes away from the International Airport and just walking distance to Siem Reap National Museum.' She took full advantage, the White House Press Office relayed, visiting the temples at Angkor Wat when she wasn't meeting-and-greeting embassy staff. The first lady's lodging expenses in Cambodia were first reported by the Washington Free Beacon. They came at the tail end of a five-day Asia trip to promote girls' education. A few other smaller hotel contracts were awarded in Cambodia at the same time as the Sofitel's. The State Department justified the rush-job with hotel booking by noting that '[s]ecurity concerns prohibit sufficient advanced notification of VIP travel to allow for sufficient time to conduct full and open competition.' Michelle Obama walked with Cambodian first lady Bun Rany (right), the wife of Prime Minister Hun Sen, as they arrived at a school where they met with a group of 10 female students for 21 minutes . Mrs. Obama, her entourage and their security detail contemplated the 'crisis' of girls' education at a resort that features a swim-up bar . JUST LIKE HOME! President Obama's wife is accustomed to fine wines and cheese at the White House, and the Sofitel didn't disappoint . 'The Department of State can only communicate with the staff at Posts abroad when authorization is given due to security concerns. They have an extremely short turnaround time when authorization has been granted for negotiations to commence and site selections to be finalized with both the local vendors and Posts before the actual Senior High Level USG VIP visit occurs.' The contracting document referred to her as a 'Senior High Level USG [U.S. Government] VIP,' although the title of 'first lady' is honorary and has no official government function. Her accommodation arrangements, in fact, were apparently shoehorned into a generic form typically used for male VIPs. 'Security and logistical teams make determinations during the site survey as to which hotels are most suitable for the Senior High Level USG VIP and his traveling staff to remain overnight,' the contracting document reads.

"Controversial letters sent to IRA fugitives granting them an amnesty from prosecution may have been illegal, a damning Parliamentary report has found. A Commons select committee said the so-called ‘comfort letters’, which assured 187 Republican terror suspects they were no longer being hunted by the police, should never have been written. In a highly-critical report, it said the ‘one-sided secretive scheme’ – which victims said effectively handed paramilitary fighters 'get out of jail free' cards – had damaged the integrity of the UK criminal justice system. Scroll down for video . A Commons select committee has said the ‘comfort letters’ scheme which was set up by Tony Blair's (pictured) Labour government in 2000, should never have been written and may have been illegal . MPs investigating the scandal said the scheme, set up by Tony Blair’s Labour government in 2000, had caused further hurt for the families of those killed during the Troubles. At least 95 recipients were linked to almost 300 murders. But the letters – sent to the so-called ‘on the runs’ after pressure from Sinn Fein – only came to light during the trial of John Downey, the man accused of the Hyde Park bombing in 1982. The trial collapsed in February last year when it emerged the 63-year-old had been told he would not face prosecution for the blast that killed four soldiers and seven horses in London. A review by Lady Justice Hallett concluded in July that the letter scheme, established as part of the peace process, was not unlawful but that there were 'significant failures' in how it operated. Britain's then Prime Minister Tony Blair (L) meets Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams (R), and chief negotiator Martin McGuinness in 2005 - the letters were sent to so-called ‘on the runs’ after pressure from Sinn Fein . But today the Commons’ Northern Ireland Affairs Committee published a blistering report raising serious questions about the legality of the highly-divisive scheme. The report said: ‘It is questionable whether the 'on-the-runs' (OTR) scheme was lawful or not, but we believe its existence distorted the legal process. ‘We accept that there was a difficult peace process going on at the time, but believe that there still has to be transparency and accountability in government and in the legal process.’ It found that ‘damage has undoubtedly been done to public confidence in the criminal justice system’. The committee, which took evidence from 55 witnesses, including ex-prime minister Mr Blair, also blasted the decision not to appeal the Downey ruling . This had placed ‘preserving the integrity of the criminal justice system over the public interest involved in continuing the trial of someone accused of carrying out multiple murders,’ it said. IRA terror suspect John Downey (pictured) was wrongly sent an immunity letter causing his trial for for the 1982 Hyde Park bombing to collapse . The report also said the people of Northern Ireland had been ‘kept in the dark to the greatest possible extent’ by the Government. The report said that during the peace process, Sinn Fein had pushed for ‘comfort letters’ to be issued and had received promises from Mr Blair. But while working hard to ensure those pledges were kept, Mr Blair did so without telling other Northern Ireland party leaders about the exact nature of the scheme, the report said. Committee chairman Laurence Robertson said the victims of the Troubles and their families had been ‘let down’. He said: ‘Our priority is to serve the victims and their relatives, whom we believe to have been let down by HM Government by the way in which this scheme has operated. ‘If any scheme had been put in place at all, which is questionable, it should have been properly introduced and correctly administered. It also should have been open and transparent. This scheme was none of those things. ‘Regardless of the intentions, this scheme has caused further hurt to people who have suffered far too much already, and has led to further suspicions being raised.’ The report branded ‘wholly unacceptable’ the Government's failure to identify those IRA members who had been charged or convicted who obtained Royal Prerogatives of Mercy during the peace process. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers has reiterated that the Government was no longer standing by the ‘on the run’ letters and that those who had received them could no longer rely on them as a defence. It comes after six IRA terror suspects thought to be behind some of the worst atrocities committed on mainland Britain are facing major new police investigations despite receiving letters granting them immunity. A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said: ‘The letters were only ever a statement of the facts as they were understood at the time, as to whether or not an individual was wanted for questioning by the police. ‘They were not intended to preclude investigation or prosecution based on new evidence emerging, or on the basis of a fresh assessment of the existing evidence. The Government is today repeating its statement that recipients of the letters should cease to place any reliance on them.’","Letters sent to IRA fugitives granting them amnesty may have been illegal .

"It's been three weeks since Dan Osborne was heard threatening to stab his ex-girlfriend - and the mother of his one-year-old son Teddy - Megan Tomlin in an audio recording. But a second audio, handed over by Megan, 23, this week and released by The Sun On Sunday, hears the 23-year-old TOWIE star make another expletive-laden rant, threatening to end her life. Dan, who was arrested but released by Essex Police without charge after the last incident, also refers to his second child Ella, born last month with Jacqueline Jossa, as a 'mistake.' Scroll down for video . Recorded: A second audio recording has been released which hears TOWIE star Dan Osborne threatening his ex-girlfriend, and the mother of his child Teddy, during an expletive rant . Dan and Megan split in April 2013, shortly after the birth of Teddy, and the reality TV star then started dating EastEnders actress Jacqueline before announcing they were pregnant in August 2014. Now though, an audio-taped recording - heard by MailOnline and allegedly secretly taken by Megan last November at her home in front of their young son - sees Dan refer to her as his 'property' and threaten her if she moves on with another man. He is heard saying: 'I swear on this boy’s life I will end your f****** life if you shag another man. Never in your f****** life are you going to be with another man. I can swear on my son’s life.' Split: Dan Osborne and ex-girlfriend Megan Tomlin split in Aprul 2013 and have a one-year-old son together Teddy . 'Shut your f****** mouth you f****** c***. If you go near another man I promise you I will stab you in the f****** throat.' Dan made similar threats of physical violence in the first tape released earlier this month but in this latest release Megan can be heard exclaiming, 'Ow, get off me!' and tells Dan to stop 'hitting' her until she seems distressed and in tears. There is no proof that Dan actually hits Megan in the recording. After asking him to leave her house, he admits, 'Yes I am horrible when you go on about other men' telling her that as long as they have a son together, Megan is his 'property' Bouncing back: Following the release of the first audio recording, in which Dan was heard denying he was dating current girlfriend and the mother of his second child Jacqueline Jossa, Dan is now back in his relationship and expected back on TOWIE . Throwback: Megan and Dan are now the parents of Teddy, who is one year old . Dan can be heard telling Megan that she can't get a new boyfriend even though he's made another girl pregnant because that was a 'mistake' and he didn't 'mean' to get 22-year-old Jacqueline pregnant. Megan tells him that it's laughable because having a child doesn't get more permanent but he says things would be different if he 'actually wanted a family with [Jacqueline]' or if he was going to 'propose' to her. 'I don't care. It won't be funny when you're in hospital,' he says, and referring to a future boyfriend he adds: 'If I'm going to go to prison, I'll stab him in the throat.' A representative for Dan Osborne has been contacted by MailOnline for comment. Happy families: Dan shared an intimate picture showing a make-up free Jacqueline Jossa and his new baby Ella recently . The previous recording also heard Dan deny having a relationship with Jacqueline, despite her being pregnant with their daughter at the time of the alleged first recording. Dan appears to have patched things up with the mother of his second child, as he was this week pictured with Jacqueline on a date. Sharing an intimate kissing picture to his Twitter page, Dan wrote: 'A night with this beauty' The reality TV star was also reportedly due to return to The Only Way Is Essex following a brief suspension, though Lime Pictures have confirmed that Dan will not be receiving a new contract any time soon. Keeping close: Dan and Jacqueline appear to have patched things up after he claimed they weren't together in the first recording, taken in November 2014 . A spokesperson for the ITVBe show told MailOnline on Sunday: 'Dan has not been on the show for several weeks and there are no plans for him to return.' To apologise, Dan released a statement eight days after the initial audio was released, pleading for understanding and appearing to confirm that it was his voice which featured in the expletive rant. He said: 'It has taken me a while to find the right words but I would like to say that I am truly sorry to anyone who was offended by what they heard.' 'I am ashamed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to reach such a dark place that I behaved in a way that even I didn't recognise. 'While I acknowledge that there is absolutely no excuse for my deeply regrettable behaviour, I plead for some understanding that I had no intention of violence.' Father's defense: It was Dan's dad Jim Osborne who was the first to defend him on social media on Sunday . Stand by your man: Jim Osborne took to social media to say Dan was a 'beautiful person' on Sunday . Dan and Megan dated for 18 months in 2013 but have remained close for the sake of their son, who was born in December 2013. Jacqueline and Dan have now been together for over a year and she gave birth to baby Ella on February 16. It was Dan's father Jim - who previously reportedly branded Megan the 'scum of the earth', and a 'tramp' on his Facebook page according to The Sun - who leaped to Dan's defense on social media on Sunday. He said: 'We all love you Dan, beautiful person inside and out xxx' before Dan quoted his tweet and added the line, 'love you too dude! If only everyone knew the full story eh x' Words of advice: Dan's dad was previously quoted as saying that he thought Megan was the 'scum of the earth', and a 'tramp' on his Facebook page .","Second audio-taped expletive rant released by ex Megan Tomlin .

"A thug who battered his girlfriend so badly she needed hypnosis to help bring him to justice was today jailed for ten years. Mum-of-two Zoe Dronfield, 38, suffered a bleed on the brain and a neck wound after partner Jason Smith, 31, from Coventry, launched a ferocious eight-hour attack. When she regained consciousness, she found Smith slashing his wrists in a suicide bid but she had no memory of the assault. She feared he would escape justice until she hired a hypnotherapist who helped her piece together the details of the attack. Scroll down for video . Recovery: Zoe Dronfield hired a hypnotherapist who helped her piece together the details of the horrific attach . Injuries: Ms Dronfield suffered a bleed on the brain and a neck wound after partner Jason Smith, 31, from Coventry, launched a ferocious eight-hour attack . Police then used her evidence in court to convince a jury to convict him of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm with intent and criminal damage. Today, Ms Dronfield, from from Coventry, West Midlands watched Smith jailed for ten years at Warwick Crown Court in Leamington Spa. Recorder Richard Atkins QC told him: 'Having beaten her and knocked her senseless you then took a knife to her face. 'The photographs of the victim's injuries are deeply unpleasant. She was quite viciously assaulted and savagely cut. 'This was a sustained attack. There were numerous blows to the victim's head and body with feet and a sharp object. 'I've no doubt you've been a good father to your seven-year-old daughter and it saddens me she won't see you as a free man for some time . 'But there's a violent bully in you that won't take no for an answer. I therefore feel ten years in prison plus four on licence is an appropriate sentence.'

Lee Egan, defending, said: 'My client doesn't accept guilt. 'His overriding concern at the police interview immediately after the incident was for Ms Dronfield's welfare. It was an isolated incident and it was not premeditated. 'But she did suffer life changing injuries. He does feel remorse for causing them, although he doesn't remember doing it.' Ms Dronfield, from Coventry, was stabbed in the neck by Smith on February 2 last year. He then stamped on her head, leaving her with horrific injuries. She suffered a cracked cheekbone, a bleed on the brain and the stab wound was just 1cm from her jugular vein. The savage assault also left her with short term memory loss which meant she was unable to recall the hours before the attack.

Both of her arms were cut in the attack. The savage assault also left Ms Dronfield with short term memory loss . Speaking after the case, she said: 'I think it was a fair outcome and justice has been done. 'It's about time courts started taking domestic violence seriously. Jason is a controlling bully and I think he has a personality disorder. 'I feel lucky to be alive and I'm glad he's been put away where he can't hurt any other women. 'After the attack I was a shell of my former self and I've never been so low in my life. 'Many women take their own lives after such events but I had to find a way to fight through it and that's why I wanted to get hypnotherapy - to build me back up mentally and fill in the blanks.' 'I want to show other women they can do the same, we do not have to let abusers win,' she added. Zoe met Smith on Facebook and they were in a relationship for a year before he attacked her. They had mutual friends on the social media site and they began chatting, before he soon began showering her with compliments and offering to take her out.

Mr Kilmurry said: 'I have worked with Zoe and I am proud to have helped her to retrieve her memory and rebuild her confidence following the trauma' Smith acted like a true gentleman, taking to her expensive restaurants and hotels, and treating her like a princess. They had spent the night of the attack talking before Smith fell asleep and Ms Dronfield went to bed. She said: 'The next thing I knew, I woke up covered in blood and had no idea what was happening. 'My first thought was I wasn't going to die because I needed to be there for my children. I grew up without a mother and I didn't want that for my children. 'The whole house was covered in blood. The bedroom was red and the bed was sodden. It was like a scene from a horror film. 'The bath was filled with water and he was cleaning knives in the bath. There was an eight-inch knife and a meat cleaver.' Just a week before the attack, Ms Dronfield was forced to hide in her wardrobe when Smith stormed into her home after she tried to end their relationship. Prosecutor Raj Punia said: 'A week previously he had come into her home unannounced while she was alone with her four-year-old daughter. 'He damaged a door and ran upstairs where the victim was hiding in a wardrobe in her bedroom. He demanded to know why she wouldn't speak to him anymore.' Ms Donfield has found herself a better job and has set up a charity. Of people with her type of head injury, 75 per cent don't return to work .

'Zoe has not only returned to work but has gone and got a better job and set up a charity and has been helping others less fortunate as herself. 'It wasn't until later on down the hypnotherapy line that the trust built up and she was confident enough to go to 'parts unknown' we embarked on some regression to the event and the detail she remembered was quite amazing even in and out of unconsciousness.'","Zoe Dronfield suffered a bleed on the brain and a stab wound in the attack .

"Shocking video footage has emerged showing the moment passers-by refused to help a fatally injured young  man who burst into flames while trying to steal copper wire from an electricity substation. The unidentified South African, who appears to be in his teens, was seen with horrific burns covering most of his upper body following the incident in the outskirts of the city of Witbank in north-western Mpumalanga Province. With his terrible injuries clearly visible, the young man says he is in agony and begs passers-by to take him to the hospital - but he is cruelly told to walk if he wants treatment. The burns victim then walked to a nearby health clinic, where an ambulance was called - but he is understood to have died hours later. Scroll down for video . Fatally injured: The unidentified South African, who appears to be in his teens, was seen with horrific burns covering most of his upper body. He is heard begging passers-by to take him to the hospital - but he is cruelly told to walk if he wants treatment. The man died the following day . The explosive blast was also seen by locals at the same time as the electricity cut out throughout the Witbank suburbs. As they rushed over to see what had happened they saw the man smoking and shouting for help as he climbed out of the Botha substation in the city's Lynnvill suburb. According to the local council's acting municipal manager Theo van Vuuren, the thief had probably been attempting to repeat the success of an earlier theft at the same substation. During that incident electrical wiring was stolen leaving the areas of Lynnville and Ackerville without electricity. 'Today a thief attempted to steal and vandalise Botha substation, only weeks ago this same substation was hit leaving Lynnville and Ackerville without electricity,' van Vuuren said. 'The team has managed to restore power to Lynnville and part of Ackerville. After restoring power a cable fault emerged and this is affecting part of Ackerville as well as Thushanang.' He did not comment on the video footage of the young thief that appeared a short while later showing people refusing to assist the man as he screamed in pain and shouted for help. One eyewitness, who asked not to be named, said: 'The man came out of nowhere and was screaming, obviously in a lot of pain. His whole body was burned, the skin was left hanging off his body and some of his hair also burnt off.' Several community members came out to see why he was shouting but no one wanted to help the poor man. They were all staring at him,' he added. Video of the incident captures locals shouting: 'What were you doing? You brought this on yourself, what were you doing in the substation?' 'I am burning, I am dying and it is so painful, please get an ambulance,' the horrifically injured thief shouted back. According to the source, the man walked 500 metres to the clinic where the nursing staff called an ambulance. He was taken to a nearby hospital but is understood to have died the next day. The local police spokesperson colonel Leonard Hlathi said that they had not had any reports about the theft and the dead man's identity remains unknown.","Young thief was horrifically burnt in the outskirts of the city of Witbank .

"Cassie Newnham (pictured) insisted on a prenup before tying the knot with boyfriend of four years Brendon . Wedding dresses and venues might top the list of internet searches for most brides-to-be, but not for Cassie Newnham. When her boyfriend of four years popped the question, the 33-year-old wasted no time Googling prenuptial agreements instead. Despite being head over heels in love with Brendon, 38,  Cassie, who lives in London and is originally from South Africa, had spent years working hard to save for her future. And as her heart raced with wedding plans, her head told her to protect her assets. 'People think of a prenup as something you put in place in case you get divorced but it's actually a great way to safeguard your assets,' account manager Cassie said. She got engaged to Brendon in February 2013, when he went down on one knee during a trip to Cape Town for a friend's wedding. She continued: 'If you take life insurance out you're not protecting yourself from death, you're just insuring yourself in case.' Like Beyonce and Nicole Kidman – who are both reported to have prenuptial agreements – getting her man to sign on the dotted line before walking up the aisle was non-negotiable for Cassie. She thinks Cheryl Fernandez-Versini was wrong for not instigating one before her whirlwind wedding to Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July 2014. 'You always think ""it will never happen to me"" but you just don't know,' Cassie said. She continued: 'Quite a lot of our friends have prenups in place. If you've put money into property or built up your own career or company, that's something you should safeguard.' Cassie and Brendon's prenup was signed a month before their wedding day in Cape Town in January 2014 (Pictured: The couple at their wedding) If the Brendon and Cassie (pictured) split up each will keep all of the assets they acquired before their marriage took place . So as Cassie and Brendon planned their big white wedding in front of 98 guests in Cape Town in January 2014, they were also busy negotiating how they would split their future possessions. 'We both always thought prenuptial agreements were a good idea, so we were both in agreement we should get one done, says Cassie, who is expecting the couple's first child at the end of March. She continued: 'Neither of us felt awkward about it at all.' 'As well as the house we bought together before we got married, I have a property in South Africa left to me by my dad, and Brendon already had a property too. 'In addition, we both had savings.' Beyonce (left) has been reported saying a prenup is 'smart', Catherine Zeta-Jones (centre) is said to have one and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini (right) reportedly refused to sign one before her marriage to Jean-Bernard . The couple used online law firm Rocket Lawyer to draw up an official agreement and Cassie thinks more brides-to-be should consider doing the same. A prenup is a legally binding contract entered into before marriage . It protects people from losing money and assets . It commonly includes provisions for divisions or property or spousal support in the event of divorce . A prenuptial agreement isn't legally binding in the UK but will be taken into account during a divorce hearing . It is also possible to have a postnuptial agreement after the marriage ceremony has taken place. She said: 'You can tailor your prenup to whatever you want it to be, and it also protects you from debt. 'People think it's a legal agreement and you need a lawyer but it's really simple and cheap. 'We entered our details, declared what our savings and assets are and it gets checked by a lawyer. 'It cost us £25 and took about 20 minutes.' In the event of divorce, Cassie and Brendon have agreed to split all the earnings accumulated during their marriage by 50 per cent. The earnings accumulated before are their own. 'Prenuptial agreements are becoming more and more common these days – it's like taking out insurance. 'It hasn't impacted our relationship and we don't talk about it anymore. 'It's a good thing to have in place.' Keith Urban will allegedly receive $640,000 (£429k) for every year he is married to Nicole Kidman if they split . Beyonce and Jay-Z: Beyonce reportedly gets $5m (£3,349,634) with each child she bears and would receive $1m (£669,926) for every year the pair were married if they divorce. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban: Keith will allegedly receive $640,000 (£428,753) for every year the couple is married – unless he uses drugs . Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas: It's reported that if the Hollywood couple split she will receive $2.8m (£1,875,669) for every year of the marriage, and if he cheats on her she gets a $5m 'bonus'.","Cassie Newnham, 33, from London, wanted to protect her assets .

Estee Lauder has renewed her contract for the 21st year in a row, she has a lead role in the new (and unapologetically daft) US series The Royals and her swimwear line is selling well in Saks Fifth Avenue and Harrods. It's now nearly 21 years since the British actress, model and businesswoman  was catapulted into the spotlight at the Four Weddings and a Funeral Premiere. Scroll down for video . Looking regal at nearly 50: Elizabeth Hurley, pictured above promoting new US television series The Royals, puts her enduring beauty down to covering herself in moisturiser from a young age . Show-stopper: The Versace dress worn by Elizabeth at the premiere for Four Weddings and a Funeral put her on the front page of every newspaper. She calls the dress 'a landmark dress in fashion history' Just being on Hugh Grant's arm would have garnered headlines enough but famously pouring herself into that revealing black Versace dress saw her steal the entire show, even if she was thereafter constantly referred to as 'Hugh Grant's girlfriend'. Elizabeth tells the Times that the moment was actually less about her and all about the dress: 'It was such a landmark dress in fashion history. Like nothing to do with me. It was the dress.' The black, strappy ensemble, seemingly held together with large gold safety pins, kickstarted her previously quiet career which, two decades on, has seen her try her hand at everything from acting and modelling to owning her own organic food company and designing her own swimwear. Her looks have very much remained flawless despite the ageing process. Still pin thin, there's barely a wrinkle on her, something which she puts down to nothing more than a lifetime of lathering on moisturiser - with at least SPF30 if she's in the sun - and a great diet. If plenty of older female stars have spoken out about ageism against women recently, any obvious discrimination seems to have passed Elizabeth by. She says there are 'a lot of girls who are doing advertising campaigns who are my age or more. It's a very nice time as far as that's concerned.' 'Quite sexy': Elizabeth's new show The Royals sees her play Queen Helena, based on an 'obviously fictitious' royal family living in modern-day London. Joan Collins plays her mother and was handpicked by Elizabeth . Flawless skin (...and plenty of diamonds): The star (pictured left in a recent selfie) says she hasn't experienced ageism in Hollywood and has had her 21-year contract with Estee Lauder renewed . It's hard to believe but exercise has hardly featured 'for years' thanks to a gruelling work regime that means she doesn't find it easy to make time for working out. Her current schedule, she says, sees her picked up at dawn and not home until 8:30pm in the evening. New show The Royals, described as 'obviously fictitious' sees Elizabeth playing the character of Queen Helena reigning over modern-day England, with Joan Collins, who was handpicked by her, playing her mother. She says of the show: 'It's fun, it's a drama - it's not a comedy but it's lighthearted. It's quite sexy.' She admits that her 12-year-old son Damian, born in 2002 to entrepreneur Steve Bing, was privy to some of the racier scenes, having spent part of his school holidays on the set. Father and son: Liz fell pregnant in 2001 by business magnate Steve Bing. Although Mr Bing denied that Damian, now 12, (right) was his child, a DNA test proved otherwise . Taking a sabbatical from relationships: After plenty of romances including a marriage to Arun Nayar, an engagement to Shane Warne and a short friendship with financier David Yarrow, Elizabeth is enjoying a break . Still the one? They've been apart longer than they were together but the lives of Elizabeth and Hugh are still very much entwined with both being godparent to the other one's child. Hugh is pictured above with Elizabeth's son Damian at a fundraising event in 2013 . After a string of high-profile relationships, Elizabeth seems to be settling for the single life as she approaches her fifties. Speaking on The Jonathan Ross show, she said: 'I am single. On sabbatical. I'm busy at the moment, family, work, I'm working more now than I ever have been, no time for love.' Her life is, she readily admits, still entwined with former beau Hugh Grant's. Although the couple have now been apart for longer than they were together, there seems to be few signs of the friendship fading. The actor is godfather to her son Damian, born in 2002 to entrepreneur Steve Bing and she has returned the favour, being godmother to one of Hugh's daughters, Tabitha. She told Jonathan Ross: 'We're best friends. He lives next door to me and he's godfather to my son and I'm godmother to one of his children. 'We've been apart for longer than we were together. We were together for 13 years and then we've been best friends for 15.' When pushed by the television presenter on a possible romantic reunion, she dismissed the idea, saying: 'I don't think that's going to happen...but he's the best friend that anyone could have.' After a brief dalliance with Steve Bing which resulted in a DNA test to prove his paternity of Damian, she married Indian textile heir Arun Nayar in 2007 after a five-year relationship, with a ceremony in the UK and a lavish six-day ceremony in Jodhpur, India. A new episode in the life of Elizabeth: The star has been promoting new E! show The Royals . When the relationship crumbled five years ago, a series of headline-grabbing romances followed including an engagement to Australian cricketer Shane Warne. Her most recent paramour was said to be hedge-fund financier and wildlife photographer Steve Yarrow. It seems, with son Damian, a small herd of pets to nurture including five dogs, chickens, alpacas and piglets, that she already has more than enough affection in her life. 'I am much more country girl than town girl. When I had my son, it got quite difficult in London to get any privacy and so I bought a farm in the country, in Gloucestershire and lived out there for a while and did full-time farming.' The actress has a rather clever way too of filtering out calls to her office too. She's known by close family not as 'Liz' or 'Elizabeth' but an undisclosed moniker. 'No-one calls me Liz or Elizabeth. If someone rings the office and says anything about 'Liz', we know they've never met me.'","The British actress and businesswoman will turn 50 in June .

"Council boss Jo Stephenson, 59, who died after jumping from his roof had been 'stressed over plans to introduce new parking charges' A council boss who died after jumping from his roof had been 'stressed over plans to introduce new parking charges', an inquest heard. Father-of-two Cllr Jo Stephenson, 59, who was Lib Dem deputy leader of Cumbria County Council, died in hospital three weeks later from internal injuries. His wife Hilary told the inquest he had been under considerable pressure in the weeks before his death to push through the later-abandoned policy of fresh on-street parking across Cumbria. It was initially thought Mr Stephenson had accidentally fallen from his roof while carrying out some DIY on his Lake Windermere home in July last year. But Kendal Coroner's Court was told after hitting the ground Mr Stephenson dialled 999 - and admitted to the call handler he had thrown himself off on purpose. He then discussed ending his life with the paramedic at his home, as well as with staff at the Royal Preston Hospital, the inquest heard. The former Lakes School teacher was said to have been 'deeply distressed' by 'personal attacks' made towards him over the internet. These came as a result of the move to impose a parking tariff in 11 towns including Carlisle, Penrith, Cockermouth and Keswick. The plans were not introduced following a consultation that identified concerns about the inadequacy of the  enforcement regime. This resulted in him appearing 'distracted' in the fortnight before the incident. While in hospital the councillor suffered what was described as a 'psychotic episode' - attacking a pregnant nurse with a butter knife. Mental health consultant Dr Richard Morgan confirmed Mr Stephenson 'lashed out' at the pregnant nurse. He said the councillor also injured his own eye with the arm of his glasses and said he wished the attempt upon his life had been successful. Mr Stephenson's wife argued he was terrified, sleep-deprived and affected by medication at the time. She added she did not believe Mr Stephenson deliberately tried to end his life. He died on 25 July from a pulmonary embolism and bronchial pneumonia, with a stroke as a secondary factor. Giving a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Alan Sharpe stopped short of ruling Mr Stephenson had intended to take his own life but said the fall was 'no accident'. He discussed ending his life with the paramedic at his home, as well as with staff at the Royal Preston Hospital (pictured), the inquest heard . The South Cumbria deputy coroner stressed that while Mr Stephenson had told medics he had intended to take his own life, it was not certain he was thinking clearly at the time of his fall. He added: 'It's quite clear Jo Stephenson was very well-loved and liked and had lived a very successful life. 'It's quite clear from the transcript of the 999 call and from the evidence given by the paramedic that it was not an accident when he fell from the roof. 'Whatever his state of mind - he did jump.' His widow Hilary told the hearing despite the attacks he received in the months before his death, she had no regrets about him entering politics. Last year Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg led the tributes to respected Mr Stephenson. Mr Clegg said: 'I am very sad to hear of the death of Jo Stephenson, a much-loved and dedicated councillor and a great servant of his community. Prime Minister Nick Clegg led the tributes to Mr Stephenson describing him as a 'much-loved and dedicated councillor' 'He is a real loss to the Lib Dem family and will be greatly missed. 'My thoughts are with his family and friends at this awful time.' Mr Stephenson, who had previously worked as a solicitor and teacher, also ran a B&B near the scenic Lake Windermere, in Cumbria, and was a former leader of South Lakeland District Council. Labour Cllr Stewart Young said: 'We are all enormously shocked by this very sad news. 'I worked very closely with Jo since the 2013 elections and found him to be a very decent and honourable man. He will be thoroughly missed.' Clare Feeney-Johnson, a friend of Mr Stephenson and a fellow Lib Dem cabinet member, was also devastated by his death. She added: 'Jo was an inspiration for many of us and gave up so much of his time and resources in order to try and make Windermere and Cumbria a better place. 'All of our thoughts are with Hilary and his family at this very distressing time.' Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat MP for the South Lakes, said: 'Jo was a wonderful councillor, colleague and friend. 'He got involved in local politics, giving up a career in law because he wanted to make a difference to the community he loved.' County council chief executive Diane Wood said Mr Stephenson would be sorely missed, adding: 'This is a complete bolt from the blue because he appeared to be recovering so well.' James Airey, leader of the authority's opposition Conservative group, described Mr Stephenson as a 'a gentle, quiet and thoroughly decent family man'. Cllr Peter Thornton, Leader of SLDC, said: 'Jo was a much loved ward Councillor, and colleague. 'We will all miss him and the Members and staff of SLDC send our prayers and heartfelt sympathies to Hilary, his wife, and family.' Lawrence Conway, Chief Executive, SLDC said: 'Cllr Stephenson worked tirelessly for his community. 'He is a great loss to them and the Council. We shall all miss him'.

"A Russian opposition leader was forced to write hand-scrawled notes to his aide the day before he was shot dead near the Kremlin after claiming he feared he was being bugged. Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, was gunned down as he walked with his Ukrainian girlfriend, Anna Duritskaya on Friday night near Red Square. He was the most prominent opposition figure to be killed in Russia during Russian President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule. Former Russian deputy prime minister and opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was shot dead near the Kremlin last week. Before his death he feared he was being bugged . In his final note before his death, Mr Nemstov is claimed to have written about how he heard Russian paratroopers had been fighting in Ukraine. Pictured is the scene near to the Kremlin and Red Square after he was gunned down . Now it has emerged that the day before his death, Mr Nemtsov and close aide Olga Shorina were discussing a sensitive investigation he was preparing into Moscow's backing for separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine. But fearing that his conversations with Ms Shorina were being listened in on by the Kremlin, he resorted to writing instead of talking. In his final note, which has been shown to Reuters, Mr Nemtsov wrote: 'Some paratroopers from Ivanovo have got in touch with me. 17 killed, they didn't give them money, but for now they are frightened to talk.' Ms Shorina said: 'He did not want to say anything, just in case. He did not want to utter it out loud, which is why he wrote it down for me.' However, it has not been possible to independently confirm the authenticity of the handwritten note. Ms Shorina added that Mr Nemtsov has planned to publish one million copies of his report on Ukraine, in order to reach as wide an audience as possible. She explained that most of the material gathered for his report was from open sources, and that he had not been intending to reveal any explosive new information. However she said in the course of his research, he had been contacted by relatives of a group of Russian soldiers, who according to him has been in action in eastern Ukraine. He claimed they were the serviceman who were based in Ivanovo, a city 185 miles north east of Moscow, which houses units of the Russian military's 98th paratroop division. Mr Shorina added: 'He was maintaining contact with them. How he was maintaining contact with them, I don't know, he did not put me in touch with anyone.' Mr Nemtsov's mother, secretary and daughter pay their last respects at Mr Nemtsov's funeral. Ms Shorina added that Mr Nemtsov has planned to publish one million copies of his report on Ukraine . The aide said she and another Nemtsov associate, Ilya Yashin, would try to salvage the information Mr Nemtsov had been gathering and attempt to publish the report in a month. But as far as she was aware, he had only managed to write down a table of contents. She said that for previous reports, Mr Nemtsov had stored most of the information in his head, and would dictate it to her when he was ready. Meanwhile, Mr Yashin said he and Mr Nemtsov had spoken about the Ukraine report about a day and a half before his death. He said: 'He told me he had been in touch with relatives of Russian soldiers killed there and he was planning a trip to Ivanovo to talk to the parents of those killed soldiers. 'He said in the very near future he was going to assemble and put in order various evidence and documents directly proving the presence of the Russian military on the territory of Ukraine and, accordingly, (exposing) President's Putin's lies that there are no Russian servicemen there.' President Vladimir Putin has condemned the death of Mr Nemtsov, saying it was a shameful tragedy . Since last summer, reports have been circulating inside the country that many serving Russian troops have died in combat in eastern Ukraine, where the separatist war has killed more than 6,000 people. However, Moscow adamantly denies sending arms or troops to the region, saying any Russians fighting in Ukraine are volunteers. Mr Nemtsov's death came a week ago when after dining next to Red Sqaure, the 55-year-old was shot four times in the back. Putin has called his death a shameful tragedy, and the Kremlin has denied any involvement. Mr Nemtsov was part of a liberal opposisition in Russia and was almost never given any air time on state-run television and radio. In a campaign over many years to expose what he saw as Putin's misrule, Mr Nemtsov had previously published eight reports, including investigations into alleged corruption surrounding last year's Sochi Winter Olympics and into assets owned by the president and his circle .","Boris Nemtsov was gunned down last week in Moscow while with girlfriend .

"Drivers across America be warned - there's an 'unmanned' car on the road. A driverless car is currently on a cross-country road trip to test the state-of-the-art technology that allows a driver to sit back and relax with no hands on the wheel. Delphi Automotive launched the first coast-to-coast test of a driverless car on Sunday, starting at the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. For the next week, the specially rigged Audi SQ5 SUV will be headed on a 3,500 mile journey to New York City. It is expected to arrive before the New York International Auto Show on April 3, ending what Delphi Automotive describes as the 'longest automated drive ever attempted in North America' Scroll down for video . 'Look ma, no hands': Delphi Automotive started the first cross-county test drive of an automatic car (pictured), starting in San Francisco . Take off: Two people will be in the car at all times during the journey from San Francisco to New York for an automotive show . Test run: Delphi is using the cross-country trip to gather data and check on the car's safety systems . But Delphi insists that drivers on the road shouldn't be scared if they pass by their test vehicle. Two people will be in the car at all times to take over the controls in emergencies - or more often, construction zones. Delphi, one of the largest suppliers of automotive electronics and safety systems, is using the long journey in the Audi crossover to acquire 2.3 terabytes data from a sophisticated array of cameras, radar and lidar - a laser mapping technology. The Delphi drive kicked off March 22 near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, with plans to wind up in New York City just before the annual auto show opens there on April 3. During the coast-to-coast journey in the Audi, at least two Delphi engineers will be aboard, including one behind the wheel. The venture informed all of the states it will pass through about its unmanned car, and all of them agreed to let the vehicle travel on their roads. The car comes with 20 sensors including four short-range radars, three vision-based cameras, six lidars, a localization system and a driver assistance program. The Michigan-based firm also wants to test and demonstrate its wireless and active safety systems. Delphi's demonstration underscores growing interest and investments by automakers and suppliers in self-driving cars, some of which could be production-ready by 2020. Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, sees the automated driver assistance systems in the Audi as building blocks on the road to fully self-driving cars in the next decade. Delphi has been working on automated cars since 1999, when it split from GM, according to Ars Technica. Google, which has also been working on self-driving cars, has made public statements about having such a vehicle available in five years. The tech giant has been testing out its vehicles around its Mountain View, California, campus. Tesla Motors, the electric car brainchild of Elon Musk, also announced last week that new software out this summer will let cars be largely automatic on the highway. Smart car: The Audi is decked out with a range of sensors (pictured) that include our short-range radars, three vision-based cameras and six lidars, a laser mapping technology . Making improvements: Delphi, one of the largest suppliers of automotive electronics and safety systems, is using the long journey in the Audi crossover to acquire data from a sophisticated array of cameras and radars . The Audi heading to New York will be able to stop and proceed at four-way stops and find the best way to get around cyclists, according to Delphi. It can also navigate complicated procedures such as merging on to the highway. Though commuters may be dreaming of kicking back on the way to work, Owens said, 'our view is that the driver is going to be in the seat for a long time' in case of emergency situations. During the coast-to-coast journey, one of two engineers aboard will be behind the wheel. Delphi will now test such functions as traffic jam assist, automated highway pilot with lane change and automated parking and valet. All of those systems are expected to be introduced in production cars over the next two to three years. The car had previously been tested on the streets of Las Vegas during the CES 2015 conference and has been on road trips between the Bay Area and Los Angeles. Video of the car's steering wheel moving on its own can be seen on YouTube. Fully automated systems that may be phased in after 2020 could add about $5,000 to the cost of a car, estimates Glen De Vos, vice president of advanced and product engineering for Delphi's electronics and safety division. Car of the future? Development times for self-driving cars (pictured) vary, with Google saying it could have one on the road in five years . Safety first: The firm also wants to test and demonstrate its active safety systems (above) designed to prevent crashes and keep the car in its lane . The car and its potential human drivers will not travel at night or in difficult weather as they make their way to New York . Delphi is providing some of the components and technology, including vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, for GM's Super Cruise automated driving system, which will debut in 2016 on the new Cadillac CT6 sedan. During the cross-country trek, the vehicle will be challenged under a variety of driving conditions from changing weather and terrain to potential road hazards -- things that could never truly be tested in a lab. The Audi will avoid harsh weather and not drive at night, according to PC Mag. It will drive about eight hours a day. While states such as California are just beginning to allow testing of automated vehicles, all of the states the car will pass through are allowing the unmanned car on their roads. Delphi director John Absmeier said that once the automation system is tested it will be applicable to any car model. An Italian company took a driverless van 8,000 miles from Europe to China in 2010.","Delphi Automotive began cross-country test of driverless vehicle on Sunday .

"A time capsule hidden inside the walls of a California home in 1978 was finally reunited with its owner, who placed it there when he was only 12 years old. Robert Wright, 49, flew from Texas with his father to their former home in Fontana to pick up the 37-year-old time capsule that Wright once hid while his family was remodeling the house. Inside he placed a signed note, a few coins, a newspaper cutting and a McDonald's scratch card. Robert Wright (pictured left as a 12-year-old and right today) was reunited with a time capsule he hid inside the walls of his home in 1978 . The 12-year-old Wright explained in the note that his dad was redoing the wall's paneling, which gave him the chance to hide the note away. He also provided 'proof' of the date with a newspaper clipping . In the note, Wright wrote: 'Hello to whoever finds this. My name is Robert Wright. Today my dad is putting up paneling. Today is November 18th, 1978, 15 till 12:00 noon'. 'I'm 12 years old and a student at Fontana JR. High, 7th grade. I am 5'3, blond hair, hazel eyes.' 'Here is proof of the date. Robert Wright.' Wright told ABC News it was 'surreal' to be reunited with the capsule he never thought he'd seen again. The capsule was a 'spur-of-the-moment idea', according to Wright, who quickly gathered some trinkets from his room before his dad sealed the interior wall he was redoing. He tore off a newspaper and threw in the McDonald's ticket to prove the date. The capsule wasn't unearthed until six years ago when Greg Sandoval, the home's current owner, was doing a renovation of his own. Sandoval struggled to find Wright's contact information or profile on Facebook but didn't have the heart to throw it away. The plastic bag capsule contained a note, coins - and this scratchcard from a McDonald's restaurant . The capsule wasn't unearthed until six years ago, when the home's current owner Greg Sandoval and his wife were doing a renovation of their own . After six years he decided 'to do something about it' and reached out to his local ABC station in Los Angeles in December. The segment aired on a local ABC affiliate in Houston and Wright was soon inundated with phone calls. He told ABC News: 'I watched the video link and was like, ""Oh my gosh. This is me. I am that Robert Wright.""' Wright, who works in orthopedics in Austin, got in touch with Sandoval and decided he would personally pick up the capsule when he had to fly down to California in a few months for a conference. The father-of-two now plans to continue the tradition with his boys, aged eight and nine, when they remodel their home this summer. 'Maybe 50 years from now, someone will find their things,' Wright said. 'And they'll have a cool story to tell.' Sandoval struggled to find Wright's contact information or profile on Facebook but he didn't have the heart to throw it away, so he contacted contacted his local ABC station - and Wright saw the segment .

"Guilty: Michael Hood, who has been jailed for eight years for raiding an Edinburgh jewellers . An armed robber who stole £1.35 million in a raid on a central Edinburgh jewellers has been sentenced to eight years in prison. Michael Hood, 32, from Royston Mains Edinburgh acted as getaway driver for a three man gang which made off with luxury watches and jewellery following the robbery on a Hamilton and Inches store in the Scottish capital. The gang, armed with machetes and axes, terrorised shoppers in the day-light raid on the prosperous shopping area in George Street, the High Court in Livingston, West Lothian heard. The jury found Hood guilty of robbery for his involvement. He was given a shorter sentence for driving the white BMW in which the trio made their escape. Sentencing Hood to eight years, backdated to July last year when he was first remanded, Judge Lord Glennie said the armed raid was 'a very serious offence'. 'You snatched a very valuable collection of watches and jewellery from one of the principal shopping streets in Edinburgh,' Lord Glennie said. 'The gang, of which its been found you formed a part, armed with machetes and axes clearly terrorised the people within the shop. 'Your role was clearly that of the getaway driver although, as part of the gang, you bear equal responsibility in law,' he added. During the trial the jury was shown CCTV footage of the armed robbers smashing display cabinets and emptying the contents of displays into rucksacks in the professional-looking 90-second operation. The gang, armed with machetes and axes, terrorised shoppers in the day-light raid on the Hamilton and Inches store in Edinburgh . The trio ordered staff to lie on the floor before smashing their way through armoured glass display cabinets to grab fistfuls of valuables. The robbers took rings, necklaces and a collection of gem-studded Patek Phillipe timepieces which alone were worth £580,000 . The three men - wearing identical balaclavas and boiler suits - took rings, necklaces and a collection of gem-studded Patek Phillipe timepieces which alone were worth £580,000. The trio, armed with machetes and axes, ordered staff to lie on the floor before smashing their way through armoured glass display cabinets to grab fistfuls of valuables. Some criticism was raised over police conduct during the investigation into the robbery. Defending QC Mark Stewart claimed the evidence against his client had been 'tainted' and 'polluted' by senior officers from Police Scotland's Serious Crime Squad and compared their tactics to the actions of corrupt cops in the fictional 70s TV series The Sweeney. Hood was eventually linked to the crime through DNA evidence which was found in two getaway cars used. Senior Investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Houston said the convivtion had come about 'as a result of excellent police work across a number of police forces.' 'This robbery left several members of staff extremely shaken and caused extensive damage to the premises on top of the loss of the luxury items,' Houston said. 'His conviction today should serve as a reminder that offences of this nature will not be tolerated and those found to be responsible will be brought to task,' he added.","Michael Hood, 32, from Edinburgh was getaway driver for the armed gang .

"It is an English landscape of quintessential beauty, whose many shades of green contrast sharply with the red, loamy soil: a place of steep, broad hills and ancient stone churches, where magnificent open vistas stretch from the crags of Dartmoor to the sea at Dawlish. South East Devon has inspired many writers, such as Thomas Hardy, Michael Morpurgo and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. But today, one of its jewels, Haldon Ridge, in the heart of an officially designated Area of Great Landscape Value close to the Dartmoor National Park, is being desecrated. Thanks to a company controlled by Harry Lopes, the former underwear model who is the son-in-law of the Duchess of Cornwall, running along the road at the top of the Ridge for close to a mile is the edge of a giant 50-acre solar panel energy farm. Scroll down for video . Eyesore: The 50-acre solar farm on Haldon Ridge lies on an official Area of Great Landscape Value . Thanks to a company controlled by Harry Lopes, the former underwear model who is the son-in-law of the Duchess of Cornwall, the solar farm sits at the top of the ridge . Mr Lopes and his colleagues – who include spokeswoman Sophy Fearnley-Whittingstall, sister of the TV chef and River Cottage author Hugh – developed the farm and got it through the planning process. They have now sold their interest to sister company Belltown Power. Belltown and Solstice share the same investor, Berti Investments, while ‘green’ financier Seth Tabatznik is a director of all three firms. Without the huge subsidies added to consumers’ bills, the solar panel business would not be profitable. Ms Fearnley-Whittingstall refuses to divulge how much Solstice – in which Mr Lopes owns 115,000 shares - has been paid, saying this information is ‘commercially sensitive’. An internal report by the local Teignbridge Council’s heritage and landscape officer, Olwen Maidment, described the solar panel development as ‘not sympathetic to the character of the locality’, warning that it would ‘detract from its scenic quality’. However, it was awarded planning permission late last year without ever being discussed by the council’s planning committee. On its website, Lopes’s firm, Solstice Renewables, claims the farm ‘sits within its own bowl, largely hidden from the surrounding landscape’. In fact, seen from the air, it dominates it: a Y-shaped hilltop sprawl with line after line of black, reflective panels on metal frames. As Maidment’s report makes clear, the farm is visible from Hay Tor, a popular hiking and picnic spot ten miles away on Dartmoor. The ranks of panels loom over Ashcombe, a gorgeous village with water meadows and a Grade I listed 13th Century church. The ranks of panels loom over Ashcombe, a gorgeous village with water meadows and a Grade I listed 13th Century church . The Ashcombe estate’s owner, Ralph Rayner, refused to say yesterday how much he was being paid for the use of his land. His only comment was to complain that we had flown over the solar farm without seeking his permission. The Solstice website makes much of a pledge, issued by Sophy Fearnley-Whittingstall, to pay £6,500 a year for a ‘community benefit fund’ for projects such as improved local internet connections. Yet, next to the vast amounts the farm will rake in, most of it from subsidy, this pales into insignificance. The Mail on Sunday asked John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a specialist think-tank, to compute the sums, given the panels’ supposed output of 6.5 megawatts. He said: ‘The total annual income will be about £770,000, of which about £430,000 a year will be from subsidy under the Renewable Obligation scheme, ie over 50 per cent of their annual income will be from subsidy.’ This is about 60 times as much as might be expected as income from growing wheat. When The Mail on Sunday asked about the figures, Mr Lopes and Sophy Fearnley-Whittingstall issued a statement. This referred only to the legality of the farm’s planning permission, adding that the site would eventually be surrounded by newly planted hedges. ‘Once [these] have had a chance to grow in, no one will be able to see it,’ the statement said. ‘Not only is the solar park helping to cut carbon emissions and increase our energy security, it will result in a huge improvement in ecology and biodiversity, with the creation of habitats for nightjars and skylarks being just one example of measures that have been built into the design.’ In Maidment’s view, while planting hedges might reduce the impact, the site’s exposed and windy location meant the hedges were ‘unlikely to survive’. In the money: Tom Parker-Bowles (right) at the races with his sister Laura (left) and her mother the Duchess of Cornwall . Moreover, this large industrial project was completely at odds with the landscape, and ‘the panels will stand out from the surrounding green fields and be a focal point in views… given the high scenic quality of the valley and sensitivity of the viewpoints along public footpaths and access land, the adverse effect on these views is considered significant.’ The council planning committee never discussed or voted on the solar farm because the local ward member, Lib Dem Alan Connett, decided not to refer it – as he was entitled to do. The Monk of Haldon . Never, I ween, has fairer scene – . Sapphire-blue and emerald-green, . With the glow of the red red rock between, . Bathed in a glory of golden sheen,– . Gladdened your heart, or dazzled your een. There tarry a while, and gaze your fill, . From Berry Head to Portland Bill; . Or turn your face to the north if you will, . Where the Dartmoor range lies gloomy and still, . And I’ll wager a crown . When you get back to town, . Bright visions will haunt you of Haldon Hill. By R.H.D. Barham, whose poem features Haldon Hill - where the solar farm now sits . ‘I was content for the officers to deal with it,’ he said. Other councillors were more vociferous. ‘I was amazed when I saw how big it is,’ said Tory Chris Clarance. ‘I would very much have liked it to go to the committee. It is a scar on the landscape.’ Climate historian Tony Brown, who lives nearby, said: ‘That so much pristine countryside can be swallowed without anyone picking this up through the democratic process suggests the system has failed. We’ve ended up with an eyesore when we have no need for it.’ In October, Environment Secretary Liz Truss told this newspaper that large solar farms were ‘ugly, a blight on the countryside’. In the middle of the 19th Century, the Devonshire poet R. H. D. Barham wrote the poem, The Monk Of Haldon – part of which is reproduced on the right – describing the very spot where the farm, now nearing completion, lies. There is no fairer scene anywhere, he writes. On the Ashcombe estate website, Mr Rayner describes himself and his family as ‘custodians’ of its landscape. Asked whether he thought the poet might have thought the solar farm added to its beauty, he again refused to comment. In an email response yesterday, Sophy Fearnley-Whittingstall said: ‘Overall this planning application received substantially more letters of support than objections. We believe the benefit to the public in the long run will outweigh any negativity.’ An earlier version of this article has been amended to make clear that Solstice Renewables and Harry Lopes has sold its interest in the scheme to an associated company Belltown Power which will receive the green subsidies and has been responsible for construction. The article previously described the farm as “permanent”. In fact permission is for 25 years.","Harry Lopes' company developed 50-acre solar panel farm on ridge in Devon .

"Ultra-conservative MP Fred Nile has lashed out at Sydney's Mardi Gras celebration, saying parenting, 'not promiscuity' should be celebrated. The Christian Democratic Party NSW MP made his comments on his official Facebook page just as the party was getting underway across Sydney and came as a television advertisement was aired during the parade, which claimed same-sex marriage would disadvantage children. A spokeswoman for Mr Nile, who spent the day campaigning in Coffs Harbour, said the post was designed to remind people of the importance of traditional relationships. Scroll down for video . Ultra-conservative politician Fred Nile has lashed out at Sydney's Mardi Gras celebration, saying parenting not promiscuity should be celebrated. Mr Nile posted this image to his official Facebook account on Saturday, just as Mardi Gras Parade celebrations were getting underway. Marriage equality advocates have slammed an advertisement that aired during Sydney's Mardi Gras celebrations on Saturday night claiming children from same-sex couples are disadvantaged. 'With so much coverage and celebration of Mardi Gras, it's important to also be thankful for natural relationships - for the mum and the dad,' the spokeswoman said. 'Without that traditional relationship, natural reproduction wouldn't be possible. It's very important to celebrate natural couples and those values.' His controversial comments came as an advertisement claiming same-sex marriage disadvantaged children aired on TV on Saturday night. It was organised and paid for by the Australian Marriage Forum, a group 'disappointed with the one-sided debate' surrounding the issue. The 40-second spot starts with a mother at a park saying: 'We hear a lot about marriage equality, but what about equality for kids?' Dr David Gend, president of the Australian Marriage Forum and a family doctor based in Toowoomba, Queensland, says in the commercial that 'so-called marriage equality forces a child to miss out on a mother or a father'. The Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby accused the commercial of not only missing the point on marriage equality, but of also attempting to fight a losing battle. 'That's not equality; that's not marriage,' Dr Gend says. It also asks for supporters to donate money to the group. Marriage equality advocates have slammed the ad, and said the campaign is trying to mislead people on the issue. 'The first point for us is that marriage equality and same-sex couples having children are two different equations,' GLRL Co-Convenor Justin Koonin told Daily Mail Australia. 'Same-sex couples already can and do have children - marriage equality is not going to change that. 'If the people behind this video were really thinking of the children, they would support marriage equality so that all kids, including those with same-sex parents, could say their parents are married.' Mr Koonin also said most Australians could see through claims that marriage equality disadvantages children, and that most had 'moved on' from that discussion. 'They definitely aren't fooling anyone,' he said. 'If they want to make that claim, have some evidence to support it. 'The majority of evidence shows there is no disadvantage to children with same-sex parents, and in fact most are slightly better off than average.' Dr David Gend, president of the Australian Marriage Forum says in the commercial that 'so-called marriage equality forces a child to miss out on a mother or a father'. The controversial Australian Marriage Forum commercial starts with a mother at a park saying: 'We hear a lot about marriage equality, but what about equality for kids?' The commercial has been widely criticised on social media, with more than 1200 people disliking the video on YouTube, compared to just 150 who liked it. According to its website, the Australian Marriage Forum is 'an organisation that has been set up to encourage Australians to discuss the issue of same-sex marriage with some discernment and caution.' It also states marriage equality would 'have enormous consequences on our culture' and calls for a 'open and honest debate...free of the intimidation that so many defenders of natural marriage have been subject to in recent years.'","Image  Fred Nile posted reads 'parenting, not promiscuity worth celebrating'

"A 79-year-old man has been given five years probation for filming a teenage German male exchange student with a secret camera hidden in a clock. Lloyd Lindquist of Leesburg, Florida, pleaded guilty to video voyeurism on Friday as part of a plea deal which also prohibits him from having unsupervised contact with minors. The host was arrested last after the youngster, who was attending Tavares High School, told police he found a device hidden in his bathroom clock. Lloyd Lindquist of Leesburg, Florida, pleaded guilty to video voyeurism on Friday as part of a plea deal which also prohibits him from having unsupervised contact with minors . On closer inspection, he then discovered a USB port and memory card attached to the device. The student had been living with Lindquist since August 2013, but didn't find the camera until May 2014. The boy searched for the hidden gadget after noticing Lindquist had searched for 'spy cameras' on his browsing history. Scott Herman, an attorney for Linduist, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'In the end, it was a difficult decision for Lloyd to enter a plea. 'In my opinion, the evidence against him was not nearly as lewd as the initial report made it out to be.' The teenager's mother has also started a civil suit against Lindquist, and is seeking $15,000 in damages. It states the boy had an 'expectation of privacy' and was left severely emotionally distressed as a result.

"Charged: Stacie Laughton, 31, allegedly called in a bomb threat to a New Hampshire hospital . A New Hampshire ex-official believed to be the first transgender person elected to a state legislature was charged on Thursday with calling in a bomb threat to a hospital, police said. Police arrested 31-year-old Stacie Laughton of Nashua on Thursday following the February 27 threat to Southern New Hampshire Medical Center. Police evacuated the building but found no suspicious device. An investigation led police to issue a warrant for Laughton's arrest; the Nashua resident complied. Calls weren't being accepted Thursday at a phone listed for Laughton. In 2012, Laughton was elected to the state House of Representatives but never took the seat, resigning after reports of a prior felony conviction raised questions about Laughton's legal ability to serve. The state's Ballot Law Commission denied Laughton's request to run again last year, saying Laughton's 2008 convictions for identity fraud and falsifying evidence disqualified the would-be candidate until 2018, when a suspended sentence ends. Laughton was charged on Thursday with making a false report regarding explosives, a felony that can bring up to 7 years in prison if convicted. Laughton was released on $50,000 bond and is due back in court in April. Laughton expressed remorse for alleged actions and blamed them on an untreated mental illness. 'I have had a mental illness my whole life, and I guess this was my worst break with it. I was untreated for a long time, and I didn't have medication,' Laughton told the New Hampshire Union Leader following her arrest. 'I wasn't trying to hurt anyone, and it was totally out of character for me. I have put a lot behind me, and I never thought I would do this in a million years,' she told the newspaper. Stacie Laughton was born Barry C. Laughton Jr. and was convicted twice in Nashua before she ever turned 20. Bomb threat: Police arrested 31-year-old Stacie Laughton of Nashua on Thursday following the February 27 threat to Southern New Hampshire Medical Center (pictured) Police told The Patch that in 2002 she was charged with domestic violence/criminal mischief after an argument with her father during which she smashed a plate. In 2003 she was charged with sexual assault involving a woman from whom she was renting a rorom. 'Those charges were eventually dropped,' Laughton told The Patch in 2012 following her resignation from her elected position. Convicted felon: In 2012, Laughton was elected to the state House of Representatives but never took the seat, resigning after reports of a prior felony conviction raised questions about Laughton's legal ability to serve . 'In fact, she still lives in the city, and we see each other from time to time, and we are pleasant. It's as if those years never happened,' she said. Laughton said three years ago that she hopes to run for office again someday despite her sordid past. Her criminal history will prevent her from doing so. 'After I got out of prison I felt like it was a new start for me. I began my transformation, from who I had been for all those years, to who I really was,' Laughton said. 'And ever since that that day, I do something, every day to try to better myself, or help someone else. I am trying to be the best person I can be, and put the past behind me, once and for all. ' wanted change:  'After I got out of prison I felt like it was a new start for me.

"A niece of one of the victims of the Germanwings crash is haunted by the 'atrocious' thought that her uncle spent the last eight minutes of his life knowing he was going to die. Sandrine Driessens, niece of 59-year-old Belgian father and grandfather Christian Driessens, said that the thought was 'very hard'. 'My uncle certainly knew that he was living his last moments and it's very hard to hear that the descent of the aircraft lasted eight minute,' she told La Provence newspaper. Scroll down for video . Loving: Christian Driessens, 59, pictured second from right, was a keen traveller. He was killed when the Germanwings A320 crashed in the Alps on Tuesday . Happy: Although Christian Driessens' niece said she was haunted by the idea that he knew he was going to die for eight minutes while the plane was descending, an aviation expert has said that it is more likely that the passengers and crew were calm and did not realise that they were in mortal danger . 'For eight long minutes, he was dying. This is atrocious! I dare not imagine the horror of parents who tried to protect their babies in this airplane.' But a veteran A320 pilot has said that the passengers would have been unlikely to know that they were going to die. If anything, he said, the plane would have been filled with 'eerie silence'. 'It is likely that there was a problem with the pilots, as they put the plane into descent but failed to control it,' said Tony Newton, who is also an examiner for Britain's Civil Aviation Authority. 'The aircraft descended at fairly normal rate, in a fairly normal way. It was steep, but I have used steeper descents on a regular basis. It was well within the everyday operation and not in any way terrifying.' It is likely the oxygen masks were released, he said, and if passengers did not put them on quickly enough they may have lost consciousness. There also may have been 'unpleasant noises and wind effects', which may have caused some alarm. But the plane was not 'tumbling out of the sky in a screaming dive'. 'The crew was probably sitting there waiting for the pilot to complete the descent,' he said. 'There was probably no indication to passengers of what the end was going to be. 'There may have been some panic when they saw the mountains coming up through the windows, but it would have been brief. 'Either way, in my experience, passengers tend to stay absolutely silent during an emergency. 'It's not a Hollywood panic, it's an eerie silence.' Mr Driessens, born in Kinshasha, had returned to Belgium in 1960 and lived in Couvin and Mons. After meeting his Catalan born wife, Monserat Domingo, the couple settled down in Palleja, 25 km from Barcelona. They had three sons aged 17 to 31, and three grandchildren. 'He was a wonderful man who loved his family above all,' said Ms Driessens. 'For more than 30 years he travelled almost weekly in his job. But in this family we're birds. Drissens are globe-trotters who love to travel.'","Sandrine Driessens, niece of 59-year-old Belgian father and grandfather Christian, said the thought is 'very hard'

"Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has had a giggle at Education Minister Christopher Pyne’s expense after Today Show host Karl Stefanovic showed her the Star Wars parody video featuring Pyne’s now infamous ‘I’m a fixer' line. Stefanovic introduced the clip called 'Star Wars: Fixed', which superimposes Pyne's head onto the body of a imperial officer and blends his recent Sky News interview with a scene from the beloved movie franchise, by asking ‘what’s going on with Christopher Pyne? He’s gone to the dark side, Mr Fix It’. ‘You may not be aware of this but he’s been hired for his specialist skills by an unlikely source,’ Stefanovic joked. Bishop watched the parody, in which Pyne is heard pledging ‘I’m a fixer, I’ve fixed it in another way which you’ll find out in the budget', on a monitor in Canberra. Bishop laughed: ‘I wouldn’t be the first person to think that Christopher Pyne comes straight out of a Star Wars movie.’ Scroll down for video . Today Show host Karl Stefanovic showed Foreign Minister Julie Bishop a parody video starring the Education Minister and her reaction was perfect . Education Minister Christopher Pyne plays the leading role in a parody video, Star Wars: The Fixer . ‘Well said Minister… may the force be with you,’ Stefanovic responded. The parody clip, which shows Pyne in connection to the evil Empire's super weapon the Death Star, was first shown on the ABC on Sunday. Mr Pyne's memorable lines from his recent Sky News interview, where he explained how he had 'fixed' the government's higher education reforms and gave himself the nickname of 'the fixer', are seamlessly inserted into a scene from the iconic movie. Pyne's confident comments in the Sky interview were ahead of the government's latest attempt to pass higher education reforms, which were later shot down in the Senate for the second time in three months. In the video, a superimposed Pyne comforts a collection of imperial officers worried about the vulnerability of their planet-destroying space station, as the ruthless, rebel-crushing Darth Vader menacingly stalks around behind him. The video was created by Huw Parkinson, and aired during ABC's Insiders on Sunday morning. Bishop watched the parody, in which Pyne is heard pledging 'I'm a fixer, I've fixed it' The spoof, created by ABC producer Huw Parkinson, blends Pyne's cringe-worthy Sky News interview and a scene from the famous trilogy . Mr Parkinson said he was inspired to make the video after watching Mr Pyne's 'bizarre' interview. 'His delivery was so theatrical despite the fact he barely moved a muscle though out the entire interview,' Mr Parkinson said. 'I didn't really know how I was going to work it into something but I just knew it was going to work. 'I played around with a few different ideas at first but then once I started toying with this scene from Star Wars it just became clear that this was a perfect match.' Mr Parkinson also said he was 'working on a few other' videos, but didn't want to spoil the surprise. 'I wouldn't want to promise a video that I can't finish, and there's always the possibility that another classic moment like this Fixer interview will occur in the meantime,' he said. Labor MP Ed Husic tweeted about his enjoyment of the video, saying it was 'the best thing (he'd) seen' in a long time. Mr Pyne's office did not have any comment on the video on Sunday morning. However, the Minister tweeted that he is 'available for Star Wars VII if JJ Abrams wants to know' on Sunday afternoon.

"When Kelly Lynn Miller appeared at a press conference in Thailand on Wednesday, the American fugitive didn't appear to take the hearing about her extradition very seriously - resting her head on her hands in boredom and casually applying lip-gloss through the proceedings. Authorities say the 36-year-old has been on the run for six years after fleeing the U.S.  to avoid a five-year prison sentence for killing truck driver Donald Goodwin, 57, in a 2004 drunk-driving accident. She managed to evade detection, and even give birth recently, by constantly moving around a set of Thai islands. On Thursday,  Goodwin's younger sister Faye Dees spoke out to the Daily Mail Online, saying she wasn't at all surprised by Miller's nonchalant behavior in Thailand based on how she reacted to her brother's death and interacted with the family at trial nearly a decade ago. Victim: Kelly Lynn Miller, right, was arrested in Thailand on Tuesday after  years on the run. She was supposed to report to prison for hitting and killing truck-driver Donald Goodwin, left, in 2004, but instead fled the country . Dees, 66, says Miller didn't even try to help her brother after fatally striking him with her car in 2004, according to a witness at the scene who spoke to her. ‘She didn’t seem too concerned about Donny’s life according to the first witness on the scene. She didn't even know she had hit him,' Dees said. When the witness asked Miller if she knew Goodwin, she 'didn't even know who he was talking about'. The witness 'ran up there immediately to see if he would render any help and [Miller] just got on the phone and started calling for help. She was just so uncaring.’ Unmoved: On Thursday, Goodwin's sister spoke out to the Daily Mail Online, and said she was surprised by Miller's nonchalant behavior at a press conference in Thailand on Wednesday (above). Faye Dees, 66, says Miller acted similarly during her homicide trial in 2006 and 2007 . Return: On Wednesday, Thai police held a conference announcing the arrest of Miller and her upcoming extradition back to the U.S. She reportedly gave birth to a baby boy two months ago, who will also be sent back to the U.S. Goodwin had apparently pulled over to the emergency lane to check the tires on his tractor-trailer when Miller drunkenly swerved and side-swept the hauler - instantly killing Goodwin, according to AL.com. When Dees was finally able to confront Miller at her sentencing hearing in 2007, she and the rest of the Goodwin family were met with 'attitude' from the convict. 'When we were allowed to get up and make a comment to the judge...there were times she had facial expressions like ""I can’t believe what you’re saying."" She just had an impression like she just didn’t understand what the big deal was,' Dees recalled. Dees says she and the rest of the family first found out about Miller's arrest Wednesday afternoon, when a reporter contacted her elderly mother, 87. 'She was pretty upset about it. She lives alone and she’s wasn’t feeling particularly well and she got the news just out of the blue...She was really too upset to talk.,' Dees said. She says before his death, Goodwin purchased a 7-acre property across the street from his mother's house and had taken time off to care for her when she underwent a quadruple bi-pass surgery. Another life: Miller said the father of her child is an American national living in Thailand legally, who did not know she was a fugitive . 'He was counting down the days to when he could retire,' Dees said. 'He was going to retire at 62 and he was just trying to work on his little piece of land.' Goodwin left behind a son now in his 30s, also named Donald, and was divorced. Goodwin's younger brother Larry also spoke with the Daily Mail Online, and said his brother's passing was 'real tough' on the son. When asked what she would tell Miller, if she had the opportunity, Dees said: 'I would just let her know that the whole family is elated that she has finally been caught. We didn’t think she ever would be, but justice is going to prevail for her.' 'I hope she has additional time added onto the original sentence and I hope it’s as much as they can possibly give her. I don’t know what they can do. I hope she doesn’t get off any time for good behavior or anything like that. ‘[Goodwin's] life did matter to his family and to people that cared about him. It may not have mattered to her,' Dees said. Miller is set to be extradited back to the U.S. soon. She was arrested Tuesday on the remote island of Koh Lanta, according to the Thai publication Phutketwan, about a month after authorities received a tip. Tourist Police officials said the 36-year-old woman had been moving between Koh Lanta, Samui and Hang islands without a current visa. Paradise lost: Miller was on the remote island of Koh Lanta when she was arrested by tourist police in Thailand on Tuesday. Above, a view of the island . Investigators said Miller delivered her son two months ago in a small clinic on the island of Samui, and his birth was not registered. It's believed that the father is an American national living in Thailand legally. The baby will also be deported back to the U.S. Thai authorities believe Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to her to help her make ends meet. After the 2004 crash, Miller was arrested  on DUI charges but released the next day after posting $1,000 bond. In 2006, a Jefferson County jury indicted Miller on a charge of vehicular homicide. She was re-arrested but again freed from jail after posting $10,000 bond. Miller was expected to go on trial in January 2007 but pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison. Before Miller was set to report to prison, she took off and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010. Following her arrest in Thailand Tuesday, Miller allegedly admitted to police that she flew into Bangkok in January 2009 and then spent the next six years traveling on an expired visa.","Fugitive Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was arrested in Thailand this week .

"As a famous actor, Juliet Stevenson may be used to walking past crowds of adoring fans and the paparazzi on the red carpet. But she was unprepared for the adulation she received while filming a biopic about Mother Teresa in the slums of India. As she passed through the slums, locals dropped to the ground believing the Nobel Peace Prize winner had been brought back to life to care for the poor. Scroll down for video . Juliet Stevenson was treated like a saint while filming a biopic on the Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa . Stevenson, who is not a Christian, was wary of taking on the role but said it had been a 'wonderful challenge' Stevenson told The Observer: 'I was filming in her iconic white sari with the blue stripes. 'People would come up to me, drop and touch my hem...in India, she's still revered. She lifted tens of thousands of people off the streets and into her care.' Stevenson, who starred in films such as Truly, Madly, Deeply, The Politician's Wife and Accused, is heading the cast of the forthcoming feature film about Mother Teresa, The Letters. The biopic explores the life of the saint through letters she wrote to her longtime friend and spiritual advisor, Father Celeste van Exem over a nearly 50-year period. The letters, published in 2007, revealed her crisis of faith and the torment of feeling Jesus had abandoned her. Mother Teresa, who died in 1997 aged 87, became one of the 20th century's most influential religious figures. She founded an international order - the Missionaries of Charity - in the slums of Calcutta dedicated to the poor, disabled and dying. She won the Noble Peace Prize in 1979 for her role in founding the order and by the time of her death, it had grown to more than 4,000 sisters running orphanages, hospices and charity centres in 133 countries. The film partly draws on Mother Teresa's secret letters, published in 2007 revealing her crisis of faith . The biopic will be released this year in the hope it coincides with Mother Teresa's canonisation . Stevenson, who is not religious, was initially wary of taking on the role but said it had been a 'wonderful challenge'. To perfect the role, Stevenson watched and listened 'endlessly' to historic recordings of Mother Teresa. She told The Observer: 'It was very daunting, because I'm so wrong for her. I'm 5ft 8in, quite strongly built. I'm not in any way miniature (Mother Teresa was only 5ft). 'I don't have a religious faith and she believed so ardently in God. I also couldn't differ from her more when it comes to her views on women's rights, birth control and abortion...but it was a wonderful challenge.' There was an early screening  of The Letters at the Vatican, at the International Catholic film festival last year. Its cast also includes 85-year-old Swedish actor Max von Sydow and Rutger Hauer, who won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor in Escape from Sobibor. It is directed by William Riead who was inspired by Richard Attenborough's Oscar-winning film Gandhi. The biopic will be released this year in the hope it coincides with Mother Teresa's canonisation.","As actress passed through slums in costume, locals dropped to the ground .

"While many of her colleagues have succumbed to the temptations of Botox and plastic surgery, Cate Blanchett has always been outspoken in her views about ageing gracefully. Both on screen and on the red carpet, she always radiates with a natural beauty - but while Cate has avoided going under the knife or being jabbed with needles, she still relies on some beauty secrets to keep her looking her best.

"She's best friends with Kendall Jenner, has one of the most unique looks in the industry and is currently riding high as one of the most popular Victoria's Secret models. And 19-year-old Gigi Hadid, the Los Angeles-born blonde beauty, is quick becoming one of the biggest names in the fashion industry. From being named as the face of VSPink, to landing herself yet another campaign with American super-brand Guess, Gigi has been making serious waves in the modelling industry. Scroll down for video . 19-year-old Gigi Hadid who hails from Los Angeles is quickly becoming one of the top models in the world, having landed herself incredible campaigns and making a name for herself on the fashion scene . Of course, she has all the makings of a supermodel, and it's not just about her obvious good looks and jet-setting lifestyle. Gigi, of course, runs with a seriously cool crowd. As well as Kendall, she's often spotted hanging out with Cara Delevingne or partying with Justin Bieber. And she's already bagged herself the ultimate model accessory: a popstar boyfriend. Gigi has been dating Australian singer Cody Simpson on and off since 2013. And at the moment it looks like the pair are most definitely on. The aesthetically blessed young couple were spotted over the weekend hanging out at Miami beach kissing in the surf. Gigi is close friends with Kendall Jenner (left) and has already managed to bag herself a popstar boyfriend (right) in the shape of Australian singer Cody Simpson . Cody and Gigi showed off their beach bodies whilst enjoying a day out at Miami beach this weekend . Some might say that Gigi's modelling success has been a long time coming, as she first started working when she was just two years old when she was spotted by Paul Marciano of Guess. She took a break so she could study, but picked up her career again after school. At recent fashion weeks, she walked for brands such as Dolce and Gabanna, Sonia Rykiel and Tom Ford - quickly becoming one of the most recognisable faces on the runway. It was also recently announced that the young model is set to be the new face of beauty brand Maybelline. And Gigi's had the praise heaped on her by some of the fashion industries biggest names. Last year Carine Roitfeld, the infamous former editor of Vogue Paris told Style of the model: 'I was drawn to her right away because she was so different, and I love girls that are different—different from me, different from what everyone has seen before. 'I knew immediately that she was going to be a star.' And at the beginning of the year she was named 'Model of The Year,' at the Daily Front Row fashion awards. And good looks seem to run in the family as Gigi's younger sister Bella is also a model. Gigi looked incredible in a 70s style outfit on the cover of Vogue Spain, the model says that when she goes on jobs she always tries to work hard . When talking about her work ethic Gigi has previously said that she follows three rules when she's on a job. She told the Independent: 'Three things: work hard, be nice and make a friend.' Gigi - who has previously landed the cover of Vogue Spain - says she also thinks it's important to connect with her fans and that this is something brands connect with. She said: 'Girls are following me because I’m a model and because they want to see the behind the scenes aspect of it. 'They’re also following because there’s someone, hopefully, that they want to be friends with. And I think there are a lot of models that don’t understand it.' Gigi has become a runway regular, walking for both Dolce and Gabbana (left) and Tom Ford (right) Gigi poses with her fellow models Cara Delevingne  (left) and Kendall Jenner (right) with whom she has become close friends . Gigi is the face of GUESS, she previously Instagrammed this bill board which was spotted in Paris . However, like most celebrities, Gigi has found that her increasing profile hasn't come without it's brushes with controversy. She was today forced to deny rumours that she had taken cocaine at a Victoria's Secret pool party this weekend. In a 10-second Snapchat video, taken of Gigi dancing with Cody on a balcony at the event the model appeared to bend close to a lowered surface at one point seemingly, 'snorting.' The model was quick to take to Twitter to lambast the rumours saying: 'If you actually watch the video there is nothing on the counter .5 seconds before you see that image.' Gigi and Cody attended the Victoria's Secret Pink Ultimate Spring Break Bash this weekend, however, the models fun was marred when she was accused of taking drugs . She continued: 'I would never touch that... it's not only impossible but insane to me. Besides for doing the supposed in general, I'd be an idiot to do that at a WORK EVENT in front of hundreds of people/press. I'm insulted. 'I take pride in being a good role model, would never touch that and will not stand or put up with a little piece of scum blog like YOU.' Ocean's Up is a blog which reported on the video which had been grabbed from Cody's snapchat account which is publicly accessible to his fans.","The 19-year-old is fast becoming one of the best known faces in fashion .

"A millionaire hospital executive stabbed to death his wife then set fire to their New Jersey home in a murder-suicide, officials have ruled - despite the couple's children insisting they were both murdered. John Sheridan, 72, the CEO of Cooper Health System, and his 69-year-old wife, Joyce Sheridan, were found dead, with seven stab wounds between them, in their blazing Skillman house last September. Mrs Sheridan, a retired high school teacher, died from a stab wound to her chest, while her husband, an ally of state governor Chris Christie, passed away from 'sharp force injuries' and smoke inhalation. On Friday, prosecutors ruled Mr Sheridan had attacked his wife with a knife in the seconds leading up to their deaths, which occurred just a day after the couple had decorated their home for Halloween. 'Murder-suicide': John Sheridan (left), 72 ,stabbed to death his wife, Joyce (right), 69, then set fire to their home in a murder-suicide, officials have ruled - despite the couple's children insisting they were murdered . Crime scene: Mr Sheridan, the millionaire CEO of Cooper Health System, and his wife were found dead, with seven stab wounds between them, in their blazing Skillman, New Jersey, house (pictured) last September . Mrs Sheridan suffered eight wounds to her head, a stab injury to her chest that 'perforated her aorta', wounds to her hands that were 'characterized as defensive in nature' and bruising, officials said. She was ruled to have died before the fire started  on September 28. After killing his wife of 47 years with a 'carving-type knife', Mr Sheridan then doused the room with gasoline and set it alight, it is said. Mr Sheridan finally stabbed himself with a sharp item three times in the torso and neck area, causing a 'small perforation to the right jugular vein', prosecutors ruled. He was then overcome by thick smoke. Despite the murder-suicide ruling, announced by Somerset County Prosecutor Geoffrey Soriano on Friday, the four grown sons of the Sheridans have released a statement challenging the findings. The men, including Mark Sheridan, who is a prominent Republican election law lawyer, said they were not satisfied with the result of the investigation and still don't know who killed their parents. 'The conclusion announced today fails to provide those answers,' the sons' statement said. Connections: Mr Sheridan (left) is pictured with, from left, George Norcross III, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Dr. Paul Katz during an event in 2012. He was an influential member of the Republican party . Revelation: On Friday, prosecutors said in a statement (pictured) that Mr Sheridan had fatally stabbed his wife on the day of their deaths, which occurred just a day after they had decorated their home for Halloween . 'It is nothing more than an expedient way for the Prosecutor's Office to close its file and put an end to its embarrassing bungling of this murder investigation in the hope that our family, the citizens of Somerset County and the press will stop inquiring about what actually happened. Authorities discovered the Sheridans' bodies in their master bedroom after responding to a report of a fire  shortly before 6.15am. Mr Sheridan was found lying face-up at the foot of the couple's bed. The top portion of a two piece, armoire dresser was discovered resting on his body, according to officials. Seconds later, Mrs Sheridan was found lying face-up on the floor to the left of the bed. The wealthy couple did not leave behind a will, while two knives were found in the master bedroom near their bodies. Following the grim discoveries, Soriano's office spent six months investigating. Damaged: After killing his wife with a 'carving-type knife', Mr Sheridan set fire to their home with gasoline and matches, it is said. Above, a police vehicle is seen stationed outside the burned property on September 29 . Police at the scene: Mr Sheridan finally stabbed himself with a sharp item three times in the torso and neck area, causing a 'small perforation to the right jugular vein', officials ruled. He was then overcome by smoke . On  Friday, the office said some of the 180 interviews carried out during the investigation had revealed Mr Sheridan had been withdrawn and acting unusually in the days before the deaths. He was described as being 'out of character', 'very upset' and with 'an attitude of resignation'. The investigation also found no signs of a break-in at the Montgomery County home, officials said. However, the couple's sons have argued some key evidence is missing in the case. The Sheridans owned two homes - the $512,000 property where the fire unfolded and another in New York. Mr Sheridan was president and CEO of Camden-based Cooper University Health Care, which has more than 700 physicians and serves more than half a million patients a year, when he died. Memorial service: The couple's joint memorial service drew hundreds of mourners including Gov Christie and four of his predecessors, ex-governors Jim Florio, Christine Whitman, Tom Kean and Don DiFrancesco . Last year, NJBiz valued his company at $913million. Mr Sheridan, a Republican, was also an important political figure who served as general counsel to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The couple's joint memorial service drew hundreds of mourners including Gov Christie and four of his predecessors, ex-governors Jim Florio, Christine Whitman, Tom Kean and Don DiFrancesco. As well as their four sons, the Sheridans left behind three grandchildren. In a case unrelated to the fire, one of the sons, Matthew Sheridan, 40, was arrested hours after their deaths for cocaine possession and possession of drug paraphernalia found in his car. Prosecutors have not yet pursued the charges against Mr Sheridan, but have five years to do so.","John Sheridan and wife, Joyce, found dead in New Jersey home last year .

"Early humans living in Africa almost two million years ago came in a range of shapes and sizes, just as people do today, a new study claims. Researchers have found that some species were short - measuring under five feet tall - while others would have grown to heights of almost six foot. The study is the first in 20 years to compare the body size of humans who lived between 1.5 million and 2.5 million years ago. Early humans living in Africa almost two million years ago came in a range of shapes and sizes, just as people do today, a new study claims. This image shows the skeleton of the ‘Nariokotome Boy’ (Homo ergaster) Three species are generally recognised to have roamed Africa during this time frame: Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo ergaster . Researcher Dr Jay Stock, from Cambridge University's Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, said: 'If someone asked you 'are modern humans six foot tall and 70kg?' you'd say 'well, some are, but many people aren't, and what we're starting to show is that this diversification happened really early in human evolution.' Nutrition and local environmental factors probably played a role in making some early humans larger than others. Experts also believe that sexual dimorphism (pronounced differences in appearance between males and females, such as size) might have played a part too. ‘However, almost all studied… groups include smaller and larger individuals and assessing sex based on the isolated and fragmentary postcranial remains of early Homo is nearly impossible,’ they say in the study. Another possibility, thought to be less likely, is that there were numerous species belonging to the human family Homo that varied in appearance. Measurements of fossils from sites in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Georgia in eastern Europe, revealed significant regional variation in the size of early humans during the last Ice Age. Some groups, such as those living Olduvai, Tanzania, measured just 4.8 feet on average, while those from the Koobi Fora region of Kenya grew to heights of 5.8 feet. The evidence also suggests that big bodies and long legs were not prerequisites for spreading out of Africa into Europe and Asia. The main increase in body size occurred tens of thousands of years after the small, primitive human Homo erectus migrated out of Africa. Fossils show that Homo erectus, which averaged less than five foot in height and weighed less than eight stone, was living in Georgia 1.77 million years ago. Some groups, such as those living Olduvai, Tanzania, measured just 4.8 feet on average, while those from the Koobi Fora region of Kenya grew to heights of almost six foot. A table showing the variation is pictured . Measurements of fossils from sites in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Georgia in eastern Europe, revealed significant regional variation in the size of early humans during the last Ice Age. This the landscape of the West Turkana region of Kenya is where the skeleton of Homo ergaster was found . 'The evolution of larger bodies and longer legs can no longer be assumed to be the main driving factor behind the earliest excursions of our genus to Eurasia,' said co-author Manuel Will, from Tubingen University in Germany. The scientists, whose findings are reported in the Journal of Human Evolution, developed a method of calculating the height and body mass of individuals from small fossil fragments, some no bigger than toes. Dr Stock said: 'In human evolution we see body size as one of the most important characteristics, and from examining these 'scrappier' fossils we can get a much better sense of when and where human body size diversity arose. 'Before 1.7 million years ago our ancestors were seldom over five foot tall or particularly heavy in body mass. 'When this significant size shift to much heavier, taller individuals happened, it occurred primarily in one particular place - in a region called Koobi Fora in northern Kenya around 1.7 million years ago. 'That means we can now start thinking about what regional conditions drove the emergence of this diversity, rather than seeing body size as a fixed and fundamental characteristic of a species.' ‘The results demonstrate chronological and spatial variation, but no simple temporal or . geographical trends for the evolution of body size among early Homo….suggesting that migrations into Eurasia were not contingent on larger body sizes,’ the study says . Body size has been implicated as a factor contributing to both brain evolution and the first hominin dispersals into Eurasia . One argument suggests that as lower limbs lengthened and hominins assumed limb proportions more similar to modern humans, they became more mobile and changed their foraging behaviour and diet. But fossil fragments have now shown a richer variety of sizes and this may not be the case. The ecomorphological model says that Homo ergaster was the first hominin to colonize other continents due to its energetically efficient bipedal locomotion, long distance travel abilities, large home range sizes and habitat tolerance. But fossil evidence for body size now suggests the marked increase of body size variables in early Homo took place after 1.8 Million years in eastern Africa. By this point, the dispersals already happened, suggesting that migrations into Eurasia were possible without a significant increase in body size and possibly lower limb length. Interestingly, the study says that there was an increase in body size at the start and end of the period studied, which suggests that factors other than chronology also influenced the body size of early humans.","Experts developed a method of calculating the height and body mass of individuals from small fossil fragments, some no bigger than toes .
Researchers found early man ranged from 4ft 8 inches to almost 6ft .
It has been said ancestors left Africa as a result of developing longer legs .
But this study suggests that there may have been another driving force .
Experts also claim regional conditions may be to blame for diverse shapes .
This suggests body size is not a fixed characteristic of a species .

"A competitive shooter satisfied both his appetites by wrapping his gun in bacon and using the heat generated when firing to cook and eat it. Dustin Ellermann, a self-taught marksman and avid hunter, is captured on camera applying the rashers of bacon to his Gemtech TREK 5.56mm suppressor that rests on the back of a pick-up truck. Either Dustin or the video maker mutters under their breath: ‘So much America right now’, before the competitive shooter secures the bacon in place with some tin foil, which is also wrapped around the suppressor. Getting into position, Dustin lifts his Pre-86 M16 Lower rifle and begins firing rounds of Wolf 223 – spraying shells in every direction. Pausing to reload Dustin laughs and says: ‘I was like, what’s that sound?’ Referring to the sizzling noise coming from the suppressor of his gun. Dustin fires more bullets before pausing once again to examine his rifle. Dustin wraps the suppressor of his M16 rifle in bacon (left) before securely covering it in tin foil (right) This time smoke billows from the tip of it and the sizzling of the bacon cooking can be heard even more clearly. The competitive shooter fires one last time and the vibrations caused by the bullets leaving the gun cause the tin foil to fly from the suppressor. Stopping to admire the bacon, Dustin says: ‘There’s nothing wrong with that’ before taking his gun back to the pick-up truck. Dustin fires around 90 rounds with the intention to heat the suppressor so much that it will cook the bacon . The competitive shooter laughs at the camera as the bacon wrapped around his gun's suppressor begins to sizzle . Once there, Dustin uses a pair of tongs to remove the bacon and utters in excitement as it unravels looking, if anything, slightly overdone. The thread mount suppressor used in the video is made from stainless steel and an Inconel alloy, which allows it to function under high heat and pressure. The video concludes with the shooter, clearly impressed with the outcome, wolfing down the bacon. Dustin uses a pair of tongs to remove the surprisingly well-cooked bacon from the end of the gun . Laughing he says: ‘Let’s go and kill some more pigs’ before rubbing his hands together in satisfaction. Dustin Ellermann was a competitor on the third season of the History Channel's marksmen competition ‘Top Shot’, which he later won. Born into a small community in Zavalla, Texas – where the video takes place – the competitive shooter is also the director of a Christian camp.

Hailey and her twin sister, Savannah Lane will be celebrating their 20th birthday on Friday. The second-year Air Force Academy cadet, who is an Academic All-Americans honored swimmer, was stabilized and transferred to Virginia Commonwealth University's Health Center last week. She remains connected to an EMCO machine, which helps her breath and pumps her heart, which was originally at five per cent and had improved to 35 per cent. Doctors hope to take Hailey off of life support on Tuesday as her body continues to recover. Though she hasn't gained full consciousness, Savannah Lane said that she has opened her eyes and responds to familiar voices. Hope: Staff at ACAC gym, where Hailey had the heart attack, wore yellow and posted a photo on Twitter with a sign reading 'We Are Hailey Strong' to support the woman's recovery . Recovery: Hailey, who is in her second year at the Air Force Academy in Colorado, has received support from across the nation during her recovery. Al Roker blew her a kiss during the Today Show after hearing her story . But doctors warn that Hailey, who is on dialysis, could lose part of her leg because of blood-pressure issues and that it is too soon to determine the extent of damage to her heart and body. Hailey's family said her sudden collapse was a total shock because she has always been athletic and driven. Doctors will soon run tests to see if an unknown condition is in the family. The Lane family - consisting of Hailey, her twin Savannah, a set of older twins, a ten-year-old brother and parents Brigid and Dennis Lane, have been overwhelmed by the nation's support. The social media campaign, #WeAreHaileyStrong' calls for people so say prayers and send messages for Hailey. Savannah described her sister as 'My sweet sweet angel. My soldier.

Anti-terror police foiled a planned attack in the coastal city of Mombasa after they intercepted a car packed with explosives in March 2014, according to Kenyan authorities. According to police, al-Shabab militants had planned simultaneous attacks on the international airport in Mombasa, the ferry crossing and a supermarket. The car laden with explosives was to be detonated on a ferry. With Garar's alleged planning, the gunmen stormed a shopping mall in Nairobi on Saturday killing at least 20 people in what Kenya's government said could be a terrorist attack . Al-Shabab, an Islamic extremist group, has vowed to inflict violent attacks on Kenya and Uganda because the two countries have contributed troops to the African Union force supporting the government in Somalia.

"Nigel Farage used to claim he wanted to move away from the idea Ukip was a one-man band which relied on his own personal profile. But at the launch of his party's pledge card today, he was photographed in front of no fewer than seven images of himself. Amid a media scrum, Mr Farage used the event to boast that Ukip is 'quite reflective of what modern Britain is', as he called to leave the EU, control borders, spending £3billion more on the NHS, cut foreign aid spending and scrap income tax for the minimum wage. Nigel Farage today launched Ukip's election pledge card, surrounded by no fewer than seven photos of himself . Mr Farage used the event in central London to boast that Ukip is 'quite reflective of what modern Britain is' Ukip hopes to use the election to make a major breakthrough into the Commons, securing enough seats to hold the balance of power in the event of a hung Parliament. Mr Farage said a strong showing for Ukip at May's election could boost the calls for electoral reform, which in turn could make his eurosceptics a 'big party in British politics'. He said: 'I've always thought there should be election reform but that is frankly irrelevant in the next 38 days. 'Yes, this is very hard for us because you find good Ukip support in Labour constituencies and in Conservative constituencies. 'Yes, that's a challenge but what we have to do is to get over the line in enough seats in this General Election campaign and then you'll see how many seats we've actually come second in, and you'll realise as part of a longer-term strategy this really could become a big party in British politics.' Mr Farage was mobbed by photographers, camera people and journalists as he arrived in Smith Square in central London to unveil the poster truck. He was hidden by the media scrum for the duration of the press conference and had to fight his way into his car as he left. Mr Farage was mobbed by photographers, camera people and journalists as he arrived in Smith Square in central London to unveil the poster truck . Earlier Mr Farage played down a run of opinion polls which suggest his support is on the wane, insisting his party is 'more in tune' with the British public. Although the posters include a pledge to control the UK's borders, the word immigration does not feature. The leader was joined by Ukip MP Mark Reckless and other senior Ukip figures, each other them holding an over-sized pledge card in front of the billboard. But Clacton MP Douglas Carswell, who defected from the Tories last year, did not attend the event as he was campaigning in his constituency. Last year Mr Farage warned that people would not vote for Ukip unless he broadened its appeal beyond his own profile. 'I don't think people will vote for us in a general election in big numbers if they think it's a one-man band. I intend to change that over the summer,' he said in May 2014. But Mr Farage today brushed aside questions about the use of his photograph on the card. He said: 'The thing about Ukip is we have become the most eclectic, diverse political party. 'We've got all shades of opinion, we've got people from the left, people from the right, people of all ages, all classes, all races. 'We are quite reflective I think now as a party of what modern Britain is.' Mr Farage insisted that smaller parties will have major influence in an election which no party will win outright . Responding to Ukip's pledge card, a Liberal Democrat spokesman said: 'Ukip's pledge card should instead be a P45 for each of three million people whose jobs benefit from our membership of the EU.' The latest ComRes poll for the Daily Mail puts Ukip on 12 per cent, well down on last year's peak of 19 per cent. Speaking this morning Mr Farage insisted that smaller parties will have major influence in an election which no party will win outright. He vowed to use any influence he can to ensure a referendum on leaving the EU happens this year. The Ukip leader - who will later kick off his party's campaign by announcing its key policies - told ITV1's Good Morning Britain: 'I'm up for it. 'We have got massive public support for our views on proper immigration controls and the need for an Australian-style points system. As we have shown before, we have come from behind in many elections to win in the past. 'We are going to win a good number of seats in Westminster, but with the best will in the world, I am not going to be Prime Minister.' He added: 'I'm a straight-talking person, I'm honest - Ukip are not going to win the general election. But you know what? No-one is going to win the general election. There will be nobody with a clear majority. 'The question is what parties will have enough power to coalesce around the other parties?' He said David Cameron had never wanted to hold a referendum on Britain's EU membership, and had been 'forced into' his vow to stage a poll by the end of 2017. 'Our job in the next Parliament would be to hold his feet to the fire, to make sure that the referendum is not a stitch-up,' he said. 'I don't want this to be kicked into the long grass until the end of 2017. I think it should be before the end of this year.' Mr Farage acknowledged that Ukip had lost ground in the polls over the last few months, but insisted it remained 'more in tune' with the British public on key issues than the mainstream Westminster parties. 'We have dipped a little bit over the last two months, but not markedly,' he said. 'What we have just passed through is the phoney war. The real battle starts today.' Mr Farage acknowledged that Ukip had been 'hurt' by bad publicity including a councillor who made racist comments . Mr Farage acknowledged that Ukip had been 'hurt' by publicity over supporters such as Thanet councillor Rozanne Duncan, who was expelled from the party after saying she had 'a problem with people with negroid features'. But he insisted: 'We are through all of that. What we have now got to talk about is an election campaign in which the biggest issue in voters' minds is the impact of immigration on public services and on people's incomes ... I think Ukip, over the next 38 days, is going to connect with people.' He said he stood by his position that discrimination laws should be relaxed, so employers can favour British workers over those from other EU nations. 'I think that to have an open door and to have mass migration of unskilled and semi-skilled labour is bad for British people, because it has driven down wages and how does that make sense?' said Mr Farage. 'What may be good for big business isn't necessarily good for millions of British families.'","Ukip leader insists his party is 'more in tune' with the British public .

"Forget being a supermodel as a career choice - young Chinese women are now dreaming that when they grow up they will get the chance to be an e-sport hostess. A recent report on 163.com, one of China's most-read websites, suggested that such hostesses, who are hired by gaming platforms to commentate on online video games and host live events in scanty clothing, are among the best-paid people in the country. Han Yiying, China’s top-paid e-sport hostess, was paid around ¥17 million (£1.8 million) to join a gaming company at the end of 2014. Xiao Xue (pictured) is an e-sport hostess and is recently featured by 163.com, one of China's largest websites . According to Xiao Xue, the income for hostesses vary considerably . Part of her job is to interact with live gamers over the Internet . Han's income almost caught up with Liu Xiang, a hugely popular Olympic gold medalist from China. Wages for e-sport hostesses increased more than 10 times in 2014 alone, according to the report. E-sport, short for Electronic Sports, is the name for organised multi-player video game competitions in which mostly male players pay to take part. Video game competitions associated with electronic sports involve real-time strategy, fighting and first-person shooter contests.

Originally from Sichuan, Han is also a professional online gamer and has participated in international competitions such as World Cyber Games . Many Chinese men take part in the events for a chance to ogle and communicate with beautiful women . There are cash prizes to competitors, but the real attraction for many Chinese men taking part in the events is the opportunity to ogle and communicate with beautiful women like Han Yiying, who is dubbed ‘Queen of e-sport’. Ms Han’s daily job includes dressing in a sexy outfit and chatting to the male competitors in the contests either through the internet or in person when there are live events.

Han is one of a growing number of professional and highly paid e-sport hostesses, with at least 20 reported to be earning similar money. However, most of the hostesses are still on salaries considerably lower. 163.com reported that some of the new hostesses could only afford to eat one cup noodle per day, but they entered the industry out of passion. Hosting e-sport is becoming a dream job for some young Chinese girls . Beginners such as Xiaoxue are lowly paid and can only afford eating instant noodles .

"When Nick Clegg walked out of today's farcical ‘yellow budget’ speech, it prompted relentless jeers from Labour MPs - and left Danny Alexander speaking to a virtually-empty chamber. And, to add insult to injury, the Deputy Prime Minister's swift exit appeared to be for the sole purpose of trying his hand at a spot of Am-dram in Gravesend. As these pictures show, the Liberal Democrat leader was this afternoon seen sauntering around Kent, taking selfies with residents and high-fiving passers-by as part of a 'fun' film shoot for a party political broadcast. Scroll down for video . High five: Nick Clegg was spotted in Gravesend, Kent, high-fiving passers-by (left) - and himself (right) - as part of a 'fun' political party broadcast . 'Fun': The Deputy Prime Minister said he did not want the election campaign to be too 'po-faced' and serious . Selfie: As part of the filming, Mr Clegg, who left the Commons early, stopped to pose for selfies with residents . Am-dram: He also practised his best acting outside a nail art studio (left) and with another selfie taker (right) Wearing dark woollen gloves, an open-neck shirt and a navy v-neck sweater, Mr Clegg looked right at home as he laughed and joked with residents, putting on his best smiling face for the cameras and occasionally treating them to an embrace. There were even reports that he interacted with dancing girls for the film. At one point, Mr Clegg opted for an outfit swap, changing into a camel-coloured jacket, which he matched with a more severe facial expression, as he walked solo along the high street. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the political broadcast is not the first time that Mr Clegg has attempted some amateur acting. The politician is said to have enjoyed Am-dram at school, taking the lead role in The Government Inspector while at Caldicott. At Westminster,  he took the lead in The Changeling, opposite Hollywood actress in-the-making Helena Bonham Carter. In one scene, she had to kick him between the legs - and one night she hit the target rather too authentically. 'She got it spot on… no acting was required,' Clegg recalls. He also once donned a purple velvet jacket to play Charles Condomine in Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit - a man who boasts about his sexual conquests. Woollen: Wearing woolly gloves, an open-neck shirt and a v-neck sweater, Mr Clegg looked right at home . Swap: He even opted for an outfit change halfway through filming, reverting to a camel-coloured jacket . Strutting his stuff: Mr Clegg is a seasoned amateur actor and took the lead role in The Government Inspector while at Caldicott . Speaking to KentOnline about today's filming, Mr Clegg said: 'It's a bit of fun. I want to have fun in this general election campaign. I don't want it to be too po-faced and serious.' Asked why the party decided to shoot the video in Gravesend, he added: 'It was just a really great place to do this and hopefully not cause too much disruption. 'Everybody in the shops here have been really warm and really generous with their time.' A Lib Dem source said: 'We were filming bits of a party political broadcast and other videos that are going to be used in the campaign. 'The whole crew has been filming for a couple of days – Nick was there for a couple of hours today. 'But you'll just have to wait and see what's in them.'","Nick Clegg left today's 'yellow budget' speech  to go to Gravesend, Kent .

"A young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street has escaped going to jail after a judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica Silva stabbed her boyfriend of four years, James Polkinghorne, five times on Mother's Day in 2012 after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim sat down and wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. However the prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva was sentenced to a suspended sentence of two years' imprisonment on Friday . The 24-year-old was found guilty of the manslaughter of her partner of four years, James Polkinghorne (pictured) in 2012 . Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' She  faced the NSW Supreme Court in Sydney on Friday where her jail sentence was suspended . During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne to her in the lead up to his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Silva stabbed James Polkinghorne five times  after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney fuelled on the drug 'ice' The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. Justice Hoeben called the situation 'exceptional' after accepting Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive' Silva also believed he had shot and killed Nikolas Argiropoulos, whose body was found in a park in Birchgrove in Sydney's inner-west on March 22, 2012. Outside court, her lawyer Adam Houda said there were no winners in this tragedy. 'My client has had to endure the most extreme forms of physical, verbal and psychological abuse and in that light the sentence imposed today was the appropriate one considering the extraordinary circumstances of this case,' he said. 'It's now time to heal.'","Jessica Silva stabbed James Polkinghorne    outside her home in 2012 .

"Apparently, there exists a huge disconnect between parents and teens when it comes to who is expected to fund college. According to a new survey conducted by Junior Achievement USA and The Allstate Foundation, nearly half of teens questioned (48 per cent) think their parents will help pay for college, but only 16 per cent of their parents reported planning to. Of the 800 parents polled, more than a third said they don’t speak to their children about money at all, stating they want to 'let kids be kids'. Thanks for nothing, dad: The study, conducted by Junior Achievement USA and The Allstate Foundation, found a huge disconnect between parents and teens when it comes to who is expected to fund college . 'It is obvious that parents and teens need to have honest conversations about money management, including paying for college,' said Jack E. Kosakowski, president and chief executive officer of Junior Achievement USA. 'Together as a family, it is important to develop a plan for life after high school – whatever that looks like for your family.' Even when parents do talk to their teens about money, it appears that girls are often side-lined. Around 40 per cent of girls said their parents didn't talk to them enough about finances, compared to just 24 per cent of boys. According to the College Board, the average annual cost of tuition and fees for the 2014–2015 school year was as follows: . Furthermore, females - teens and their parents - both have lower expectations about their potential earning power. Moms are significantly more likely than dads to say their child will earn $15k or less at their first job after graduation (26 per cent compared with 17 per cent respectively). Similarly, when asked about their future earning power, 24 per cent of teen girls say they’ll make $15k or less at their first job, compared to only 16 per cent of boys who feel the same. It appears things aren't improving either. The overall number of teens who think their parents don’t spend enough time talking to them about money matters is up by 11 per cent over last year's findings.","A new study, conducted by Junior Achievement USA and The Allstate Foundation, revealed a significant disconnect between expectations .

"An Australian couple spent five terrifying hours trapped inside the car with their two young children not knowing whether they were going to survive the wrath of Cyclone Pam which tore apart the island of Vanuatu. Beth and Kris Russet moved to the island in 2009 and spent 18 months building a cyclone-proof house before moving into the beautiful home just four months ago in November with their children Charlotte, 3, and Henry,14 months, and also Beth's mother. But nothing could have prepared the couple for the hell they endured as each room in their brand new home began to rapidly fill up with water after the ceiling was ripped off leaving the petrified family exposed to the ferocious and deadly elements of the worst cyclone to have hit the Pacific region in living memory. Beth Russet - left with Henry, and Kris Russet - right with Charlotte, 3, spent five terrifying hours in their car as Cyclone Pam hit Vanuatu . The polished new deck before it got ripped apart - pictured are the two German Shepherds who survived the cyclone on back of the ute . The entire roof of the decking blew off during the cyclone and exposed plywood was flying through the house . The brand new open kitchen and dining room where the family used to spend a lot of their time . The ceiling in the kitchen was ripped off and rain started coming in sideways along with a ferocious wind tunnel . The night began like any other for the Russet's on March 13, they had settled in to watch a movie with a glass of wine in hand after putting the kids to bed. However, within two hours the pair were frantically moving their children and Beth's mother from one room to another as their family home began to resemble an indoor swimming pool. 'Our walls started to rain - it was coming in too hard and too fast,' Beth said. 'I had to put Henry in the pram because I couldn't carry him while we kept having to move them from one room to the next.' 'We were trying to stay calm for the kids but the roar of the wind was so amazing that we had to keep yelling at each other over the noise. 'We were tying to keep our happy faces on so the kids would be fine.' But this was no easy feast as the entire roof from the large decking outside had torn off causing exposed plywood to come flying into the open living area. 'All of the doors stayed shut but as soon as the roof came off it was as if we had no walls - then the kitchen fan flew off and rain started coming in sideways and a wind tunnel began,' she said. 'We couldn't get from one side of the house to the other without help and holding hands because it was flood waters and the wind was just so strong.' Three-year -old Charlotte's room is completely trashed after the epic storm . The ceiling was blasted open with parts falling onto the ground in 14 month old Henry's nursery . Probably the scariest of many hairy moments throughout the night was when Beth's mum and Kris had a ceiling collapse from above them in the master bedroom just as Beth had moved the children into her son's nursery. 'I turned around to get my mum from the bedroom when the ceiling came in on her and the ceiling fan missed her head by inches,' Beth said. 'The door slammed with the wind and I couldn't get in - I had no idea how she was but luckily my husband was in there and she was ok.' The family vowed to stick together from that point on - including their two German Shepherds and a reluctant cat. Eventually they moved to the bathroom because there was too much potential for the nursery ceiling to collapse as water was pouring in from the down lights, however the bathroom presented the exact same problem. 'We did the big dramatic run to the kids bathroom because it's mainly concrete walls and a big bath tub so we thought it would be really safe there,' she said. Beth in the kitchen with Charlotte (left) and Henry (right) before the cyclone tore their home apart . This was when Beth and Kris felt they had choice but to move their family and pets to the car parked in an open patio although they were far from certain it was the safest option. 'I was freaking out in the house because we had too many ceilings coming down on us but we didn't know if moving to the car was the smart decision,' Beth said. They decided that they would attempt to drive down the road to Kris's dad's farm. 'So while the car was shaking and rattling around we tried to move it forward a few hundred feet and no way - there was too much wind, it was so dark and it was crazy with trees and debris,' Beth said. 'We didn't know how much water was around and I couldn't handle it if the car started to slide away and I would somehow have to let my children out of their car seats. 'Also, my mum wasn't strong enough to be able to swim if we had to go through something so we decided to stay put.' Beth standing on the beautiful lush land before they began to build their dream home 18 months ago . Kris left and Beth's mum (right), with Henry in the high chair, having a drink to celebrate their first Australia Day on their new deck . So with the dogs in the tray in the back of the Ford Hilux and three adults and two children in the cabin they painstakingly sat tight from midnight until 5am. 'It was horrible, we were all cramped and sopping wet and the car was not sitting still - it was shaking violently but as soon as the sun came up we could see a clear path down to Kris's dad's farm so we drove down the hill very slowly,' she said. Miraculously even the pets survived with the dogs making it though the night in the back of the ute and the cat hid in a cupboard until morning. 'Kris and I looked at each other blankly the next night as if to say ""oh my goodness"".' The family moved from one room to the other as water rapidly filled up in every room of the new home . Beth said the determined spirit of the Vanuatu people after such an epic disaster was nothing short of phenomenal . Beth said they feel incredibly lucky to have survived the horrendous ordeal unscathed and could not bear the thought if anything had gone wrong . Beth said they feel incredibly lucky to have survived the horrendous ordeal unscathed and could not bear the thought if anything had gone wrong. 'I couldn't care less about the house - I was only concerned about the kids and mum and keeping them calm so they experienced the least impact,' she said. 'I was very nervous and freaking out about going in the car and then driving off and being washed away and I thought ""if I lose a child just let me be washed away too"". 'I was just terrified that something was going to happen to the children like a ceiling was going to fall in on them while I was saving the TV so I just stayed with them the whole time.' Now sharing one room at Kris's father's place, they expect to be back in their home, where the walls are still in tact, within the next six months. Charlotte has had a few nightmares since the ordeal but was a very brave girl and went back to school yesterday . The family won't be moving back in for up to six months and are currently all sleeping in one room at Kris's dad's farm . Beth won't be cooking in her kitchen anytime soon as it took the full brunt of the massive storm . The family got to spend just one Christmas in their new home before the cyclone wreaked havoc .

'I just want to lie down with a magazine but you have to keep going - you can't stop in these situations.' She said the help and aid from Australia has been extremely overwhelming.

"It is always satisfying to get a beautiful picture of a landscape, mountain or lake that you have visited. Gregor Skoberne, however, takes dedication to the next level by photographing Slovenia's Lake Bohinj every day during summer, and experimenting with paragliding to capture its reflective surface from different angles. The  lake is situated in the Triglav National Park and is the largest permanent lake in Slovenia, perfectly mirroring the surrounding mountains in its waters. Reflective beauty: The stunning Lake Bohinj in Slovenia is less well-known than the popular Lake Bled, and is in pristine condition due to the lack of tourists . Lake Bohinj's orientation results in fascinating light which is perfect for capturing its surrounding mountains and reflections . The 14th century church on the lake is featured on the coat of arms of the  Bohinj municipality and makes for a beautiful keepsake picture . Gregor Skoberne captures Lake Bohinj every day during summer, working at the local tourist information office during that period to be closer . Lake Bohinj is not as famous as popular tourist destination, Lake Bled, but the lack of visitors allows the area to maintain its pristine condition. Photographer Gregor Skoberne, 23, became so spellbound by Lake Bohinj that during summers he now works for the local tourist association in order to be closer to photograph it, as he lives 30 minutes away. 'I was amazed that every day there was something different at the lake, be it light, clouds, fog, reflections or different colors of the leaves,' he said. 'Secondly, I love symmetry and taking reflection shots and Lake Bohinj surrounded with mountains is perfect for that.' Taking to the skies! Gregor enjoys capturing the lake from all angles, including capturing reflections of the clouds while paragliding . To photograph the lake from varied perspectives, Gregor has even gone so far as climbing to the top of nearby waterfall Savica . The lake is situated in the Triglav National Park and is the largest permanent lake in Slovenia . The Slovenian's interest in photography started when he received his first digital SLR camera, his father's Nikon D70s . Gregor now uses a Nikon D5100 with the Nikkor 18-105mm and 12-24mm lenses to capture the stunning Slovenian lake . The Agronomy student, 23, is currently doing a master thesis on visualization of root growth using Time Lapse technique, but hopes to do something professionally that's connected with photography. 'When you see something beautiful in nature, it’s hard to describe another person what you saw and how amazing it was, so I’m trying to capture that on my camera so others can enjoy that too,' he said. One of his most challenging shots occurred following a climb down a stone wall to get to the Savica waterfall. However, the resulting photograph was one that only a true artist would have been able to create. But for Greggor, the best photograph that he has taken of the body of water was while flying above, thanks to the spectacular reflection of the clouds on the lake. His photography can be followed on Facebook and Instagram.","Gregor Skoberne, 23, photographed the 790-acre lake every day during the summer using numerous methods .

"A woman has told how she fulfilled a promise to her twin when she successfully fought to get her sex attacker jailed after she committed suicide. In a landmark legal case, Sharon Hennessy, 30, won justice for her sister Michelle who killed herself aged 27 in October 2012, a year after she was punched, kicked and sexually abused as she walked home from a night out. At the time of Michelle's death, police were pursuing a rape case against her attacker Sean Thackaberry, but they said they would close it because there was no chance of a conviction without her evidence. Michelle (left) and her twin Sharon, pictured together on their 21st birthday. Michelle committed suicide a year about being attacked after a night out. Sharon reveals how she fought to bring her sister's attacker to justice . Sean Thackaberry was jailed for five years in a landmark case over attacking Michelle Hennessy . But Sharon, of Kildare Town, Ireland, had promised her beloved twin she would not let her attacker walk free. The pledge was important to Sharon because after initially being charged with rape, Thackaberry was released on bail – and Michelle said she did not feel safe while he was on the streets. The family believe this was one of the reasons Michelle took her own life. Sharon reveals how Michelle - who was a fan of skydiving and nights out - changed after the attack. She said: ‘She was afraid and vulnerable and instead of travelling to far-flung corners like she had done, she spent her time sat by the fire, knitting. ‘I hardly ever saw her put on make-up and she never went out with friends, like she used to. ‘She’d been so proud of her girly locks and her sense of fashion, but afterwards she didn’t care. ‘We were furious that Thackaberry hadn’t been locked up and whenever Michelle left the house, his supporters would harass her. They sent her abusive messages online too, calling her a liar. ‘The taunts and threats ground her down until she didn’t feel human anymore.’ In October 2012 Michelle committed suicide at home. Her sister recalled finding out – and desperately trying to reach her twin’s body. She said: ‘I remember collapsing onto the stairs and screaming from the bottom of my belly. ‘I screamed for all the pain and emotion that my twin sister was never able to scream. I screamed for the devastation she buried inside her, until it slowly destroyed every inch of her being. ‘I screamed for the anger she felt at not being protected from the monster who stole her life. It was devastating.’ Michelle (left) and Sharon, pictured at three years old, had always been close and Sharon vowed to see her sister's attacker jailed, hiring a top lawyer and pestering police to keep the case open . Sharon, pictured at her 30th birthday (left) along with a tribute to her sister at the event (right) Michelle (right) and Sharon pictured together on their 27th birthday . Sharon was heartbroken when a lawyer told her family the ongoing case against Thackaberry would ‘never see the light of day’ because of her sister’s death. ‘It felt like the final nail in Michelle’s coffin,’ she said. ‘I felt like that monster was going to win – again.’ So she hired a top lawyer and repeatedly pestered the police for the case to be pursued – and the trial went ahead. In November 2013 Thackaberry, then 20, of Kildare Town, Ireland, appeared at Dublin’s Central Criminal Court where he admitted aggravated sexual assault. The court was told the former boxer had violently assaulted Michelle as he walked her home, dragging her onto wasteland around 250m from her home. Michelle pictured after skydiving in Spain. Her sister Sharon reveals how Michelle changed after the attack and wouldn't leave the house . Michelle - pictured (left) skydiving in Spain, and (right) on a night out afterwards - committed suicide a year after she was attacked by Sean Thackaberry after a night out . Remembering how Michelle felt after being attacked, her sister said: ‘She told me, “I thought I was going to die”.’ Sharon told how Thackaberry winked at her as he was jailed for five years at Dublin’s Central Criminal Court. Her sister said: ‘I’d made my sister that promise. ‘The lawyer said there hadn’t been a case in Irish history like Michelle’s, where someone was convicted after the victim had died. But we wouldn’t give up. ‘Michelle was dead because of what that man did to her. ‘We had hoped he would be prosecuted for rape, but it meant so much that Thackaberry had finally admitted what he’d done. ‘His sentence wasn’t long enough for what he’d done, but we were so relieved that we finally had justice for Michelle.’ She said she was now fighting for other victims. ‘They weren’t even going to look at her case and didn’t believe Michelle deserved justice,’ she said. ‘Michelle’s case set a precedent for future court cases. Hopefully there won’t be other victims like Michelle. But if there is, they won’t just be forgotten, like Michelle threatened to be. ‘People think it’s bad to talk about these things but, in fact, it’s one of the most important things in the world. ‘Because it’s only by talking about them that more women who feel lost like Michelle will go and get help.’ In the year after her sister's death, Sharon has helped raise more than €30,000 (£21,000) for suicide awareness.","Michelle Hennessy killed herself year after attack by Sean Thackaberry .

"They might not have had quite as rapturous a reception as 'WillKat' but 'ChaCam', as the local media has christened them, certainly know how to put on a show. So far, the star is proving to be Camilla who showed off her increasingly confident sense of style during a reception at the British ambassador's residence in Washington D.C last night. Resplendent in a shimmering silk gown by Bruce Oldfield and her trademark pearl choker, the Duchess of Cornwall cut a glamorous figure as she arrived on the arm of Prince Charles. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Camilla in a chic Bruce Oldfield gown during a banquet on the second day of the US tour . Looking good: The Duchess has also used the occasion to show off a chic new haircut . But Camilla isn't the only one who has proved a hit with the US public, with Charles also pulling in the crowds - most obviously during a whistle-stop tour of Washington's many monuments yesterday. Arriving to cries of 'Welcome your Highness!', a clearly delighted Prince of Wales happily stopped to chat to schoolchildren and their parents outside the Lincoln Memorial. Not everyone knew who they were however, with one little boy asking his mother: 'Who is that man?' 'The future King of England,' she replied as she swiftly snapped a photo on her iPhone. Charles and Camilla are now on the third day of a four-day state visit that has been described as 'your grandfather's royal visit' by the local Washington Post. New name: The royal couple have been re-christened 'ChaCam' by the local media . Warm welcome: Both Charles and Camilla have enjoyed a rapturous reception from local people . In a piece headlined, 'Camilla and Charles don’t get the WillKat [William and Kate] treatment, but it’s still royal', the paper went on to contrast the 'high-volume excitement worthy of boy-band' that greeted the Duke  of Cambridge with the quieter one offered to his father. But while Charles and Camilla aren't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation, the visit is seen as 'crucial' - for Charles at least. That echoes comments made by British Ambassador to the US Sir Peter Westmacott who described the tour as being a fillip for Anglo-American relations. 'I am so pleased to welcome The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall back to the United States, ten years after their first official visit together,' he said ahead of the royal couple's arrival on Tuesday night. Looking around: Charles and Camilla spent their first full day touring Washington D.C . Star of the show: Camilla, who is clearly been enjoying the tour, has enjoyed a particularly warm welcome . Smile! Yesterday, the Duchess obligingly posed for a selfie outside the Lincoln Memorial . Cheering for Charles: Local teenagers wait for the royal couple to emerge from the Lincoln Memorial . 'Their trip to Washington and Kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values, combating climate change, preserving the natural environment, creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the Royal Family play in keeping that relationship special.' Much of the itinerary is taken up with marking big anniversaries, among them the 800th birthday of the Magna Carta and the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Both were ticked off the list yesterday, with Charles and Camilla starting the day at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and, in Charles' case, ending it at the National Archives for a viewing of the 1297 Magna Carta. Today's schedule, which, if yesterday is any indication, will also be covered rather breathlessly by the local press, will see 'ChaCam' visit President Lincoln's cottage in Washington D.C. Later, the royal couple will be whisked to the White House where they will meet President Obama in the Oval Office for the second time since he took office. President Obama is the sixth American president to entertain Charles, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last.

"They are common to all whales, helping them to propel themselves forward through the water. But this week, a cetacean with no flukes was spotted diving off the coast of Southern California. The migrating gray whale, whose tail was likely amputated after it became entangled in fishing gear, was seen adapting a new style of swimming to allow it to negotiate its way to warmer waters. Diving sharply into the ocean, it corkscrewed its body so that it could use the side of its peduncle - the area between its main body and where its flukes would be - to generate sufficient thrust. Scroll down for video . Rare sight: This gray whale was spotted diving off the coast of Southern California with no flukes this week . Contrast: Flukes (file picture) are common to all whales, helping them to propel themselves forward in water . The action also enabled it to plane and steer. Although experts believe the style of swimming could cause the whale to develop back problems, it is probably the only way it could make the migration. The flukeless creature, dubbed the 'whale without a tail' by some whale watchers, was first spotted swimming alone off the coast of Point Loma in San Diego on Saturday, according to Grind TV. A day later, it was seen diving into the ocean beyond Dana Point in Southern California by stunned passengers aboard the Dana Pride, who recognized it only when it blew a plume of mist into the air. And on Monday, the determined young cetacean was caught on camera swimming in waters off Point Vicente in Los Angeles, accompanying two other gray whales on the northbound migration. Speaking to the TV station, Captain Tom White of the Dana Pride, which runs from Dana Wharf Whale Watching, said the rare sighting of the whale proves how intelligent the creatures are. 'It just goes to show how smart these mammals are, to be able to adapt so well without a limb,' he said. 'It was migrating along fine, although a little slower than what we usually see. Chopped off: The migrating gray whale (pictured), whose tail was likely amputated after it became entangled in fishing gear, was seen adapting a new style of swimming to allow it to negotiate its way to warmer waters .

Above, the whale's amputated tail . Sighting: The flukeless creature was first spotted swimming alone off the coast of Point Loma in San Diego on Saturday. A day later, it was seen diving into the ocean beyond Dana Point (pictured)in Southern California . 'And during its deeper dives it would use its pectoral fins and swim harder on one side to spin around” in kind of a corkscrew manner. But it did not seem to be in any trouble.' The whale, which will average 40 to 50 feet in length when fully grown, likely lost its fluke recently after becoming entangled in fishing gear, such as ropes from crab or lobster traps or gill nets. The entanglement could have cut off blood supply to the animal's tail, reported Captain Dave’s Dolphin & Whale Safaris, which ran the boat trips during which the striking creature was seen. This may have led to the whale's flukes dying and falling off without harming the rest of its body. IIntelligent: Captain Tom White of the Dana Pride whale watching boat, which runs from Dana Wharf Whale Watching, said the rare sighting of the whale (pictured swimming) proves how intelligent the creatures are . Another appearance: On Monday, the determined young cetacean was caught on camera swimming in waters off Point Vicente (above) in Los Angeles, accompanying two other gray whales on the northbound migration . Speaking to The Dodo, marine biologist Michael J. Moore, Ph.D., of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said chronic entanglement trauma could be 'the worst form of animal welfare abuse'. He said it was likely that a gill net had slowly cut off the whale's flukes, 'giving the major blood vessels that feed the fluke time to clot and heal as the damage got deeper.' According to Captain Dave's, researchers estimate that entanglement in fishing gear and other items kills nearly 1,000 dolphins and whales across the world on a daily basis. Every year, gray whales make a 10,000- to 14,000-mile round trip from their feeding grounds in the cold Chukchi and Bering Seas to Mexico's Baja peninsula and the southern Gulf of California. Boat: Marine biologist Michael J. Moore, Ph.D., of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said chronic entanglement trauma could be 'the worst form of animal welfare abuse'. Above,  a file photo of the Dana Pride . There, they mate and have calves in the regions' warm lagoons. The migration is believed to be the longest annual migration of any mammal. Gray whales typically live between 55 and 70 years. It is not the first time a whale has been sighted with no flakes following an entanglement. In the 1990s, a flukeless gray whale was seen a number of times over nine years off the Baja Peninsula. Two others were seen in 2011 and 2012 - one in the same location and another near Australia.","Whale with no flukes was seen off coast of Southern California this week .

"A record number of people are now in work after a massive hiring surge, official figures revealed this morning. The number of people with a job increased by 143,000 to reach 30.94 million in the three months to January – with wages now rising six times faster than inflation. At the same time unemployment fell by 102,000 to reach 1.86 million while the number of people on the dole last month fell by 31,000 to 791,200, the Office for National Statistics said. However, today’s figures also revealed that almost as many foreigners found work over the past year as British citizens. The number of Britons working in the UK increased by 375,000 to reach 28million – while the number of foreign workers jumped by an astonishing 239,000 to reach 2.96 million. There will also be concern at the increase of women forced to work part time. While the number of men in part-time jobs fell by 20,000, the number of women in part-time work soared by 157,000. It means there are now 6.15million women in jobs that aren’t full time – almost three times higher than the number of men in part-time work. Scroll down for video . A record number of number are now in work after a massive hiring surge, the Office for National Statistics said this morning . Overall, unemployment is now at a near seven-year low, while the number of people are in work has hit a new record. The employment rate of 73.3% has never been higher. The jobless total is now 1.86 million, the lowest since the summer of 2008 and almost half a million down on a year ago. Overall, 5.7 per cent of over 16s are unemployed - compared to a European Union average of 9.8 per cent. The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance fell by 31,000 to 791,200 in February - the 28th consecutive monthly reduction. The number of people classed as economically inactive, including those on long-term sick leave, looking after a relative or who have given up looking for work, fell by 30,000 to just over nine million, or 22.2 per cent of 16 to 64-year-olds. However, this is 14,000 higher than a year ago. Self-employment increased by 33,000 to 4.5 million, close to a record high and accounting for more than one in four jobs. Other figures showed that public sector employment has fallen by 6,000 to just under 5.4 million, the lowest since current records began in 1999. Overall, 5.7 per cent of over 16s are unemployed - compared to a European Union average of 9.8 per cent . George Osborne, pictured outside Number 11 Downing Street this morning, has promised to deliver 'a budget that works for you' The biggest losses have been in local government, while employment in the NHS increased by 18,000 over the past year. Prime Minister David Cameron this morning hailed the figures. He said: 'The highest employment rate in our history is not a dry fact. It means more people with the security of a pay packet and a brighter future.' Chancellor George Osborne added: 'Today's ONS figures record yet another economic milestone, confirming a new record high employment rate alongside a claimant count that has not been lower since 1975. 'This good news is further proof that the government's long term economic plan is working and that British families are seeing the results with regular wages rising more than five times faster than prices. 'But in an uncertain world economy all of this progress will be at risk of collapsing back into chaos unless we carry on working through the plan that is delivering stability and rising living standards.' His Lib Dem number two Danny Alexander said: 'Today's ONS figures show a yearly increase of 617,000 more people in work with a record high employment rate and unemployment continuing to fall each year. 'For the fifth month in a row wages are also continuing to rise faster than prices. 'While there is a lot more to do to fully repair our economy, this strong job creation is powerful evidence that we are creating the right economic conditions for businesses to invest and grow.' Unemployment has fallen in almost every region in the UK - with only Scotland and the East of England seeing an increase in the number of people out of work . David Cameron, leaving Downing Street this morning ahead of the budget, welcomed this morning's figures . Employment minister Esther McVey and Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander, pictured today, saod today's figures showed the 'long term economic plan' was working . The Business Secretary Vince Cable claimed the employment figures were 'an historic moment'. He added: 'With almost three quarters of working age people now in work, we have achieved the highest rate of employment in the UK since records began. 'This is a sign that the long term decisions the Liberal Democrats have taken in government have created a more resilient economy.' But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the 'remarkable set of figures' were partly down to his benefit reforms. He said: 'For every single day that this Government has been in power, we have seen an average of 1,000 more people in work. In total, that's 1.9 million more people with the self-esteem and financial security that a job brings.

"Alex Salmond was ridiculed last night after he boasted of becoming Westminster’s king- maker while quaffing pink champagn . Alex Salmond was ridiculed last night after he boasted of becoming Westminster’s king- maker while quaffing pink champagne and saying that he ‘identifies’ with Nelson Mandela. Seemingly still unable to come to terms with his referendum defeat, the former First Minister continued to overshadow his successor Nicola Sturgeon with a self-regarding interview for New Statesman magazine. Before a vote has even been cast in the General Election, he predicted the stars will be in ‘alignment’ for his triumphant return to Westminster as power broker, and vowed to crowbar Ed Miliband into No 10. Mr Salmond also said he would make it impossible for David Cameron to govern if the Conservative leader fails to secure a majority in May’s election. Last night, Tory MSP Alex Johnstone said: ‘Nicola Sturgeon must wish that Alex Salmond would just shut up.’ Earlier this year, Miss Sturgeon slapped down her predecessor by insisting that she would lead any post-election negotiations at Westminster. But Mr Salmond continued to publicise his plans yesterday, claiming he would join forces with Labour to ‘lock out’ the Tories by voting down any attempt by Mr Cameron to pass a Queen’s Speech. Scottish Labour Party chairman Jamie Glackin said: ‘You’d be forgiven for thinking he was still leader of the SNP.’ The New Statesman article reveals how, during the interview in London, Mr Salmond ordered pink champagne to toast the launch of his widely mocked referendum diaries, accompanying it with fish, chips and mushy peas. Asked by the magazine which ‘historical figure’ he identified with, he replied: ‘Nelson Mandela. Everybody of my generation would say that.’ Mr Johnstone said: ‘Alex Salmond is fast becoming a figure of ridicule. This bizarre comment suggests that the former First Minister has unhinged himself from reality completely.’ The Tory MSP said the interview was ‘yet more evidence that Alex Salmond is a backseat driver, with Nicola Sturgeon looking on from Edinburgh wondering where the car is going’. Tory MSP Alex Johnstone (right) said new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon (left) 'must wish that Alex Salmond would just shut up' Scottish Labour director of policy Blair McDougall said: ‘Pink champagne? Lah-di-dah! I’m sure the First Minister is really relaxed about Salmond’s boozy lunches with London journalists.’ Tory sources last night said that Mr Salmond’s comments showed the SNP was prepared to ‘sabotage’ the outcome of the election in order to put Labour leader Mr Miliband in Downing Street. Senior Tories are considering plans to run a minority government if the Conservatives emerge as the largest party in a hung parliament. But Mr Salmond said the (Fixed-term) Parliaments Act, which was passed by the Coalition, meant that the SNP could put Labour into power even if the Conservatives win more seats. He said the SNP – on course for an election landslide in Scotland – would not contemplate any deal with the Tories. Asked about the prospect of a minority Tory government, Mr Salmond replied: ‘The Tories would have to go straight effectively for a vote of confidence, usually the Queen’s Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course, and we’d be voting against. Salmond on… ordering pink champagne: . ‘To toast my book.’ Salmond on… which historical figure he ‘identifies’ with: . ‘Nelson Mandela.’ Salmond on… his recent weight gain: . ‘I’m about to go back on my diet.’ Salmond on… a second referendum on independence: . ‘It’s not a question of if, but when.’ Salmond on…. the number of Nationalist MPs elected in May: . ‘We will win a barrel-load.’ Salmond on… the SNP’s 2011 election landslide: . ‘It’s happening again.’ Salmond on… his referendum defeat: . ‘I’ve no doubt that Gordon Brown saved the day for No.’ Salmond on… his return to Westminster: . ‘I think the stars might be in alignment. I wouldn’t come to Westminster to make up the numbers.’ Salmond on… Tories in the Commons he admires today: . ‘I don’t really know them… William Hague.’ Salmond on… immigration: . ‘Does Scotland need more people? Yes.’ Source: The New Statesman . ‘So if Labour joins us in that pledge, then that’s Cameron locked out. And then under the (Fixed-term) Parliaments Act that Westminster passed but nobody seems to have read, you’d then have a two-week period to form another government – and of course you want to form another government because this might be people’s only chance to form another government.’ He said it was a ‘fib’ spread by Labour that the party with the most seats automatically won the right to try to form a government – pointing out that Labour’s first government in 1924 was formed after it came second. A spokesman for the Conservatives said: ‘Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ‘That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond’s tune. The only way to protect Trident, keep Britain together and safeguard the economy is to vote Conservative.’ The former leader of the SNP said he indentifies with former South African president and anti-apartheid revolutionary Nelson Mandela (pictured) Mr Miliband moved to quell Labour panic in Scotland last week by ruling out a formal coalition with the SNP. But the UK Labour leader has refused to rule out a looser power-sharing deal. The SNP has made it clear it would extract a ruinously high price in return for propping up Mr Miliband in office, including £180billion of extra borrowing, ditching Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent and insisting on sweeping new powers for the Scottish parliament that would leave the country reliant on dwindling North Sea oil revenues. Mr Salmond said the SNP would amend any Labour budget to introduce ‘progressive tax rises’ – likely to raise fears of big tax hikes for the middle classes. He also dismissed Labour suggestions it would not cut a deal with the SNP. He said the party would face a stark choice between doing a deal with the SNP, or allowing Mr Cameron to stay on as Prime Minister. Mr Salmond is favourite to win the Lib Dem-held seat of Gordon at the election. He is likely to return to Westminster as the effective head of the largest ever grouping of Nationalist MPs. He has also predicted that his party will oust both Labour’s election co-ordinator Douglas Alexander and the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander from their Scottish constituencies.","Former SNP leader Alex Salmond is accused of being a 'back seat driver'

"The president of Sierra Leone has ordered the entire country to stay at home for three days in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola. Ernest Koroma has ordered the entire population into lock down from 6am on March 27 until 6pm on March 29. It comes as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - which have been the centres of the outbreak which has killed more than 10,000 people - have set a goal of cutting off the disease's spread by April 16. The president of Sierra Leone has ordered the entire country to stay at home for three days in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola . The worst-ever outbreak of the virus has claimed almost 3,700 lives in Sierra Leone, one of three impoverished west African nations that have seen their economies and healthcare systems wrecked by the crisis . Koroma said: 'All Sierra Leoneans must stay at home for three days,' he announced, expanding a previous order for a lockdown in the capital Freetown and northern areas of the country nationwide. 'I have made my personal commitment to do whatever it takes to get to zero Ebola infections and I call on every Sierra Leonean in every community to pull together,' he added. Liberia had previously reported that it had reached an end to the epidemic in the country but a new case appeared in its capital Monrovia on Friday. The infected woman is the wife of a man already cured of the disease, it has been reported. One of the deadliest viruses known to man, Ebola is spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the recently deceased or an infected person showing symptoms, such as fever or vomiting. Health workers from Sierra Leone's Red Cross Society Burial Team carry an ebola victim from a house in Freetown . The World Health Organization said Ebola can still be transmitted in sperm 82 days after a patient carrying the virus is cured.

"ISIS has taken a terrifying stranglehold on Nigeria after militants Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the terror group. An audio recording believed to be from Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau said the jihadists, who have been waging a six-year military campaign in northern Nigeria, were merging with ISIS. A translation of the Arabic broadcast said: 'We announce our allegiance to the Caliph... and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity.' Scroll down for video . An audio recording believed to be from Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau said the terrorists were joining ISIS . ISIS' influence has spread cross the Middle East and north Africa, with groups of terrorists in Libya and Egypt as well as the terror network's strongholds of Iraq and Syria . Boko Haram, now under the ISIS umbrella, control swathes of Nigeria (pictured) and have committed atrocities in much of the north of the west African nation . The recording identified 'the Caliph' as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS and self-proclaimed caliph of the Muslim world. The message means that ISIS now has a foothold in Nigeria, as well as controlling swathes of Iraq and Syria and parts of Egypt and Libya. Baghdadi has already accepted pledges of allegiance from other jihadist groups in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan and north Africa as he seeks to expand their reign of terror. This month Boko Haram released a highly-edited video appearing to show it beheading two men in a similar fashion to the sickening footage released by ISIS. Rita Katz, from terrorism monitor SITE Intelligence Group, said: 'Boko Haram is now being elevated from a local jihadi group to an important arm of the Islamic State. With Boko Haram's wide network in North Africa, the Islamic State's projection of creating an Islamic Caliphate is gaining headway. 'Furthermore, Islamic State's infrastructure, resources and military capabilities will enable Boko Haram to expand its operations and control even faster in North Africa.' The move now means ISIS controls parts of Nigeria, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Libya - where the terrorists paraded police cars sporting black flags through the streets of Benghazi last month . Chilling: The broadcast pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS . Barbarity: Eight men were found hanging from their feet in the Iraqi city of Hawija in the ISIS latest public display of death earlier today . Earlier today, four bomb blasts killed at least 50 people in the north eastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri in the worst attacks there since Boko Haram militants tried to seize the town in two major assaults earlier this year. A tricycle rider detonated a bomb when they were prevented from entering a fish market in the west of Maiduguri. A second blast hit another market shortly afterwards before a car bomb exploded by a bus station near a government office, it was reported. 'We've received 50 dead bodies from the blast scenes and 36 injured people,' Salisu Kwaya Bura, Chief Medical Officer of Borno Specialists Hospital said. The number of wounded was well above 36 as some of the injured were taken to two other hospitals, a hospital source said. Maiduguri is the  birthplace of Boko Haram, which has long coveted the city as a capital for the state it wants to create. The militants tried to seize Maiduguri at the end of January and again in early February. Boko Haram overran a territory the size of Belgium last year, which Nigeria's ill-equipped army has struggled to take back. The group gained worldwide notoriety in April when its members kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls.","Nigerian militant group Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to ISIS .

The Abune Yemata Guh church, which sits 2,500ft above ground, is said to have been carved out by an Egyptian priest who walked all the way there. Mariam Korkor church: This is one of the extraordinary Christian places of worship carved into the sandstone Gheralta mountains in Ethiopia . Journey: Anyone visiting the Abune Yemata Guh church must make their way along narrow ledges and cross a rickety makeshift bridge . Historic: The mountains where the Abune Yemata Guh church is located, 2,500ft above ground level - and carved out by an Egyptian priest . Father Yemata’s journey established a church which the congregation can now only reach by scaling a 19ft-high rock wall without ropes or harnesses. Anyone wanting to pay a visit nowadays must also make their way along narrow ledges and cross a rickety makeshift bridge. But families have brought their newborn babies there to be baptised, while corpses have been carried up to be buried on the mountain. Some of the priests at the church - which was virtually unknown to the public until the Sixties - are said to have been up there for 40 years. Interior design: The stunning frescoes inside the Abune Yemata Guh church remain extremely well preserved thanks to their remote location . It is not known why Father Yemata established the church - with theories suggesting he wanted to pray alone in the clouds, or even escape raiders. The stunning frescoes inside the churches remain extremely well preserved thanks to them being hidden in such an inaccessible place of worship. Also featured in the images taken by photographer Olivier Grunewald are the churches of Abune Abraham, Mariam Korkor and Abune Michael Kebe. The mountains are located about 500 miles north of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, and are around 60 miles south of the border with Eritrea.

"The number of customers trapped in poor-paying ISAs has doubled in the last two years . Savers are being hit with the worst interest rates in history with a third of Isa accounts now paying less than 1 per cent a year. The number of customers trapped in poor-paying Isas has doubled in the last two years as interest rates on them plummet to new lows. One in six accounts offer less than the Bank of England’s base rate at just 0.5 per cent, while some savers are stuck on rates of 0.1 per cent. The proportion of these tax-free accounts returning below 1 per cent has doubled in the last two years, from one in six to one in three. It means that on the current worst Isa rate of 0.1 per cent, someone depositing £15,000 would make a paltry £15 a year in interest. In contrast, a saver on the most competitive rate of 1.5 per cent would make £225 – a difference of £210 a year. With four weeks left to use this year’s £15,000 Isa allowance, many savers will question the value of such accounts. The Building Societies Association said there was not ‘one single factor’ driving down Isa rates but said the ‘persistently low base rate’ had contributed to lower returns. A spokesman added: ‘I don’t think there is a hard correlation between Isa rates and mortgage rates. The Building Societies Association said there was not ‘one single factor’ driving down Isa rates but said the ‘persistently low base rate’ had contributed to lower returns . ‘Each provider has to strike a balance between savings rates and mortgage rates as they need both savers and borrowers.’ Experts also blame the Government’s Funding for Lending scheme, which allowed banks to borrow cheaply in return for handing out home and business loans after the economic crisis. The scheme meant that banks were no longer dependent on savers’ money – reducing the need to offer competitive rates, it is claimed. Anna Bowes, of independent savings website Savings Champion, said: ‘After six years of the base rate at 0.5 per cent, this is toughest time on record for savers, and Isa savers have certainly not been immune to the pain. ‘Isas were once seen as the go-to savings product due to their tax-free status. ‘But with rates at an all-time low, some savers – especially those looking to build up a short-term lump sum for perhaps a house deposit or a car – may need to be more creative. ‘High-interest savings accounts offer rates of up to 5 per cent before tax, so even a taxpayer could find that this route could earn them more interest.’ But Rachel Springall, of the website Moneyfacts, warned: ‘Despite the gloomy outlook on savings rates, consumers need to use their tax-free allowance or lose it. ‘While there might be an abundance of taxable savings accounts out there, it is always worthwhile to track down an Isa equivalent and use the yearly tax-free allowance.’ Savers have lost out on £4.7billion in the last three years due to low interest rates.","Figures show savers are being hit with the worst interest rates in history .

"Avid rugby fan Prince Harry could barely watch as England came up just short of the 26-point margin needed to win their first Six Nations since 2011 in a pulsating match at Twickenham. In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy. Sporting a navy blue suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne squirmed in his seat as England got off to a difficult start, despite an early try. Scroll down for video . Stress: The Prince can barely watch as England beat France 55-35 but narrowly missed out on the Six Nations . Taking its toll: Harry looks anxious as England struggled to cope with France's impressive start to the match . Passion: Prince Harry belts out the national anthem, seated behind England coach Stuart Lancaster . Despite their herculean effort, England could not find a final try and finished second in the championship, behind Ireland. After the match, England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for 'one of the most courageous performances' he has seen from his side. 'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed 40-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20. All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey . Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game. Harry - who is a Vice Patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) - also chatted with members of the armed forces at Twickenham . Looking dapper in his navy suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne then took his seat in the stand before singing the national anthem with gusto.

"They might have thousands of pounds to spend on the best products and make-up artists at their beck and call but sometimes celebrities still slip up when it comes to their slap. This week Kylie Jenner showed up to a Nip and Fab event sporting a two-toned chest, which appeared to be the result of badly applied contouring bronzer, leaving her with an unfortunate tide mark around her breasts. But the 17-year-old is not alone as stars like Angelina Jolie, Drew Barrymore and Kim Kardashian have all had very public make-up mishaps. Scroll down for video . When Kylie Jenner attended an event for Nip and Fab recently it was clear to see that she had tried to contour her chest but the powder had not been blended in properly . Kylie posed happily on the red carpet in a see through top, unfortunately it seemed she hadn't noticed her make-up mishap . But it seems Kylie - who has recently been announced as an ambassador for the beauty brand - didn't even notice her two-tone cleavage. She happily posed away while photographers snapped the bronzing boo-boo, yet the youngest of the Kardashian clan is not the first celeb to fail prey to a make-up malfunction. In fact her sister Kim, the ultimate queen of contouring, recently had a bit of a fail herself. While Kim showcased her dramatic new platinum 'do in Paris during Fashion Week, she had paid less attention to her make-up and stepped out with a  brown line running down her nose which hadn't been blended properly. Darkening the centre of the nose and highlighting the sides is a make-up artist's trick for making the feature look thin and straight. The 34-year-old is well known for her love of highlighter and deep contouring which excentuates her cheekbones. Whilst out and about for Paris Fashion Week Kim, who usually has perfect make-up, was spotted with a dodgy looking brown stripe going down her nose . Other stars such as Angelina Jolie have also previously had maquillage 'mares. The actress was photographed at the premiere of The Normal Heart, to support husband Brad Pitt who produced the flick, with pale white powder in patches on her face. Experts guessed that her make-up artist had been liberal with the translucent powder which mattifies skin without adding colour to it. However the product - which works well in photoshoots when the light can be controlled - is less forgiving on the red carpet. With so many flashbulbs going off, the light reflects off one of main ingredients in the powder, silica. Angelina Jolie is one of the most famous stars to have suffered for a make up malfunction, she was once seen covered in white powder that hadn't been rubbed in properly . Clearly Angelina's husband Brad did not see fit to tell Angelina that she was suffering from a make up malfunction as the pair attended a screening of The Normal Heart . But Angelina is far from the only celebrity to be coated in the face powder only to find it looks like she's been flour-bombed in photos. At the 2003 premiere of Charlie's Angels, Drew Barrymore looked as though she was trying a geisha-inspired avant garde  look. The former child star had so much white powder around her eyes she seemed to be wearing a white mask. Drew Barrymore looked a fright at the 2003 London premiere of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle . Nicole Kidman sported white powder on her nose and under her eyes, possibly a result of using powder intended for HD film, not a camera flash at the Nine film premiere in NYC in 2009 . And the usually pristine-looking Nicole Kidman experienced a similar problem at the 2009 premiere of Nine in New York. The Australian star had white patches beneath her eyes and a smear on the end of her nose that looked as though she'd just done some rather messy baking. Eva Longoria revealed her own penchant for translucent powder on a night out with Entourage actor Kevin Connolly in 2011. While her bronzed cheeks glowed, beneath her perfectly applied smoky eyes, the Desperate Housewives star sported a thick line of white powder, making her look like Adam Ant. Eva Longoria displayed white powder under her eyes as she left a sushi restaurant in Hollywood with Kevin Connolly in 2011 . Jessica Biel sported a touch of white powder on her nose at a film premiere in New York in 2010 . Melissa Joan Hart sported a huge white smear across her forehead and chalky remnants around her eyes and nostrils at a film premiere in LA in November 2013 . Actress Ashley Judd isn't immune from a bad make-up job, pictured in NYC in 2011 . Meanwhile, it's not just US celebs who seem to put their make-up on in the dark. TV presenter Claudia Winkleman fell prey to an attack of the eyeliner at the GQ awards in 2013 when her smudged look went really wrong. The Strictly star is known for her distinctive Sixties-inspired style with a heavy blunt fringe, strong eyeliner, bronzed skin and pale lips. However, at the event it looked as though she'd applied her eye make-up in the car on the way to the show with liner so smeared it was streaked well below her lash line. Jennifer Aniston wisely sticks to natural make-up to enhance her year-round tan, piercing blue eyes and tawny long, layered hair. But at a screening of Call Me Crazy in Los Angeles in 2013, she was left with marks from a cupping treatment, which she attempted to disguise with liberal applications of powder. The result was that rather than a series of marks from the treatment that uses suction cups on the skin, there were discs of bronzer all over her back instead. At the GQ Awards in 2013 Claudia Winkleman turned heads for all the wrong reasons with her bizarre smokey eyed make up . Jennifer Aniston tried to use make-up to cover-up the remnants of a cupping treatment, but the foundation only made the circles look worse at the Los Angeles screening of Call Me Crazy in 2013 . But for every unintentional make-up mishap celebrities have worn perfectly-applied - but badly judged -  lipstick, powder and paint. Gossip Girl Leighton Meester stepped out looking vampish in purple eyeshadow that had been painted around her eye sockets, and almost into her hairline. While America's Next Top Model judge Tyra Banks is famous for inventing the 'smize' (smiling with your eyes)  at a New York City party in 2012 she took it too far - liberally painting black shadow across both lids. Her garish pink lips did nothing to improve the look either. While many everyday women admit to applying their make-up on the move, it seems celebrities are guilty of the same grooming crime. Leighton Meester wore garish purple eyeshadow made worse with red lips at a NYC event in 2009 . Tyra Banks looked like she had done her make-up in the dark with her thick black eyeshadow and neon pink lips at a ball in New York City in 2012 .","Kylie Jenner was recently spotted with a bronzer tide-line on her breasts .

"Ryanair has backtracked on plans to develop a cheap flights to America- just days after it said it had received approval from the board. On Monday, the budget airline had announced plans to run transatlantic services between key European cities and the US with one-way tickets costing from as little as £10. But today, bosses have been forced to admit the carrier is not about to move into long-haul flights. Scroll down for video . Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, had announced just days ago that is was planning to develop a transatlantic service for budget passengers, with one-way tickets between the US and key European cities costing as little as $15 . In a brief statement, the Irish airline's board said it had not approved any such plans, nor would it. 'In the light of recent press coverage, the Board of Ryanair Holdings plc wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any transatlantic project and does not intend to do so.' The sudden U-turn came after Ryanair unveiled its plan to operate budget flights to the US within five years. The idea was part of an aggressive growth strategy, connecting airports such as London Stansted and Berlin with New York, Boston and Miami. In a statement carrier had said it was talking to manufacturers about buying planes to serve new routes between various European airports and 12 to 14 American cities. Michael O'Leary  previously said the airline has long been looking at long-haul flight plans, but is held back by a lack of aircraft availability . 'European consumers want lower cost travel to the USA and the same for Americans coming to Europe. We see it as a logical development in the European market,' a spokesman said on Monday. 'The business plan is there but it's dependent on attaining viable long haul aircraft and we estimate that's 4 to 5 years away.' Ryanair pilots had to wear oxygen masks as they made an emergency landing in Barcelona on Thursday after a fire extinguisher went off in the cockpit. Passengers said the pilot and first officer were unable to breathe without the masks as halon - a liquefied, compressed gas - filled the confined space as the plane flew from London Stansted Airport to Valencia. TV presenter and professional sailor Hannah White said that passengers suspected there was a serious problem, but they did not know the reason for the emergency landing until they arrived at Barcelona-El Prat Airport. Fire trucks greeted the Boeing 737 when it touched down shortly after 10:15am local time as passengers began to grasp the nature of the emergency. Ryanair described it as a 'minor fault'. The airline first mooted the idea of offering transatlantic flights back in 2008 and board approval comes after the airline has invested 18 months in cleaning up its image and improving customer service. Last year, Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, told the Irish Hotels Federation conference in Meath that Ryanair would offer the $15 flights to Boston and New York. However, he admitted that passengers would pay extra for everything from meals to baggage. He said: 'We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe . 'Not every seat will be ($15) of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats.' In a separate conversation, Mr O'Leary admitted: 'We've had a business plan ready to roll for a transatlantic, low-fares airline. 'The difficulty is, I keep cautioning, is that there's no availability of long-haul aircraft for another four or five years.' Ryanair isn't the only airline to consider offering budget transatlantic flights. Previously, Sir Freddie Laker launched Skytrain in the late Seventies to offer 'no frills' flights to the US, but his carrier Lake Airways failed in 1982. Zoom Airlines tried a similar concept in 2002 but was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2008. Sir Freddie Laker revolutionised air travel with his idea for budget flights between Europe and the US, but his airline failed in 1982 . More recently, Norwegian Airlines launched its own budget flights between London Gatwick, New York, Boston and Los Angeles from as little as £389 ($415) return. Icelandic carrier Wow Air, which will later this year launch £99 tickets from London Gatwick to two US cities with a stopover in Reykjavik. Last summer Ryanair, Europe's largest budget carrier, launched a business class service. The airline said its 'business plus' fare would allow passengers flexible tickets,priority boarding and 'premium' seats – in the first five rows for quick boarding, or on exit rows with extra legroom. It would also allow extra hold baggage allowance of one bag weighing up to 20kg, which can cost up to £75 on top of a standard ticket in high season on busy routes.","Ryanair had announced plans for a service between Europe and America .

"Tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers, a report claims today. Almost one in three crimes is ‘inappropriately’ punished with a police caution or penalty notice, including some that carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, such as rape, MPs say. Some 86,000 offences that could have gone before a Crown Court were dealt with out of court in the year to June 2014, they add. Revelation: Tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers, a report claims today . The Home Affairs Select Committee points to an ‘alarming’ rise of the caution culture – which grew and peaked under the Labour government – and says this has damaged public confidence in the justice system. The committee’s report concludes that too often, police used cautions as a ‘time-saving tool’ rather than the correct way of tackling an offence. In total, police issued 318,500 of the so-called out-of-court disposals, mostly for minor offences, in 2013-14, down from 660,965 in 2008. Despite ministers insisting cautions are ‘inappropriate’ for serious offences, 70 sexual and violent offenders a week received one in the past four years. Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the committee, said: ‘The inappropriate use of out-of-court disposals to deal with serious offences is unacceptable. ‘It is alarming that they are not being used in the correct way in up to 30 per cent of cases. ‘We cannot allow the misuse of out-of-court disposals in serious cases to continue. The public deserve to feel reassured that their local police forces are not tackling serious crimes with a slap on the wrist.’ Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the committee, said the 'inappropriate use of out-of-court disposals to deal with serious offences unacceptable. The committee also says the use of cautions has resulted in a ‘postcode lottery’. In Gwent, 49 per cent of offences were brought to justice, compared with 26 per cent in West Yorkshire. At the peak, one in ten of all solved cases was dealt with by out-of-court disposals. By last year, it had fallen to fewer than one in 20. The report found that cautions could save the police time and money by cutting bureaucracy, allowing front-line officers to spend more time pounding the beat. Arresting an offender takes almost three hours of police time, and charging someone takes five hours. But too many cautions were being handed out ‘inappropriately’, says the committee. The report welcomes reforms being introduced by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling that will end the caution culture which led to criminals being let off with a warning. Six types of out-of-court disposals will be replaced with just two which are designed to compel offenders to make some form of reparation. Minor criminals will be told they must apologise to victims or repair damage they have caused to prevent a court appearance. More serious offenders will be give a ‘suspended prosecution’, which means they must meet a set of conditions such as paying a fine and going on a rehabilitation course to avoid further punishment. Last year the Mail revealed that 90 rapists have received only a caution since the Coalition came to power. In total, police issued almost 15,000 for offences that would typically result in jail, including 2,279 for sexual assault, 783 for robbery and 11,347 for burglary.","Almost one in three crimes ‘inappropriately’ punished with police caution .

"A startling video has emerged showing an officer putting his hand around a woman's throat then forcing her to the floor at a Massachusetts police station. The footage, taken in February 2013, was released this week following a $1 million federal lawsuit filed by the woman, Maylene Maldonado, against the Chicopee police officer, Daniel Major. Major has resigned from the department, WCVB reported. The footage shows him and two other officers restraining Maldonado, who was arrested for allegedly slapping a police officer after she admitted to drinking and smoking PCP, Mlive reported. In the video, the then-24-year-old repeatedly tells the officers that her lip ring is giving her pain and asks them to help her remove it. Arrest: Maylene Maldonado can be seen screaming as she is taken into custody in February 2013 . Attack: One of the officers, Sergeant Daniel Major, then abruptly grabs her neck and holds on . But as she continues to scream, Major suddenly grabs her around the neck and continues to hold on as his fellow officers do nothing. Then they all pull the woman to the ground. While on the floor, Major shouts: 'Shut the f*** up!' Maldonado was charged with resisting arrest and assault and battery on a police officer. In her lawsuit, which also names the other officers, Maldonado has accused the officers of assault and battery and civil rights violations, and accuses the city of failing to properly train its officers. She also claims she never received medical treatment for the injuries she allegedly sustained. Maldonado, from Springfield, was arrested after her friend's car got stuck in a snowbank in Chicopee and officers, who were called to the area following reports about a man with a knife, saw her running to a nearby gas station and went to check on her. She admitted to drinking and smoking the hallucinogenic drug PCP and then got into an altercation with police officers when they tried to see her license. Holding on: She struggles as Major holds on to her neck - while the other officers stand back and do nothing . 'Attack': The officers then push Maldonado to the ground, where Major says: 'Shut the f*** up' She slapped an officer across the face and apologized, according to the criminal complaint, but was arrested and taken to the police station where the alleged assault unfolded. The case has also caused divisions within the department. Thomas Charette, the acting chief at the time of the 2013 incident, defended Major's actions as appropriate because Maldonado was high on PCP and allegedly spat blood during her arrest. 'Sergeant Major made several attempts to speak softly and calmly with Ms. Maldonado in order to calm her and complete the booking process,' Charette said, according to WHDH. 'However, she was either unwilling or unable to understand simple instructions and kept insisting that Sergeant Major repeat himself.' An internal police review determined he had 'acted admirably', Mlive reported, and a clerk-magistrate's hearing agreed. A district court judge  reviewed the recording and he was charged with assault and battery in November 2013. Major, in court in November 2013, was charged with assault but an internal review found he did nothing wrong, which the current police chief has disputed. Major has since retired but now faces a lawsuit from the woman . But because internal affairs investigation found no wrongdoing, former Chicopee Mayor Michael Bissonette told ABC40 that his hands were tied. Despite his predecessor's ruling, the current chief, William Jebb, has said Major did not act appropriately and handed the video over to City Hall officials, Mlive.com reported. 'We want to make it clear, it's a different administration,' Chicopee Police Officer Mike Wilk told ABC. 'Two officers have retired and a lot of people have asked about releasing it. Chief Jebb and (Mayor) Kos want it to be transparent department. That's why we released it today.' Charette ultimately retired in July 2014 after Jebb beat him to secure the job of police chief. Mayor Richard Kos' office said: 'The city takes these allegations very seriously and the Chicopee Law Department will file a timely answer to this lawsuit once served.'","Maylene Maldonado was arrested in Chicopee, Massachusetts in February 2013 after slapping a police officer and admitting to taking drugs .

"A Chicago man charged with murdering his girlfriend's mother told an Indonesian court Thursday he was angry after the victim threatened to kill his unborn baby, called him a racial slur and strangled him hard for about half a minute. Tommy Schaefer, 21, and Heather Mack, 19, are being tried separately by Denpasar District Court, where they are charged with premeditated murder for the death of Sheila von Wiese-Mack last August in Bali. They could face a firing squad if found guilty. The victim's bludgeoned body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi. Testifying at the trial of Mack, Schaefer told the court their relationship was not endorsed by his girlfriend's mother, and he went to Bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant. Scroll down for video . Break down: Heather Mack, from Chicago, weeps in a courtroom as she witnesses her trial in Bali, Indonesia on Thursday, March 12, 2015. Mack, 19, charged with premeditated murder in the death of her mother . Trial: Mack told the court her boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer (right) killed her mother in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby . 'She attacked me': Schaeffer testified in court Thursday that the victim insulted him using a racial slur, described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man, and strangled him for 30 seconds . After meeting with Mack at the hotel, they discussed how to inform von Wiese-Mack that Mack was  pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where Mack and her mother were staying. Speaking through an interpreter, Schaefer said Mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl, which he hid under his shirt as a 'precaution'. Asked by a judge why it was hidden, Schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself. According to Schaefer, he arrived in the room and found Mack weeping. He did not know why, but also saw that Mack's mother was screaming. 'She (von Wiese-Mack) was angry at me when she knew that Heather was pregnant,' Schaefer said, while trying to hold back tears. Mack, who was sitting beside her lawyer, sobbed at the testimony. He said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man. He said the situation got heated when von Wiese-Mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby. Schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which von Wiese-Mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds.

'I was angry, I took the fruit bowl and hit her,' Schaefer said, in tears. He added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim. After acknowledging she wasn't breathing, he tried to give her artificial respiration, while Mack, who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes, came back and tried to revive her mother. He said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the United States. In her first questioning in court on Wednesday, Mack, who is eight months' pregnant, said Schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von Wiese-Mack made the threat in an argument. 'The blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting,' Mack said. 'I asked Tommy to stop and then I ran into the bathroom.' Von Wiese-Mack's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets. The suitcase was later found in a taxi at the posh St. Regis Hotel in August. Deceased: Shelia von Wiese-Mack's late husband, and her daughter's father, was composer James Mack . Pregnant: The couple, seen here together in an Instagram picture from last year, are expecting a child . Trial: According to the indictment, Schaefer battered von Wiese-Mack with the metal bowl following an argument over the hotel bill .

Mack said when she left the bathroom, she found Schaefer on the bed trying to give her artificial respiration. 'Tommy said my mother was not breathing,' she said. Mack said she also tried to revive her but it didn't work. She said they panicked and thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the U.S. Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. 'We panicked and didn't know what to do,' she said. Mack answered 'no' when the judge asked whether she wished her mother dead. 'Troubled': Mack has previously been described as 'troubled' and 'violent' by friends of her family .

Heavily pregnant Mack (right), 19, and Tommy Schaefer (second from left), 21, sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of von Wiese-Mack . Mack and Schaefer arrived in court, handcuffed together and wearing matching orange waistcoats. The pair sat in court in front of evidence believed to be a suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of Mack's 62-year-old mother. According to the indictment, Schaefer battered von Wiese-Mack with a fruit bowl handle in her room following an argument over the hotel bill. It says Mack helped stuff her mother's body into the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it. The indictment says they then placed the suitcase in the trunk of a taxi and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did. Hotel security guards are said to have seen blood spots on the grey suitcase and the taxi driver went to the police, who then made the gruesome discovery. The pair were wearing matching orange waistcoats as they arrived for their latest court appearance on Wednesday . Sheila Von Wiese-Mack's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel . The first witness to testify at Schaefer's trial, a bellboy named Arifin, said he saw the couple taking a suitcase on a baggage cart toward the lobby on August 12. He said during proceedings in February that he asked them about the hotel bill, which according to a receptionist hadn't been paid, but Mack refused to respond. 'They asked me to call a taxi, but they refused when I offered to help put the bag into the taxi,' he said. 'They argued that the contents were fragile, and refused to be assisted.' Arifin, who uses a single name, said he heard about the murder later from police. The second witness was I Putu Adi Marta, a technician who examined the hotel's security videos on August 12. 'I was asked to check because a couple, a man and a woman, were said to have escaped without paying the hotel bill,' he said. Marta said the video recordings showed that Schaefer and Mack used the emergency stairs several times to go between the third and sixth floors. Mack and her mother were staying in a room on the third floor, while Schaefer was staying on the sixth floor. 'The man walked up and down from the third to the sixth floor, changed his shirt once and brought a white cloth,' he said. 'They also were shown bringing a large package from the third to the sixth floor.' The pair (pictured together in a cell), from Chicago, Illinois, are being tried separately by the Denpasar District Court . A police officer also testified that he was among five police who arrested the couple on August 13 at the Bali Wisata Hotel in the Kuta area, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the St. Regis hotel. 'First they refused to be taken without being accompanied by lawyers from their government,' I Made Ariyana said. He said they also refused to talk or be photographed at the Kuta police station. Schaefer did not object to any of the testimony. Prosecutors said before visiting Bali, Mack had suggested that Schaefer hire someone for $50,000 to kill her mother, who objected to their relationship. Mack and her mother had arrived first in Bali and were staying in a room on the third floor of the hotel, while Schaefer arrived later and was staying on the sixth floor.

"A bird that was long thought to have gone extinct has been rediscovered in Burma after a team of scientists used a recording of the species' distinctive call to track it down. The Jerdon's Babbler (chrysomma altirostre altirostre) - a small brown bird similar in size to a house sparrow - was last spotted in Myanmar in 1941 and was thought to have died out altogether. But a team of scientists managed to uncover multiple birds nesting in a small area of grassland in Myanmar's central Bago region in May last year, according to their report published in the latest edition of Birding Asia. Re-discovered: The Jerdon's Babbler which was thought extinct for 73 years until scientists found evidence of it living in Burma . The scientists targeted some of the few remaining patches of wild grassland left along Myanmar's mighty Irrawaddy river, now one of the most heavily cultivated and densely populated regions of the impoverished but emerging southeast Asian nation. At one small patch of grassland near an abandoned agricultural station, the team heard what they thought could be the babbler's call. They then used a recording of a Jerdon's Babbler from the Indian subcontinent to see if the bird would show itself. Frank Rheindt, from the National University of Singapore, told AFP he was the first person to spot the bird during the survey, which was also carried out with members of the Wildlife Conservation Society and Myanmar's Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division. 'It was unbelievable,' he recalled. 'We played the sound recordings and one of the birds came up from the reed beds. Like many song birds in reed beds you hardly ever see them, they only come out to defend their territory when they hear a territorial call.' Further searches over the next two days uncovered more birds allowing researchers to obtain blood samples and photographs. But researchers warned that the bird's survival is still far from guaranteed given pressure on Myanmar's few remaining grasslands. 'This discovery not only proves that the species still exists in Myanmar but that the habitat can still be found as well,' Colin Poole, director of Wildlife Conservation Society's regional hub in Singapore, said in a statement. 'Future work is needed to identify remaining pockets of natural grassland and develop systems for local communities to conserve and benefit from them,' he added. Birds fly over the Moe Yun Gyi Wetlands in Bago Division, Myanmar, where Jerdon's Babbler was re-discovered 73 years after it was believed to be extinct . Rheindt said the area of grassland where the bird was found was very small, 'around 50-80 hectares' and that new chicken and fish farms were being built nearby. He added that its plumage and song were significantly different to how it had been described by ornithologists in the early twentieth century - leading the team to suspect that it may differ from threatened populations found in Nepal, India and Pakistan. His team now hope to conduct DNA tests to decide if it is a separate species. Burma's quasi-civilian government replaced decades of brutal military rule in 2011. It has since embarked on a series of political reforms and shown itself to be far more open to foreign businesses and academic researchers than the country's generals were. Burma has more species of bird than any other country in mainland Southeast Asia, with ornithologists saying this number is could increase if more scientific research is conducted.","Was last spotted in Burma in 1941,and was thought to have died out .

"The board of trustees for University of Oklahoma's Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity has admitted that the racist chant that shocked the nation had been circulating among the brothers for three to four years before it surfaced last weekend on social media. The alumni who oversaw the disgraced chapter of SAE issued a statement on Wednesday calling the song a 'horrible cancer' and apologized for not stamping it out when it emerged years ago. The statement confirms reports that the 'there will never be a n***** SAE' chant heard aboard a chartered fraternity bus last weekend had been passed down between generations of new pledges. The national SAE headquarters has denied that the song is part of the fraternity's tradition, though officials said they are investigating claims of racism at other chapters across the country. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was closed down on Monday and fraternity members forced to moved out . A popular statue on the OU campus was adorned with a protest from the group that leaked the racist SAE video. The statue 'Sower' had its mouth taped over with the word 'unheard' On Tuesday, the president of the University of Texas announced he had launched an investigation into reports that the song had been used by members of the SAE fraternity there, as well. The trustees also intimated that current and former members of the fraternity were being harassed and threatened and called for 'all parties to begin the healing process.' 'The OU SAE Board of Trustees has discovered that a horrible cancer entered into the OU chapter of SAE three to four years ago and was not immediately and totally stopped,' the statement said. 'It should have been. We are sincerely remorseful for the pain that this terrible chant has caused and would ask for your forgiveness. We are truly sorry.' On Monday, the University of Oklahoma shut down the SAE chapter on its campus and closed down the house. On Tuesday, President David Boren expelled the two students at the center of the racist chant. The video that emerged on social media on Sunday was taken aboard a chartered bus with members of SAE and the sorority Delta Delta Delta. The shocking racist song has been circulating the SAE fraternity at OU for at least three years, trustees said . It included two brothers - 19-year-old Parker Rice and 20-year-old Levi Pettit - leading other fraternity members in singing 'there will never be a n***** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me. There will never be a n***** SAE.' The members of the board of trustees for the fraternity were not identified in the statement.  OU spokesman Corbin Wallace told Daily Mail Online fraternity trustee boards are typically made up of alumni and that they oversee the administration and finances of the fraternity houses. A request for comment from the SAE headquarters in Evanston, Illinois, was not immediately returned. The OU SAE Board of Trustees has discovered that a horrible cancer entered into the OU chapter of SAE three to four years ago and was not immediately and totally stopped. It should have been. We are sincerely remorseful for the pain that this terrible chant has caused and would ask for your forgiveness. We are truly sorry. For the safety of the students that were involved and the students who were not involved, our desire would be for all parties to begin the healing process. We hope that this despicable situation will forever change an atmosphere that would even allow an incident like this to take place.","Alumni who governed disgraced chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity said they failed to stamp out racist chant when it emerged three to four years ago .

"When it comes to tracking down the perfect pair of jeans, there is no other piece of clothing that induces so much stress. As well as adhering to the style of the season (flared? skinny? boyfriend?), women want jeans that flatter their bottom, suck in their tummy and make their legs look longer. Perhaps, then, it comes as little surprise that a recent study by Tampax Compak Pearl found that 40 per cent of women struggle to find the perfect fit - and 15 per cent have even been reduced to tears in their efforts. Scroll down for video . New research reveals that 40 per cent of women struggle to find the perfect fit of jeans - but there is an exact formula for finding a pair to suit your shape.

But, according to a celebrity denim expert, there is a tried-and-tested formula to finding the perfect pair to flatter - and it's all about your body shape. Jean queen, Donna Ida Thornton, whose designs are worn by the likes of Millie Mackintosh, has devised some denim-buying hacks. If you have a boyish shape - similar to Cara Delevingne, left, and Cameron Diaz, right,  you can wear most styles, according to denim expert Donna Ida Thornton but add shape with some zip detailing like Cara . If you have a boyish shape - similar to Cara Delevingne and Cameron Diaz - you can wear most styles, according to Donna. 'Add some shape and interest with zips and details on back pockets,' she suggests for women with this figure. Pear-shaped women, who, like Kim Kardashian, have a smaller top half than bottom and boast fuller hips and a shapely lower half, should opt for high-waisted jeans. 'Look for skinny jeans in a high waisted style - it elongates the leg and slims down the hip,' said Donna. If, like Lena Dunham, you possess an apple shape you should opt for elasticated waistbands. Women with apple body shapes, which are larger across their mid-section, typically with slimmer legs, should look for plenty of stretch in a straight leg in a dark wash as they complement every curve, advises Donna. Ladies with long legs, like supermodels Candice Swanepoel, left, and Karlie Kloss, right, look best in a mid to low rise to keep the waist at the right height, says Donna . Ladies with long legs, like supermodel Karlie Kloss, often struggle to find jeans that fit their stomach and their pins. Sharing her advice, Donna said: 'Ladies with long legs look best in a mid to low rise to keep the waist at the right height, whereas petite girls look great in a high rise that accentuates the waist and elongates the legs.' Revealing other essential tips for buying jeans, she explained that if jeans go on easily, go down a size. 'Kicking your way into the legs isn’t unusual, and the waistband should be snug, if you can fit two fingers down the back that’s good, a whole hand is not,' she said. When buying jeans with super stretch, she suggests looking for good quality denim that has great memory. 'The ""memory"" is how quickly the denim springs back after wear,' she explains. 'Buy them firm but not overly tight. If you have ""seam strain"" down the legs, they are possibly too tight and this could damage the stretch.' She also explains that a curved or pieced waistband is ideal for flattering all shapes. 'This will be slightly higher at the back than the front and will curve into your waist rather than sit straight up,' she said. Once you've chosen the perfect pair of jeans, Donna says it's essential to read the care instructions. She added: 'Most premium jeans are best washed COLD, that’s cold and not 30 degrees. Any warmer and you are damaging the fabric.'

"Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps is once again having the alleged details of his sexual escapades shared by a former paramour. This time around it is Kim Petro, a 36-year-old plus-sized dominatrix from New York City who is detailing her wild night spent with the swimmer, one that she claims involved her urinating on him and Phelps wearing women's underwear. This all comes just a few months after another woman, Taylor Lianne Chandler, came forward to detail her sexually-fueled relationship with the highly-decorated athlete. It also comes a month after Phelps popped the question to girlfriend Nicole Johnson, a former Miss California. Plus-sized dominatrix Kim Petro (above) has given an interview claiming she had a wild night with swimmer Michael Phelps who paid her a $900 'donation' 'When he said drink some water before I get to the hotel, I knew what I was in for,' said Petro of Phelps (above) She alleges that she urinated on Phelps while he lay on his bed in the London hotel in women's underwear in February 2013. Afterwards, she claims she showed him her breasts while he pleasured himself and two smoked marijuana together . In an interview with The National Enquirer, Petro says that Phelps contacted her in February 2013 and paid a $900 'donation' for her to come to his hotel room at The London in Manhattan. This after an online posting that said; 'All-natural, super busty fetish provider with all the right curves in all the right places. 'Time with me is time well spent. Nothing shocks me. Don't be shy.' Phelps, Petro claims, called her on his cell phone, saying his name was Fabian Marasciullo, a Miami music producer who is close to Phelps' good friend, rapper Lil' Wayne. 'When he said drink some water before I get to the hotel, I knew what I was in for,' said Petro. 'I was going to go to the bathroom anyway - I figured I might as well get paid for it!' When she got to the hotel she claims Phelps removed his shirt and then shorts to reveal that he was wearing 'skimpy women's underwear.' They then smoked a little weed according to Petro and got down to business. 'I got above him [on the bed] to [urinate on him],' said Petro. 'After I was done, he asked if it was okay to [pleasure himself]. Of course, I’m going to bend the rules a little for a famous Olympian, so he pulled down his panties.' That is when she claims she noticed he had a string tied around his genitals. 'I grabbed [the string] and pulled, and I also took out my breasts because he wanted to see them,' she said. This comes just months after another of Phelps' former paramours, Taylor Lianne Chandler (above), shared details of their alleged sexual romps. 'The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman,' said Chandler of Phelps . Phelps proposed to girlfriend Nicole Johnson, a former Miss California, last month . Chandler, 41, also detailed her relationship with Phelps to the Enquirer, specifically their first date that involved sex in a public restroom at a Baltimore Ravens game. 'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she said in the interview. 'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.' Chandler, who was born intersex and claims she met Phelps on the dating and hookup app Tinder, also said; 'Spending time with him was like a teenage love affair. I have never felt so comfortable and accepted in every way as I did with him.' She also claimed she was with Phelps when he was arrested and jailed for DUI last September, which resulted in a six-month suspension from competitive swimming. He announced on his Instagram in February that he and Johnson had become engaged, sharing a photo of the two and writing; 'She said yes.'","Plus-sized dominatrix Kim Petro has given an interview claiming she had a wild night with swimmer Michael Phelps who paid her a $900 'donation'

Mimick: During the opening of the show the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, speaks about allegations she used a private email account to conduct state business . Speaking to the camera: At the beginning of the interview she describes herself as a 'relateable woman on a couch' before revealing the content of the emails . Speaking about the release of the emails, following pressure from her opponents and the media, she says: 'Go ahead, read them, you won't find squat. 'Those emails are as clean as a whistle. What did you think those emails said? ""Hey it's Hilary I really screwed up on Benghazi"".' Referencing her probable run for president, she also insists: 'There will be no mistakes in my rise to the top.' She then describes the nature of the content in the messages, suggesting they will either by 'fun woman talk' or 'mature romance' - relating to correspondences with husband Bill.

"The family of Winston Churchill, pictured, have donated 37 of his paintings to the state following the death of his one remaining child . A collection of Winston Churchill’s paintings has been given to the public by the late Prime Minister’s family to settle a multi-million pound tax bill. The politician’s family was left owing £9.4million in inheritance tax following the death of his last surviving child Lady Mary Soames last year. But rather than selling off the prized collection of 37 paintings, his family has given the paintings to the nation under a specialist tax scheme for important pieces of art. As part of the deal the vast majority of the paintings will be permanently displayed to the public at Chartwell, Churchill’s former home that is now run by the National Trust. The wartime Prime Minister took up the hobby at the age of 41 and continued painting in a figurative style into his 80s, producing more than 500 works. Although his amateur offerings never received mass critical acclaim, they have attracted huge prices on the private market from avid fans of ‘Churchilliana’ buyers. The value of his paintings was highlighted last year when The Goldfish Pool at Chartwell – depicting the garden feature which he dug and visited daily - was sold for a record £1.8m. Despite selling many of his prized possessions at auction last year, Lady Soames’s will included a request that the paintings remain on display at Chartwell. She also asked that Coast Scene near Cannes should remain in the Houses of Parliament and that View From a Bathing Hut at the Miami Surf Club stays in the Churchill War Rooms. Lady Soames, who died last June at the age of 91, previously described how painting ‘literally ‘grabbed’ her father in 1915. She credited the hobby for ‘playing an increasing and abiding role in his life, renewing the source of his great inner strength and enabling him to face storms, ride out depressions and rise above the tough passages in his political life’. The items were donated to the nation under the acceptance in lieu scheme, which allows people to offset inheritance tax against valuable items of cultural significance. Churchill's painting 'The Goldfish Pool at Chartwell', pictured, sold recently for a record £1.8 million . Some of the collection will remain on permanent display at Churchill's home, Chartwell, pictured . The scheme sees the Government accept the items for the full market value, provided they can be permanently bequeathed to a museum or gallery. It also offers a ‘good deal’ for those offering up historically important items, with works avoiding the taxes associated with a sale on the private market. Inheritance tax is paid at 40 per cent when an estate exceeds £325,000 but the scheme sees the amount of tax incurred by the objects reduced to 25 per cent of its market value. The secretary of state for culture, media and sport is responsible for deciding whether the items offer a good deal for the taxpayer after being advised by a board of experts. The Government has accepted items worth £124.5 million instead of tax between 2009 and 2013. The Churchill family has previously courted controversy after benefitting from the sale of prized possession to the state. The war leader’s collection of pre-1945 speeches and letter was sold to the nation in 1995 for £12.5million using money from the Heritage Lottery Fund. As well as 37 of Churchill’s paintings, the collection also included a painting by Sir John Lavery and the Aly Khan Gold Cup, which was won by Churchill’s horse High Hat in 1961. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said: ‘It is fitting that in the 50th year since his death these paintings by the great war-time leader Sir Winston Churchill will be displayed in three very significant locations that helped shape his life and gives us an opportunity to appreciate the artistic talent of a man who was a colossal figure in world politics.’ Chairman of the Acceptance in Lieu Panel Edward Harley said: ‘Fifty years after his death and 70 years after the end of the War, Churchill remains one of this nation’s greatest figures. ‘His paintings let us see the man in the round and not just as a great politician.’","Winston Churchill's family donated the artwork to settle a large tax bill .

Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established. Comments from her followers include ones such as: 'she looks like me on a normal day' and 'I had to look at it for ages to notice she was pregnant' Sarah has over 1m Instagram followers who regularly comment on her trim baby body .

"A father has been charged with child neglect after his two toddlers were found malnourished and dehydrated in a squalid home. The children, aged two and three, were found abandoned in a crib at their home in Princeton, Minnesota, by their father Michael S. Gunderson, 32. The mother, who had been out of state for  two months, 'discovered the children  weak and thin', police told The Star Tribune on Monday, with one child too weak to walk. The home was filthy with dog feces. Michael S.

"Police have been accused of creating a ‘charter for criminals’ with a scheme that allows officers to ignore low-value offences. The powers mean they can dismiss a crime if the investigation cost outweighs the value of the item stolen or damaged. Victims have been told that unless the stolen object exceeds £50 in value, police do not have to bother with an investigation. Police have been accused of creating a ‘charter for criminals’ with a scheme that allows officers to ignore low-value offences (file picture) Last night the move was roundly condemned by MPs, anti-crime campaigners and criminologists who said the scheme handed offenders a ‘licence to steal’. They said the police power of ‘discretionary disposal’ could forever change the criminal justice system which was founded on a principle of caution or prosecute. Mark Williams, a businessman who had his fridge stolen, was stunned to hear police would not investigate as it was worth less than £50. The 50-year-old, of New Ferry, Wirral, was selling the fridge on eBay, with the buyer picking it up from his flat. The fridge was loaded into his van and he told Mr Williams he would secure it and then pay him. Instead, he drove away. Mr Williams called police, giving them the vehicle registration, the man’s name and description and details of his eBay account. Mark Williams (pictured) was told police would not investigate the theft of his fridge because it was worth less than £50 . But he received a letter a few days later from Merseyside Police, which read: ‘I am sorry to inform you that the theft that you reported will not be investigated due to the low value of the fridge (£16.00) as the cost of the investigation would outweigh the cost of the item stolen. ‘The crime report will be closed using the Police Discretionary Disposal method as it is not in the public interest to pursue the offender.’ Mr Williams said: ‘I was absolutely astonished police have been handed the power … It is a charter for criminals, a licence to commit crimes. 'They could make a mint stealing items under the value of £50 and never face a courtroom.’ He added: ‘This anoints police the judge and jury … criminals who can be pursued and brought to justice will simply escape unpunished to go on to more serious and larger crimes.’ Discretionary disposals, created to save policing costs, were first introduced in Northern Ireland and have yet to be widely used on the British mainland. But critics expressed concern that the power was an option at all. David Green, criminologist and founder of think-tank Civitas, said: ‘In areas where there are problems of disorder it could end up tipping the balance in favour of the criminal element as opposed to the law-abiding.’ Nick De Bois, Tory MP of the Justice Select Committee, said the disposals send ‘a signal that crime is OK and will be tolerated at a certain level’, adding: ‘If we let this take root then we are looking at criminal justice from the wrong end of the telescope.’ Others said the powers had been introduced by stealth to avoid public outcry and called for an explanation from the Home Office. A spokesman for Families Against Crime said: ‘This is a preposterous scheme … It’s time the Home Office stamped it out.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘This Government expects all police forces to investigate all crimes reported to them.’ Merseyside Police stood by the use of discretionary disposal, which it introduced two years ago, but said it was wrongly applied in Mr Williams’s case – and would make ‘further enquiries’. A spokesman said the scheme allowed officers to focus on the ‘most serious’ crimes, not those ‘highly unlikely to be detected’.","Police accused of creating a 'charter for criminals' after rolling out scheme .

"Kim Sears waited eight years for a proposal from Andy Murray, Mariah Carey accepted Nick Cannon’s offer of marriage after one month. How long it takes you to get married is entirely individual but when one person is gagging to get up the aisle and the other has no intention of going there, there are clearly questions that need answering. Staying with someone who’s using you as a stop-gap until their ‘true’ love comes along isn’t healthy; staying with someone who loves you but doesn’t want to get married for justifiable reasons is entirely different. Tracey Cox reveals the signs to look out for to work out whether your partner is 'the one' But how do you know who’s holding out for better and who’s genuine, albeit marriage shy? There are the seven key questions to consider, according to relationship therapists - and two you need to ask yourself. 1. What’s their background and relationship history? It is often used as an excuse but the ‘I don’t believe in the institution of marriage - it’s just a ‘piece of paper’’ is understandable if based on past experience. A previous failed marriage can make people cynical about a repeat performance. If your partner’s parents had a toxic marriage, treated each other badly and were desperately unhappy, it’s hardly surprising they’re not keen to follow in their footsteps. Their fear isn’t about getting married, it’s fear of it ending in a messy, painful divorce. Are they happy discussing marriage even if not happy doing it? If you can’t sit down and have an open, honest discussion with someone you love about something that is important to you, you shouldn’t be marrying them in the first place. If a partner refuses to even talk through the topic, it shows a distinct lack of interest in you and your feelings which isn’t a great indicator for a healthy, long-term relationship. 2. Can they tell you the reason why they’re not interested? It’s a huge red flag if their answer to ‘Why don’t you want to marry me?” is “I don’t know”. Usually one of two things is going on. They’re avoiding telling the truth - they don’t want to marry you - or it suggests a lack of self-awareness and ability to articulate feelings. Neither are indicative of a healthy functioning relationship. 3. Do they have a problem with the actual ceremony? One couple I knew nearly split because the guy refused to discuss marriage even though he was desperately in love with his partner. He nearly lost her before admitting that, as a shy person, the thought of being the centre of attention and having to make a speech in front of dozens of people scared him witless. Think about anything else about the ceremony they might be dreading. 4. Does the thought of all their family being together in one room make them want to run for the hills? Tracey says that being to optimistic could be a sign that your relationship is in danger . Offer up some alternatives - a registry office, garden party with a few friends, just the two of you away somewhere, writing your own vows instead of repeating words that might mean nothing to them - and see what response you get. 5. Is it about money? I’m not just talking about who will finance the wedding but what happens after that. Men, particularly, will often put off getting married until they feel financially secure. Even they intellectually know we live in (more) equal times, that inbuilt male desire to want to provide can kick in with the most ‘feminised’ man at times like this. 6. Are they worried getting married might ruin a good relationship? We’ve all heard of couples who finally marry after more than a decade only to split a few months later. Usually this is because the relationship was failing and getting married was a last-ditch attempt to save it, given all the history shared. But to someone who is thoroughly enjoying the relationship they have now, seeing others fail is a reason to be nervous. Why fix it, if it isn’t broken?, they reason. Some personalities are better suited to living together than marriage. Some see marriage as security, comfort, an expression of deep and lasting love. Others see it as suffocating, claustrophobic and stifling. They might be very happy to live with you forever without being formally ‘forced’ to stay but find the thought of ‘having’ to stay unappealing. 7. Are they happy committing, if not getting married? Don’t confuse marriage with commitment. Plenty of couples are committed to each other without being married and being married doesn’t ensure your partner will be committed (or faithful). If they’ll happily chat about things like buying houses, planning holidays, looking after parents in later life and other things that will tie you together for an awfully long time, they have a problem with marriage, not committing to you and your relationship. If your partner clearly loves you, is committed for life but just doesn’t want to get married, does it really matter? Why is marriage important to you? There are many reasons to want to get married. Be honest with yourself about what your motivation is. Do you want to get married for moral or religious reasons? Are you jealous and want to make sure others know your partner’s off limits? Are you doing it because all your friends are and you feel left out? Do you want to send an ‘I’m over you alright!’ message to an ex? Or do you fancy a big party with all your friends and a chance to show off? Are you doing it to boost your self-esteem? The high of planning a wedding and being the envy of others who’d also like to be getting married, works wonders to prop up sagging self-confidence. Until, of course, the wedding is over and everything reverts straight back to what it was with no problem solved and one created if you realise you’re married to the wrong person. How healthy is your relationship? The worst reason of all to get married is thinking it will fix an floundering relationship. Are you pushing for it too soon? If you’ve been together less than six months, it’s more ‘What are you thinking?’ than ‘Slow down’. Yes, of course there are exceptions of couples who marry weeks into their relationship and remain blissfully happy years later. But there are more couples who fall into the ‘marry in haste, repent in leisure’ category. What’s the rush, anyway, if you’re going to be together forever? Most research on marital happiness suggests couples who’ve been together 18 months before getting engaged, then marry within a year, have the best chance at lasting long-term. Statistics are statistics and not always right but this does provide a good yardstick to measure your eagerness by. If you’re suggesting marriage way earlier than most people and your partner’s baulking at the idea, this may actually mean they’re more serious about you, than you are them. While there’s an undeniable romantic appeal to the notion of ‘love at first sight’, is it not more romantic (not to mention sensible) to give your marriage the best possible chance to succeed by waiting a little?","Sex expert reveals how to stop if someone is using you as a 'stop gap'

"The Liberal Democrats have been accused of accepting a potentially illegal donation in a new party funding scandal. An undercover reporter, posing as an Indian businessman, was told he could make a major gift to the party without revealing his identity, it was claimed. Treasury minister Danny Alexander was dragged into the row after he was recorded urging him to give more money, but Nick Clegg insisted he had done nothing more than poliutley thank a suporter for their help. The journalist, who was posing as an Indian businessman, was allegedly told to split his donations between family members to keep his identity a secret, and was pictured at a meeting with Danny Alexander . An undercover Daily Telegraph reporter was reportedly told that by spreading his donation among other family members, he would not exceed the £7,500 threshold requiring him to be named on the Electoral Commission register. The reporter was offered private meetings with Nick Clegg and other senior figures. He was allegedly told he could also back-date cheques so he appeared to have given the money in different years and could avoid declaring it as a lump sum. The fake donor was said to have been invited to a fundraising dinner with senior Lib Dem figures after he and his fictional 'cousin' handed the party £9,100. The donation was sought by Ibrahim Taguri, the party's former chief fundraiser. He is running to be an MP in Brent Central. He was pictured at a private meeting with Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander who allegedly encouraged him to provide further financial support and said his money would 'genuinely make a difference to the results of the election'. The cabinet minister is said to have told him: ‘I just want you to know that I, personally, am very, very grateful for what you’re doing. It genuinely will make a difference to the results of the election’. Mr Taguri was recorded telling him: ‘When you do this, the doors will open for you… We’re going to introduce you to the parties, they will be, very, very helpful once they know you are helpful.’ But Mr Clegg told LBC radio that the recording showed 'Danny being a polite guy, just saying thank you to someone who he has been told is supporting the party'. The Lib Dem leader added: 'The idea that Danny or any parliamentarian has done anything wrong is categorically untrue. 'On the issue of Ibrahim Taguri, no cheque has been received by the Liberal Democrats, no cheque has been cashed. If we had received this cheque in question, of course it would have been scrutinised and checked.' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg insisted Mr Alexander was just being 'a polite guy' and had done nothing wrong . The scandal will put the spotlight on how funding is sought by the Lib Dems and, potentially, other parties, and what access they may have been offering in return. It comes weeks after ex-foreign secretaries Malcolm Rifkind and Jack Straw were filmed accepting money to work for a bogus Chinese firm. The fake businessman is understood to have made contact with Mr Taguri, the party's spokesman on race equality. He told the candidate he wanted to donate but keep his funding 'secret', the Daily Telegraph reported last night. Mr Taguri apparently told him the money would 'open doors' explaining donors can give £1,500 to a local party office or £7,500 to the central party per year without having their name on the register. The undercover reporter donated £1,450 to Mr Taguri, just under the limit, last October, it was claimed. The fresh scandal comes just weeks after Sir Malcolm Rifkind (left) and Jack Straw (right) were  caught offering to exploit their parliamentary connections while working for a bogus Chinese firm . But it is alleged that the aspiring MP then told the businessman he could use 'cheeky' ways to donate larger sums by using 'a cousin' to give money for him or back-dating cheques. The reporter was said to have then arranged for a 'cousin' to donate a further £7,650. He was then invited to a Lib Dem fundraising dinner. Mr Taguri was recorded telling him: 'When you do this, the doors will open for you… We're going to introduce you to the parties, they will be, very, very helpful once they know you are helpful.' The following month it is alleged the fake businessman asked Mr Taguri for some contacts at local councils as he was interested in pursuing housing grants to help his property investments. The Lib Dems said they were investigating the claims. Mr Taguri denied any wrongdoing. He said he had not cashed the cheque and would have declared it properly. He added he thought the 'cousin' had given his own money and that he was 'publicly declaring all donations', even those he was not required to disclose. A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'Had the money come to us, which it as of yet hasn't, we would have declared the original source as is legally required and we would have no intention of doing anything otherwise.' Electoral Commission rules say intermediaries 'must not be used as an attempt to evade the controls on permissibility and transparency'.","Undercover reporter was allegedly told to split donation among family .

"Janice Sage became the owner of a picturesque Maine inn 22 years ago, after entering a writing contest. Now the 68-year-old innkeeper is ready to retire and plans to hand off the keys to the Center Lovell Inn and Restaurant to a new owner with a new contest. Ms Sage announced the  contest late last year, and expects to receive 7,500 entries from prospective new owners by the May 7 deadline. On Monday, the Daily Mail Online spoke with Ms Sage about her decision to finally step away from the inn she's toiled at and invested $500,000 into for renovations. All this could be yours: The owner of the Center Lovell Inn and Restaurant in Maine is holding a contest, with the winner getting to take over ownership of the historic inn built in 1805 . 'I've been in the business 38 years so it's time to retire,' Ms Sage said, adding that she's looking forward to doing nothing in her retirement after years of 17-hour workdays. Ms Sage says she can't reveal the essay that won her the inn in 1993, but she believes her 16 years running a restaurant in Maryland helped. 'One of the judges told me they chose me because they saw that I could carry on the inn and make it a viable business,' Ms Sage said. While Ms Sage has the right to sell the business, as the outright owner, she has decided to give it away with a new essay contest out of goodwill. 'I just want to pass it on to somebody else who is looking for an inn, who possibly can't own it on their own outright and I think this is a good way to pay it forward,' she said. Ms Sage hopes to read all of the applications by May 17, and says she'll be impressed by grammatically correct entries that show a passion for work. Current owner: Janice Sage (pictured above) has owned the Center Lovell Inn since 1993, when she won a similar contest . Deadline approaching: Prospective owners can apply to take over the inn by submitting a 200-word essay and $125 by the deadline of May 7 . The prompt for the essay is simple: 'Why I would like to own and operate a country inn.' Prospective new owners must answer the question in a pithy 200 words, and pay $125 to enter the contest. Ms Sage will be keeping the money from the application, which could exceed the inn's estimated value of $900,000. Ms Sage won't choose the winner, though. Instead, she'll whittle down the list to the top 20 candidates and then let a two-person team who have no stake in the inn select the winner by May 21. The inn will then transfer to the new owner within 30 days, along with $20,000 to jumpstart the business. However, the new owners must agree to keep the inn, which dates back to 1805, painted white with green or black trim. They must also run the property as an inn for at least one year after the handover. Busy, busy: The inn, located three hours north of Boston, is open year round and its seven rooms are routinely booked up seven days a week in the high season . While the new owners can revel in self-employment, the job of keeping up the inn is no easy work, Ms Sage warns. The inn, located three hours north of Boston, is open year round and its seven rooms are routinely booked up seven days a week in the high season. Everyday, Ms Sage and about 10 employees work to cook breakfast, clean rooms, take reservations, check out guests and serve dinner. 'Unless you raise 14 kids, you’re not going to be used to this,' Ms Sage told the Boston Globe. 'Look, this is something you start when you’re young. It takes a lot of stamina.' Ms Sage was 46 when she took over the inn, having never visited Maine before in her life. When she learned she was the lucky winner, she brought along her parents to help with the new place (her father has since passed and mother is now in a nursing home). Ms Sage grew to love Maine and plans to remain in the area for the time being.","Janice Sage, current owner of the Center Lovell Inn, won the inn in a 1993 essay contest .

"Obama, pictured on Wednesday, made his first remarks on Ferguson police's racial discrimination . President Obama said the type of racial discrimination found in Ferguson, Missouri, is not unique to that police department, and he cast law enforcement reform as a chief struggle for today's civil rights movement. Obama said improving civil rights and civil liberties with police is one of the areas that 'requires collective action and mobilization' 50 years after pivotal civil rights marches brought change to the country. The president made his first remarks about this week's Justice Department report of racial bias in Ferguson, which found officers routinely discriminating against blacks by using excessive force. The Justice Department refused to prosecute Ferguson cop Darren Wilson despite compiling a 350,000-page report on racial profiling in the Missouri city which 'led to' him fatally shooting unarmed black teen Michael Brown on August 9, 2014. 'I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,' Obama told The Joe Madison Radio Show on Sirius XM radio's Urban View channel. 'I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they're protecting and serving all people and not just some.' Obama's interview was to preview his trip Saturday to Selma, Alabama, where he plans to speak from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where white police officers beat civil rights protesters on March 7, 1965. Obama last visited Selma in 2007, when he was running for the Democratic presidential nomination and spoke about the responsibility of those who came after the civil rights generation of the '60s to carry on the struggle. It was a theme he reiterated ahead of his return visit. In another interview with radio host Tom Joyner, Obama said that despite the progress in race relations over the past 50 years, the Justice Department findings about Ferguson show that civil rights 'is an unfinished project.' 'There is work to be done right now,' he said. On Friday, Obama was kicking off the weekend's 50th anniversary with a town hall meeting at South Carolina's Benedict College, a historically black college. The White House said Obama plans to speak about efforts young people made throughout history to expand opportunity. Obama's visit to Columbia is his first trip to South Carolina as president. Obama has just two other states to reach his goal of traveling to all 50 in office - South Dakota and Utah.

"Police are investigating a string of suspected arson attacks on three Melbourne Catholic churches with links to paedophile priests. Emergency services were called to a fire at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2am on Wednesday, and police are treating the blaze as suspicious. The church is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased convicted paedophile Father Kevin O'Donnell. Police are investigating whether the blaze is connected to two separate suspicious blazes that were lit on Monday at St James Catholic Church in Brighton and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda, where paedophile priest Ronald Pickering served as minister. Emergency services were called to a fire at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2am on Wednesday, and police are treating the blaze as suspicious . Firefighters extinguished blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street . On Wednesday, it took firefighters 90 minutes to extinguish blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street in Dandenong. Father O'Donnell - who was reportedly known by police as the 'two-a-day man' - was jailed for 15 months in 1995 after he admitted to abusing 10 boys and two girls. He is believed to have committed hundreds of sexual assaults against  young girls and boys over the 50 years that he worked in Victorian Catholic churches, before he retired in 1992. He died in 1997. St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased Father Kevin O'Donnell . At the Dandenong church in 1958 Father O'Donnell allegedly molested a 15-year-old boy in the presbytery and went on to sexually abuse his brother, sister and friends, The Age reported. He presided over the church from 1958 to 1986, before moving onto Oakleigh. On Monday, heritage-listed St James Catholic Church in Brighton was mostly destroyed by fire and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda was found with a small amount fire damage to a door. Bishop Peter Elliott told 3AW Catholic churches would be increasing their security, and said he did not believe the fires were lit by sex abuse victims. Australian actress Rachel Griffiths said she was 'quite elated' when she heard the 124-year-old James Catholic church  had been destroyed by fire. The Six Feet Under star revealed that like many of the church's former parishioners she found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east. Firefighters desperately tried to battle a fierce blaze that took hold of the  building at around 6.30am on Monday morning but it was left gutted. Ms Griffiths told 774 ABC Melbourne the church was plagued by 'tragedy and complicated feelings' and described it as being known locally as 'the haunted house on the hill'. 'We've all attended many funerals of boys that we now know were abused by [Father Ronald] Pickering ... and other perpetrators in the parish - at the actual church that it occurred in,' she said. 'It's been hard for priests to really cleanse this parish, it's been very difficult to rebuild a community and we pretty much all scattered after the revelations came out and found other parishes.' 80 firefighters attended the scene to battle the blaze at St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east . Australian actress Rachel Griffiths is happy that her former Melbourne church has burned down because of its past links to a paedophile priest . Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church because of the sick crimes that historically took place inside it. Her mother stopped taking her to the church after her father left them because Pickering wouldn't have a 'divorced woman in the church'. 'I think that's probably one thing that saved our family that so many of my friends' brothers got involved with,' she said. Ronald Pickering abused boys between 1960 and 1980 while working as a priest in Melbourne . 'We stopped going because he stopped my mother at the door.' At least five people killed themselves after being sexually abused by paedophile priest Ronald Pickering between 1960 and 1980, according to research carried out in 2012. The former priest was named by the Catholic Church in 2013 as being guilty of sexually abusing children. However, after emigrating to Britain in the 1990s he was never brought to justice before he died. One victim, Raymond D'Brass, told a 2013 Victorian government inquiry that Pickering groomed him with cigarettes, money and alcohol. He was abused between the age of 9 and 13 while acting as a choir and altar boy at the church. In his statement at the parliamentary inquiry on March 4, 2013, Mr D'Brass said: 'Over this four-year period I am aware that two other boys were also sexually abused by Father Ronald Pickering. 'I was regularly fondled and petted by Pickering, as were other boys. This occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery. I began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with Pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol, which left me vulnerable to such abuse.' Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church . Photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky . He recalled: 'I now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses, as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication. In 1983, I stopped going to the presbytery after Pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming Sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father. 'He told me that I was not welcome back and that I would burn in hell. Between 1983 and 1987, the two other boys who I know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money, alcohol and cigarettes from Pickering, but I chose not to because I was terrified of him. I have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by Pickering. 'One night after one of the boys paid a visit to Pickering, he attempted suicide. He was unsuccessful on this attempt, but he would go on to successfully commit suicide a short time later.' Many of the church's former parishioners found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton after revelations of child abuse came out . The church is described as a 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church' on its heritage-listed page . The cause of the fire has not yet been established. 'MFB will determine the cause of the fire and then if it's suspicious it will be passed on to police,' a Victoria Police spokesperson said. More than 80 firefighters and 20 trucks were at the scene where the ancient bluestone church was fully alight on Monday morning. A caller to radio show 3AW, named Andrew, said: 'You can hear that in the background, the roof is actually collapsing now.' 20 fire trucks were at the scene of the fire at the ancient bluestone church . Residents watching the fire were cleared from the area because of asbestos. And a 10 metre exclusion zone was put in place around the building over fears of structural collapse. MFB spokesperson David Jarwood told the ABC the smoke could be seen from 50 kilometres away. 'It's about 50 by 40 metres apparently the blaze is, the structure, so I'm not surprised people can see a plume from Mornington,' he said. Smoke from the St James Church fire could be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge. An advice notice put out by the MFB said: 'Emergency services are attending to building fire in North Rd Brighton. The area of North Rd and St James Brighton is currently closed and people are advised to avoid the area.' Smoke from the St James Church fire can be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge . The church was built in 1891 and the Parish of Saint James was established a year later. In 1990 a bell tower and bells were installed at a cost of $500,000. The Victorian Heritage Database website said the church 'stands on a site which has great importance in the early history of Catholicism in Victoria as the place where the mission to Brighton was established circa 1854'. It is described as 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church, rectory and church close, mostly dating from the last century but with additions made in 1908 and in the 1920s'. It has an 'unusually elaborate 1934 decoration of the chancel with Roman mosaic flooring, opus sectile tiling and marble altars and rails.

"As senators debated the Arctic, DC-dwellers engaged in their own seasonal politics. Defying the city's sledding ban, around 100 children and adults took to Capitol Hill to tumble down the thick layer of snow on Thursday. A group of parents claimed to be staging a 'sled-in' to protest against the rule, tweeting about it with the hash tag #SledFreeOrDie. Though Capitol Police refused to lift the ban - citing the fact that there are 20,000 yearly sledding injuries - no arrests have yet been made. Scroll down for video . Come sled with me! Twin sisters Charlotte and Kendall Adams, eight, sled down Capitol Hill on Thursday . Having a blast: Colton Fleming, six, was one of dozens involved in a sled-in to oppose the unpopular ban . Demands: This man came out in the snow armed with placards calling for an end to the ban . Political: Parents have been lobbying to end the ban for years. It came into place after the 9/11 attacks . 'This is a great day for sledding and democracy,' Tim Krepp, one of the snow-covered parents, told The Hill. He added that he had been warned by police to stop sledding but was not detained for persisting. 'We're out here sledding for America,' Mai Fernandez told Reuters Television after she skidded down the hill with her dog, Ariel, in her lap.

The weather closed schools, canceled nearly 4,000 flights and stranded hundreds of drivers in Kentucky. The District of Columbia's non-voting delegate to Congress, Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, wrote to Capitol Police officials on Wednesday, asking them briefly lift the grounds' sledding ban to take advantage of the late-winter snow. That was turned down by Frank Larkin, the Senate sergeant at arms who heads the Capitol Police Board, citing security concerns that made the area 'not your typical neighborhood hill or playground.' Yet by early afternoon, the sled riding was unimpeded by Capitol police officers, who maintained their usual posts around the building. 'I'm hoping that common sense and a kind heart are ringing through,' said another sled rider, meeting planner Jason Petty, in explaining why the authorities had let things slide.","Senators debated the Arctic as around 100 families sledded outside .

"Entertainers, actors and priests are now claimed to be part of a VIP child abuse ring that Scotland Yard stands accused of covering up. The paedophiles were initially said to include MPs, senior police officers, and judges, but now investigators have revealed the net has been widened further. Over 30 years, officers from Scotland Yard are said to have also protected entertainers, actor, and priest by shutting down inquiries. The police watchdog has now added a further three alleged paedophilia cover-ups by the Metropolitan Police to the investigation, bring the total to 17 . Probe: Police allegedly stopped investing a child sex ring based in Dolphin Square in Westmister, pictured . The police watchdog has now added a further three alleged paedophilia cover-ups by the Metropolitan Police to the investigation, bring the total to 17. In a statement the IPCC said the police investigation had 'gathered evidence against MPs, judges, media entertainers, police, actors, clergy and others'. Criminal proceedings were being prepared, but two months later an officer was called in by a senior Metropolitan Police officer and told to drop the case, it is alleged. The IPCC is also looking into an allegation about police actions during a child abuse investigation in the 1980s, and another complaint about the same investigation - although no details of this have been given. Allegations: Sarah Green of the IPCC will oversee the investigation into the corruption claims . The watchdog said all the allegations relate to 'suppressing evidence, hindering or halting investigations' and the 'covering up the offences because of the involvement of members of parliament and police officers'. When the probe was announced earlier this month, commentators said It could be the biggest investigation into police corruption since the 1970s. The Metropolitan Police force is leading the investigation into the alleged corrupt actions of its officers but the IPCC says it is closely monitoring their probe. The IPCC had last week announced that it is investigating 14 allegations. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is also assessing a further six referrals it has received from the force as part of the case. When the investigation was launched The IPCC Deputy Chair Sarah Green said: 'These allegations are of historic, high level corruption of the most serious nature. 'We will oversee the investigations and ensure that they meet the terms of reference that we will set. 'Allegations of this nature are of grave concern and I would like to reassure people of our absolute commitment to ensuring that the investigations are thorough and robust.' The complex web of allegations was uncovered by detectives probing claims of historical sex abuse first raised by Labour MP Tom Watson in October 2012. The claims include that police deliberately stalled their inquiries into the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south-west London, leaving dozens of boys to be abused. Officers are also accused of releasing paedophile MP Cyril Smith without charge after he was caught in an undercover operation at a sex party involving teenage boys . Former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, pictured left, has been alleged to be involved in an establishment cover-up, as has William Whitelaw, pictured right, also a former Home Secretary . Officers are also accused of releasing paedophile MP Cyril Smith without charge after he was caught in an undercover operation at a sex party involving teenage boys. It has also been claimed officers failed to end sex parties at the now notorious Dolphin Square complex, in Pimlico, central London, following the intervention of ‘prominent people’. Tory home secretary, William Whitelaw, who is accused of demanding that police drop an inquiry into a paedophile ring, is also under the spotlight.  As is former Home Secretary Leon Brittan.

"The mother of two Detroit children whose bodies were found in a deep freezer in their home was charged with child abuse Wednesday and could face more serious charges once investigators determine how the boy and girl died. Mitchelle Blair, 35, was arrested Tuesday after court officers serving an eviction notice at her home opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter Stoni Ann Blair and her son Stephen Gage Berry. The county medical examiner was hoping to conduct autopsies on the children's bodies Wednesday but had to wait until they had fully thawed. The police, meanwhile, weren't saying much about their investigation into the circumstances surrounding the children's deaths and the conditions in the home near downtown Detroit, where Blair's other two children had also been living. 'While we all understand the desire to know what happened in that home is strong, I will ask you to be mindful of the two children who were also in that home and are still living,' Detroit Police Chief James Craig told reporters Wednesday. 'They've been through a lot, a tremendous trauma.' Scroll down for video . Mother: 35-year-old Mitchelle Blair, who two children were found dead in a deep freezer in their home, was charged with child abuse Wednesday . Daughter: Blair's daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, is seen with her father Alexander Dorsey. Stoni would have been 15 now, if alive . Court officers serving an eviction notice at Blair's home opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter Stoni Ann Blair and her son Stephen Gage Berry . Prosecutors believe that when they died, Stoni was 13 years old and Stephen was 9. Stoni would have been 15 now, if alive, and Stephen would have been 11. Police are seen Tuesday . A woman walks past notes left on the door at at the family's home on Wednesday . The two surviving children, a 17-year-old girl and 8-year-old boy, were placed in protective custody on Tuesday. Blair is charged with five counts of first-degree child abuse, one of which could land her in prison for life, said Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County prosecutor's office. She may face further charges after the autopsies are completed. Prosecutors believe that when they died, Stoni was 13 years old and Stephen was 9. Stoni would have been 15 now, if alive, and Stephen would have been 11. Neighbors said they hadn't seen the dead children in about a year. None of the four children was enrolled in Detroit schools, and friends said their mother was home-schooling them. Under state law, Michigan parents have the right to homeschool their children. Educating them, assigning homework and testing are the parent's responsibility. Registering the home school to the state Education office is voluntary, unless the student is special needs and special education services have been requested from the local school district. The state was not notified that Blair's children were being homeschooled this year, said Education Department spokesman Bill Disessa. Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years. She was unemployed and having money troubles, and she had gotten behind on her rent. Neighbors said they knew about the impending eviction. Court records show a judgment filed last month against her for $2,206 owed to the complex. Despite her money and other problems, friends call her a good mother. Blair is known throughout the complex of low-income townhomes as 'Angel' - a play on her middle name, Angela, that she got because she is so well-liked, said neighbors Carrie McDonald and Shay Wilson. 'The mother is a beautiful person. She was just going through some things,' McDonald said. 'She has a good heart.' But neighbors rarely saw the four children outdoors. Some say they hadn't seen Stoni and Stephen for about a year. 'She really don't let them outside,' said Wilson. 'They are always in the house.' In announcing the charges against Blair, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said 'the alleged facts in this case present examples of why we must all be diligent and involved citizens.' Blair allegedly confessed to the murder of her two children, according to a police source . It has been claimed that Blair allegedly confessed to strangling her son in May 2012, according to WXYZ, who are quoting a police source. She is also said to have admitted torturing her daughter to death just nine months later,  the news channel reported. Police were called in by the bailiffs after they discovered the girl's body in the chest freezer next to the front door. Her sibling's corpse was found later. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the mother was taken into custody after an apartment resident informed officers she was staying with someone at a different home inside the complex, according to the Detroit News. Craig said the mother was handcuffed when she was taken into custody. Blair describes herself as 'Loyal to my babies' on her Facebook page. Blair posted a photo with a message in January . On January 30, the posted a photo with a message. It read: 'There is no greater blessing than being called MOM.' Before she was taken into custody, the mother reportedly said her son was raped and that the sexual assault had been carried out by his siblings. Police have not confirmed that is the case and it is unclear if she was talking about the boy who was found in the freezer. She filed a paternity suit in 1999 which resulted in a man being ordered to pay child support. Blair filed another suit in 2007 against another man which had the same result. Her brother Marlon Blair told the Detroit News earlier this week: 'It's too early to even say what this could be, or to make any judgments. 'She didn't have any emotional problems from what I'm aware of. I don't know what to say about this.' Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt told the Detroit News earlier this week it appeared the bodies had been in the freezer for 'over a year' and that the mother had been living in the apartment 'with other children while the bodies were in the freezer'. 'This is a terrible situation,' he said. No weapons were discovered after the apartment was searched and police do not yet have a motive. Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, told the Detroit News Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'. There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official. People did notice that two of her children seemed to disappear about a year ago. Lanier told the newspaper: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house. 'Or sometimes she'd tell people they stayed inside because they didn't like to be around people.' Craig said the Detroit News that police were still 'trying to determine what happened'. The cause of death won't be known until after autopsies are conducted. Tori Childs, who also lives in the complex, told the Detroit News she often saw the children and sometimes gave them clothes or food. She said they were 'the nicest kids' who were 'so respectable'. 'This is just wrong,' she said in tears. Childs said she saw two bodies on the floor after police arrived at the home. 'It was a little girl and a little boy,' she said. 'The little girl had on a pink jacket.' Toni Williams, 28, left, and Natasha Bell, 30, leave balloons at the house on Wednesday . A neighbor, Tori Childs (center), was led away from the scene as law enforcement investigated on Tuesday . The two surviving children, a 17-year-old girl and 8-year-old boy, were placed in protective custody on Tuesday . Lanier told the Detroit News said her sister received a phone call around 6am on Tuesday from a woman who lives inside the apartment. The woman asked to stay at Lanier's sister's home with her two children that day, according to Lanier, and was there when the bodies were found. Police initially reported that they had a discovered a single body in the freezer.","Mitchelle Blair, 35, was arrested Tuesday .

"One mother has learned that the kindness of strangers can be boundless after her seriously ill daughter lost her 'bravery bracelet'. Madelyn McKinnon, from Brisbane, has undergone countless surgeries, procedures and treatments in her two short years, and to help her along the way her family bought her a silver bracelet from Pandora. Each charm on the piece of jewellery represented an obstacle she had overcome, or a milestone she surpassed, and so held special meaning for the McKinnon family and Madelyn's mother Melissa. 'It’s basically Maddy's life on a bracelet, she’s been through a lot in her time,' Melissa McKinnon told Daily Mail Australia. Madelyn McKinnon, who is almost two, lost her 'bravery bracelet' (pictured on her arm) last week at hospital . Maddy's mum Melissa McKinnon was devastated when the special bangle - a representation of her daughter's life, went missing . Thanks to the kindness of strangers who donated money and Pandora who donated an entirely new bracelet Maddy's again has a special bangle . But on Wednesday just after Madelyn, who is two this week, had been admitted to the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane for more treatment, somewhere between the cafeteria and her room the bangle went missing. When a head-to-toe search and retracing of footsteps turned up nothing, Ms McKinnon took to Facebook to ask for help recovering the symbolic bracelet. 'Yes, the bracelet is very pretty and is quite expensive for a 23-month-old but if only you knew what she had to endure for those charms,' the young girl's mother wrote. 'She has been on life support, had countless surgeries, MRI's, Lumbar punctures, EEG's, blood tests, infusions, transfusions to just name a few. Our daughter is a very sick child and has been since she was 5 weeks old and her Pandora bracelet is to recognise her bravery.' Ms McKinnon also said she had checked with hospital security, volunteers and staff and reported the matter to the police but had not managed to recover the bangle. She said the overwhelming feeling when she first realised the bracelet was missing was 'grief'. This replacement bracelet was gifted to Maddy just days ago, and now holds even more meaning for the McKinnon family . Strangers and friends raised over $1100 for young Madelyn in just hours . The young girl, who is almost two, has been sick since she was just weeks old and now the money raised for her bracelet will go towards a new wheelchair . 'It was very emotional for us and we were just absolutely gutted … it's something that means so much and has sentimental value behind it,' Ms McKinnon said. Madelyn has been very ill since she was just weeks old, when she suffered a series of life-threatening infections which left her with brain damage. At the end of August, she was diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, which means Ms McKinnon and her partner Marcus are at the hospital monthly, while caring for the six other children in their blended family. Friends and strangers alike were touched by Maddy's story and soon Ms McKinnon was flooded with messages and donations from people wanting to help, through a Facebook page called Brisbane Lost And Found. 'I put a post on that (page) and literally within minutes we had people commenting on there wanting to replace a charm. 'The response we had was just so overwhelming and I was left just speechless,' Ms McKinnon revealed. Friends and strangers alike were touched by Maddy's story this week and soon Ms McKinnon was flooded with messages and donations from people wanting to help . 'The response we had was just so overwhelming and I was left just speechless,' Madelyn's mother Melissa McKinnon revealed . Maddy's ongoing treatment is very expensive and she has six other siblings in her 'blended' family . People offered to replace the charms or bracelet for Madelyn, and soon more than $1000 had been raised. But Ms McKinnon was shocked again when the Pandora store visited by a kind stranger intending to replace the bangle with donations offered to give Madelyn a brand new piece of jewellery and all the charms she lost free of charge. 'There was one lady by the name of Natalie and she ended up coordinating the whole thing for us,' Ms McKinnon said, describing the stranger as a 'beautiful lady'. Before Natalie went to Pandora Mt Ommaney to pick out the new bracelet, another woman in the group had emailed the company's head office directly, explaining Maddy's situation. The store then offered to donate a replacement bracelet, as did two other stores in the area. 'Everybody just pulled in, and then we ended up having three Pandora stores wanting to donate,' Ms McKinnon said. The Brisbane girl has been sick since she was just weeks old, pictured her on life support . 'It just restores your faith in humanity,' Ms McKinnon said . 'We never expected it to end up like this... To have this response makes you so proud to be Australian. 'It just restores your faith in humanity,' she added. The ongoing cost of Madelyn's ongoing treatment is very expensive, and now the McKinnon's have a little extra to help them out after so much was raised for the bracelet. 'The money that was originally raised to go towards charms.. is now being raised to pay for the remaining amount for her wheelchair,' Ms McKinnon said. 'To have the response that we did was just so heartwarming and so generous and kind . 'These are complete strangers, now we feel like she’s sharing her journey,' Ms McKinnon said. 'Now that bracelet has an entire new meaning… she now got a bracelet that shows Australia is with her.'

"All cigarettes in Britain will be sold in plain packets bearing gruesome health warnings under a landmark new law backed by MPs today. The legislation, which will come into force from May next year, easily cleared the Commons by 367 votes to 113. It follows the example of Australia, which became the first country in the world to introduce the public health law two years ago to deter a new generation of young smokers. Britain is to become the second country in the world to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes . Powers to introduce standardised packaging were in passed the Children and Families Act 2014, but MPs must vote on bringing them into force. More than 100 mostly-Tory MPs opposed the move in a free vote this afternoon, but it passed into law with the support of Labour and the Lib Dems. Critics said the idea will not prevent people smoking, could confuse consumers and fuel illegal imports. But public health minister Jane Ellison insisted the plan would bring the country 'one step closer to our first smoke-free generation'. She said she recognised concerns that standardised packaging for cigarettes could be a 'slippery slope' towards a similar approach to other products such as junk food and alcohol. But she told MPs: 'The Government has no intention to extend standardised packaging to any other product than tobacco. 'Tobacco is a uniquely harmful consumer good and as such it's been treated uniquely in regulatory terms for many years.' Ahead of the vote Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity ASH, said she was confident that MPs will vote for the standardised packaging 'by a large majority'. 'There is strong support amongst parliamentarians from right across the political spectrum for this important public health measure to protect children and save lives,' she added. Public health minister Jane Ellison insists the plan would bring the country 'one step closer to our first smoke-free generation' Cancer Research UK's Alison Cox said: 'The public health community has been united in calling for the introduction of plain, standardised packaging of tobacco products across the UK. 'The growing weight of peer-reviewed evidence that standard packs reduce the appeal of smoking to children has crushed the tobacco company counter claims.' Dr Jenny Hatchard, from University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group, said: 'Tobacco companies have undertaken an unremitting three year opposition campaign, in which they hid behind third parties as they tried to dissuade politicians from acting in the interests of children's health. 'The vote indicates that the strong evidence that this measure is likely to reduce the appeal of smoking and bring health benefits for young people for generations to come has finally won out.' However, pro-smoking groups said the public did not support the plan. Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest which runs the Hands Off Our Packs campaign, said voters did not see it as a priority. 'The public wants parliament to prioritise tackling immigration and terrorism, not plain packaging of cigarettes. 'Plain packaging legislation is an ill-judged sideshow and a distraction from the real challenges the government faces before the end of this parliament.' In December 2012, Australia became the first country in the world to insist all tobacco products are sold in standardised packs. Cigarettes there have to be in a drab olive-coloured packaging, and the brand name is in a uniform typeface. The packets are also adorned with graphic images of the effects of lung cancer. In May 2013 it emerged that the UK government had dropped plans to follow suit, to focus on economic growth, tackling immigration and reforming welfare. But pressure from health campaigners mounted, and in January this year ministers confirmed the law would go ahead.","MPs back new law on plain packaging which comes into effect next May .

"The key to a happy home is regular meals together, more than one tablet computer and a Netflix account, a new study has revealed. Research into the  lives of 2,000 British families found that traditional values such as regular heart-to-hearts, hugs and knowing when to say sorry were still important factors for domestic bliss. But the study also revealed that modern families believed that having modern technology and gadgets such as a Netflix account, fast wi-fi and Sky TV were also key to harmonious home life. A new study has found that one of the keys to domestic bliss is having more than one tablet computer per household (picture posed by models) Monthly trips to the cinema, a good coffee machine for mum and dad and at least three televisions were also deemed necessities for happiness. The research, commissioned by British manufacturer Origin, found the highest rated tips for domestic bliss included eating together regularly, laughing a lot and keeping the home tidy. Despite the importance of eating together proving the most popular source for a happy family, a third said they rarely find time to do this. A quarter of families also felt they haven't got a good work/life balance with the average family getting less than 12 hours a week together. Andrew Halsall, Managing Director at Origin, said: 'The list of things that people attribute to happiness at home is an interesting mix of traditional processes, efforts to create a warm environment blended with the presence of technology and modern comforts. The whole family regularly eating together topped the list of things that helped create a harmonious family life . 'It's nice to see that eating together is still seen as the biggest sign of family bonding and a significant part of what people say makes a happy home. 'Modern life can be so hectic that families can struggle to get time together or ensure they appreciate their home life fully. People and their lifestyles change over time and homes need to be able to change with them. 'Whether it's through physical changes like extending or developing the property, or through making a conscious effort to do things together more, building that home environment clearly leads to happiness. After all, an Englishman's home is his castle.' The study also revealed that keeping the place tidy, cooking with the children and having in-jokes makes all the difference in fuelling a great home environment. Unsurprisingly, a dishwasher helped to avoid arguments about who is going to do the washing up, while a Netflix account was seen as an important factor in keeping the peace . Despite items such as fast wi-fi, Sky TV and everyone having their own smartphone or tablet, old fashioned bonding such as hugs and eating together were in the top five ways to keep a happy home . While a lock on the bathroom door, movie nights and well-lit rooms were also important factors to a house being free of doom and gloom. A good stack of board games, a comfortable sofa everyone can pile on and picking up clothes from the floor also goes a long way. Narrowly missing out on the top 50 elements for family happiness was the ability to share the remote control, having blinds to keep out nosy neighbours and a set of bi-fold doors opening out to the garden also help. More than two thirds of the families studied also felt that they were in definite need of more space at home. But children had other ideas when it came to essentials for a happy home with a tree house the most wished-for item, followed by a swimming pool in the garden and a bigger playroom. Andrew Halsall added: 'Space plays such a big part in creating a happy home environment.'Lack of adequate space for a household has also been shown to have significant impact on health, educational attainment and family relationships.' 1.

"Controversial radio presenter John Laws has revealed he was abused by a paedophile in a public toilet when he was a child. Laws, who recently came under fire for his tough on-air interview with a sex abuse victim, reducing the caller to tears, has admitted he was attacked in a public toilet in Sydney when he was 10 or 11 years old. 'I was a child. It was in a public lavatory at Mosman Oval. I didn’t know the person. I was disturbed. I took off. I ran,' he told The Australian. 'I made it very clear that I didn’t appreciate it. I would have shouted and yelled.' Scroll down for video . Radio broadcaster John Laws has defended his 10-minute on-air phone conversation with a listener named Brian . The revelation came just over a week after he reduced an elderly man, known only as Brian, to tears when the caller told the broadcaster he was abused as a child in the 1940s. Laws criticised Brian for not  fighting the attacker off and called him a 'wet blanket'. But the radio veteran has defended his comments and said he did not think he had treated Brian insensitively. The interview earlier this month stirred an outrage among listeners, with some calling for his resignation over the comments. But Laws rebuked claims he had no sympathy for those who had been abused and said his reaction to Brian's story stemmed from how he had handled his own experience. Brian called Laws during his morning radio show on 2SM earlier this month and told him about his sexual abuse . He said his attacker was someone he did not know and he was left disturbed by the abuse, adding he would have made it 'very clear' he did not appreciate it by shouting and yelling. The broadcaster said his advice to Brian would have been how he would have reacted in the same situation, describing it as 'tough love'. When contacted by Daily Mail Australia, Laws did not wish to comment further on the matter. The shock jock called the elderly man a 'wet blanket' and suggested he should 'go to the pub and have a lemonade' In a 10-minute call, Brian told Laws about how he had been sexually abused on several occasions from the age of 11 to 14 live on Sydney radio station 2SM. Laws quipped and chuckled it 'took a little while for you to get around to talk about it'. Brian then told Laws he had in fact reported two instances to the police but he was told to 'go away and forget about it. No one would do anything about it'. It was at this stage, Laws added insult to injury as he told Brian that he should have fought the man off, as he himself had done when men had 'had a go' at him when he was younger. 'Did you scream in fright? Did you yell out 'stop that you bastard'? Did you lash out with your fists? Did you hit him?' Laws asked. The call outraged people on social media who called for the radio presenter's sacking after the call . A meek sounding Brian responded 'no, no probably not.' 'I don't quite understand why you didn't lash out, you would have been a fairly big boy by that time. Didn't you kick or yell or scream or hit?' Laws continued to press the issue and said he should have told his family or his boss, who it turns out was responsible for several of the assaults. Brian began to become audibly distressed at this stage when he explained he had no family support. 'No... there was no such thing as ... family love,' Brian said. He explained that his abuse was a contributing factor to why he had no girlfriend, no romantic interests and very little human contact. Laws then tried to salvage the conversation saying he should have felt better after speaking to him and getting it off his chest. Brian responded he was 'sad more than anything'. Laws then shockingly claimed the interview was a waste of 'both of their time.' Former Hey Dad star Sarah Monahan wants Brian to know that he is not alone and people do care . Brian continued to open up about his years spent in isolation after the attacks, trying to minimise human contact when Laws thought it prudent to offer Brian some more sound advice. 'Have you ever stopped and asked yourself, why don't people like me? But this is not the first time, laws has been met with controversy. In 2013, he referred to women who dressed provocatively as 'rape bait' 'You're not the happiest soul, I don't know that you'd make people who are around you feel all that good. Have you tried to brighten up a little? Difficult I know. 'Do you hear me? But you're not taking any notice. 'You've got to be responsible for your own activity. You must make the move, go and talk to somebody about it. 'But don't be down all the time, don't be a wet blanket all the time. Try and have a laugh. 'Go to the pub and have a lemonade for God's sake. He was met with silence. 'No? Well there's not a lot more I can do, is there?' To wrap up the uncomfortable ten minute conversation Laws asked Brian to thank him for his time. 'Brian, could you say thank you?' The interview draws shocking parallels to a conversation Laws had with a female caller in 2013 who had also experienced sexual abuse. Laws blamed the victim and claimed that women who dressed provocatively were 'rape bait'. Twitter has erupted in support for Brian as listeners call for the so-called radio magnate to be sacked. Sarah Monahan, the former co-star of Hey Dad! who was among actor Robert Hughes’ child sex abuse victims, chimed into show support for Brian and said she hopes he can see that there are people out there who do care. She added Laws needs 'genuine help' after listening to the insensitive call.","Radio broadcaster John Laws has revealed he was abused in a public toilet .

"A Michigan couple has completed a quest to visit all 3,108 counties in the lower 48 states after driving around the country in a green 1999 Dodge Intrepid for almost nine years. Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl put the finish touch on their journey this week when they boarded a ferry to Nantucket in their car, which has accumulated almost 540,000 miles. They can now navigate small towns and state highway systems without any help after they accumulated knowledge about how the country is set up, the couple told Daily Mail Online. Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl, 32 and 31, completed their journey to the lower 48 states' 3,108 counties when they arrived in Nantucket, their last county, with their green 1999 Dodge Intrepid . They have preferred sticking to physical maps since their journey began in 2006, though the Riehls bought a GPS device in 2012 to help out in the remote corners of the US where the streets aren't labelled. Jennifer Riehl, 32, a research scientist at Michigan Technological University, and her husband, 31, an engineering instructor at the institution, typically drove about 50,000 miles a year. Jonathan, who does the majority of the driving while his wife navigates, hangs a map of their travels in his office and says that colleagues are 'genuinely baffled' by the accomplishment. Mr Riehl bought the car as a high school senior living in New Jersey for $9,000. At the time, 2002, it had 70,000 miles. The couple met in 2005 and have had their share of adventures since, including meeting a bear and running into nasty weather, according to The Cape Cod Times. The car and both of its primary passengers have been to all 3,108 counties, and the vehicle is still using the same engine it had when it was bought despite many 16-hour days on the road. They think a 15,000-mile trip from New Jersey to Alaska to their home on Michigan's Upper Peninsula over 38 days in the summer of 2012 may have broken a record for the long distance speed in a car. First counties visited by the couple, which met in upstate New York, include many Northeastern destinations where they visited friends. Jonathan, who works with geographical information science computer programs, saw that they had visited a fair number of counties together and during childhood road trips. A move to Nashville, Tennessee, for two years, sparked the idea that they could actually hit all the counties. The contiguous 48 states have 3,108 counties, and the addition of Alaska and Hawaii brings the total to 3,143 . The couple reached their final county in the lower 48 states on Tuesday during their spring break trip. Above, pictured in Plymouth, Mass on Wednesday. The couple has already visited some boroughs of Alaska, but plans on finishing the state and starting on Hawaii. Jennifer's mother lives in Texas, but the travelers don't take the direct interstate route when they go to visit. They have spent days going to the southern state by route of California or Idaho, most recently picking up five counties they had missed in the Gem State during previous journeys. Their parents accompanied them on the final ferry leg into Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Tuesday. With academic schedules, the pair has gone to most of the thousands of counties during breaks from school, including winter holidays where they truck through snow. Jonathan proposed to Jennifer on a 2011 trip to Manitoba, Canada, where they have added roughly half of the provinces to their total in addition to three Mexican states. However, their first hours as an engaged couple were spent driving south to Winnepeg in blinding snow with Jennifer keeping track of the road's white line out of the car window and her fiance drove. The couple often taken the long route to friends' and relatives' houses, going from Michigan to Texas via California or Idaho. The car, which Jonathan bought in 2002, still has the same engine . The couple avoids the interstate and uses small and dirt roads when possible. Above, Jennifer stands in Golden Valley County, Montana, in 2012 . Oscar Voss of the nonprofit national Extra Miler Club, a travel group where the Riehls are members, says that the couple is likely the first to ever visit every county in the same car. The club lists 38 people who have 'bagged' all 3,143 counties in the entire US, the first being Ed Dietz and Arthur Palmer in 1976. Most of the people who have been to all the counties are over 60, according to the club's Valerie Naylor. The Riehls said that all members of the club go around the country with different goals, such as visiting national parks or climbing to the highest points. Jonathan and Jennifer like to visit the county seat of each county if they can. Jonathan is particularly interested in architecture and Jennifer likes to hike all over the country. As a pair they have also visited motels in each of the 48 states but Delaware and roughly 550 brewpubs during their travels, hearing stories from a variety of locals. Jonathan, who is doing his doctoral research on urban sprawl, said that all of the best places are away from major highways. Jennifer said that the trips 'give me a perspective about what places and life are like that you just don't get from the interstate.' The pair began their journeys with trips around the Northeast. Above, the travelers stand in a New Jersey wood by Jonathan's uncle's house . Jonathan and Jennifer say they can navigate small towns just because they know how they are set up. Above, Paul Bunyan and his ox Blue in Bemidji, Minnesota, near the Mississippi River's headwaters . The university employees don't go out looking for particular adventures, and just try to enjoy meeting people along the way. After failing to drive through Baxter State Park in Maine because of heavy snow, the couple reattempted to make their way through the forest again in June 2006 only to find that a bridge was completely out. The Riehls were surprised when construction crews near the site were able to build a structure just for them so they could cross the river. In Ohio they found a man going cross-country alongside a road where he was walking his dog and rolling a globe. They don't play children's car games and occasionally listen to XM radio, but spend most of their time in the car catching up on each other's lives. 'I guess we must still like each other, or else we would have gone insane by now,' Mrs Riehl said. The travelers will end their spring break trip by driving to New Jersey before heading back to Michigan and working next week. The couple. who both work at Michigan Technological University, have been going to different counties together since 2006 and drive about 50,000 miles a year .","Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl, 32 and 31, hit last county in Nantucket, MA .

"Britain's Big Six energy firms are set to make £118 per household despite falling wholesale gas and electricity prices . The average profit that energy firms are making from customers has surged to an all-time high of £118 a household. This is up by a third on last year and well over double the £49 the companies were making two years ago. The rise is a direct result of firms failing to pass on a sharp fall in the wholesale price they pay for gas and electricity. The industry regulator Ofgem estimates that the average wholesale cost of gas and electricity is down from £633 per household a year ago to £553 – an £80 drop. But its figures for household dual-fuel bills show a lower fall of £60, taking them to an average of £1,295 a year – of which nearly 10 per cent is profit. The Big Six firms – British Gas, SSE, Npower, E.on, EDF and Scottish Power – have been able to cash in by keeping their tariffs high during winter. They have announced small reductions of around 5 per cent or less, but this will make little difference to household bills. The apparent profiteering comes despite the fact that last year was one of the warmest on record and total household consumption of gas and electricity was down by 14 per cent on 2013. It will add to demands for a shake-up amid claims that suppliers are failing to compete on price and customer service. The Competition and Markets Authority is asking suppliers to explain why lower wholesale costs have not been passed on and Which? wants a new regime for setting energy prices. The consumer group suggests regulators should set a fair ‘price to beat’ based on an assessment of costs, and firms would compete to match or undercut it. A charting showing the decreasing wholesale energy costs and the increasing pre-tax margin for the energy giants . Richard Lloyd, of Which?, said: ‘Consumers will be questioning why their bills haven’t been slashed further at a time of rising profits and falling wholesale prices. Energy bills are consistently the top consumer concern, so we need the CMA to get to the bottom of whether the price people pay is right. We also need to see simple pricing, and a price to beat that people can trust.’ Citizens Advice said: ‘Low wholesale costs are allowing energy companies to increase profits while barely cutting energy prices.’ Energy companies reject the way Ofgem estimates profits. Lawrence Slade, of the trade body Energy UK, said: ‘Ofgem risks misleading customers by publishing these inaccurate figures every month.’ The firms have suggested part of the blame for high bills should fall on Ed Miliband and his vow to impose a price freeze if Labour wins the election. Executives suggest they are unwilling to cut prices because they are afraid of being locked into low tariffs that would put their profits at risk. Wholesale gas and electricity costs are expected to be £80 less than they were estimated at a year ago .","Wholesale gas and electricity prices are expected to fall over the next year .

"Drug Enforcement Administration employees have a history of colorful arm patches, and some of the creations seem more likely to be found in a smoke shop than on the uniform of a federal agent. Federal agencies began using arm patches to identify themselves during cross-agency work in the 1970s, though the little bits of flair eventually spawned an entire catalog of agents' gear not officially sanctioned by the DEA. Raymond Sherrard, a retired special agent from the IRS, wrote The Encyclopedia of Federal Law Enforcement Patches to keep track of all the creative images. There are an estimated 20,000 federal patches in existence today, according to the Washington Post. But the field of crime where DEA agents worked, drugs, spawned some of the most interesting, including scores of swatches with dragons, grim reapers, a scorpion wearing a surveillance headset and slogans such as 'you make it, we'll take it.' The patches bear a striking resemblance to armed forces patches, and Larry Kirk, a police chief in Old Monroe, Missouri, said they were a 'reflection of these units taking on paramilitary ideas.' Former agents say that the DEA's culture has changed since the 1990s, and has become much more politically correct since the days when the patches were swapped around like business cards. Collector Nathan Zubke told Daily Mail Online that only ten copies of certain patches were originally made, as they were only for small groups of agents. He said reproductions are often sold on eBay, though collectors are on the look out for the real pieces of agency gear, which can fetch hundreds of dollars. Employees of the Drug Enforcement Administration made unofficial patches with bizarre designs such as skeletons in tuxedos . Grim reapers are a popularly featured image on some patches, believed to be among around 20,000 federal patches in existence . The DEA's patches became known for their particular style, which often incorporated pictures of drug paraphernalia such as syringes . The use of federal patches first began in the 1970s, when different agencies began working together on the same projects . The patches often included jokes about the substances that DEA agents were tasked with helping control . Patches from certain raids and missions were reportedly swapped around like business cards by employees . The patches were generally made by employees rather than the DEA itself, which did not sanction the gear . Different missions, such as the Unified Caribbean On-Line Regional Network, often sport different patches with relevant imagery . Former agents say that the DEA has become more politically correct after a change of culture in the 1990s . Some of the patches, such as those with skulls, bear a resemblance to armed forces patches, which police chief Larry Kirk attributed to 'paramilitary ideas' among agents .

"Ukip will form an electoral pact with Northern Irish MPs to keep the Tories in power after the next election, Nigel Farage said this morning. The Ukip leader said the Conservative Party will emerge from the general election as the largest party but wouldn't have enough MPs to govern on their own. Mr Farage said he would force an early referendum on Britain's membership of the EU as his price for keeping David Cameron in Number 10. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the Conservative Party will emerge from the general election as the largest party but wouldn't have enough MPs to govern on their own . The Ukip leader's intervention comes amid growing pressure on the Tories to rule out a power-sharing deal with Ukip after the election. Mr Cameron has repeatedly challenged Labour to reject a coalition with the SNP, but has side-stepped questions about whether the Conservatives would rely on Ukip to form a government. But Mr Farage said this morning said he would not have a choice. He said: 'At the end of the day, this is all about numbers, isn't it?' He added: 'I mean I still believe that the Conservatives will be the biggest party – not least of which is because Alex Salmond's party is doing so well in Scotland. 'I think between UKIP and possibly the DUP in Northern Ireland as well, there will be a body of MPs there to have significant influence and to force a referendum on our EU membership.' Mr Farage has previously insisted he would be willing to support a Tory minority government only if a referendum on Britain leaving the EU was held before the end of this year – two years earlier than David Cameron plans. Nigel Farage said Ukip would form an electoral pact with Northern Irish MPs to keep the Tories in power after the next election . The Tories have insisted that Mr Cameron needs two years to re-negotiate Britain's membership of the EU. But Mr Cameron said: 'Donald Tusk and Mr Juncker, the two bosses of the European Union, have made it perfectly clear there is no renegotiation. 'When it comes to the fundamental point of the free movement of people and immigration into the UK, which is the number one issue in British politics and I think between now and May 7 will start to dominate this General Election campaign, there is no renegotiation.' David Cameron may be forced to rely on Ukip and DUP MPs to stay as Prime Minister . Mr Tusk – the European Council president – last week claimed Mr Cameron's proposal for a new EU treaty was 'Mission Impossible'. But the Prime Minister, speaking in Brussels on Friday, said a Tory victory in the General Election would give him a 'very powerful mandate' to win sweeping reforms and insisted it was possible. He added: 'Tom Cruise normally prevails in the end. He's a little bit smaller than me, but I hope to be just as effective.' But Mr Cameron has refused to rule out a coalition with Ukip, telling MailOnline: 'I don't want to have a coalition with anybody. 'I'm fighting for a majority government, there are 93 days to go and I'm not going to speculate about any outcome other than victory.' Last week the Chancellor George Osborne demanded that Labour say it would not form a coalition with the SNP, who are expected to make big gains in Scotland. But he refused to make the same promise about a Tory-Ukip tie-up. Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Mr Osborne said: 'It's just total nonsense, voting for Nigel Farage makes Ed Miliband the likely Prime Minister and it means instead of getting the referendum on Europe we get no referendum at all, so that's what a vote for Ukip is about and it's a fundamentally different situation from the SNP, you were asking Ed Balls about it, he again refused to rule out a deal with the SNP. 'We are fighting for a majority, we only need 23 more seats to get that majority. 'Nigel Farage and indeed Ed Balls are trying to muddy the waters, it's a fundamentally different situation for this reason - Nigel Farage is not going to win seats in the House of Commons, even on his own boasts he's only going to win a small handful. 'The SNP are likely to win dozens of seats because of the collapse of the Labour party, Ed Miliband can't be Prime Minister without the support of Alex Salmond and that creates an alliance between those who want to bankrupt the country and those who want to break up the country.' Nigel Farage said Ukip MPs could join forces with DUP members, led by Nigel Dodds (left), in the Commons to keep David Cameron in Number 10 . Mr Farage has claimed that his party will win a 'handful' of seats at the election, which means the Tories would likely also need the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to maintain a minority government. Ukip would back the Tories' first budget if a referendum on Britain's EU membership was promised before the end of 2015. Up until now, the Prime Minister has vowed to hold a referendum by the end of 2017, and has said he will campaign to stay in a reformed EU. But the latest polls suggest neither the Conservatives or Labour will have enough seats to form a government, meaning Mr Cameron may have to find a compromise.","Ukip leader said the Tories will emerge from the election as largest party .

"Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK would send around 75 military trainers to train Syrian rebels . Britain is to provide military training to Syrian rebel groups fighting ISIS, the Government has announced on the final day of Parliament. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK would send around 75 military trainers and headquarters staff to provide instruction in the use of weapons, infantry tactics and medical skills. The training, which forms part of a US-led programme to support the moderate Syrian opposition, will take place in Turkey. Mr Fallon said ISIS could only be defeated by local forces on the ground in Syria and Iraq. He said: 'Britain remains at the forefront of coalition military efforts to support the Iraqi government in their fight against Isil. 'This effective and closely co-ordinated activity in conjunction with Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces has largely stalled the terrorists' advances. 'But Isil must be defeated in both Iraq and Syria. In Syria, coalition air strikes have supported the liberation of Kobane and have disrupted Isil's logistics and supply lines. 'However, defeating Isil ultimately lies with local forces and we are helping to create effective ground forces in Syria, as well as in Iraq, so they can take the fight to Isil.' The training programme, expected to start in the coming weeks, is intended to equip and train thousands of screened members of the opposition in Syria over the next three years. British military instructors have already been providing training to Kurdish peshmerga militias fighting ISIS in northern Iraq. Scroll down for video . Mr Fallon said two RAF Sentinel surveillance aircraft were also being deployed to the region to operate alongside Tornado strike jets and Reaper drones that have been carrying out air strikes against ISIS targets in Iraq. These will provide wide area surveillance over Iraq of IS activity and track improvised explosive device (IED) laying activity. The RAF planes will join the Tornados and Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft which have conducted 194 strikes over Iraq, starting on 23 March. British troops will be sent to Turkey to train moderate Syrian forces battling ISIS, such as those above holding a flag with 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' The UK continues to be the second largest contributor to the coalition airstrike campaign and is playing a leading role in the coalition's counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) training programme, the Ministry of Defence said. This is in addition to the infantry and Heavy Machine Gun skills training packages the MoD has already delivered to over 1,100 members of the Iraqi Forces. Mr Fallon added: 'Britain remains at the forefront of coalition military efforts to support the Iraqi government in their fight against Isil.' The number of asylum-seekers in the Western countries rose by nearly 50 per cent last year - driven by the devastating conflicts in Syria and Iraq, the UN has revealed. In 2014, some 866,000 people applied for asylum across Europe, North American and other wealthy countries - up 45 percent in just a year earlier. The surge is linked to the spiralling conflicts in the Middle East, which have created 'the worst humanitarian crisis of our era,'  the UN's Melissa Fleming told reporters. As a sign of the crisis, the number of asylum applications last year was the second highest on record, coming very close to the all-time-high of the about 900,000 requests made in 1992, at the beginning of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNHCR said. Syria's conflict, now in its fifth year, has killed more than 215,000 people and forced 11.4 million people to flee their homes, including nearly four million who have left the country. Last year, 150,000 Syrians applied for asylum in industrialised countries, marking a 166-percent hike from 2013 and accounting for a fifth of all asylum claims, the UNHCR report said. As the violence in Syria has spilled over into neighbouring Iraq with the ruthless Islamic State jihadist group, Iraqis too have been leaving in droves. Last year they accounted for 68,700 asylum applications to wealthy nations - almost double the number a year earlier - while Afghans made up the third largest group, with almost 60,000 applications.","Military trainers will provide instruction in the use of weapons and tactics .

"Adrian Lubecki (pictured) admitted supplying class A controlled drugs and possession with intent to supply a class B drug at Ipswich Crown Court . A teenager who supplied a dangerous batch of 'Superman' ecstasy pills linked to at least two deaths in the same town has been jailed for five years and four months. Factory worker Adrian Lubecki, 19, from Ipswich, admitted supplying class A controlled drugs and possession with intent to supply a class B drug. Justas Ropas, 23, was found dead at his home in Ipswich on Christmas Eve, and Gediminas Kulokas, 24, was found on New Year's Day at his home in the Suffolk town. Ipswich Crown Court heard Polish factory worker Lubecki sold the red Superman-branded pills over the Christmas period last year on the streets of Ipswich, Suffolk. He had supplied the drug to Lithuanian machine operator Mr Ropas, who died at home on Christmas Eve. The same Superman pills were linked to the death of Lithuanian labour Mr Kulokas who died on his 24th birthday on New Year's Day. But the court heard that the supplier of the drug to Mr Kulokas had not been identified and there was no evidence that it was Lubecki. Prosecutor Michael Crimp said: 'The prosecution can't say they came from the defendant.' The drug was also originally linked to the death of British labourer John Hocking, 20, who died on New Year's Day at a friend's home in Rendlesham, Suffolk. But Suffolk Police confirmed today that they no longer believed Mr Hocking had taken the rogue Ecstasy. The deaths prompted Suffolk Police to issue a warning over the Superman-branded pills, which contained the drug PMMA which is said to be five times as toxic as the usual Ecstasy ingredient MDMA. A court heard Lubecki sold the red Superman-branded pills (pictured) on the streets of Ipswich, Suffolk . But PMMA which has the full name Paramethoxymethamphetamine is slower acting than MDMA so some users are tempted to take higher doses. The court heard that a housemate of Mr Ropas had contacted Lubecki on December 23 and asked if he could supply some ecstasy tablets. He and Mr Ropas, who was diabetic, then went to meet up with Lubecki in Norwich Road, Ipswich. Mr Crimp said: 'Between them they purchased five ecstasy tablets for £5 each. They were triangular in shape, red and had a 'Superman' logo on them.' The men went back to their rented Victorian terraced house and Mr Ropas rook one and a half of the tablets. Mr Crimp said others in the house who had taken ecstasy before said the Superman tablets 'seemed different', describing their effect as being slow to start off with and then 'suddenly very strong'. Lithuanian factory worker Justas Ropas (pictured) was found dead on Christmas Eve at his house . He added: 'Tragically the effect on Justas Ropas was that by Christmas Eve he was discovered dead in the flat and the cause of his death was found to be PMMA toxicity.' The court heard how Lubecki was arrested and then confessed to police where he had hidden his remaining batch of the drug. Officers recovered a bag 461 of the PMMA tablets with the 'Superman' logo and 49 MDMA tablets with a snail logo. Mr Crimp added: 'They were carefully hidden and not thrown away.' The court heard how text messages suggested Lubecki had been supplying drugs to people in Ipswich from around last April. Judge John Devaux told him: 'I accept you didn't foresee that your drug dealing might lead to a death.' Roger Thomson, defending, said Lubecki was devastated by what had happened to Mr Ropas and it was something he would have to live with for the rest of his life. He said Lubecki had got involved in drug dealing to fund his own drug use, but after what happened to Mr Ropas he didn't want anything more to do with drugs. Mr Thomson said that Lubecki had told police where the remaining 'Superman' tablets were hidden to prevent a further tragedy. Police have warned drug users not to take the suspected rogue batch and to hand in supplies. Chief Superintendent Jon Brighton said: 'Lubecki's sentencing reflects the seriousness with which drug offences are taken. 'Our message is clear - the supply of dangerous drugs will not be tolerated and every effort will be taken to bring those responsible to justice. 'The tragic deaths of two men in Ipswich led to an extensive police operation, not only to locate anyone supplying the drugs but also to ensure that communities were aware of the dangers and risks associated with taking them. 'We will continue to work with our partners to combat drug dealing in Ipswich and to help those individuals who wish to stop their substance misuse. 'Cases like this show the stark dangers of taking drugs and the simple fact that any illegal drug can result in death. 'We would encourage anyone who takes drugs to seek help from one of the many support agencies available in Ipswich or Suffolk-wide.' Inquests are due to be held at a later date. Lubecki was sentenced to five years and four months in prison at Ipswich Crown Court.","Adrian Lubecki, 19, supplied dangerous batch of 'Superman' ecstasy pills .

"The taxman enjoys a ‘cosy’ relationship with the accountants who help multinationals avoid billions in tax, a damning report will claim today. A powerful committee of MPs claims weak law enforcement means tax avoidance – and evasion – remains ‘a risk worth taking’. The Public Accounts Committee said HM Revenue and Customs is failing to sufficiently tackle ‘widespread’ tax avoidance by US giants, including Starbucks, Google and Amazon. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said HMRC needs to come down hard on companies who use artificial overseas offices to avoid tax, and the firms that advise them . They must also do more to challenge the accountancy firms which help these multinationals to dodge their liabilities, the group will say. Major corporations have been accused of funnelling billions of pounds through tax havens such as Luxembourg and Ireland to reduce their bill. They are accused of exploiting a loophole which enables them to pay tax in the country where they are based, rather than where they sell their goods. By setting up ‘artificial’ offices in low-tax countries, they are able to pay a much lower annual levy on their profits. Today, the PAC will say that the taxman must do more to ‘challenge’ these tactics, saying: ‘HMRC needs to show that it comes down hard on tax cheats and change the perception that it is far too tolerant of those who break the law by hiding their income. ‘The current system still causes the odds to be stacked in favour of tax evaders using offshore accounts when the worst that will happen if they are caught is that they will pay the tax they owe and a fine.’ Amazon, Starbucks and Vodaphone have all previously been found to funnel profits through tax havens, despite earning that money in the UK . It added: ‘HMRC has not been sufficiently challenging of the manifestly artificial tax arrangements of multinationals.’ The report was critical of large UK accountancy firms, such as Pricewaterhouse Coopers, which it claimed advised many multinationals on how to pay less tax in the UK through the use of complex schemes. They accused HMRC of not doing enough to ‘challenge’ this tax advice and instead focusing on the multinationals themselves. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee and a Labour MP, said: ‘We remain concerned that HMRC’s relationship with these large accountancy firms is too cosy, and it needs to get much tougher in challenging the advice they give to their clients. ‘It is disappointing that HMRC has rejected our recommendation for a tougher code of conduct for tax advisers - a response which is out of kilter with its wider policy to clamp down on aggressive tax avoidance. ‘Furthermore, we do not believe there are enough prosecutions for tax evasion to act as an effective deterrent to those who break the law. As it stands, tax avoidance – and even evasion – can be a risk worth taking. ‘We are not persuaded that HMRC and the Crown Prosecution Service are doing enough to prosecute serious tax evasion cases.’ The report also found that part of the problem was Britain’s hopelessly complex tax system. They said the number of different tax breaks open to businesses and individuals had grown under the Coalition by almost 100 to 1,140. These many tax reliefs were open to abuse and difficult to keep track of. The report said: ‘For as long as the United Kingdom has such a complex tax code, opportunities for aggressive tax avoidance and evasion will continue to be exploited.’ The report named management firms, such as Pricewaterhouse Coopers, as being among those who advised their clients on how to reduce their tax bill . It added that ‘HMRC must urgently transform its currently unacceptable levels of customer service’. They claimed the taxman’s target to answer 80 per cent of calls within five minutes was ‘unambitious and inadequate’ and noted that HMRC expected its performance in 2014-15 to be ‘worse’ than the previous year. It comes as the Treasury revealed it was joining forces with five other tax authorities to examine how digital multinational companies shift their profits to tax havens. David Gauke told MPs the co-operation was part of the diverted profits tax project - or so-called ‘Google tax’ - announced in the Budget last week and aimed at clamping down on tax avoidance. From the start of next month, companies who artificially funnel profits offshore to avoid paying UK tax will face a 25 per cent levy on that money. Yesterday, Mr Gauke told MPs: ‘As part of this project I can confirm we are working with five other tax authorities to investigate and challenge how digital multinationals shift their profits to tax havens. ‘For the first time we are gathering a full global picture of the tax risks these companies pose. That is invaluable in helping us to take decisive action.’ A spokesman for HM Revenue and Customs said: ‘We are pleased that the committee recognises the progress that HMRC has made in clamping down on tax evasion and avoidance, by relentlessly pursuing those who seek to cheat the system. ‘We have shut down marketed avoidance schemes, closed loopholes, secured tough new enforcement powers, and opened up international information exchanges so rich evaders will have no safe havens where they can hide their money. ‘As a result of our compliance efforts and the £1billion extra investment over this Parliament, we have secured more than £100 billion in additional revenues in the past five years to pay for essential public services, raised penalties for tax evasion to 200 per cent of tax owed and increased prosecutions five-fold.’","Public Accounts Committee said HMRC is failing to tackle tax avoidance .

"Ex On The Beach star Jess Impiazzi has been signed up by bargain fashion brand In The Style to be the face of their new South Beach swimwear range. Brand bosses say they spotted Jess strutting her perfect bikini body on the MTV show and knew immediately she was the right girl for the job of pushing their latest swimwear pieces. The model, who is most famous for her fleeting TV appearance on the reality show, has recently been in the headlines for clashing with the rather more established swimwear star Kelly Brook, claiming that the actress called her a 'slut' for getting involved with her ex David McIntosh.

Brand bosses say they spotted Jess strutting her perfect bikini body on the MTV show and knew immediately she was the right girl for the job of pushing their latest swimwear pieces . Kelly and David famously called off their engagement last year, and in the months after Jess and David enjoyed a fleeting romance. It wasn't until Jess and Kelly were locked into a phone conversation, the beauty explained to The Sun On Sunday earlier this month, that the former Big Breakfast host allegedly expressed her frustrations. Jess recalled of their conversation: 'She went, ""Are you and David dating - are you together? What's going on?"" I said: ""Nothing really, we're just friends.'"" The 25-year-old, who claims she wasn't aware until then that Kelly and David were speaking again, added: 'I said, ""Kelly, there's no need to try and upset me. I'm not in love with the guy. There's no need to be horrible. I don't care."" The model is most famous for her fleeting TV appearance on the MTV reality show .

"Two men suspected of abducting and killing an elderly Ohio couple are facing charges including aggravated murder, kidnapping and robbery, according to an indictment released on Monday. Robert Clark, 29, and Jeffery Stewart, 21, are accused of killing 88-year-old Doyle Chumney and his 79-year-old wife Lillian after abducting them from their home in Tuscarawas in January. After their daughter found their house ransacked and reported the Chumneys as missing, their bodies were found a badly-burned car the next day. Scroll down for video . Robert Clark, 29, was indicted by a grand jury in Coshocton County, Ohio, on 15 counts including murder . Jeffery Stewart, 21, was also indicted for his suspected role in the slayings of Doyle and Lillian Chumney . Doyle, 88, and Lillian, 79, went missing from their home in Tuscarawas and their bodies were found a burned car . A Coshocton County grand jury indicted both of the men on 15 counts, including ten counts each of aggravated murder. Clark, who led authorities on a nationwide manhunt before being arrested on February 5 in Arizona, is facing the death penalty while Stewart is not, according to the Canton Times Reporter. His charges include death penalty specifications for using a gun which are not included in the charges against Stewart. If Stewart is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Surveillance video showed Clark (left) holding a sawed-off shotgun during an apparent gas station robbery . The Chumney's daughter found their house ransacked and alerted authorities the day before they were found . The jury felt the killings were premeditated and said Clark and Stewart caused the death of the Chumneys with 'prior calculation and design'. The other charges lodged against the men include aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, kidnapping and aggravated arson. Clark was also classified as a repeat violent offender because he was convicted of robbery in 2010. The men are being held separately in Tuscarawas County jail in New Philadelphia. They can plead guilty or not guilty when they appear in front of a judge, but an arraignment date has not been set. Clark is also suspected of being involved in the armed robberies of gas stations and convenience stores in West Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia.","Robert Clark, 29, and Jeffery Stewart, 21, accused of  dual killing in January .

"She was seen leading the cortege at his funeral earlier this year, and now the former fiancée of tycoon Scot Young appears to have returned to the public eye. Noelle Reno, 31, was spotted out and about for the first time since her tragic ex-partner was laid to rest in January, and appeared to be ready to rebuild her life. The reality TV star and fashion designed attended the UK premiere party for E!'s new show The Royals in London, with a smile on her face once more. Scroll down for video . Smiling again: Noelle Reno, 31, was spotted out and about for the first time since her ex Scot Young's funeral . The 31-year-old American looked stunning in metallic shorts and a white vest as she beamed at photographers at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park on Tuesday evening. Miss Reno, star of Bravo's Ladies of London, suffered a shocking loss when her ex-fiance was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Marylebone, central London, in the early evening of December 8 last year. Mr Young, a one-time fixer to the super rich, had been one of Britain's wealthiest men, with a series of multi-million pound properties in Surrey, Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Miami, and a collection of supercars and a private jet. But he then became embroiled in one of the most high profile and nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK, with ex-wife Michelle accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters.

Paying her respects: Noelle  attended her former partner's funeral in January this year . Mr Young claimed he had lost all his money in a mysterious Russian property deal but she demanded £300million, saying he was worth 'a few billion'. Mr Young, a friend of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, was last November ordered to give her a settlement of £20million and £6million in legal costs. He was also sent to prison for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth during the case. After his release, Mr Young became engaged to US fashion designer and TV presenter Miss Reno. But apparently drinking heavily and using cocaine, he spiralled out of control and she split up with him a few months ago. However it is understood he went to Miss Reno's apartment in Marylebone. When she arrived later that day, she found him inside apparently 'manic, crazy and probably high' and she demanded he leave, friends said. She allegedly walked out eventually and called the police to remove him, while he phoned her to threaten he was going to jump out of the window. By the time police arrived, he was dead, impaled on the metal railings outside. Miss Reno said she was 'distraught by the sudden loss of my best friend' and wanted to 'grieve in peace'. Mr Young had previously spoken of his battle with bipolar disorder, for which he was taking prescription medication.","Noelle Reno seen in public for the first time since funeral of her ex .

"At least Eight female students at Brigham Young University in Utah were 'catfished' by the same 24-year-old woman - who pretended to be a man. The victims all believed they were involved in a relationship with a Mormon man living in the same state - only to find out they were being duped by a  woman in Texas. After one of the students became suspicious, it began to emerge that they had all fallen for a serial 'catfish' - someone who tricks others online by setting up fake profiles with fake pictures and names.

Miss Hayes added: 'She just knew everything about me it was just really hurtful to find out that you literally didn’t know anything about this person, not even something so foundational as their name.'

"Tourists and New Yorkers have been slammed for taking selfies while visiting the scene of last week's devastating gas explosion in the East Village. The blast last Thursday set four buildings ablaze, killed two men and injured 25 people. But some people believed it was still appropriate to smile and pose for a social media picture as emergency crews surrounded the charred site. Scroll down for video . 'Disgusting': Christina Freundlich, who describes herself as a political communications professional, was condemned online for posting this picture at the site of the East Village fire on Friday . A group of young women were seen using a selfie stick in front of the flames. The photograph was posted to the Twitter account EventsPhotosNYC and drew a barrage of criticism. One commenter said: 'Everything that’s wrong with NYC summed up in one photo.'

"Cats can sometimes be a mystery, even to their owners. But our felines friends may not be as difficult to understand as you might think, with clues to their personality hidden in their features. This is according to a California-based cat behaviourist who has identified three different types of cat face shape that she says can accurately reveal personality. Scroll down for video . 'Cats with square faces are often keen to please their owners. 'Square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts,' said cat behaviourist, Arden Moore . 'Cat face geometry is one of the best tools for matching a cat to a person,' says Arden Moore, author of 'Fit Cat: Tips & Tricks to Give Your Pet a Longer, Healthier, Happier Life'. 'It especially helps with ""mutt"" cats whose breed cannot be determined.' While Moore's theory is not based on any scientific study, she says experience has revealed there is a strong link between looks and personality. This may be because different breeds of cats, with distinct behaviours, often have the same face shape. For instance, some cats, such as Main Coon, can have square faces and bodies. These cats are often keen to please their owners. 'Square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts,' said  Moore. Triangular cats have been referred to as 'the herding dogs of the cat world.' Triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy, curious, smart and vocal . Cats with round faces have flatter features, large eyes, circular heads and rounded bodies.  Arden Moore describes them as the 'lap dogs' of the feline world.'They tend to be low-energy, easily frightened, submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members,' she said . According to a report in the New York Post, the best type of owner for these cats is one that has a a social life, works a 9-to-5 job and has a family who will play with the pet. Cats with round faces. meanwhile, also have flatter features, large eyes, circular heads, and rounded bodies, such as a Persian cat. Moore describes them as the 'lap dogs' of the feline world, and 'library cats'. Square - 'The retrievers' These cats are often large with square faces and bodies. Maine Coon, the largest domesticated breed of cat, falls into this category. They have been described as the 'retrievers of the cat world.' Cats with square faces are often keen to please their owners. 'Square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts,' said cat behaviourist, Arden Moore. Ideal owner: Works a 9-to-5 job and has a family who will play with the pet. Round - 'The lapdogs' Cats with round faces also have flatter features, large eyes, circular heads, and rounded bodies. An example would be the Persian cat. Arden Moore describes them as the 'lap dogs' of the feline world. 'They tend to be low-energy, easily frightened, submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members,' she said. Ideal owner: A homebody who enjoys spending time with the cat in a quiet environment. Triangular - 'The herders' Cats with triangular faces include Siamese or Abyssinian cats. They are sleek and lanky cats, often boasting big ears and faces that narrow at the nose. They have been referred to as 'the herding dogs of the cat world.'  Triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy, curious, smart and vocal. Ideal owner: Someone who wants to show off their pet and teach it tricks, and who doesn't own, another submissive cat. 'They tend to be low-energy, easily frightened, submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members,' Moore told Petsbest.com. The ideal companion would be a homebody who enjoys spending time with the cat in a quiet environment. Cats with triangular faces include Siamese or Abyssinian cats.

Most would prefer to look out of a window and watch the scenery than snuggle on your lap. Moore says they are the perfect cats for people who want to teach their pets tricks. She adds that basing a cat's face shape on their personality is remains a theory and not based on scientific studies.

"Ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was 'on edge' and aggressive at a Boston nightclub two nights before prosecutors say he killed another football player, a witness told jurors at his murder trial on Thursday. Kasey Arma, who danced with the former New England Patriots tight end at Rumor nightclub early on June 15, 2013, said he initially seemed relaxed, but later appeared irritated, grabbing her and telling her to dance with him in another part of the club. 'He just seemed a lot more agitated, on edge,' she said. 'He was just very aggressive.' Testimony: Kasey Arma (pictured in court on Thursday) who danced with Hernandez at Rumor nightclub in Boston early on June 15, 2013 - two days before the alleged murder - said she thought he was agitated . 'On edge': She described how the former New England Patriots tight end initially seemed relaxed, but later appeared irritated, grabbing her and telling her to dance with him in another part of the club . Hernandez, 25, is on trial at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts, for fatally shooting Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating his fiancée's sister, early on June 17, 2013. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole. Prosecutors say Hernandez became upset with Lloyd at the club that night for associating with people he disliked. Lloyd had gone to the club with Hernandez and his barber, Roberto Olivares, according to prosecutors. An acquaintance of Lloyd's who was also at the club, Kwami Nicholas, testified earlier this week that Hernandez stared for several minutes at Lloyd and another man, and appeared angry before storming out of the club, with Lloyd running to catch up. Arma, who had seen Hernandez at the club several times before, said Hernandez initially tapped her on the hip to get her attention. She said she danced with Hernandez, who introduced himself as 'Rock,' for several minutes before he abruptly walked away. Distressing: Ursula Ward, mother of murder victim Odin Lloyd, puts her hand on her face as an image of her son's body is displayed on a monitor during the murder trial . Scene: Hernandez watches as an image of the ground near where victim Odin Lloyd's body was found is displayed on a monitor during . He later returned and 'grabbed me by my arm and pulled me out of the crowd and told me to go with him,' Arma said, adding they then danced in another part of the club. Also on Thursday, prosecutors showed surveillance video recorded at Hernandez's house in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, hours after Lloyd's death. It showed Hernandez and two alleged accomplices, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, in different parts of the house, at times playing with Hernandez's baby daughter and swimming in his pool. Prosecutors say Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz picked up Lloyd at Lloyd's Boston house early on June 17, 2013, and drove him to an industrial park near Hernandez's house where his bullet-riddled body was later found. Wallace and Ortiz have also been charged with murder and will be tried separately. All have pleaded not guilty.

"One in five gay teenagers in schools across Britain are being subjected to bullying by teachers or other adults, new research has shown. Another third of gay male pupils said they left school without being taught anything about HIV or safe sex, despite a spike in infections nationwide. A survey by the National Aids Trust (NAT), which quizzed more than 1,000 gay or bisexual men aged 14 to 19, also found that more than half had experienced some form of discrimination. More than half of gay teenagers said they had been bullied at school. While 99 per cent said they had been targeted by a classmate, 39 per cent said their tormentor was a teacher or adult (file image) Of those 99 per cent said they had been targeted by another pupil, while 75 per cent said they received online abuse, reports The Independent. However, another 39 per cent said the bullying had been at the hands of a teacher or another adult at their school. Deborah Gold, the chief executive of NAT, said: 'It's an incredibly high number. 'The idea that teachers or other adults at school are sometimes responsible for bullying and discrimination is utterly unacceptable.' The survey also showed a worrying lack of education among young men about the spread of HIV and safe sex, despite them being in the most at-risk group in the UK. Two thirds of those surveyed said they had not been given information about testing for the killer virus, while a third were given no information about the spread of HIV. Another three quarters were also unaware of the drug PEP, which can help prevent infection if it is given to a patient within three days of them being exposed to HIV. A third of teenage boys said they had been given no information on HIV or safe sex, while two thirds said they didn't know how to test for it, despite being in the most at-risk group (pictured, the HIV virus) Three quarters of pupils also said they had been given no information on same sex relationships during sex educations lessons. Ms Gold added: 'The number of young men who have sex with men who are contracting HIV is increasing. I think there's an absolute link between the lack of this education at a time when people need it and the consequences of that.' While education on HIV is required as part of the science curriculum, it is only recommended as part of social and health education classes, with campaigners calling its application 'patchy'. The most recent figures from Public Health England show that HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men are at an all-time high, and are continuing to rise. In 2012 there were 3,250 new diagnoses of HIV among this group, pushing the total to more than 40,000, of which around 7,300 were unaware they had the virus.","Survey found more than half of gay teens bullied for sexuality at school .

"The future of the humble bar of soap may in be hot water as more people are choosing to use liquid hand wash and hand sanitiser. Baths were also on the decline with more people opting for a quick shower over a long soak, according to a new report. Despite falling sales of the traditional bar of soap, people are actually washing more with over a third of adults are washing their hands more often than they were a year ago. The proportion of people buying liquid hand soap at least once a month has risen from 56 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2014 . Experts believe the nation's changing hygiene habits could be down to the public fear over international health scares such as last year's Ebola outbreak. Charlotte Libby, Senior Beauty Analyst at Mintel, said: 'With health scares making headlines around the world throughout 2014, the spread of disease has raised awareness of how hand hygiene plays a part in preventing infection, causing an increase in the frequency of consumers washing their hands.' Professor Vincent-Wayne Mitchell, a consumer marketing specialist at the Cass Business School in London, added that years of MRSA oubreaks and food hygiene scares had made people 'hygiene hyperconscious.' The proportion of people buying liquid hand soap at least once a month has risen from 56 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2014. Research by Mintel found that 87 per cent of people are more likely to purchase liquid soap than bar soap, 71 per cent. More than half of us also use hand sanitiser gel, with a third buying it once a month or more. Professor Isabelle Szmigin, a consumer behaviour expert at the University of Birmingham, said the shift to liquid soap was 'purely an improvement' 'The large majority of young Brits purchasing hand sanitiser shows that, despite preconceptions, this group have a particularly cautious attitude towards spreading germs,' added Ms Libby. Humans have been using soap for thousands of years. The earliest bar discovered dates back to around 2800 BC in ancient Babylon. The first mass-market transparent soap was Pears, which was first sold in 1807. Professor Isabelle Szmigin, a consumer behaviour expert at the University of Birmingham, said the shift to liquid soap was 'purely an improvement'. 'This is what we call a continuous innovation, where the basic formula is the same but the product is better,' she said. Shower washes were the most frequently purchased body cleansing product of 2014, as they were the previous year, with one in five taking less baths than they did a year ago. Ms Libby said: 'Consumers have started to realise that being environmentally friendly can translate to money-saving and are making greener choices to benefit their own pockets.' Experts believe the nation's changing hygiene habits could be down to the public fear over health scares such as last year's Ebola outbreak . Young men, aged 16-24, were the most likely to still choose a bath over a shower with a quarter claiming that the bath is their cleaning method of choice, compared to the national average of 19 per cent. One in five men young men said they are taking more baths compared to three years ago with a quarter of describing the bathroom as their 'sanctuary.' Prof Mitchell said the increasing use of baths by young men reflects the rise of male grooming and the metrosexual phenomenon. 'Young men can prove an important target for innovation in the soap, bath and shower sector, and could be encouraged into habits that they maintain as they age,' Ms Libby concluded. The soap, bath and shower category experienced declining sales over the past two years, falling from £660 million in 2012 to an estimated £638 million in 2014.","Study found numbers buying liquid soap rose from 56% to 62% last year .

"A baby chihuahua has been reunited with her dognapped mother after thieves abandoned her in a local park. Chanel was only nine days old when her mother Sophie was taken in a raid on their home - and was so upset she refused to eat and wouldn't stop crying. But three days later, their owner Mara Almeida, of Rush Green, east London, received a phone call to say two-and-a-half-year-old Sophie had been abandoned in a park on National Puppy Day. Puppy Chanel was only nine days old when her mother Sophie was taken in a raid on their home - but the pair have now been reunited after thieves abandoned the dog at a park in Dagenham, east London .

But all they asked for is to have Sophie back so she could feed her puppy - and even offered a £1,000 reward for her safe return. The mother-of-five said: 'I'm so happy now. The puppy is so happy she's back with her mum now. 'She had stopped eating without her but now she's eating again.

"The trust-fund granddaughter of a pharmaceutical magnate has upset the residents of her upscale New York condominium who claim they can smell cigarette and marijuana smoke from her apartment. Jacqueline Lasdon, 27, a nightlife performer, moved into the Onyx Condominium last year and since then the board said it has been 'inundated with complaints concerning unreasonable and offensive levels of cigarette and marijuana smoke emanating from the unit,' according to court papers. The board also said it has received numerous 'complaints concerning the regular influx of transient persons residing in the unit'. Jacqueline Lasdon, the trust-fund granddaughter of a pharmaceutical magnate, upset the residents of  upscale Onyx Condominium by smoking too much weed in her $2m New York apartment, a new lawsuit claims . Party girl: Jacqueline Lasdon, 27, a nightlife performer, moved into the Onyx Condominium last year and since then the board said it has been 'inundated with complaints' about smoke in her apartment . Young heiress: Lasdon, who received a $25million trust from her late grandfather Stanley Lasdon, said the suit took her by surprise and says she doesn't hold parties in her apartment . According to the lawsuit, the condominium 'repeatedly warned' Lasdon that she was violating building rules, but is now seeking a court order, as well as unspecified monetary damage and attorney's fees, to force her to stop what it claims is 'intentional and unreasonable' behavior. Lasdon, who received a $25million trust from her late grandfather Stanley Lasdon, said the suit took her by surprise. She told the New York Post she 'definitely' doesn't smoke pot in the building, and quit lighting up cigarettes a few months ago after an upstairs neighbor complained. The apartment board  said it was 'inundated with complaints concerning unreasonable and offensive levels of cigarette and marijuana smoke emanating from the unit' after Lasdon moved in, according to court papers . Lasdon also said she doesn't throw parties in her $2million apartment and is only regularly visited by the same two friends. 'I heard everything was fine in the building,' she told the New York Daily News. 'They said there wasn't a problem.' Lasdon said she has only had problems with one upstairs neighbor, who she claimed was 'verbally abusive'. 'I haven't had any contact with any of my other neighbors,' she said. 'This is definitely a shock to me.' Lasdon trained to be an opera singer and now hosts dance parties. She also sometimes performs cabaret and DJs.

"The chairman of a House committee investigating the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya, said Tuesday that he wants to interview Hillary Rodham Clinton by May 1. That timeframe would put the next round of what' been called 'email-gate' in the middle of Clinton's likely timetable for announcing a presidential campaign. South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, the Benghazi committee's chairman, said in a letter to Clinton's lawyer that a recorded and transcribed interview would help the committee better understand decisions Clinton made 'relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records' — namely her emails during the four years she was secretary of state. At that point, he continued, the committee would consider calling her to testify under oath in an open, public hearing. SCROLL DOWN TO READ GOWDY'S DEMAND LETTER . DEADLINE: Hillary Clinton has until May 1 to sit down with congressional investigators and discuss her use of a private email address from 2009 to 2013 – along with what happened to tens of thousands of her messages . INQUISITOR: Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican congressman who was a hard-nosed prosecutor before winning his seat in Congress, is calling the shots but has limited authority and can't subpoena Clinton's computer hardware . Gowdy announced Friday that Clinton's attorney, David Kendall, said she had wiped her private email server 'clean' and permanently deleted all emails from it. Clinton, a likely Democratic presidential candidate, exclusively used a private email account and her own server during her tenure at State from 2009 to 2013. Her spokesman Nick Merrill told the Associated Press on Tuesday that Clinton told Gowdy's committee months ago that she was ready to appear at a public hearing. 'It is by their choice that hasn't happened,' Merrill said. 'To be clear, she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the American public.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest put some distance between Clinton and the Obama administration on Tuesday afternoon, referring to her as a 'private citizen.' THE LAWYER: David Kendall, whose service to the Clintons goes back past President Bill Clinton's impeachment and all the way back to his days as Arkansas governor, is catching legal spears for Hillary as 'email-gate' grows . 'This will obviously be a discussion for the leaders in that committee and Secretary Clinton and her team to have, so I don't have an opinion on it,' Earnest told reporters in his daily briefing. Asked if Clinton should ultimately sit with Republicans for an in-person grilling, he replied: 'That will be a decision for her to make.' Earnest contended that the White House has provided the committee with enough information. 'We certainly have,' he claimed Tuesday. But Clinton has refused Gowdy's request to turn over her email server, housed at her upstate New York home, to a third party for an independent review. If the Secretary continues to reject the offer of a neutral review,' Gowdy wrote in his letter to Kendall, 'the House of Representatives as a whole will need to consider its next steps.' Kendall said Friday that Clinton has already turned over to the State Department all work-related emails, about 30,000 in all. Gowdy, however, said Clinton lacked the authority to determine what was and wasn't a government document subject to archiving. Clinton confirmed in a press conference this month that she deleted the rest, more than 32,000 emails. White House press secretary Josh Earnest seemingly cut Hillary loose on Tuesday, calling her a 'private citizen' and saying it was up to her to decide whether or not to cooperate . CONNECTED: Hillary Clinton was never far from her mobile smartphone as secretary of state, but only her closest confidantes knew the device was communicating with a private email server at her house – not a government system at the State Department . Kendall also said it would be pointless for Clinton to turn over her server, since 'no emails ... reside on the server or on any backup systems associated with the server.' But technical experts cited in news reports point out that the same argument was made early in an investigation of former IRS official Lois Lerner. Lerner was accused of conspiring to user her authority to slow-walk or deny tax-exemption applications filed by conservative nonprofits in order to put them at a political disadvantage. She claimed a hard-drive crash wiped out years of her email traffic, but the IRS inspector general later found usable archives covering large portions of the missing material. Gowdy said Tuesday that it is technically possible in many instances to recover electronic information that has been deleted or overwritten. 'It is precisely for this reason a neutral and objective party must have access to the server and related equipment to identify information potentially responsive to relevant laws and investigative requests,' he wrote in a letter to Kendall. Gowdy also reminded Kendall that the server and any associated information, data, backups and equipment 'must be preserved wherever they reside and that any further deletion or destruction of data or information must cease.' Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Benghazi panel, said Clinton agreed to testify months ago, in public and under oath, 'so the Select Committee's claim that it has no choice but to subject her to a private staff interview is inaccurate.' Rather than drag out what he called a 'political charade,' Cummings said, the committee should schedule a public hearing with Clinton, make her email public 'and re-focus its efforts on the attacks in Benghazi.' Four Americans were killed in the September 2012 attacks, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens.

"Keepers at Taronga Western Plains Zoo are looking for help to name one of their latest additions to their family of otters. The oriental small-clawed otter pups were born on January 8 at the zoo located in Dubbo in New South Wales' central west. While keepers will name two of the pups, they are enlisting the help of the public to christen the third. Scroll down for video . The oriental small-clawed otter pups were born on January 8 to parents Emiko and Pocket . The trio include two females and one male, and were born to Emiko and Pocket. It is Emiko's second litter. A statement from the zoo said the pair were 'exceptional parents' and were taking 'great care of their offspring. 'Both Emiko and Pocket are very hands-on parents and have been displaying ideal nurturing behaviours,' keeper Ian Anderson said. 'The pups have been in the den to date and we have been monitoring them via a video camera, to ensure they are growing and developing well.' Keepers will name two of the otters, while they have enlisted the help of the public to name the third . The birth of this litter comes off the success of last year's first litter as part of the zoo's breeding program. 'The older siblings born in 2014 have been assisting their parents with the daily care of the pups including grooming and babysitting the new arrivals,' Mr Anderson said. 'Oriental small-clawed otters are a social species and live in large families so it is anticipated that the family will remain together for the near future.' The trio had their first vaccinations and health check on Friday. This is the second litter for Emiko who had her first in January last year as part of the breeding program . A statement from the zoo said Emiko and Pocket were 'exceptional parents' and were taking 'great care of their offspring . Right now, they are still spending a lot of time in their den and rarely seen at the zoo. Keepers expect them to will start venturing out more often with their parents and older siblings to explore their exhibit and to learn to swim over the coming weeks.

"With it's 'exceptional location' and 'prestigious, exclusive environment', you might be forgiven for thinking this advert referred to a sought-after luxury flat. But the estate agent's blurb is actually for Britain's most expensive car parking space - which has just put been on the market for nearly £500,000. The 'fantastic' underground parking space is located in Kingston House in Kensington, one of the most affluent areas of London. Britain's most expensive car parking space, in Kensington, London, has been put on the market for £480,000 . The 'fantastic' underground parking space, which is a triple bay, is located in Kingston House (pictured) A resident's parking permit in Kensington and Chelsea, where the car parking space is located, typically costs up to £207 per year depending on the car's carbon dioxide emissions . Described as 'spacious', the triple parking bay comes with 24-hour security, a valet service and extensive state-of-the-art CCTV. There is also a complex ventilation system which ensures the regular flow of clean and extraction of carbon monoxide emissions. The parking space has been put on the market with Foxtons for £480,000. With stamp duty, the buyer will end up paying a total of £494,000 - three times the price of the average home in England and Wales and the same price as a pretty cottage in the Cotswolds. With the same money, you could also buy three plush Ferrari 458s, 50 new Ford Fiestas or a lavish superyacht. On top of this, the purchaser will also have to pay an additional £1,500 per year service charge. The bay is one of two triple spaces currently for sale in the underground car park. The other one costs £390,000. There is also a single space for £132,000. Paul Wallace, who runs the YouTube channel Supercars of London, believes it is unfortunately a price to pay for keeping your cars safe. The same amount could buy you this quaint country cottage in Costwolds village Bourton-on-the-Hill . It could also buy you this lavish 16th century castle, which has six bedrooms, in By Chryston, Glasgow . He said: 'You might think the super wealthy residents of Central London would have unlimited secure parking spaces, but it is becoming more apparent that this is not the case. 'There are lots of £200,000 supercars left on the side of the roads overnight, which exposes the cars to having wing mirrors clipped, rain and pollution on paintwork and even worse. '£480,000 is an very excessive cost to keep your car safe at night, but it's relatively essential with potential vandals.' The Kingston House car park, on Prince's Gate, can house a maximum of 144 cars. As part of a multi-million pound renovation, engineers installed a state of the art ventilation and fume extraction system which is designed to 'ensure the regular flow of clean air throughout the car park and the extraction of harmful carbon monoxide emissions'. The £480,000 - which would also have stamp duty added on -  could also buy you this luxury yacht . A prospective buyer could also swap the parking space for three of these cars, a Ferrari 458 . On its website, Kingston House Private Parking described the car park as a '5 star parking facility deserving of our discerning clients'. Henry Pryor, a property expert, described the £480,000 triple car parking spot as a 'reasonable expenditure' for the right person. He said: 'Secure parking in central London is particularly valuable at the moment with homeowners keener than usual for serviced and underground spaces in the light of recent keyless entry car crimes. 'In Kensington and Chelsea it costs £4 per hour to park, for 10-12 hours a day, most days of the year. 'So it is not an absurd alternative to paying the council - although it is a lot more than a resident's parking permit.' A resident's parking permit in Kensington and Chelsea typically costs up to £207 per year depending on the car's carbon dioxide emissions.","Triple bay is based underground in Kingston House, Kensington, London .

But the most recent edition, which came out on March 26 - featuring Noel Gallagher and novelist Irvine Welsh - is to be its last, bosses have revealed. Deputy editor Lia Nicholls revealed the closure on Twitter in a post which included pictures of the first and last editions of the magazine. She said: ‘The very first and unfortunately the last issue of @loadedmag. Sad day. Loved every minute.’ Glamour models and Page Three girls Lucy Pinder (left) and Michelle Marsh (right) pose for photographers in a giant cake to help celebrate the 10th anniversary of Loaded, outside the Tate Modern in London in 2004 . At times during its 21 year life, Loaded ran into controversy attracting criticism over the number of scantily-clad women it included in each edition. Circulation fell as it went through a number of different ownership changes, but after a relaunch last year, Loaded said it would be ‘far more discerning and sophisticated’ in its depiction of women, the BBC reports. The Telegraph reports that circulation topped 500,000 for its 50th edition in June 1998. Lads' mags may have taken off in the mid-1990s, but some of the many titles that became synonymous with the booming sector had already been around for some time. The likes of FHM and Arena had been catering for the male market since the middle of the 1980s and more emerged in the following decade. But although many titles prospered in that era and continue to do so, circulation for some of the best-known magazines started to suffer with the rise of the internet. Men's monthly magazine Arena was set up in 1986 with the aim of providing a mix of fashion and style. Game changers: Nuts (left) and its rival Zoo (right), were launched within weeks of each other leaving more established lads' mags reeling . But circulation declined in its last decade and it was closed down by publishers Bauer in 2009. In the same year, it was announced that the UK print edition of Maxim would be closed after 14 years having been launched in 1995 by Dennis Publishing. It was reported at the time that the US version would be sold on British news stands. In 2004, two new weekly titles, Nuts and its rival Zoo, were launched within weeks of each other leaving more established lads' mags reeling - but they often encountered controversy for their portrayal of women. FHM magazine (left), is one of the best known lads's mags. Maxim's UK print edition (right) closed down in 2009 after 14 years . Although many titles prospered in the 1990s and continue to do so, circulation for many of the best-known magazines started to suffer with the rise of the internet . Front pages predominantly featured pictures of scantily clad women and in 2013 it was reported that Co-op would no longer sell Nuts. It came after the title rejected an ultimatum to use 'modesty bags' or be removed from shelves, it was reported at the time. Despite having a weekly circulation of more than 300,000 at its height, the circulation of Nuts was in decline by 2007 and in 2014, IPC Media announced that it was closing the title down. Zoo, published by Bauer Media Group, is still operating as it another well known lads' mag title from the era, FHM, which started in 1985 as For Him Magazine, . But sales plummeted to about 35,000 in 2011, the last officially audited figures for the magazine. It was one of a number of lads’ magazines that became popular in the 1990s along with the likes of FHM and Maxim and, later, Nuts and Zoo. The magazine’s publisher Simian said in a statement: ‘As of the current April issue, published on March 26th, Loaded will cease to trade as a printed magazine. ‘We would like to pay tribute to our customers, staff and especially our contributors and editorial team.’ One of its initial 1994 launch editors, James Brown, told his Twitter followers that the closure was 'a pity' adding: 'The last team seemed to have made a real go of it.'","Magazine was set up in 1995 and had six-figure readership at its height .

"Mexico officials are offering Sony Pictures Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. up to $20 million to portray a positive image of the country in the upcoming 'James Bond' film, 'Spectre.' Among many private documents leaked by hackers in the recent Sony hack were emails between Sony and MGM officials regarding the upcoming 'James Bond' film, looking for ways to save money, according to Tax Analysts. As part of, what the e-mails referred to as, the 'Mexican Deal,' producers are making several changes to the film to secure up to $20 million from Mexican officials including script rewrites and casting changes. Scroll down for video . Millions: Mexico officials are offering Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM millions to portray a positive image of the country in the new 'James Bond' film (photographed is Daniel Craig as James Bond in 'Spectre') In one email, Jonathan Glickman, president of MGM's motion picture group, wrote that producers are facing a budget for 'Spectre' far beyond what was expected. Now more than $300 million, Glickman said producers are under 'immense' pressure to reduce the film's budget to $250 million. 'This is not about 'nickel and diming' the production,' Glickman wrote. 'As of now, our shooting period is $50M higher than 'Skyfall' and the current gross budget sits in the mid $300Ms, making this one of the most expensive films ever made.' Desperate to save money, producers have reportedly given up a measure of creative control. They are so desperate in fact, that the studio allowed Mexican officials to dictate characters' ethnicities, make casting decisions, and change the occupation of an unnamed character that never appears on screen, the Independent reports. Cast: Mexican officials requested that a Mexican actress be cast as a Bond Girl; Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman has joined the cast of 'Spectre' as Estrella . Changes: Mexico officials requested that the villain in the film be an international ambassador rather than a Mexico City mayor and that Mexican police be depicted as a 'special force' Among the changes, Mexico officials requested that the villain in the film be an international ambassador rather than a Mexico City mayor, that Mexican police  be depicted as a 'special force,' and that a Mexican actress be cast as a Bond Girl. As was recently announced, Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman has joined the cast of 'Spectre' as Estrella. The film received $14 million for roughly four minutes of footage in the film's opening, Business Insider reports. Mexico officials would reportedly give another $6 million to the film if producers highlighted the skyline and 'modern' features of Mexico City -- the film's first shooting location. Amy Pascal, then chair of Sony's motion picture group, encouraged Glickman to move forward with the changes to increase the project's eligibility for Mexico's film production incentive programs. 'We should insist they add whatever travelogue footage we need in Mexico to get the extra money,' Pascal reportedly said in an e-mail. Image: Mexico officials' involvement in the film is an effort to repair the country's image amid a drug war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2006 (here, riot policeclash with students furious about the massacre of 43 students in Mexico City) Insider reports that Mexico officials' involvement in the film is an effort to repair the country's image amid a drug war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2006. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro spoke at a film fest recently saying that the drug war has left the country in 'social decay.' However, Ioan Grillo, author and expert on Mexico’s drug war, told Insider that the country's appeal through the Bond film won't help significantly and he is not surprised by the country's effort to attract tourists and investments through the film. 'It might help to improve Mexico’s image a little, but if the government really wants a better image, it needs to change the reality and stop mass disappearances and massacres,' Grillo said.","Mexico officials are offering Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM millions to portray a positive image of the country in the new 'James Bond' film .

"A mother racked up £45,000 in debt and maxed out five credit cards after becoming addicted to online bingo while she was off work sick. Kelly Nield, 32, would gamble for eight hours at a time and drained all the money she and her boyfriend had saved up together. Her addiction became so bad that she began to have suicidal thoughts and turned to self harm after worrying about how she would ever escape the habit. Scroll down for video . Kelly Nield racked up £45,000 debt and maxed out five credit cards after becoming addicted to online gambling . Mother-of-one Ms Nield, from Billinge, Merseyside, said: 'You get to the point where you can't see a way out. 'It's a vicious cycle as when you win get the buzz to play again, and when you lose you just want to get your money back. 'I just wanted to find a way to make myself stop and when my thoughts turned dark I knew I had to get help.' She first stumbled across bingo while watching The Jeremy Kyle Show when she was signed off sick from her job as a childcare worker in 2012. Foxy Bingo was advertised with a bright, brash logo on the daytime television show, luring Ms Nield in before she went on to use other sites too. 'You can go on and do it in your own home in comfort and to begin with it's not a big deal,' she said. The mother-of-one would play for eight hours non-stop while she was signed off work sick . 'I'd been to bingo with friends in the past but not spent more than about £20. It had never been an issue before. 'But they always let you win something to begin with or offer you free plays. In just over six months, I was £10,000 in debt.' Ms Nield's online bingo habit quickly spiralled out of control, and the first thing she would turn to in the morning was her smartphone, where she could get her kick within seconds. She said: 'I would gamble from the second my family left in the morning until they came home at night, and when they were home I would sneak off to the bathroom and bedroom to play. 'My partner would come home and comment that the house hadn't been touched and it was because I'd be sat on it all day, gambling. 'For the first two years I put everything on credit cards. Because I was off and suffering with stress, I don't really remember it. I think I was just blocking out what was going on . 'I know the difference between right and wrong so now I think what on earth was I doing.' The mother took out more credit cards, arranged more overdrafts on her bank account and began to dip into the family's savings. 'I've ended up with five credit cards in total - one for £10,000 and the others all have around £5,000 on them,' she said. 'I'd maxed them all out by the end of 2013 and then until the middle of 2014 I was using any cash I could get my hands on. 'I managed to get a £1,600 overdraft on one of my accounts and I just spent it. 'My partner and I were saving around £500 a month and I would just access the accounts and spend what I could. Now we're left without any savings at all.' Eventually she came clean to her boyfriend Ian Nairn, 37, and she started seeing a doctor to help her tackle her addiction. Now Ms Nield, who is paying off £300 of debt a month, is now calling on the gambling industry to rein in its adverts, which are aired on television throughout the day. Ms Nield is now undergoing counselling after kicking the habit, and is paying back £300 a month to clear her debts . She said: 'They target vulnerable people and make them believe they can make money from gambling. 'I understand some people gamble and have no issues. But many people have a problem and this destroys lives, families and even drives people to suicide. 'It destroys people and leaves them with long term debts, depression and stress. 'No-one gives you anything for nothing in this world and something needs to be done about it.' Dirk Hanson, CEO of gambling support charity Gamcare, said: 'We applaud people who come forward and admit that they have a problem with gambling. 'We encourage people to get support either for themselves or for family members or friends who might be struggling. 'There is help available out there either through support groups or through one-on-one counselling. 'We know that women in particular are drawn to online forms of gambling and they are more likely to access these services online. 'We offer an online chat service through our helping where people can anonymously come through and chat with one of our advisors. 'It is a reality that people can get hooked on these websites, and people should be fully aware of the risks before getting too involved.' Foxy Bingo have been contacted for comment.","Kelly Nield got hooked on online gambling while she was off work sick .

"Incredible before and after images have revealed a fresh lunar scar created by the biggest explosion ever recorded on the moon's surface. The moon is pelted with cosmic debris all the time, but this relatively recent crater was created by an object the size of a small boulder. Scientists watched the object explode as it hit the surface in Mare Imbrium creating a flash of light 10 times as bright as anything ever recorded on the moon before. Scroll down for video . Incredible before (left) and after (right) images reveal a fresh lunar scar created by the biggest ever explosion recorded on the moon surface. Slide the middle bar to see how the moon's surface changed after impact . When a meteoroid strikes the moon, a large portion of the impact energy goes into heat and excavating a crater. However, part of it also goes into generating visible light, which results in a brilliant flash at the point of impact. The images reveal intricate details of the resulting impact crater and could help scientists learn more about how craters form. The brightest flash occurred on March 17, 2013 with coordinates 20.6°N, 336.1°E. The team predicted the crater's size based on the energy, and then eagerly awaited Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera;s next pass over the location to confirm their calculations. Being able to get observations before, during and after the impact is a valuable opportunity to understand impact events better. Four different mages of a crater formed on the moon, March 17, 2013; each scene is 1837ft (560 metres) wide. The brightest flash occurred on March 17, 2013 with coordinates 20.6°N, 336.1°E . Comparing the actual size of the crater to the brightness of the flash helps validate impact models. The crater itself is small, measuring 61.7ft (18.8 metres) in diameter, but its influence is large; debris excavated by the sudden release of energy flew for hundreds of metres. More than 200 related surface changes up to 19 miles (30km) away were noted. Scientists could be closer to finding water on the moon - a discovery that could help create rocket fuel and breathable air for future colonies. Using data from the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter's Lend tool, Nasa scientists have been mapping the hydrogen levels across the moon craggy deposits. And they've found surprisingly higher levels of hydrogen in a very specific area; the slopes of craters in the moon's southern hemisphere facing the South Pole. These slopes could be mankind's best hope finding drinkable water on the lunar surface, they claim. Hydrogen could be found as either hydroxol - which is a single atom bound with a single oxygen atom - or it may be two hydrogen atoms bound with oxygen. Scientists believe lunar water could be used for drinking or its components – hydrogen and oxygen – may be used to manufacture rocket fuel or even breathable air. Not only did the LROC images reveal intricate details of ejecta distribution, but they also offered a valuable opportunity to study the structure of the top meter of the regolith. Regolith is a term that refers to a soil that is lacking organic material. The soil on the moon is formed slowly over time as micrometeorites impact the surface and slowly grind rocks into a fine powder. As the fresh soil grains sit on the surface, they are exposed to radiation and slowly become darker and redder. This is largely caused by a reduction of iron in minerals to iron metal – reverse of rusting that happens on Earth. This slow change in reflectance and colour is generally referred to as space weathering; fresh soil is referred to as immature, and weathered soil is mature. Several surprises were revealed in the before and after image pairs around the new crater. Conventional thought predicted that the new crater should be surrounded by a high reflectance ejecta with some patchy debris spreading out two or three diameters. 'The high reflectance was there, but three other zones were discovered,' said Mark Robinson, a professor in ASU's School of Earth and Space Exploration and LROC's principal investigator. 'At the edge of the high reflectance ejecta was a low reflectance zone, then, beyond that, another high reflectance zone, and beyond that, another low reflectance zone.' It's not easy to find new impact craters because most of them are very small. The only way to really do this is to have a before image and an after image to compare. With the help of the automated tool, the team has identified 225 new impact craters ranging in size from 4.9ft to 140ft (91.5 meters to 43 metres) and over 25,000 small changes known as 'splotches'. Using data from the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter's Lend tool (artist's impression pictured), Nasa scientists discovered the crater itself is small, measuring 61.7ft (18.8 metres) in diameter, but its influence is large; debris excavated by the sudden release of energy flew for hundreds of metres .","Nasa watched a boulder-sized object explode on March 17 2013 .

"Hillary Rodham Clinton's silence on the email controversy swirling around her is getting louder by the day. On Monday, the potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate ignored the issue at a forum while a second Democratic senator urged her to speak out – and predicted she will – about her decision to conduct business while secretary of state in a private email account. Republicans are ramping up their attention on the issue. At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama indeed knew she was using a nongovernment account during her tenure. Obama had indicated earlier that he only learned of that from recent news reports. EMAILS? WHAT EMAILS? Hillary Clinton didn't address her growing email scandal on Monday as she spoke about global progress on the role of women . SCRIPTED: When Melinda Gates (left), Chelsea Clinton (center) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (right) participated Monday in the unveiling of a Clinton Foundation report on women's rights, nothing was left to chance . HE'LL HANDLE IT: White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday during his press briefing that President Obama exchanged emails with Hillary Clinton at her private, non-government email address . Earnest said the president actually learned from those news reports of Clinton's privately run email server, but was familiar with her private account earlier because the two had exchanged emails when she was in office. Obama did not know at the time that she was using private email exclusively, Earnest said. Clinton spoke at a carefully choreographed two-hour event involving her No Ceilings project at the Clinton Foundation, highlighting economic and educational opportunities for women and girls. She took no questions. When she sat down to lead more informal conversations with invited speakers, participants appeared to be reading from teleprompters. Clinton is under scrutiny over whether she fully complied with federal laws requiring government officials to preserve written communications involving official business. NODS APPROVINGLY: Former US President Bill Clinton, center, watched from the audience during the 'No Celings' event in New York . Democrats have defended her but Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California made waves Sunday when she urged Clinton to offer a detailed explanation. 'From this point on, the silence is going to hurt her,' Feinstein said. On Monday, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Clinton will probably address the matter – and should. 'I think that you're going to hear something from Secretary Clinton this week,' she said on MSNBC. 'I'm fairly certain it will be soon. I think that's very important.' Last week, Clinton said in a Twitter message that she wanted her emails released by the State Department as soon as possible – but did not address why she does not put them out herself immediately. Clinton's spokesmen and the State Department have said she never received or transmitted classified information on her private email account, in which case there would be no concerns that disclosure of her messages could compromise national security. The State Department is reviewing 55,000 pages of emails that she has turned over and Republicans in Congress have said they plan to review her email practices.","The White House now says Obama exchanged emails with Clinton at her private, non-government email address while she led State Department .

"For the first time in a decade, astronomers have found dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way - an unprecedented nine in total. They range in distance from 95,000 to 1.2 million light-years, and each contain far fewer stars than our galaxy. Crucially, though, the dwarf galaxies could help test theories of dark matter and perhaps bring us a step closer to detecting the elusive particles. Move the slider below to see an image of the southern sky before and after the new dwarf galaxies are added . Astronomers have found nine new dwarf galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way. They are the first to be discovered orbiting our galaxy in more than a decade. This image shows the previously known Magellanic Clouds with six of the nine newly discovered dwarf galaxies above the Paranal Observatory in Chile . The discovery was made by a team of astronomers at the University of Cambridge using data from the Dark Energy Survey, a five-year project to photograph the southern sky in extreme detail. The nine dwarf galaxies were spotted in the night sky in the southern hemisphere, near the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud, which are the largest dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way's orbit. Astronomers have discovered that a strange ring of distant stars may actually be part of our galaxy, making it 50 per cent bigger at 150,000 light-years wide. This is based on re-analysis of a distant ring that surrounds our galaxy, which the astronomers think is now actually part of it, and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies. The team of scientists from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York studied the Monoceros Ring, which is a long ring-like filament of stars that ‘wraps’ around our galaxy three times. ‘The discovery of so many satellites in such a small area of the sky was completely unexpected,' said Dr Sergey Koposov of Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, the study’s lead author. ‘I could not believe my eyes.’ The newly discovered objects are each a billion times dimmer than the Milky Way, and a million times less massive. This makes them incredibly difficult to find, even in our galactic neighbourhood. Dwarf galaxies are the smallest galaxy structures in the universe, and can contain as few as 5,000 stars - whereas the Milky Way has around 200 billion. Importantly, though, they are thought to contain 99 per cent dark matter and just one per cent observable matter. This means they should be useful to test cosmological theories of dark matter, which makes up 25 per cent of all matter in the universe but is yet to be detected. ‘Dwarf satellites are the final frontier for testing our theories of dark matter,’ said Dr Vasily Belokurov of the Institute of Astronomy, one of the study’s co-authors. ‘We need to find them to determine whether our cosmological picture makes sense. Finding such a large group of satellites near the Magellanic Clouds was surprising, though, as earlier surveys of the southern sky found very little, so we were not expecting to stumble on such treasure.’ The newly discovered objects are each a billion times dimmer than the Milky Way, and a million times less massive.This makes them incredibly difficult to find, even in our galactic neighbourhood. They are seen here in an artist's impression below the plane of our galaxy . ‘Dwarf satellites are the final frontier for testing our theories of dark matter,’ said Dr Vasily Belokurov of the Institute of Astronomy, one of the study’s co-authors. On the left in these images is Eridanus 2, in the middle is Pictoris 1 and on the right is Horologium 1 . These dwarf galaxies are the first to be discovered after dozens were found in 2005 and 2006. The closest of the newly discovered dwarf galaxies is being torn apart by the Milky Way, while the most distant is about to start being pulled in towards us. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 25 per cent of the matter in the known universe. Their origins remain a bit of a mystery, though; they may have once orbited the Magellanic Clouds until they were thrown out. However, it should be noted that while three of the objects are definitely dwarf galaxies, some of the other six may actually be globular clusters. These are spherical collections of stars that are not thought to be held together by dark matter. Another implication of the discovery is that two star-forming clusters found below the Milky Way, announced last month, may actually have an extragalactic origin. Known as Camargo 438 and 439, the two clusters were found 16,000 light-years below the flattened disk of the Milky Way. Previously, it was only thought possible for stars to form inside giant molecular clouds (GMC) located in the inner part of the galactic disc. The two clusters were thought to have been pushed out of the galactic disk by a ‘superwind’ caused by supernovae. But Dr Denilso Camargo of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porte Alegre, Brazil - who led the study - told MailOnline that the discovery by the Cambridge scientists now suggests they might have come from beyond our own galaxy before being captured. ‘This work supports the idea that Camargo 438 and Camargo 439 have an extragalactic origin,’ he said. The Magellanic Clouds and a stream of neutral hydrogen are shown in the illustration here, along with the newly discovered dwarf galaxies. Their origins remain a bit of a mystery, though; they may have once orbited the Magellanic Clouds until they were thrown out .","University of Cambridge astronomers have found new nine dwarf galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way .

"A man who bought herbal remedies for impotence on the internet is being treated in hospital for arsenic poisoning, it has emerged. Detectives found high levels of the poison in the man's blood after he was admitted to Leeds General Infirmary. Suspicions arose after the man revealed he was taking three types of herbal tablets for erectile dysfunction. He told medics he had bought the brown, silver and red tablets on the internet. Police today warned people to be aware of the dangers of purchasing drugs and remedies online. A man has been taken to hospital after suffering arsenic poisoning from herbal erectile dysfunction remedies he purchased on the internet. Police officers in Yorkshire are investigating after it emerged the man had been taken three different medicines in the form of brown, silver and red tablets (file picture) Detective Chief Inspector Lisa Atkinson, from West Yorkshire Police, said: 'Officers are currently conducting enquiries around the supplier of these tablets and that work is ongoing. 'We have recovered a number of the tablets and they have been sent for forensic analysis which will take some weeks to complete. 'Based on what the man involved has told u,s we suspect the tablets may have been the source of the arsenic he has consumed. 'On that basis we are making people aware of the potential risk to their health of consuming similar tablets bought on the internet. 'While it is expected that he will make a full recovery we are told this is unusual for the level of arsenic in his system and that consequences could have been far more serious.' Experts have, in the past, warned of the dangers of buying medicines over the internet, including erectile dysfunction drugs. Many sites are known to sell fake, sub-standard or even dangerous medicines. More than £10 million is thought to be spent online by more than 300,000 men in the UK, believing they are buying the erectile dysfunction drug, Viagra. An estimated two million Britons regularly buy medicines, including prescription drugs and those not available on the NHS, over the internet for a range of conditions. Drugs companies have warned of the dangers of buying Viagra, pictured, and other erectile dysfunction remedies on the internet,  with some counterfeit medicines containing blue printer ink, toxic ingredients and powerful antibiotics that can cause an allergic reaction, diarrhoea or vomiting . The pharmaceutical company Pfizer, who manufacture Viagra, warns on its website of the dangers of buying counterfeit medications. It warns that fake Viagra has been found to contain blue printer ink, amphetamines or speed, and a powerful antibiotic that can cause an allergic reaction, diarrohea or vomiting. In addition, too much of the active ingredient has been found in some fake drugs, causing potential harm, and binding agents including drywall that prevent the tablet breaking down in the body. Other counterfeit medication that claims to help combat erectile dysfunction has been found to contain toxic ingredients including boric acid, floor wax, brick dust and road paint. Traces of ingredients that can have dangerous interaction with other medications people may be taking have also been found, as well as completely different medication with potentially harmful side effects.","Man taken to Leeds General Infirmary when he fell ill after taking tablets .

"A fierce row has broken out between Stephen King and Maine Governor Paul LePage after the governor claimed that the author  doesn't pay state income taxes and has moved away from the state. King immediately shot back that LePage should 'man up and apologize' for the comments because he still resides in Maine. LePage's comments came during his weekly radio address when he argued that states without an income tax, like Florida, have lured away Maine residents, including King. Fight: Novelist Stephen King says he still lives in Maine, and insists that Governor Paul LePage's claim that he has moved from the state is inaccurate . Statement: Governor Paul LePage said: 'Well, today former Governor Ken Curtis lives in Florida where there is zero income tax. Stephen King and Roxanne Quimby have moved away, as well' House: Bangor resident Stephen King's house is pictured here, the best-selling author said he and his wife paid about $1.4 million in Maine state taxes in 2013 and likely paid about the same for 2014 . He said: 'Meanwhile, remember who introduced the income tax here in Maine. 'Well, today former Governor Ken Curtis lives in Florida where there is zero income tax. Stephen King and Roxanne Quimby have moved away, as well.' LePage's office withdrew the radio address Thursday, after learning that the  statement about King was false. The corrected version, posted on the governor’s official website, deleted the reference to King and Quimby. King spends winters in Florida but told the Portland Press Herald that he and his wife paid about $1.4 million in Maine state taxes in 2013 and likely paid about the same for 2014. He told the Portland Press Herald: 'In 2013, my wife and I paid approximately $1.4 million in state taxes. 'As this is a matter of public record, I have no problem telling you that. I would imagine 2014 was about the same, but I do not have those figures.' King has an estimated fortune of $400million from book publishing and movie rights, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. Tweet: King tweeted 'Governor Paul LePage implied that I don't pay my taxes. I do. Every cent. I think he needs to man up and apologize.' Backtracking: LePage, right, withdrew the statement about King on Thursday after learning that it was false . The author's foundation awards $3 million to $5 million in grants annually, mostly in Maine. King, a best-selling author, has written over 55 successful horror novels. However, the remark prompted King, a legal resident of Maine  to say the governor 'was full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green.' King then tweeted Friday how much he paid the state in taxes over the last two years. The entire tax controversy stems from a plan being considered by the governor of Maine to overhaul tax. According to the Portland Press Herald, the plan would reduce the state income tax by raising the sales tax and applying it to new items and services. This, the Republican governor believes would encourage rich retirees and seasonal inhabitants to make Maine their primary domicile. However, the tax proposals have come under fierce criticism from Democrats in the state.","Maine Governor Paul LePage accused Stephen King of 'moving away' from the state .

"GOP presidential candidates who flocked to Iowa on Saturday for an agricultural summit hosted by a Republican mega donor lit into the Obama administration over its willingness to negotiate with countries that have 'terrible' track records. 'When you've got the Iranians and the Cubans doing terrible things to their people, you don't give them ice cream and candy for heaven's sake,' former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said after the event's host, Bruce Rastetter, a major player in the renewable energy sector, asked him if he supported the opening of trade with communist country. Responding to the same question during his 20-min Q and A with Rastetter, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie referenced  Black Liberation Army member Joanne Chesimard and argued that the U.S. shouldn't be trading with a country that is 'promoting someone who is a cop-killer.' Scroll down for video . 'When you've got the Iranians and the Cubans doing terrible things to their people, you don't give them ice cream and candy for heavens sake,' former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said while discussing trade at the Iowa Ag summit on Saturday . The Des Moines, Iowa, event was Bruce Rastetter, a major player in the renewable energy sector. Protesters are seen here outside the all-day extravaganza that attracted top-tier presidential hopefuls. Rastetter is pictured here wearing a crown in a protest sign . Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said President Barack Obama 'really missed the point' of sanctions on Cuba and had 'basically empowered the Castro regime' by renewing high-level diplomatic relations. 'This is a regime that has been incredibly onerous to the people of Cuba,' the 2012 presidential candidate said. If the point of the shift in Cuba policy was to put the country's people in a 'better position,' Perry said, Obama's plan failed. 'I'm not sure you're ever going to change the culture of Cuba until Castro is dead and gone,' Perry said, not specifying whether he was talking about the country's previous dictator Fidel, or his brother, Raul, who now runs the country. 'I think we got a bad deal. I think the Cuban people got a bad deal,' he said, stressing that the exchange of three Cuban spies for aid worker Alan Gross' release wasn't enough. 'In my opinion, we got the way short end of that deal,' Perry added. Huckabee said that the U.S. should 'quit pretending that Cuba is some wonderful nation with whom we can sit down and visit with any more than the Iranians are.' 'They're not,' Huckabee, a 2008 GOP presidential contender and likely 2016 competitor, he stated 'These are untrustworthy people who never kept an agreement in their lives.' Furthermore, Huckabee, said they, 'they kick their people in the groin.' 'You don't go around making plans to be nice to people who do horrible things,' he argued during an extended critique of the current occupant of the Oval Office's relations with foreign governments. 'You put pressure on them, you don't release the pressure.' Continuing, he said, 'I mean, my gosh, if my parents had raised me that way, I'd be a monster. 'My parents corrected my bad behavior. They didn't encourage it by rewarding me with ice cream and candy every time I did something horrible.' Former Texas Gov.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie referenced Black Liberation Army member Joanne Chesimard and argued that the U.S. shouldn't be trading with a country that is 'promoting someone who is a cop-killer.' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he is an 'emphatic advocate of free trade' but doesn't support it with Cuba. 'The Castros have been brutal dictators,' he said. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said 'any efforts taken by the Obama administration right now have not gotten anything in return.' 'Cuban dissidents are still in prison. The economy is controlled by a handful of what we would call, basically party apparatchiks. In the regime there's no small business development,' he asserted. 'All the economy built up by Cuba – the simple fact is it looks more like North Korea than a country that's emerging toward a freer place,' he claimed. Bush said a 'better approach would have been to say to Cuba, to the regime, ""You make these changes and of course we will open up diplomatic relations. Of course we will open up trade."" ' That would ultimately create 'great opportunities.' 'But right now this is not something that we should be doing unless there's big-time changes in Cuba,' he concluded. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he is an 'emphatic advocate of free trade' but, 'I don't support it with regard to Cuba.' 'The Castros have been brutal dictators,' he said, and 'they are exporting terrorism throughout the hemisphere.' Last year, Cuba was caught trying to send a shipment of arms to North Korea. Pyongyang recently paid a nearly $700,000 fine to the Panama Canal Authority for attempting to traffic arms. 'We've gotta be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,' the freshman lawmaker said. President Obama's actions will 'directly prop up the Castros,' Cruz said. Noting that he would be 'thrilled' to open up trade with Cuba, Cruz said he would only support it 'once we see freedom returned to the nation of Cuba.' That means free elections and free speech, he explained. FUGITIVE: JoAnne Chesimard killed a New Jersey police officer, escaped from a New Jersey prison and fled justice in Cuba, where she still lives under the Raul Castro government's protection . 'The simple fact is it looks more like North Korea than a country that's emerging toward a freer place,' former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said of Cuba . Christie said the U.S. shouldn't be doing any business with Cuba until it stops harboring a fugitive who killed a New Jersey police officer in 1977. 'You cannot start trading with a country that is promoting someone who is a cop-killer,' he said of Chesimard. The 67-year-old escaped from a New Jersey prison in 1979 and has been hiding out in Cuba since at least 1984, when Fidel Castro's regime granted her asylum. 'If they're going to keep harboring fugitives,' he said, 'I have a problem with that ... The president doesn't know how to negotiate. You don't give away the idea of trading with America for nothing.' Raul Castro's regime refused last week to extradite Chesimard, who now goes by the name of Assata Olugbala Shakur. 'I can say it is off the table,' Gustavo Machin, deputy director for American affairs at the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Yahoo News while discussing the latest round of trade negotiations between the U.S. and his country. Josefina Vidal, Cuba’s Head Of North American Affairs, had previously rejected a deal that would have released five Cuban prisoners being held in the U.S. if his country handed over Chesimard. 'Every nation has sovereign and legitimate rights to grant political asylum to people it considers to have been persecuted,' she told the Associated Press in December. 'We’ve explained to the U.S. government in the past that there are some people living in Cuba to whom Cuba has legitimately granted political asylum.' Both Texas politicians who spoke at the summit said that unlike Cuba, they support trade with China. China is different, Perry said, because it basically practices communism at night and capitalism in day time. Cruz, who spoke after Perry, said that 'with China you can make direct investment.' 'You can directly trade with the people,' which you can't do in Cuba, where workers paid just eight cents of every dollar, Cruz said.","Bruce Rastetter, a major player in the renewable energy sector, asked them if they support the opening of trade with communist Cuba .

"Simone Matthews felt a tummy tuck was the 'perfect way' to mark her 50th birthday . With her 50th birthday approaching, Simone Reeves decided that celebrating with a cruise or party wasn’t going to be enough. Neither was she interested in new clothes or a fancy meal. Instead the grandmother from Kent treated herself to a new stomach. The £4,800 operation was, she says, the ultimate 50th birthday treat to herself. Simone, who has three grown-up children, is one of a growing number of women said to be marking their milestone birthdays with surgery. And she says the decision to go under the knife just weeks before her 50th was one of the best she has ever made. Explaining her decision she said: ‘A tummy tuck was something I had thought about but the time never seemed right. ‘Then I was facing a new decade, my circumstances had changed dramatically and it seemed not only the perfect time, but also the perfect way to mark the occasion. ‘It was a lot of money to spend on a birthday treat but I felt I deserved it, and because I had divorced and downsized, for the first time in my life I had the money available. ‘Now thanks to my operation I have entered my fifties looking and feeling better than ever.’ Entering her forties had been a very different experience for Simone, who found she was increasingly conscious of what she calls her ‘jelly belly.’ After giving birth to Ben, now 34, Candice, 28, and Nicholas, 27, by caesarean, she had always been unhappy with the scar. Then aged 41 she underwent a hysterectomy and the additional scarring meant her tummy ‘never recovered.’ She explains: ‘I was left with an apron of saggy skin that I absolutely hated. I knew no amount of exercise would change it. ‘I did my best to hide it in Spanx underwear and always wore shorts over my bikini. I just assumed that at my age it was too late to fix or worth worrying about.' But that changed when in 2001 Simone separated from her husband Peter after 21 years of marriage. She says: ‘Peter was wonderful and had always accepted my body. It was never a problem for him so I tried to not let it be a problem for me. ‘But I never expected or imagined that I would be single again at my time in life and couldn’t even imagine dating again with my stomach as it was.’ Approaching her 50th she decided to take action. She said: ‘We’ve all heard the phrase fabulous at fifty but to be honest I felt anything but.’ So she began researching tummy tucks on line and booked a consultation with Transform: 'I was incredibly nervous but the surgeon put me at ease by explaining in great detail how he would perform the operation. After three children and a hysterectomy Simone's stomach was left sagging and throughout her forties the grandmother became more and more conscious of her 'jelly belly' During her tummy tuck operation surgeons removed 2lb of excess skin leaving it firmer and flatter . ‘He wasn’t at all surprised that I was considering surgery as a birthday gift to myself which made me feel better. In March 2012 Simone underwent the procedure – allowing 12 weeks recovery time ahead of her big day. During the three hour operation surgeons removed more than 2lb of excess skin from her stomach. She explains: ‘ When I came round I felt very sore but despite the bandage I could already feel the difference. It just felt so flat.’ It was six weeks before the dressing was removed.  ‘I was absolutely amazed. There was a thin scar but the apron had gone. I thought my stomach looked wonderful already,' she says. The 50-year-old is delighted with her new look, revealing it to friends and family at her birthday party . Over the following weeks she continued to heal and unveiled her new body to family and friends on the evening of her 50th in a figure hugging black dress. She says: ‘I would never have been able to wear it before. I felt wonderful and it truly was a fabulous day and I think having the surgery helped me face my fifties with confidence I might never have had.’ Shami Thomas a spokesperson for Transform who arranged her surgery said she had noted a high number of patients having surgery to mark a milestone birthday like Simone. 'For many people surgery is a life long wish and they wait until their 21st, 30th, 40th or 50th birthdays to make it a reality,' she says: ‘On average patients spend £4,000 on a procedure, which is a large amount of money so having it done for a birthday can help patients see it as a ‘treat’ when they might not usually consider spending money on themselves. ‘We see a lot of women having surgery for their 50th birthdays, but most always say they wish they had done it sooner.’","Simone Reeves spent £4,800 on a new tummy for her birthday .

"An Ohio man who spent nearly 40 years behind bars for a murder he did not commit will receive  $2million from the state as compensation for his wrongful imprisonment. Ricky Jackson, 59, and his friends Ronnie and Wiley Bridgeman were sentenced to death in 1975 for the murder of a businessman after a 12-year-old boy said he saw them commit the crime. All three men were exonerated in November after the witness, Eddie Vernon, recanted his testimony last year and said he had been pressured and threatened by police to testify. Scroll down for video . Ricky Jackson, 59, will receive $2million from the state of Ohio as compensation after being wrongfully imprisoned for 39 years . Jackson (pictured here holding his first ever cell phone) and his friends Ronnie and Wiley Bridgeman were exonerated in November for the 1975 murder of Cleveland businessman Harry Franks . Jackson, who is the longest-serving wrongfully convicted prisoner, was awarded $1million on Thursday as a down payment, according to Cleveland.com. The figure is computed from the state's base rate for wrongful conviction compensation, which stands at $40,330 per year in jail. The number is then adjusted for inflation. In addition to the tax-free $2million award, Jackson will also receive an undetermined sum of money to account for the wages he lost while in prison, according to his attorney Michele Berry. Berry said she believes the amount, which is decided by an expert, will be substantial as Jackson has shown himself to be an 'incredibly talented and wise person' since his release. 'The career path he could have taken will be worked out by the expert,' she told Cleveland.com. 'He could have gone in any number of directions.' Jackson (pictured left in his original mugshot and right in February) is the longest-serving wrongfully convicted prisoner. His award was computed from the state's base rate for wrongful conviction compensation . Jackson (pictured here walking out of jail) called the $2million compensation 'fantastic' and said it was 'going to mean so much' The Bridgeman brothers are due to receive their initial checks soon as well according to Berry, who said their case was a couple of weeks behind with the state's Court of Claims. Jackson's payout is significantly smaller compared to recent wrongful conviction compensation awards. Just yesterday an Illinois man who spent nearly 20 years in jail after being wrongly imprisoned for rape and murder received a $20million settlement, setting a new national record. He received about a million dollars for each year spent behind bars. Jackson, in comparison, received about $51,000. And in January a Connecticut man who spent 21 years in jail for a rape and murder he did not commit received $6million in compensation after DNA tests proved his innocence. But Jackson was rendered speechless and thankful when he heard about the $2million compensation, calling it 'fantastic'. 'This is going to mean so much,' he told Cleveland.com . And no matter the amount of money, Jackson and the Bridgeman brothers all have 'scars that we are never going to be able to recover from,' he recently told Fusion. But no matter the amount of money, Jackson (pictured here picking up his dry cleaning in February) said he and the Bridgeman brothers all have 'scars that we are never going to be able to recover from' The three men were exonerated after original witness Eddie Vernon recanted his testimony last year and said he had been pressured and threatened by police to testify when he was 12 years old . 'I think the opportunity for justice to be served was lost the day we went to court,' said Jackson, who said he will never forget the fact that he doesn't have kids. But Jackson said he did not feel bitter or spiteful. 'That's something that happened. Everyone is going through something in their life. This was our something.' 'Whatever we lost is gone... we can't ever recapture it.' Jackson was only 18 when he was convicted of the May 19, 1975, murder of Cleveland businessman Harry Franks, who was attacked, robbed and shot to death. The Bridgeman brothers and Jackson had walked passed the crime scene and inquired what had happened. They became the prime suspects not long after. The Bridgeman brothers are due to receive their initial checks soon, as their case is a couple of weeks behind Jackson's with the state's Court of Claims . The aftermath of the murder for which the Bridgeman brothers and Jackson were convicted in 1975 . The prosecution's case was based on the testimony of 12-year-old Eddie Vernon, who said he saw the murder. There was no physical evidence linking the three to the crime scene. All three men were given the death penalty, sentences that were commuted to life in prison after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment in 1978. Their cases were first re-evaluated after a 2011 article in the Cleveland Scene magazine highlighted Vernon's unreliable testimony. In the initial court hearings, Vernon said he was on a bus with other schoolchildren when he heard gunshots. Other children on the bus have said Vernon would not have been able to see anything from his seat, which he has since admitted was true. Jackson said he holds no animosity toward Vernon. 'It took a lot of courage to do what he did,' he said. 'He's been carrying a burden around for 39 years, like we have.' 'But in the end, he came through, and I'm grateful for that.'","Ricky Jackson, 59, and his friends Ronnie and Wiley Bridgeman were all exonerated in November for the 1975 murder of Harry Franks .
Jackson's award is based on Ohio's base rate for wrongful conviction compensation, which is $40,330 per year spent in jail .
He will also receive an undetermined sum of money to account for the wages he lost while in prison .
Bridgeman brothers will receive their initial checks in a couple of weeks ."
"A single mum is desperately saving every cent to fly to the U.S. for her three-year-old daughter's ear to be reconstructed so she doesn't get bullied about the birth defect when she starts school. You would never know to meet Autumn Byas, from Bass Hill in southwest Sydney, that she was born with a congenital deformity because her confidence and lust for life is oozing out of the energetic little girl. The adorable little girl may only be able to hear from her left ear but that doesn't doesn't stop her great love for music and dancing. But her mother, Tanya Byas, has been on a mission since her daughter was born with microtia to get to California for Autumn to have an operation because she can't have surgery in Australia until she is 10 years old - in seven years' time. Autumn Byas, from Bass Hill in southwest Sydney, was born without a right ear due to a congenital deformity . Her mother, Tanya Byas (right), has been on a mission to get to California for her daughter to have an operation because Autumn can not have surgery in Australia for another seven years until she is 10-years-old . Autumn loves music despite being deaf in her right ear . The condition, that affects about one baby in every 8,000-10,000 births, is treated differently in Australia with medical professionals using rib cartilage from the 10 year-old patient to recreate the ear, which takes six months to recreate. However in America, the surgical technique uses a synthetic framework and the body’s own tissue to create an ear during the eight-hour operation, meaing there are no age restrictions. 'They will use her good ear as a template and make it out of synthetic material but make it a bit bigger because ears only grow a little bit so when she grows up they will be even and they use her membrane skin to cover it,' Tanya explained. Autumn will also need a jaw reconstruction when she is about 12 or 13 years old. After scrimping, saving and fundraising, Tanya has booked her daughter in for the operation on June 2 but she is $20,000 short with just 10 weeks to go. Although Autumn is deaf in her right ear, she speaks well and has no other health complications but her mother's worst fear is that she will be tormented when she starts school in two year's time for looking different. You would never know to meet Autumn that she was born with a congenital deformity because her confidence and lust for life is oozing out of the energetic little girl - pictured at her dance class . 'With school and bullying the way it is at the moment - life is hard enough,' Tanya Byas said. 'She is so outgoing and free-spirited - it doesn't hold her back - she just goes about everyday life and I don't want that to change.' Paul Stanley from KISS was born with the same condition and was teased at school, and although it didn't stop the guitarist from succeeding in one of the most famous rock bands in the world, he still went ahead and had the reconstructive surgery in 1982 - almost a decade after the band formed. 'I read that he got called things like a ""one-eared freak"" when he was at school and I don't want Autumn to get called that,' she said. 'As much as I can teach her to be strong - it would still be tough.' Tanya's fear is that her daughter will be bullied when she starts school in another two years . A fundraiser is being held on Saturday to help with the last $20,000 needed for the $50,000 surgery . Life has been tough for Tanya, 39, who works full time as a sales coordinator, while her parents look after Autumn and has done without so she can put as much as she can towards her daughter's surgery. When Autumn was one-year-old, Tanya held a fundraiser dinner which raised $17,000 and she has managed to save $13,000 of her own money. She has also managed to pay for airfares and accommodation for the month-long trip. 'It's been hard because we can't do everyday things that people take for granted like going out to lunch or taking a trip,' she said. 'We went to the zoo last month but only because our friends had a free family pass.' But, Autumn still gets to do fun activities like any other kid such as swimming and dancing lessons which she relishes. The condition, Microtia, affects about one baby in every 8,000-10,000 births . With still $20,000 to go, Tanya is holding another fundraiser dinner this Saturday in the hope to raise the last of the funds for the surgery. 'I haven't even thought about what I will do if we don't raise the funds - I will have to get it from somewhere even if I get out a loan I guess,' she said. 'It will change Autumn's life immensely - it will give her a good start in life because no one will ever know.' 'She's such a performer so this will help her if she chooses that path in life.'

"One of the biggest concerns for owners of electric cars is that their battery could run out at any moment, leaving them stranded with no recharging station nearby. So-called 'range anxiety' is a fear that has apparently plagued some owners of Tesla’s Model S vehicle, but now CEO Elon Musk has revealed he has a solution. In a tweet he said he would reveal a way to tackle the issue at a conference on Thursday, and while no further details are known, it seems the smart money may be on either navigation software that shows the best route to a charging station or an update that boosts the car's battery power. California-based Tesla is to announce a software update on Friday. Elon Musk revealed it would be for the 'entire Model S fleet' in a tweet. This suggests it may be a trick to boost the battery power of the car (Model S pictured in a promotional shot). Others have suggested it could be new turn by turn navigation software . In the Tweet Musk said: ‘Tesla press conf at 9am [Pacific Time, 4pm GMT] on Thurs. ‘About to end range anxiety … via OTA software update. ‘Affects entire Model S fleet.’ Running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past. Earlier this month Ford unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining, it bases its predictions on your unique driving style. The MyFord Mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house. The app was announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and currently works with a selection of Ford’s electric and hybrid cars. That Musk says this is a software update seemingly rules out one theory, namely more of Tesla’s ‘supercharger’ stations being added. However, the fact that it affects the entire Model S fleet may also pour cold water on the ‘turn by turn navigation’ theory. This is because not every car has the ability to have such a feature, so unless Musk is planning to upgrade those that are not with new hardware, this may seem unlikely. Several outlets have been reporting that the answer may lie in some trickery with the car’s software that can boost the battery power. In a survey for Consumer Reports in 2012, 77 per cent of respondents said limited range was their biggest concern with electric cars. The official range of the Model S at the moment is up to 310 miles (500km), which is apparently not enough to quell range anxiety for some drivers. That Musk says in his tweet (shown) this is a software update seemingly rules out one theory, namely more of Tesla’s ‘supercharger’ stations being added. However, the fact that it affects the entire Model S fleet may also pour cold water on the ‘turn by turn navigation’ theory - as not all the cars have this ability . Only certain models of Tesla's Model S car have the ability to charge their car quickly at the company's supercharger stations, which Tesla lets owners of the Model S use for free. However, the stations are quite few and far between, especially in the UK, at the moment . CNN noted that, last year, Tesla upgraded its Tesla Roadster electric car, increasing its range from 245 to 400 miles (395 to 645km) on a single charge. This was via a lithium battery pack upgrade and, at the time, Musk tellingly tweeted: ‘Should mention that a battery pack upgrade is not coming soon for the Model S, but it obviously *will* happen long-term.’ Musk has since deleted that tweet, though - perhaps in anticipation of this latest announcement. ‘Musk said that all Model S cars will get the update - if so, that points to battery optimisations, a power-saving mode or smarter navigation,' added Engadget. Software updates to the Model S aren’t unprecedented, either; in January, an update increased the speed of the top-of-the-line P85D via use of ‘insane mode’ - enabling the car to go 0 to 60mph (97km/h) in 3.2 seconds, compared to the usual 5.9 seconds. But aside from speculation, there isn’t much that can be done except wait to see what exactly Musk will reveal on Friday.

"Trendy winter coat manufacturer Canada Goose is being accused of being cruel to animals and covering up the truth about it, Daily Mail Online can disclose. The hugely successful maker of fur-lined coats is the subject of legal action claiming that it has deliberately deceived consumers, exploited animal welfare concerns with disingenuous marketing and concealed the reality of chilling cruelty and animal suffering on which their multi-million dollar business is built. The shocking allegations are made against the manufacturer in a legal complaint filed against the company last week in Canada. The complaint has been filed by Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund and calls for independent law enforcement agency the Competition Bureau of Canada to 'investigate Canada Goose for its multiple intentional misrepresentations.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fashion forward: Sports Illustrated model Erin Heatherton is one of the many celebrities who have helped make Canada Goose the must-have winter brand . Caught: Campaigners claim coyotes trapped and skinned for their fur to trim the hoods of Canada Goose coats can be in pain for days. It is unclear whether these images are from Canada Goose trappers but the firm does use the same leg holds . Ugly: Exhausted, alone and all out of fight, this Coyote awaits its inevitable fate having been caught in a trap by its right hind leg . Fan following: Krysten Ritter models one of the coats with coyote fur-lined hoods. The brand is diversifying into other apparel too, such as the down jacket worn by Hugh Jackman (right) Endorsed: The company is marketed by British celebrity Ben Fogle, who presents Ben Fogle's Animal Clinic and has spoken out on other animal cruelty issues including the killing of rhinos and the killing of zoo animals . Canada Goose has become one of the most recognizable brands when it comes to winter jacket, coats and parkas. They have made America their new frontier, forging into the US clothing market with worldwide sales topping $176 million last year - up 4,000 per cent in a decade. In November last year it opened its own store in West Chelsea, one of New York's most prestigious shopping areas, and it also sells at high-end stores such as Barney's, Bergdorf Goodman,, Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus.. Earlier this year it opened a new factory in Toronto to cope with soaring demand. Celebrities are regularly seen wearing the trademark coyote fur-trimmed, down jackets and the brand has established itself as the go-to label for the well-known and the well-heeled braving the frigid conditions that continue to bite. Last year's Sports Illustrated cover featured Kate Upton wearing a Canada Goose jacket and little else. Other celebrities seen wearing the brand have included Hugh Jackman, the Wolverine star, and Sports Illustrated model Erin Heatherton. It is endorsed by Ben Fogle, the British animal television show presenter, who has also spoken out against animal cruelty. But according to the legal complaint, seen by Daily Mail Online, consumers are being duped into thinking they are making either an ethical choice or buying the best product when they purchase Canada Goose. In the document Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund has accused the company of, 'engaging in a persistent pattern of using deceptive practices to market its winter jackets by repeatedly misleading consumers with respect to the nature and quality of its jackets which include coyote fur.' The complaint attacks Canada Goose on its claims that the coyote fur used in its jackets is in any way ethically or humanely obtained. Distressed: A coyote is caught in a snare of the same type used by Canada Goose trappers . Snared: Campaigners claim that coyotes caught like this can take days to die . Canada Goose's website claims that the company is 'deeply committed to the preservation of our global environment and the humane treatment of animals.' It goes on, 'We never purchase fur from fur farms, never use fur from endangered animals, and only purchase from certified Canadian trappers.' These trappers are governed by the Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards (AIHTS) and their pelts are purchased by Canada Goose through North American Fur Auctions (NAFA). According to Canada Goose the NAFA 'monitors very closely' the practices of the trappers selling through it. According to Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund it does nothing of the sort. Instead, they claim: 'There is no mechanism within the NAFA to provide any degree of oversight of the trapping practices of the trappers from which NAFA accepts consignment pelts.' NAFA, it states, does not monitor trappers. It is not an oversight body; it is a commercial fur auction house. Nor does the AIHTS bring the guarantee of humane methods explicit in Canada Goose's claims. The AIHTS simply requires Canada to 'phase out' certain types of traps – traps, Animal Justice Canada claims, that are still used by the trappers selling to Canada Goose. What Canada Goose says: The FAQs on the firm's website form part of the animal rights group's case against the successful manufacturer. They say that the trappers are not monitored to be sure that act humanely . Design classic: Canada Goose's women's Trillium Coat in military green . In demand: The company predicts double digit sales growth for the foreseeable future . And so while consumers believe every effort is being made to ensure that the fur they are wearing when they buy a Canada Goose coat has been secured with minimal animal suffering and maximum human oversight, they are, Animal Justice Canada insists, being deceived. Coyotes are caught in leg hold traps that inflict injuries including fractures, severance of tendons and ligaments, severe bleeding, spinal cord injury, organ damage and amputation of limbs. Despite these horrific injuries the animal may survive long enough to be clubbed, suffocated or strangled to death by the trapper.To dispatch an animal swiftly with a bullet would spoil the pelt. Body gripping traps and snares - metal nooses - are also used inflicting similar injury and failing to deliver the swift 'humane' death implied in Canada Goose's marketing material. The Fur Institute of Canada, which promotes the interests of the fur industry, believes a 'humane' death is on that occurs within 300 seconds. According to Animal Justice Canada: '..under laboratory conditions, it takes approximately eight minutes … for a snare to strangle a coyote – three minutes longer than what even the fur industry itself claims to be humane.' As for the company's assertion that they do not use the pelt of endangered species, Animal Justice Canada points out that the traps set for coyotes are indiscriminate in the animals they capture. Marketing: Canada Goose uses Canada's Arctic Circle to highlight the warmth of its jackets . More fans: Jodie Foster (left) keeps warm in a Canada Goose jacket while filming in New York, while Olivia Wilde wears one to run errands in the city . Key among Canada Goose's defense of their use of real fur is their insistence that in, 'the coldest places on Earth…fur is not just the best choice, but the only choice.' Speaking on their website, Danny Reis, the president and CEO of Canada Goose, explains: 'We use coyote fur for a number of reasons. Number one, coyote fur works. It's functional; it provides warmth around the face in a way that no synthetic fabric can. It does that in the coldest environments in earth, and it's important to realize that sometimes urban centers and cities can feel like the coldest places on earth.' We're confident in both why we use fur and how it is sourced, and people should know this is not something we take lightly. Our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products, how it is sourced, and the government-regulated practices of the Canadian fur industry. Like many proud Canadians, we don't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong. We understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that. We also understand that despite the fact that numerous brands also use real fur in their products and do not attempt to explain their position, it is our very openness and transparency around this subject that makes Canada Goose a target for activist groups whose views will never align with ours. We are proud to support an industry practice that supports northern and rural communities in Canada, and of our continued role as an educator on this matter. The narrator then states: 'Coyote fur, unlike fake fur, doesn't hold moisture, retains heat and is biodegradable.' In its legal complaint Animal Justice Canada says: 'There is no scientific proof to support Canada Goose's claim that coyote fur is more protective of the face, in a way that 'no synthetic material' can be.' This is not the first time Canada Goose has fallen foul of animal rights campaigners. Last year Daily Mail Online revealed that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) was calling for the company to stop using coyote fur and to stop supporting the trapping of animals, 'in a way that is inherently cruel.' Speaking to Daily Mail Online then Lindsay Rajt, Director of Campaigns for PETA described the horrific reality of animal trapping. She said: 'The company's reference to AIHTS standards is meaningless and a way of placating and silencing people with valid concerns. 'Leg hold traps are still legal in Canada. Mothers will chew off their limbs in order to get back to their young. The trapped animal might be there for days before the trapper finds them. They are frightened and starving and in pain during that time. And then they're bludgeoned or strangled to death.' Additionally PETA has called for the company to replace its goose down – which is obtained as a by-product of the poultry industry - and opt for 'revolutionary synthetic technology' already used by competitor, North Face. But according to Ms Rajt PETA's repeated attempts to meet with Canada Goose have been stonewalled. Now, Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund, has called for the Competition Bureau to investigate the company for its 'multiple intentional misrepresentations on its website.' And it has urged the body to 'take all appropriate enforcement action to ensure that Canada Goose is accountable' for the 'false and misleading information that it has willfully directed at consumers.' Canada Goose said that it rejected any claims it had misinformed customers but said it could never satisfy activists entirely opposed to fur. A spokesman said: 'Our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products, how it is sourced, and the government-regulated practices of the Canadian fur industry. 'Like many proud Canadians, we don't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong. We understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that.'","Massively successful brand is subject of legal case brought by animal rights activists in Canada over its use of coyote fur .

"A three-year-old girl was allegedly banned from going on children's rides at Blackpool Pleasure Beach because she has Down's syndrome. Emma Patrick, of Loughborough, claims she was told the theme park was 'not for the disabled' as she tried to enjoy a family day out with three-year-old Lucy, who is in a special chair. Mrs Patrick, 33, said the family were told when they arrived that there were only four rides her daughter could go on because she is disabled, but when they attempted to board these they were only allowed on one. Emma Patrick claims she took her three-year-old daughter Lucy (pictured) to Blackpool Pleasure Beach but they were turned away from all but one ride after, she claims, being told the park was not for the disabled . The childminder claims the family were told 'if you can't walk, you can't ride' when they tried to board rides which included the teacups, carousel and Bikini Bottom bus tour. She claims they were refused to ride despite the theme park's brochure saying the bus tour and the Pleasure Beach Express were suitable for disabled people. Mrs Patrick said she booked the tickets for her family online, and was not told it was not suitable for disabled people until they tried to get on the rides. She added: 'They told us that the rides weren't for the disabled and I wasn't allowed to take her on.' 'I could have carried her on with shoes on and they wouldn't have said anything but because we turned up and she was in a chair,  they said no straight away. 'We only tried to get on the baby rides. We didn't try and get on massive rollercoasters. Mrs Patrick claims they were told by Blackpool Pleasure Beach the rides was not suitable for disabled people . Mrs Patrick (top right) had booked a family day out to Blackpool Pleasure Beach with her daughter Lucy (right, front), son Aj (left, front) and her husband Paul last summer but said the trip was ruined . 'I didn't want special treatment, she will do what other children will do, but they took one look at her and wrote her off.' Mrs Patrick and her husband Paul, 30, had travelled from Loughborough with Lucy and their four-year-old son AJ to enjoy a family day out last summer. She said: 'It spoiled the day with people treating her like that because to us she's normal. 'We thought it would be an enjoyable day out and a great place to take children but we felt so discriminated as they even have gates saying ""disabled, enter here."" It's wrong. The family attempted to go on the Convoy Ride but were allegedly denied access to it . 'There was absolutely no reason why Lucy shouldn't have been allowed on.' She claims to have raised her concerns with a manager at Blackpool Pleasure Beach and sent several letters of complaints to management since returning home, which have all been ignored. She added: 'I want to warn other parents in my situation. If this is how they really feel then maybe they should say the Pleasure Beach isn't for disabled people, so people don't turn up and feel discriminated.

"Rings of gas and dust are known to encircle Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Scientists recently discovered a fifth member of this haloed group known as Chariklo, which is one of a class of minor 'centaur' planets. Now astronomers have detected a possible ring system around a second centaur, Chiron, suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought. Scientists have detected a possible Saturn-like ring system (pictured) around a minor, Chiron, suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought . Like their mythological counterparts, centaurs are hybrids, embodying traits of both asteroids and comets. Today, scientists estimate there are more than 44,000 centaurs in the solar system, concentrated mainly in a band between the orbits of Jupiter and Pluto. Chiron, discovered in 1977, was the first planetary body categorised as a centaur, after the mythological Greek creature -- a hybrid of man and beast. To discover the rings, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology observed the dimming of a star as Chiron passed in front of it, briefly blocking the light. By looking at how much and when the light was blocked, scientists say the centaur may possess a circulating disk of debris. 'It's interesting, because Chiron is a centaur - part of that middle section of the solar system, between Jupiter and Pluto, where we originally weren't thinking things would be active, but it's turning out things are quite active,' says Amanda Bosh, a lecturer in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. It follows the discovery of rings around a giant asteroid called Chariklo last year. 'I try to imagine how it would be to stand on the surface of this icy object, small enough that a fast sports car could reach escape velocity and drive off into space, and stare up at a 20 kilometer wide ring system 1,000 times closer than the moon,' said Uffe Gråe Jørgensen of the University of Copenhagen of the Chariklo study. Chiron, discovered in 1977, was the first planetary body categorised as a centaur, after the mythological Greek creature -- a hybrid of man and beast. Like their mythological counterparts, centaurs are hybrids, embodying traits of both asteroids and comets. Today, scientists estimate there are more than 44,000 centaurs in the solar system, concentrated mainly in a band between the orbits of Jupiter and Pluto. While most centaurs are thought to be dormant, scientists have seen glimmers of activity from Chiron. Chiron was discovered in 1977 by Charles Kowal recovery images have been found as far back as 1895, it was the first-known member of a class of objects now known as centaurs, with an orbit between Saturn and Uranus . Starting in the late 1980s, astronomers observed patterns of brightening from the centaur, as well as activity similar to that of a streaking comet. In 2010, MIT started to chart the orbits of Chiron and nearby stars in order to pinpoint exactly when the centaur might pass across a star bright enough to detect. 'There's an aspect of serendipity to these observations,' Professor Bosh says. 'We need a certain amount of luck, waiting for Chiron to pass in front of a star that is bright enough. Chiron itself is small enough that the event is very short; if you blink, you might miss it.' In light of these new observations, the researchers say that Chiron may still possess symmetrical jets of gas and dust. But other interpretations may be equally valid, including the 'intriguing possibility,' Professor Bosh says, of a shell or ring of gas and dust. Pictured are the positions of known outer solar system objects. The centaurs are those objects (in green) that lie generally inwards of the Kuiper belt (in blue) Ruprecht, who is a researcher at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, says it is possible to imagine a scenario in which centaurs may form rings. For example, when a body breaks up, the resulting debris can be captured gravitationally around another body, such as Chiron. Rings can also be leftover material from the formation of Chiron itself. Nevertheless, Bosh says the possibility of a second ringed centaur in the solar system is an enticing one. 'Until Chariklo's rings were found, it was commonly believed that these smaller bodies don't have ring systems,' Bosh says. 'If Chiron has a ring system, it will show it's more common than previously thought.'","Minor planet is known as Chiron and located between Saturn and Uranus .

"Nancy Cameron ‘threatened to go on hunger strike’ unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored as Top Gear host, her father joked yesterday. David Cameron said his 11-year-old daughter was campaigning against the BBC’s decision to suspend the presenter over a ‘fracas’ with a producer. Mr Clarkson is an Oxfordshire neighbour and family friend of the Camerons. Scroll down for video . David Cameron's daughter Nancy, 11, ‘threatened to go on hunger strike’ unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored as Top Gear host . Despite the 'threat', which her parents have joked about, Nancy appeared to be enjoying dinner with her family . The PM told the BBC: ‘Nancy has threatened to go on hunger strike unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored. ‘I’ve told her this is not necessarily a useful intervention. It’s not exactly Gandhi, we had a discussion about this this morning.’ Samantha Cameron chipped in: ‘Nancy’s hunger strike this morning lasted approximately five minutes’. The Prime Minister quipped: ‘It’s between lunch and tea is the way it works.’ During the interview, Mr Cameron and BBC Political Editor James Landale went to a local butcher near his constituency home in Witney, Oxfordshire. They then went back to Mr Cameron’s home where the PM was interviewed while preparing food in his kitchen. Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas' with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (right), prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air . Nancy's siblings Florence (left) and Elwen tuck into a dinner of cold meats and a healthy salad, prepared by Mr Cameron . Mr Cameron was seen visiting a butchers shop in his Witney constituency, and joking about 'juicy thighs' In the shop, Mr Cameron chose some chicken, saying: ‘I like the thighs because they’re very juicy.’ He also denied being the shop’s most famous customer, pointing out ‘Mr Clarkson pops in from time to time doesn’t he?’. Mr Cameron said it was very important to him that his children ‘feel very rooted and grounded’ in Oxfordshire. One of his children, he said, calls 10 Downing Street ‘the pretend home’. The interview appeared to show Mr Cameron’s kitchen contains a red chopping board emblazoned with ‘Calm Down Dear’ The PM was accused of sexism in 2011 after using that slogan, taken from a TV advert, against Labour front bencher Angela Eagle. Mr Cameron has previously said his children would be ‘heartbroken’ if Top Gear was taken off air. When details of the incident emerged, he backed calls for Mr Clarkson to be reinstated. ‘Because he is such a huge talent and he amuses and entertains so many people, including my children, who’d be heartbroken if Top Gear was taken off air, I hope this can be sorted out,’ he said.","Nancy Cameron is campaigning against Clarkson's suspension, PM said .

"They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but this one will be worth a thousand years. Jonathon Keats, a conceptual artist and journalist, plans to capture the world's longest photo exposure, PetaPixel reports. A camera filled with oil paint instead of photographic film will capture the 1,000-year-long exposure of Tempe, Arizona. Keats calls this and similar creations 'deep time cameras.' Exposure: Jonathon Keats (photographed), a conceptual artist and journalist, plans to capture the world's longest photo exposure, a 1,000-year-long exposure of Tempe, Arizona . The camera, with a 24-karat gold plate on its front, will be installed three feet above ground at the Arizona State University Art Museum's sculpture garden trellis after it is unveiled Friday at the museum. The camera will be pointed at the city's skyline, capturing how civilization changes over the next 1,000 years. Over time, the color in the paint will fade where the light enters the camera the brightest, slowly -- very slowly -- creating an image of the Tempe skyline in red and white. The experiment will be finished in spring 3015 and the museum will hold a month-long exhibit when the project is complete -- if everything goes according to plan in the next 1,000 years, of course, Slate reports. 'The first people to see this picture will be children who haven't yet been conceived,' Keats told PetaPixel. 'They're impacted by every choice we make, but they're powerless. If they can't influence our decisions, at least they can bear witness.' Camera: The camera, with a 24-karat gold plate on its front, will be installed three feet above ground at the Arizona State University Art Museum's sculpture garden trellis after it is unveiled Friday at the museum . This experiment will be one Keats won't live to see, neither will his children, nor his children's children, nor his children's children's child- okay, you get the point. But Keats told PetaPixel that he doesn't mind being not being able to attend the exposure's unveiling in 3015. 'I'll be dead,' Keats said. 'But I don't regret it at all. For me, it's much more interesting to be here today, seeing the behavior of people who know they're being watched by the unborn, and also to be watched myself, living vicariously as a future memory of the next millennium.' Keats told Slate that the resulting photos won't be confusing, but will require a bit of interpretation to deconstruct what is recorded in the photo. Skyline: The camera will be pointed at the city's skyline (photographed), capturing how civilization changes over the next 1,000 years . He told PetaPixel that the photograph will not only show Tempe's skyline, but will illustrate how it develops over time. 'For instance, old houses torn down after a couple centuries will show up only faintly, as if they were ghosts haunting the skyscrapers that replace them,' Keats said. Keats told Slate that he can't guarantee that the picture will be perfect or even perceptible. In fact, he said, it may take multiple attempts to get the exposure just right -- that could take thousands of years. But he said he does not see that as a fault. 'A total failure photographically could still be a success conceptually,' he said. Keats said he chose Tempe because it is representative of urban expansion throughout the United States. He said he plans to install a second camera in Massachusetts.","Jonathon Keats plans to capture the world’s slowest photograph, a 1,000-year-long exposure of the city of Tempe, Arizona .

"These remarkable scans clearly reveal how smoking during pregnancy harms an unborn baby's development. New ultrasound images show how babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy touch their mouths and faces much more than babies of non-smoking mothers. Foetuses normally touch their mouths and faces much less the older and more developed they are. Experts said the scans show how smoking during pregnancy can mean the development of the baby's central nervous system is delayed. Doctors have long urged pregnant women to give up cigarettes because they heighten the risk of premature birth, respiratory problems and even cot death. Now researchers believe they can show the effects of smoking on babies in the womb - and use the images to encourage mothers who are struggling to give up. Scroll down for video . Image shows the 4-D ultrasound scan of two foetuses at 32 weeks gestation, one whose mother was a smoker (top) and the other carried by a non-smoker (bottom). The foetus carried by the smoker touches its face and mouth much more, indicating its development is delayed . As part of the study, Dr Nadja Reissland, of Durham University, used 4-D ultrasound scan images to record thousands of tiny movements in the womb. She monitored 20 mothers attending the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, four of whom smoked an average of 14 cigarettes a day. After studying their scans at 24, 28, 32 and 36 weeks, she detected that foetuses whose mothers smoked continued to show significantly higher rates of mouth movement and self-touching than those carried by non-smokers. Foetuses usually move their mouths and touch themselves less as they gain more control the closer they get to birth, she explained. The pilot study, which Dr Reissland hopes to expand with a bigger sample, found babies carried by smoking mothers may have delayed development of the central nervous system. Dr Reissland said: 'A larger study is needed to confirm these results and to investigate specific effects, including the interaction of maternal stress and smoking.' She believed that videos of the difference in pre-birth development could help mothers give up smoking. Dr Nadja Reissland, of Durham University,  said the ultrasound scans show unborn babies of mothers who smoke may have delayed development of their central nervous systems . But she was against demonising mothers and called for more support for them to give up. Currently, 12 per cent of pregnant women in the UK smoke but the rate is over 20 per cent in certain areas in the North East. All the babies in her study were born healthy, and were of normal size and weight. Dr Reissland, who has an expertise in studying foetal development, thanked the mothers who took part in her study, especially those who smoked. 'I'm really grateful, they did a good thing,' she said. 'These are special people and they overcame the stigma to help others.' Co-author Professor Brian Francis, of Lancaster University, added: 'Technology means we can now see what was previously hidden, revealing how smoking affects the development of the foetus in ways we did not realise. 'This is yet further evidence of the negative effects of smoking in pregnancy.' The research was published in the journal Acta Paediatrica.","Scans reveal babies of mothers who smoke touch their mouths and faces much more than babies of non-smokers .

"This is the shocking moment a tourist was knocked unconscious with a single blow to the head while fighting with a taxi driver in Thailand. Eyewitnesses said the holidaymaker, from South Korea, rowed with the motorcycle driver after he allegedly refused to pay his bill at a bar and cab fare in the beach resort of Pattaya. The confrontation, which was captured on camera by at a customer at a bar, escalated when the tourist threatened to hit the driver with his crash helmet on the pavement outside the business. A South Korean tourist, left, was knocked unconscious by a taxi driver after he allegedly refused to pay . A 40-second clip posted on YouTube by Spring News shows the tourist raising his crash helmet and lunging towards the driver, who raises his arm to protect himself. The tourist stops and casually tosses the crash helmet over the driver’s head as music blares in the background and customers shout at them. As they square off the tourist kicks at the driver, whose cocks his right fist as the holidaymaker backs off. After trading kicks the tourist looks down at the driver’s leg and is knocked flat on his back by a single punch to the chin. Customers inside the bar and people on the street cheered and applauded, and car horns sounded the moment the tourist was knocked out. Eyewitnesses said the tourist skipped out on a £30 bar tab but returned and got into a fight with the driver . Jongrak Thiengmak, an employee at Ann’s Bar, where the fight occurred Wednesday night, claimed the tourist got drunk and refused to pay his bill. He told Thaivisa News that the man left the bar, owing 1,500 baht (£30), and returned an hour later and fought with the taxi driver over an unpaid fare of 200 baht (£4). After he was punched the tourist, who suffered a bloodied nose and lost a tooth, was unconscious for three minutes, Thaivisa News reported. Jongrak told the news website that bar employees used ice to stop the bleeding and escorted the tourist to his hotel. The man returned to the bar last night and paid his bill to avoid criminal charges. Video courtesy of Spring News .","Fight occurred outside a bar in the beach resort of Pattaya, Thailand .

"A University of South Carolina fraternity was placed on suspension Wednesday after the 'suspicious death' of an 18-year-old member at a house where the brothers lived. The identity of the deceased Pi Kappa Alpha (aka PIKE) member has not yet been released, but he was reportedly found unconscious at the frat's house on Lee Street around 10:30am. Neighbors told Fox Carolina that the house threw a party the night before and on Wednesday there was still a keg and St Patrick's Day decorations outside the home. Scroll down for video . Suspended: The Pi Kappa Alpha house at the University of South Carolina has been suspended, after a brother was found dead in a house Wednesday morning . Rager? Neighbors said the house had a party the night before, on St Patrick's Day. On Wednesday, several stray cups and a keg were seen on the porch, as well as clover decorations . 'I would say there are three houses there, and I don't know who exactly lives in them, but there's always a frequency of parties going on,' neighbor Mehrdad Vejdani said. 'At times, there can be a hundred people in that place. Live band in the backyard, which is fine. I mean, some noise, but it doesn't bother us too much.' While the Columbia Police Department and Richland County Coroner's Office labeled the death as 'suspicious,' authorities said there was no signs of foul play or trauma on the body. An autopsy and toxicology test are scheduled for Thursday. Responding the tragic incident, PIKE's national office released a statement saying the USC chapter had been placed on leave pending the investigation. 'The fraternity’s thoughts and prayers are with the family of this young man and the brothers of Xi Chapter,' the statement read. 'There are a lot of rumors out there about the circumstances surrounding the death but at this point the matter remains under investigation,' University of South Carolina spokesman Wes Hickman said. 'While we await further information we are focused on helping our community grieve and heal.' This is just the second incident at a PIKE house this week. Last Friday, the University of Connecticut chapter lost recognition for hazing members, providing alcohol to underage students and harassing women. PIKE was founded in 1868 at the University of Virginia and has now grown to include some 220 groups across the U.S. and Canada. The house has been plagued by controversy before. In November 2012, a 19-year-old student at Northern Illinois University died after a night of heavy drinking. Five frat members were charged with felonies for hazing and the chapter was suspended indefinitely. That same year, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville chapter was suspended indefinitely when a 20-year-old member was hospitalized for reportedly ingesting wine through his anus.","The Pi Kappa Alpha brother has not yet been identified; autopsy scheduled for Thursday .

"It is known to prevent against heart disease and is hailed as the secret to a long, healthy life. Now, researchers have found the Mediterranean diet can help people with depression, too. A study found people who followed the diet were happier, less stressed and reported an improved quality of life compared to those who ate fewer Mediterranean foods. The researchers said omega-3 in particular, a fatty acid found in fish, plays a vital role in maintaining and improving mental health and stability. The diet consists of plant-based foods such as vegetables, legumes, fruit, nuts, seeds and olives, extra virgin olive oil, fish, with moderate red wine intake. It also involves a low consumption of processed food, processed carbohydrates, sweets and chocolate and red meat. Omega-3, a fatty acid found in fish, plays a vital role in maintaining and improving mental health and stability . As part of the study, Australian researchers recruited a total of 82 adults with depression, aged between 18 -65. They assessed their mental health and quality of life using two official scales: the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). They then assessed how strongly they followed the Mediterranean diet through a 14-item questionnaire. The study’s lead author, Dr Natalie Parletta, of the University of South Australia, said there was a strong link between the Mediterranean diet and lower scores for mental illness. This was despite the fact it was a study of people with depression, who tended to have poor diets in the first place. She told MailOnline: ‘What we found is that poor diet is predicting the onset of depression. ‘It’s not that people are getting depressed and then eating badly, eating badly causes the depression in the first place. ‘We recruited people who had depression already. We screened out people who had good diet. ‘So it was amazing that there was a significant correlation the Mediterranean diet and mental illness, even for people with low scores on the consumption of wholefoods.’ She said research shows there is an overlap between heart disease and depression, and scientists have begun to think there might be common underlying mechanisms. Inflammation and insulin resistance which occurs in the body and causes heart disease could also cause depression in the brain, she said. ‘The brain is an organ like any other,’ she explained. ‘It has higher needs than other organs, from bloodflow to delivering oxygen, glucose and nutrients. ‘A lack of bloodflow and inflammation can affect the brain as much as any other organ. A Mediterranean diet is high in nutrients such as omega-3, vitamin B, vitamin D, healthy fats and anti-oxidants, she said, which are all important for keeping the brain functioning well and staving off mental illness. Sometimes depression is 'biological', the researchers said. It can be a deficiency in some of the nutrients that keep the brain functioning properly . There has been a lot of research on how omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, play a vital role in maintaining or improving mental health and stability. Deficiency in these nutrients can impair the brain’s functioning and lead to depression, she added. She said: ‘There are many challenges in life, and factors that lead to depression. But by developing a strong foundation for our brain to function well through providing it with key nutrients, we’re better able to deal with life’s challenges. ‘And it’s not just the nutrients - the fibre is also beneficial. Highly fibrous foods means you’re not getting mood swings through sugar. She continued: ‘Sometimes depression is biological. It could be a wheat allergy, it’s rarely known that an intolerance can lead to depression and even bipolar. ‘Depending on the person, a deficiency could be the key link to what is causing mental illness.’ On the other hand, a poor diet can lead to depression, stress and anxiety, she said. She explained hat highly processed foods, red meat and confectionary increase our blood glucose levels, leading to sensitivity to insulin – the hormone that controls how much sugar is in our blood – and obesity. This inflammation affects the brain, causing mental illness. When the body is stressed or anxious, it goes into fight or flight mode which shuts down digestion and healing. Eating Vegetables, fruits and legumes ensures it has the nutrients it needs to function properly . When a person is stressed and anxious, they go into a ‘fight or flight’ mode in which stress hormones are released, making the body more aroused and responsive, shifting blood from the skin to the muscles, and raising heart rate. This shuts down digestion and healing. ‘If you’re in a state of stress, your body isn’t absorbing as many nutrients as possible, so the need for nutrients is increased,' Dr Parletta said. 'You’ll be in a better state to replenish the nutrients if you’re eating a nutrient-rich Mediterranean diet. 'So no stress is best of all, but a Mediterranean diet with stress is better than a poor diet with stress.' The results indicate that dietary intervention may improve mental health and so the researchers are seeking more volunteers to further examine the ability of diet combined with fish oil supplementation to improve mental health. They are now looking for volunteers aged 18-65 in Adelaide who have depression, to investigate this further.","People who adhered more strongly to Mediterranean diet were happier .
'Eating badly causes the depression in the first place,' researchers say .
Diet consists of vegetables, seeds, fruits, nuts, seeds and olive oil .

"Marijuana is much stronger than it was three decades ago, experts have warned. Scientists found cannabis smoked today has tripled in strength since the 1980s. Marijuana now contains increasingly high concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound which gives the 'high'. But concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD), a lesser known compound that is being investigated for its medical proponents, but does not create a 'high', has gone down. Samples also contained contaminants including bacteria, fungi, butane and heavy metals, scientists found. Scroll down for video . Super strong: Marijuana sold on the market today has tripled in strength since the 1980s, scientists  warn . The research was carried out by Dr Andy LaFrate, the president and director of research of Charas Scientific, a lab in Colorado, US, which carries out potency testing on marijuana samples on the market today. Presenting his preliminary findings at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), he found that marijuana has tripled in strength in the last 30 years. He said: 'We've seen a big increase in marijuana potency compared to where it was 20 or 30 years ago. 'I would say the average potency of marijuana has probably increased by a factor of three.' The average potencies of the samples he analysed was 20 per cent THC, but he saw  values close to 30 per cent, which he described as'huge'. He explained that 30 years ago, THC levels in marijuana were well below 10 per cent. The THC content of cannabis has tripled in some strains because producers have been cross-breeding them over the years as users demand stronger drugs, he said. He added that an unexpected consequence of the breeding was that many of the samples his lab tested contained little to no CBD. Researchers are currently investigating CBD as a treatment for schizophrenia, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as anxiety and depression. But unlike THC, CBD doesn't get provide the same 'high', which is why it could be considered in treatments for children. Extra potent: Concentrations of marijuana's active ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (pictured) have increased from less than 10 per cent in samples from the 1980s to up to 30 per cent in samples tested today . Dr LaFrate said he was shocked by the levels of contaminants in samples of marijuana producers had voluntarily sent to the lab for testing. He said: 'One thing that's been surprising is the level of microbial contamination in marijuana.' 'Many of the samples were covered in fungi or bacterial contaminants. 'Others had Butane, which are used to create marijuana extracts, and others had heavy metals.' This isn't necessarily a cause for alarm, but it could spark discussions on what are safe levels of contaminants. Dr LaFrate said: 'It's a natural product. There's going to be microbial growth on it no matter what you do. 'So the questions become: What's a safe threshold? And which contaminants do we need to be concerned about?'","Cannabis has tripled in strength in the last three decades, scientists warn .

"A teenager who survived the brutal axe murders of his parents and brother stands to inherit a share of at least ten million pounds from their deaths, it was reported today. Henri van Breda suffered what police sources reportedly said was ‘self-inflicted’ wounds following the bloodbath at his family home in Stellenbosch - 50 kilometres east of Cape Town. His sister Marli, 16, was the only other survivor of the horrific attack, but is still in no fit state to talk about the slaughter which left her with a slashed jugular vein and severe head injuries. Scroll down for video . Henri van Breda (back left) and his sister Marli , 16, (front left) stand to inherit a slice of their parents' reported £10million fortune after their father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed in an axe attack in their home that left Marli with severe head and throat injuries . According to South Africa’s Sunday Times newspaper, both surviving children have lawyers representing them in the division of their parents’ fortune. Henri, who has been cared for by relatives since the attack, has a legal team led by Pieter Botha, who successfully fought to have his client Shrien Dewani cleared of the murder of his new bride, Anni. A lawyer has also been appointed for Marli, who is under police guard while she recovers at an exclusive rehabilitation unit. The attack, which took place in the early hours of the morning in the family’s upstairs bedrooms seven weeks ago, claimed the lives of the children’s mother Teresa, 54, father Martin, 55, and older brother Rudi, 22 . Forensic evidence gathered at the scene, including the murder weapon, bloodied footprints and handprints is already with state prosecutors who believe they have sufficient material to make an arrest, even without Marli’s eye witness account. Mr van Breda was a successful businessman who had enterprises in South Africa and Australia, where the family lived in Perth for seven years before returning to Cape Town last year. The van Breda family lived on the estate of the De Zalze Golf Club (pictured) about 50km east of Cape Town . The home where the attack took place, on De Zalze secure golf estate in the winelands outside Cape Town, is among the assets to be sold off. Neighbours expressed shock that a killer unknown to the family could have entered and left the highly-guarded compound undetected by security guards and cameras. Physics student Henri, who called for help more than three hours after the brutal attack, claimed a man wielding an axe had set upon his loved ones while he was in a bathroom. When he emerged from the bathroom he killer hurled the murder weapon at him and knocked him unconscious. A recording of the call was leaked to the media. In it, Henri is heard to giggle as he is quizzed by the operator about the details of the attack. Henri van Breda, 20, was left with minor injuries following the slaying of his parents and older brother . The attackers left Marli (pictured) with a cut throat and 'severe' head injuries on the balcony of her home . When asked if his family were unconscious, he replied, ‘yes and bleeding from the head’ before what sounds like a quiet laugh can be heard. According to South Africa’s YOU magazine, Henri has returned once to the scene of the killing, to collect some clothes and other belongings. However, he has not been allowed to see his sister since the incident, and she has been informed that her parents and brother Rudi are dead. A teenager living in a shack near the family’s home also told the Sunday Times how he had been paid by Henri as a drug runner – and regularly delivered crystal meth to him, or ‘tik’ as it is known in South Africa. According to some reports, Henri had spent some time in an exclusive rehabilitation clinic, and had had his allowance cut by his parents shortly before the murders. A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family', they had previously lived in Perth . Mrs van Breda’s brother, Andre du Toit is the guardian to both surviving children and Henri is being cared for by him and his wife at their home. A spokesman for the family, Ben Rootman, confirmed that, ‘a joint Will drawn up in South Africa determines that a trust and the children born from the marriage inherit the South African estate. The family also had assets in Australia and these have been left to the South African families and to the trustees of the trust. These assets have not yet been fully determined.’ According to South African law, the process of settling an estate is halted if an heir is arrested on a charge of murder and will only resume after court proceedings have been finalized. An heir is disqualified from inheriting if found guilty of murder.","Henri van Breda suffered 'self inflicted wounds' following attack on family .

"An understaffed hospital trust has hired 200 nurses from the Philippines having failed to recruit any from the UK. Gloucestershire Hospitals - which serves 612,000 patients – is also aiming to appoint dozens of nurses from Spain, Portugal and India over the coming months. The trust, comprising the Gloucestershire Royal and Cheltenham General Hospitals, is one of a growing number using overseas nurses to plug severe staffing shortages. Figures show that three quarters of hospitals are recruiting nurses from abroad and nearly 5,700 were hired in the last 12 months. Experts say that as many as one in 20 nursing posts in the NHS is currently vacant which is equivalent to 20,000 nurses. Gloucestershire Hospitals - which serves 612,000 patients – and comprises the Gloucestershire Royal and Cheltenham General Hospitals, has recruited 200 nurses from the Philippines . The shortfall has come about because the number of training places was cut by the Government in 2010 meaning there are fewer ‘home grown’ nurses coming up through the system. In addition, hospitals are now under pressure to hire more nurses than ever before to care for the rising numbers of elderly patients who are very dependent. Nevertheless it is highly unusual for managers to recruit such a large batch of overseas nurses from one country in such a short space of time. The trust has been under severe pressure over the last few months and has been struggling to cope with the high volumes of patients coming into its two A&E units. It was one of about 15 NHS trusts to declare a major incident back in January due to overcrowding and at one ward in Cheltenham hospital, there were just two nurses looking after 30 patients. And so far this year it has missed the A&E target for treating patients in four hours seven out of eight weeks and cancelled 436 non-urgent operations to free-up bed space. The trust said the nurses had been appointed in December following a recruitment fair held in the Philippines, in the Far East, by a private recruitment agency. It said the nurses had all undergone rigorous checks on their skills and ability to speak English. But experts say the increasing reliance on foreign nurses is only a short-term fix as many end up returning to their home countries after a few years. There are also concerns that their English is not good enough to cope on busy wards and that they lack an understanding of how the NHS works. Gloucestershire Hospitals was one of about 15 NHS trusts to declare a major incident back in January due to overcrowding and at one ward in Cheltenham hospital, there were just two nurses looking after 30 patients . Councillor David Drew, Labour Parliamentary candidate for Stroud, Gloucestershire and a member of the Gloucestershire health scrutiny overview committee said: ‘I suppose we can recruit from abroad but that is not sustainable in the long term.’ Dr Frank Harsent, chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, says bringing in the Filipino nurses would relieve the strain on wards. He added: ‘We have also seen an increase in the number of nurses being trained at our hospitals as part of their degree, but there is a three-year time lapse.’ Last month an investigation found that one in six overseas nurses are quitting within two years of arriving in the UK. Freedom of Information requests by Nursing Times also showed that at one hospital, Aintree, in Liverpool, all of the 14 nurses hired from Spain last year have already left. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said at the time: 'The last couple of years have seen increasingly desperate attempts to plug the gap with more nurses from overseas, who have undoubtedly made a huge contribution and kept the NHS afloat. 'Some of the sums spent on recruiting staff have been ludicrous and the fact that Trusts are not able to keep hold of them is a natural result of years of lackadaisical workforce planning in the NHS.'","Gloucestershire Hospitals has hired 200 nurses from the Philippines .

"En famille: Sarah and her children in France . Breathless, but with an unmistakeable swagger, our three children burst through the door of our mobile home and regale us with their latest news. 'We've changed our minds about croissants and have got pain au chocolat instead,' announces Freddie, eight, swinging a bag full of freshly baked French pastries. Behind him, his twin siblings Bobby and Loulou, six, brandish a newspaper and my change, respectively, which they thrust onto the table like warriors returning from battle. We are halfway through a week-long break at Les Castels holiday park in Domaine De La Paille Basse, near Souillac, in the Lot region, and it is the fourth time our children have completed this morning ritual. It takes them approximately nine minutes to make the round trip to the campsite shop (they could do it in half the time if they weren't stopping to examine every rock and tree along the way) and the sojourn has lost none of its thrill. At home in London, such independence is the stuff of their dreams. Les Castels fits our bill completely: pool, play-park, shop, takeaway, English-speaking kids' club, games room, nightly entertainment. Domaine De La Paille Basse has the added aesthetic attraction of being built round an original medieval village restored by the grandparents of the current owners nearly 40 years ago. Accommodation is a mixture of tents, touring pitches and mobile homes. We opt for a three-bedroom mobile home perched on a small hill surrounded by woodland, with an unbroken view of the valley below. Inside, the sleek lines and cool grey colours have more in common with a boutique hotel. Bobby and LouLou share one twin-bedded room, Freddie (the earliest riser) has the other one. A Lot of reasons to be cheerful: Villeneuve-sur-Lot is one of the many pretty towns which dot the region . My husband and I have the double room, which boasts its own en-suite shower room, and we quickly settle into a routine that begins with the croissant run, breakfast on the terrace and two hours of 'mini-club' for children aged four to 12. Lunch is another lazy affair on the terrace with more fresh bread from the shop, cheeses, meat and fruits from the stadium-sized Leclerc supermarket at Souillac, before an afternoon of hurtling down pool slides and playing tennis. In the evenings, we light the barbecue provided before decamping en masse to the bar for the evening entertainment. We do manage to drag the children off site a couple of times. My favourite trip is the 40-minute drive to the Christian pilgrimage site of Rocamadour, which, like something from a children's fairy tale, clings to the cliffs above a gorge. Our children would say the eight-mile journey aboard the steam train at Martel, which handily includes an ice-cream stop and costs a family-friendly £7.50) for adults and £4 per child. The lesson from our holiday is that keeping it simple is the best rule because, for our children, the croissant runs arguably were the highlight of the day. Ferries from Portsmouth to Caen can be booked at aferry.co.uk. Fares with Brittany Ferries (0871 244 07446, brittany-ferries.co.uk) start at £79 each way for a car plus two passengers. A mobile home at Domaine De La Paille Basse (0033 2 23 16 45 02, camping-castels.co.uk) costs from £4.60 per person per night.","Les Castels holiday park is in Domaine De La Paille Basse, near Souillac .

"This breathtaking video captures the moment a cyclist traverses an almost-vertical rock face to conquer the world's most dangerous trail - before making a return journey. Michal Kollbek was filmed defying gravity as he made his way over the famed White Line in Sedona - a near impossible route carved into a rock in Arizona. The stunning one-minute clip was filmed using a drone flying overhead and sees Polish rider Kollbek gradually make his way along the path with Red Rock State Park seen in the background. Scroll down for video . Death-defying: Daredevil Michal Kollbek rides his bike across the famed White Line in Sedona, in Arizona's Red Rock State Park . The entire clip was shot from a drone that showed how Kollbek went all the way across the rock face, turned, and then came all the way back, completing the  trip  without any problems. Kollbek, 30, has had practice with extreme stunts before and the Polish rider has claimed numerous downhill racing titles. He claimed that he attempted the heart-stopping stunt because he happened to be in the area. To prepare for the horizontal ride, Kollbeck had to let air out of his tires to maxmimise their grip on the rocky face. He then adjusted the suspension on the bikes frame and raised his saddle and walked across the route himself to create a mental picture beforehand. 'I live for thrills like this, and I would have tackled this line whether it was filmed or not,' he told the Huffington Post. No fear: The 30-year-old Polish cyclist was captured riding across this almost-vertical cliff in a video filmed using a drone . 'The drone was a bonus, and [videographer Marshall Mullen] did a great job capturing the moment. However, it's not for everyone, so I strongly advise inexperienced riders against trying this line.' 'Conquering this ride was all mental,' he told HuffPost. 'I was confident with my skills and knew I could execute it. The key was to block the out the scary thoughts about the potential danger, so I just focused on the trail and not on the terrifying space around me.' Set amid the strikingly beautiful Red Rocks, Sedona is known for its famed arts community. Nearly 100 art galleries are in the main town and each year the Sedona International Film Festival and Jazz Festival are held in the town. Besides its bustling bohemian culture, Sedona is also a huge draw for mountain bikers, off-roaders and hikers. Experienced rider: Kollbek, 30, has had practice with this sort of stunt before after claiming numerous downhill racing titles . In the one-minute clip, the rider traverses the seemingly impossible route of the White Line before making his way back again . Home to 12,000 people, Sedona is one of the most left-leaning communities in the United States set among 19 square miles of striking red rocks that resemble a Martian landscape. A 90 minute drive or 100 mile journey away from Phoenix, the twon itself sits 4,500 feet above sea level, with a mixture of mountain and desert climates. Many of the residents of Sedona are artistic, spiritual types and the local economy is based around the jaw dropping scenery and nearby Native American ruins. Reason for siking life: Kollbek (with his girlfriend) says he attempted the terrifying stunt because he happened to be the area of Arizona .

"The Conservatives and Labour have drawn neck and neck in the polls as Ukip’s support continues to fall. Nigel Farage’s party is being squeezed as election day approaches and is now on just 10 per cent, its lowest showing since 2013, according to a new ComRes survey for the Daily Mail and ITV News. Labour and the Conservatives have both advanced since last month and are level at 35 per cent. It is the best Tory showing since November 2012, suggesting last week’s Budget has gone down well with voters. Scroll down for video . David Cameron's Conservative party is neck and neck with Ed Miliband's Labour in the polls, according to new research. The parties are both at 35 per cent in the polls - the best Tory showing since November 2012 . Any jubilation will be tempered, however, by Labour’s showing – 35 per cent is its best vote share for six months. It is the third poll in recent days to put the two main parties neck and neck, suggesting the election race is deadlocked. Today’s findings represent the highest combined two-party vote share since September 2013. Ukip is down three points since last month to its lowest position in a ComRes poll since December 2013. The pollster said the party had suffered a ‘rapid decline’, falling from its peak of 19 per cent as recently as late last year. In recent days, Ukip has been in crisis after the expulsion of one parliamentary candidate over allegations of expenses fraud, the suspension of another and the resignation of a third who complained of ‘open racism and sanctimonious bullying’. The Liberal Democrats remain on a miserable 8 per cent, down from the 23 per cent they won in 2010, with the Greens snapping at their heels on 7 per cent. Despite being level with Labour on voting intention, the poll finds that the Conservatives are in a strong position on the crucial issue of the economy. Some 45 per cent of voters now think the economy would be better off under David Cameron and George Osborne, compared with 34 per cent who think the same of Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. Nigel Farage’s (pictured) UKIP party is being squeezed as election day approaches and is now on just 10 per cent, its lowest showing since 2013, according to a new ComRes survey for the Daily Mail and ITV News . The poll also found that 45 per cent of people asked believe the economy would be better off under Cameron and George Osborne (left), while 34 per cent would prefer it if Miliband and Ed Balls were in power (right) In particular, 43 per cent think their family’s financial situation would be better off under the Conservative pair, compared with 33 per cent who think the same of Mr Miliband and Mr Balls. Britons think Mr Osborne would make a better Chancellor than Mr Balls by 42 per cent to 32 per cent. However, many voters still complain they are not feeling better off than in 2010, when the coalition came to power. Although two in five adults – 40 per cent – think the state of the economy has improved since 2010, people are more likely to think their family’s financial situation is worse than better compared with five years ago, by 33 per cent to 24 per cent. Mr Cameron has a commanding lead over Mr Miliband on who would make the better prime minister after May, by 49 per cent to 33 per cent. Extraordinarily, 24 per cent of those intending to vote Labour think Mr Cameron would be better.","Conservatives and Labour  neck and neck with 35 per cent each in the polls .

"Trial: Marcin Kostrzewa (pictured today arriving at Plymouth Crown Court) allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files . A Polish man who tried to sell secret nuclear submarine documents he stole from his neighbour's airing cupboard has been jailed for more than four years. Marcin Kostrzewa was sentenced to four-and-a-half years behind bars after a jury at Plymouth Crown Court took less than an hour to find him guilty following a three day trial. The court had heard how Kostrzewa broke into neighbour Shane Spencer's flat and took the restricted files. He had become 'obsessed' with Mr Spencer after finding out he worked with subs. Marcin later stole the paperwork after using English and Polish words to search Google using terms like 'spy games, spies and secret documents'. Kostrzewa then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the information for £50,000 but was trapped in an undercover sting. He had denied committing the burglary between January and April 2014 and claimed he had found the contents in a bin as he was carrying out research for a spy novel. The 31-year-old claims he just wanted to get arrested so he could meet a real MI5 Agent. But jailing him for four and a half years, Recorder John Williams said: 'You are not the bumbling fool you have sought to portray in your evidence. 'In my view you are both calculating and clever. 'You stole and sought to sell documents which you understood to be sufficiently sensitive and no doubt secret to warrant a large amount of money.' He added that the loss of the documents could 'affect military operations' - though the metalworker tried to sell them to a friendly government. In a statement read to court, Mr Spencer said he had been suspended from his work at Devonport Dockyard for Babcock Marine. Aerial view: The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer at Devonport (above) and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines . The court heard he had lost his high level of security clearance and was thinking of moving abroad. Alexander Chalk, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the Pole had previous convictions in his home country, including robbery and burglary. He added the documents were marked restricted, the third of five classifications at the time, below top secret and secret.","Marcin Kostrzewa, 31,  took restricted files from flat next-door .

"Jeremy Kyle isn't known as the happiest of shows but one guest walked away beaming after the ITV show paid £10,000 for her to have her teeth fixed. Gemma Swift, from Crawley, who appeared on an episode of the programme in January, was ridiculed on the internet for her protruding teeth. However, she has had the last laugh after she was invited back onto the hit TV show to have her gnashers fixed. Scroll down for video . Gemma Swift was ridiculed for her teeth when she appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show, so much so that the shows producers paid £10,000 for her to have them fixed . Jeremy Kyle filmed Gemma having her teeth done and she is said to be appearing in a new episode for a grand unveiling. However, there is one person who is not too happy about Gemma's transformation - her love rival, Leona Stoner. Leona appeared alongside Gemma on the episode in a segment entitled, 'Stop harassing me just because I'm sleeping with your ex.' Gemma, who was dating the 22-year-old's ex-boyfriend, accused Leona of harassment. She also accused her of faking her own baby's death. Leona told the Mirror that she has since received threatening messages from Gemma which the paper pertain to have seen and she is incredibly angry that she be helped out by the show. Gemma was teased on the internet for her large teeth with one user parodying the lyrics to 'All About That Bass' to make them about her . Other users also mocked Gemma for her large teeth, however, she has had the last laugh now that she has had all of her dental work done . Leona, who is also from Crawley but currently living in Hove, also told the Crawley News: 'It's a joke. She was sitting there laughing and saying [horrible things] on national TV and Jeremy Kyle didn't say anything to stop her. 'I would like to know why he treated me the way he did and why they have now paid thousands of pounds for her to get some new teeth.' A spokesperson for the show told the Mirror: 'Gemma's teeth provoked a strong reaction from viewers and on social media after appearing on the show in January. 'The programme then arranged for her to have orthodontic work, the results of which will be shown in a future Jeremy Kyle Show.

"He was one of the UK's most controversial fashion stars, a man whose flamboyant public image concealed a private life blighted by depression and battles with drink and drugs. Now a retrospective of Alexander McQueen's work is to go on display at London's Victoria and Albert Museum, with pieces taken from his ground-breaking 1992 MA collection shown alongside his last. Savage Beauty, which opens next month but had a preview for A-List stars this evening, includes pieces from the unfinished 2010 collection as well as new pieces lent by McQueen's friends, among them stylist Katy England. Scroll down for video . Spectacular: A curator puts the final touches to some of the dresses that make up the V&A's new Savage Beauty retrospective . Supersized: The new exhibition is the largest Alexander McQueen retrospective ever held in Europe . McQueen, who was found dead on the 11th February 2010, was one of the UK's most influential designers at the time of his death and was the owner of a little black book that encompassed everyone from royals to first ladies and fashion editors. The son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher, the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in Lewisham, south London, where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters. After leaving school at 16 with a single O-Level in art, the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at Savile Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, before a stint at theatrical costumiers, Angels and Bermans. Both would have huge influence on his later career. McQueen's big break came following a spell in Milan working for Romeo Gigli. On his return to London, he applied to Central St Martins for work as a pattern cutter. Impressed by his portfolio, Bobby Hilson, the head of the master's course, persuaded him to enrol as a student instead. His faith in McQueen paid off. The designer's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by Isabella Blow. Talented: McQueen, pictured left during his S/S06 show and, right, backstage with a model, was one of the UK's most talented designers . Striking: His pieces were adored by fashion press and fashion-buying public alike . Hard to walk in: His shoes were notoriously elaborate and hard to walk in, as several models discovered while on the catwalk . Finishing touches: A curator works on an exhibit (left), while right, one of the structured gowns for which McQueen became famous . Last pieces: These designs are taken from McQueen's S/S10 collection which was inspired by sea creatures . From there, McQueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation, designing David Bowie's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous 'bumsters' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans. The same year, he was appointed creative director at Givenchy, replacing fellow Briton John Galliano, and relocated to Paris. But despite his success, McQueen never forgot his London roots, often speaking of his love for the British capital. Indeed, he once spoke of how inspiring he found the V&A itself, saying: 'The collections at the V&A never fail to intrigue and inspire me. The nation is privileged to have access to such a resource... it's the sort of place I'd like to be shut in overnight.' The museum repaid the compliment, first by including the designer's work in Cutting Edge: 50 Years of British Fashion in 1997, and then again in its Fashion in Motion series. But it is the new Savage Beauty retrospective that will be the largest retrospective of McQueen's work hosted by the museum, with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show. Enfant terrible: One of McQueen's more shocking stunts involved spraying model Shalom Harlow with paint during his S/S98 show . Striking: A V&A assistant poses next to a dress taken from McQueen's The Girl Who Lived In The Tree A/W 2008 collection . Magnificent: As with his shoes, the headgear shown on the catwalk by McQueen was usually difficult to wear . Changing times: McQueen's sea creature inspired S/S10 collection (left) and a dress from his A/W08 Widows of Culloden collection . Among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection, as well as some of his A/W10 designs - the last the designer would ever create. His final collection was never completed, with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in Paris a month after he died. But while McQueen might be gone, his brand lives on and, in the capable hands of his former assistant Sarah Burton, continues to go from strength to strength. 'Lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries, challenged and inspired,' she explains. 'He believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless. Savage Beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time.' 'I am thrilled to announce that the V&A will bring this wonderful exhibition to London to celebrate the extraordinary creative talent of one of the most innovative designers of recent times,' adds V&A director Martin Roth. 'Lee Alexander McQueen was brought up in London, studied here and based his globally successful McQueen fashion brand here – by staging the exhibition at the V&A it feels like we are bringing his work home.' Dramatic:  McQueen was famous for producing pieces that erred on the side of gothic such as these three dresses . Spectacular: Victoriana and bold blooms were also recurring motifs, as these striking gowns make plain . Setting the scene: Savage Beauty opens at the V&A next month, with tickets due to go on sale on the 14th March . The stars turned out in force for the party the V&A held this evening to celebrate the arrival of the exhibition. Supermodels including Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Erin O'Connor all showed up at the event in dresses by the late designer. A-List names from the world of acting also showed up to view the designs, including Colin Firth and Laura Carmichael, while David and Victoria Beckham put in an appearance too. Princess Beatrice flew the flag for the British royals, turning heads as she arrived in a black tuxedo-style dress that was split to the thigh. Jamie Hince and Kate Moss also attended the exhibition . David and Victoria Beckham were also invited to the event . Custom Victoria Beckham Autumn/Winter '15 .

'I also want to share what I have seen over the years to help people see similar scenes.' James work began in 2008 when he realised he was missing a trick by walking on Kinder Scout, Derbyshire and the Peak District's highest point, without a camera.

"Tim Farron, pictured, has vowed to bring the Lib Dem party 'back from the dead' Embattled Nick Clegg faced a dramatic leadership challenge last night after a top Lib Dem MP vowed to bring the party ‘back from the dead’. Former Lib Dem President Tim Farron savaged Deputy Prime Minister Clegg’s U-turn on university tuition fees and said the party had been ‘tarnished’ by the Coalition with David Cameron. Farron, a bitter Lib Dem foe of Clegg, said the party needed a tough new leader like ex-marine Paddy Ashdown who rescued it from a similar crisis in the 1980s. He said he had the ‘vision and never say die’ spirit needed to repair the slump in Lib Dem fortunes under Clegg. Left-winger Farron, hot favourite to succeed Clegg if, as expected, the Lib Dems flop in the Election, threw down the gauntlet in an interview with The Mail on Sunday. Clegg’s panicking allies have launched a ‘stop Farron’ campaign in a last-ditch attempt to stop him taking over after the Election. But speaking ahead of the party’s spring conference in Liverpool this weekend, Farron made it clear he is determined to replace Clegg. He brushed aside claims by the Clegg camp that he is a ‘sanctimonious, God-bothering, treacherous little s***’, compared Clegg’s leadership to the Lib Dems’ ‘near death’ in the 1980s and said voters would never forgive him for his tuition fees somersault. For a committed Christian, it is surprising how much hatred Farron generates among fellow top Lib Dems. There is no love lost between Farron and his main leadership rival, Minister and Clegg ally Norman Lamb. Clegg, Lamb and co swallowed their Lib Dem pride and principles, at least on occasion, for ministerial jobs and limos in the Coalition.Meanwhile, Farron, refused a Government post by Clegg, could grandstand from the sidelines, voting against the bedroom tax and tuition fees. Farron’s supporters in the Lib Dem sandal-wearing brigade say he is ‘untainted’ and see ‘Saint Tim’ as a saviour. He became a Christian at 18, when marooned in a house in rainy Singapore on a trip with his mum. ‘There was nothing to blinkin’ read and I read this weird-looking book on God. It was life-changing,’ he explains. Farron’s conversation is peppered with ‘blinkins’ and ‘bloomins’, adding to a boyish, Tintin cartoon air of wide-eyed enthusiasm. The book he stumbled on said the Bible was true. And from that moment, Tim believed every word. Literally. He thinks God knows everything. ‘Every hair on your head is numbered,’ he says, without blinking. God knows every hair on his head? ‘Yeah.’ Farron believes that Nick Clegg, pictured, blew the trust of the voters by his u-turn on tuition fees . Mr Farron, pictured, said neither of the two main parties should assume the Lib Dems will prop them up . He scoffs at the idea of a ‘half-baked distant God – either he created every bloomin’ atom in the entire universe or he didn’t’. He derides those who believe in ‘some kind of part-time, low-wattage God’.Similarly, he believes Heaven and Hell really exist. Heaven is ‘a place where there’s no more tears, no more crying, no more pain, no more suffering, no more death’. It exists as a physical entity? ‘Yeah. It’s what the Bible tells me.’ His Christian beliefs made him agonise before dropping his opposition to gay marriage. Lib Dem cynics are less generous: they say voting against it would have been fatal to his leadership hopes in a party known for its strong pro-gay rights stance. State-educated northerner Farron, 44, has none of the expensive suits and modulated vowels of private schoolboy Clegg. It is hard to see him laughing and joking in the Downing Street Rose Garden with Cameron. It’s hard to see him in No 10 at all. Farron dismisses Clegg’s claim that he had to back tuition fees to save the Coalition. ‘Integrity is important. You must not only keep your word but be seen to keep your word. You can say no,’ he says emphatically. It was ‘obvious’ the Lib Dems would be ‘tarnished’ by it and voters would not forgive them. ‘In 2010, many people said: I am not voting for you because of the Lib Lab pact (in the 1970s) when I was seven years old. Just think what going into coalition with the Tories will do to our brand over the next generation.’ Clegg allies are quick to point out Farron voted for the Coalition deal. He insists he has been ‘loyal’ to his ‘friend Nick’. Far from knifing Clegg, he says he ‘rode to the rescue’ in several key party conference votes. ‘It sounds really up myself but … the day was saved.’ Farron, pictured, said he regrets signing a letter with fellow Lib Dem MPs to force former leader Charles Kennedy's resignation claiming he was acting on the advice of an un-named senior party politician . But in a clear dig at Clegg, Farron makes it clear if there is another hung Parliament after the Election, and he is in charge, it will take more than a swanky limo to make him jump into bed with the Tories or Labour. ‘If you believe what really matters is that ministerial car, you will give way to the other side more than you should. We are curating the party of Gladstone,’ he declares grandly. ‘We must not crash it by making short-term decisions in any coalition agreement.’ If the party makes too many concessions in the crucial few days after the Election, ‘whoever’s leader, whether it’s Nick or somebody else… we’re dead’. Farron portrays himself as a heroic, visionary Paddy Ashdown-style Lib Dem leader-in-waiting, name-checking him a dozen times during the interview. When Lord Ashdown led the party it was the third force in politics. Now it trails behind Ukip and the Greens with up to half its 57 MPs in danger of losing their seats in May. Farron says he will rebuild the Lib Dems with the same ‘absolute bloody-minded refusal to lie down and die’ spirit displayed by Ashdown, a square-jawed ex-Royal Marine trained to kill with his bare hands. It is hard to see slight ‘Tintin Farron’ in the same vein. ‘I’ve been paint-balling a couple of times,’ he quips with a gap-toothed grin. He is not the only Farron preparing for the limelight: ‘Blinkin’ marvellous’ wife Rosie is ready to help him. The couple have four children and live in Westmorland in the Lake District, where Farron is a local MP. ‘Rosie might have to do some telly at some point. She gave a Mothers’ Union talk last week – her first-ever public speech.’ Farron confesses he is ashamed of signing a letter with fellow Lib Dem MPs in 2006 which forced Charles Kennedy to resign as leader. He claims he was ‘persuaded’ to do it by unnamed ‘older MPs’. Farron was too discreet to mention it, but it is a matter of record that Clegg, four years his senior, was among the signatories. For all his claims of loyalty, those who know Farron say he will have no regrets if Clegg resigns. And Farron’s sandal-wearing fans will be happy. Does Farron own any sandals? ‘Only for pratting around on holiday – and never in the UK,’ he laughs.","Tim Farron said Nick Clegg should not have u-turned on tuition fees .

"Allegations that a secret undercover police unit carried out spying operations on Labour MPs need to be investigated immediately,  Nick Clegg demanded this morning. The Deputy Prime Minister said the idea that elected politicians were being 'snooped on' because of their views 'appalled' him and urged the Home Secretary Theresa May to order a wider probe into undercover police tactics to investigate allegations. It comes after a former officer, Peter Francis, said he read files on 10 MPs during his 11 years working for the Metropolitan Police's now notorious Special Demonstration Squad. The Deputy Prime Minister said the idea that elected politicians were being 'snooped on' because of their views 'appalled' him . He said the files included Labour's now deputy leader Harriet Harman , former cabinet minister Peter Hain and Jack Straw, later home secretary. Details about the targets were collected by officers infiltrating anti-racism and other left wing political groups, and apparently continued after they were elected to Parliament. The former officer claimed he personally collected information on Diane Abbott, Jeremy Corbyn and the late Bernie Grant and said special branch collected intelligence on Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner, and Tony Benn. The pink files were 'very extensive' he said, and included details of a subject's political beliefs, family relationships, personal background, education, and finances. Some contained details of 'personal and private matters', he said. If true, the files on many of the subjects existed years after they entered Parliament. Four of those on his list became ministers during his time in Special Branch. The revelations prompted demands for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policy to be widened to include the new allegations. Speaking on LBC this morning, Mr Clegg said the allegations, if true, were 'absolutely terrible'. He said: 'The idea that the police snooping and monitoring elected politicians in effect because of their views - because they were deemed to be from the left, that they were somehow dodgy - it absolutely appalls me. 'I know there's an inquiry into undercover police tactics and I very much hope it will look at these allegations because they are not the kind of thing you want in a free society. 'Politicians, regardless of their views, should be able to represent their constituents and express their opinions without being monitored by the police.' A secret undercover police unit carried out spying operations on now deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman (left) and former foreign secretary Jack Straw . Mr Francis was an undercover officer between 1993 and 1997 in the now disbanded Special Demonstrations Squad. He infiltrated left wing groups and causes which were deemed to potentially pose a threat to national security. He told the BBC: 'When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them'. 'When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across.' 'I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,' he said. 'I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.' 'I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.' Mr Hain told the Guardian: 'That the special branch had a file on me dating back 40 years ago to anti-aparthied and anti-Nazi League activist days is hardly revelatory. 'That these files were still active for at least 10 years while I was an MP certainly is and raises fundamental questions about Parliamentary sovereignty.' Scotland Yard pointed out that Operation Herne the internal police investigation into the unit was still ongoing, but that Mr Francis had refused to speak to it about his claims. A former officer said he read files on 10 MPs during his 11 years working for the Special Demonstration Squad including Diane Abbott (left) and special branch collected intelligence on Dennis Skinner (right) Special branch also investigated Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone (right) and former Welsh secretary Peter Hain (left) who said the files raised 'fundamental questions' about Parliamentary sovereignty . A Met spokesman said: 'Operation Herne has previously reported publicly on SDS methodology and remains a live ongoing investigation. 'Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes. Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.' The taxpayer faces a compensation bill running into the tens of millions of pounds from miscarriages of justice linked to a the SDS. Hundreds of animal rights activists, neo-Nazi groups, campaigners for black justice and other campaigners who, unknowingly, were spied on by the Special Demonstration Squad could have their convictions overturned. Women have also sued the Met after having children with undercover officers who they thought were genuine protesters.","A former officer from a secret police unit admitted spying on Labour MPs .

"They are the ancient Egyptian monuments that people flock from all over the world to see. So perhaps it is unsurprising that Egyptian architects have taken inspiration from the Pyramids at Giza to create a new skyscraper in the capital Cairo. Plans for a spectacular addition to the city's skyline have been unveiled and the shape will look very familiar - not only is the pyramid building borrowing from Ancient Egypt, at 200 metres (656ft) tall, it will be taller than the Great Pyramid itself and the highest building in the country. Scroll down for video . The Zayed Crystal Spark project will feature not one, but two pyramid shaped features. The smaller pyramid at the front will boast an impressive entrance and walkway, surrounded by cascading waterfalls . The Great Pyramid is thought to have been built around 2550BC and reaches 147 metres (481ft). There are three pyramids at Giza - built as burial chambers for three important kings, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure - and they are famed as one of the original Seven Wonders of the World. The modern project will be known as the Zayed Crystal Spark, occupying a 798,000-square metre spot in West Cairo’s Sheikh Zayed district. It will be multi-purpose and have potential to be used for administrative, commercial and entertainment ventures. The development would be created by real estate developers and the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA). The Ministry of Housing have announced plans for a spectacular 200 metre high pyramid skyscaper, which will be the tallest building in the country. The shining pillar will be adorned with a glowing capstone and commemorate the nation's prized landmarks . Egypt’s Minister of Housing Moustafa Madbouly omitted revealing the investment cost of the project, but said further plans would be revealed at March's economic summit. It was announced by the Ministry of Housing that 150 real estate developers, in the private sector, have been invited to attend the conference this month. It is hoped the project will attract fresh investment and help to boost the city’s job market, economy and landscape. The complex will cover a 798,000-square metre spot in West Cairo’s Sheikh Zayed district and will be used for administrative, commercial and entertainment ventures . The structure pays homage to Egypt's most iconic wonder, and further plans will be unveiled at economic summit scheduled for this month .","The Zayed Crystal Spark will be taller than the Great Pyramid and be the highest in the country .

"Thailand is not short of a marvellous beach or two. It is, after all, a country with 2,000 miles of coastline. There's The Beach, of course, on the island of Ko Phi Phi Lee, as featured in the 2000 film based on the Alex Garland novel and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. And there's the small sandy cove on Khao Phing Kan in uber-picturesque Phang Nga Bay. The Khao Sok National Park is one of the oldest rainforests in the world, where you can meet elephants at one of the better camps . The island is now known as James Bond Island, upon which you and a chum can pose back to back with imaginary weapons, echoing the scene from The Man With The Golden Gun of 007 (Roger Moore) and the evil Scaramanga (Christopher Lee). But the problem is practically every other visitor who chooses Thailand for their exotic sun, sea and sand holiday wants to sit and be seen in the country's most famous hotspots too. It gets a little crowded, to say the least. At the risk of sounding a bit of a beach snob, I want to be alone, or at least not swamped by hundreds of other sunbathers, when I'm on my holiday, at least until I've shaken off some stress. If you do too, you'll adore the JW Marriott Khao Lak. And thanks to direct flights to Phuket aboard Thomson's Dreamliner, you don't have to faff around catching a connecting flight from Bangkok. It's a real bonus. If you have flown long haul before, you will notice the difference - more space, both seat-wise and all around, dimmable windows, more oxygen and better lighting all make the journey more bearable. And it's only an hour or so drive north from the airport to Khao Lak, or 90 minutes away from the busy and, er, colourful attractions of tourist trap Patong. The JW Marriott Khao Lak is very classy and quiet and has a glorious beach whch is free from crowds . I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting such a tasteful resort. Distinctly oriental in design, the JW Marriott Khao Lak is very classy and quiet, with 250 rooms and all the facilities you need for a proper rest and de-stress, whether there's just two of you or the whole family. There's a nice spa, Quan, offering all the usual pamperings and treatments. The range of dining options includes breakfast and international cuisine in the Waterfront restaurant, Thai food at Ta-Krai, Japanese at Sakura, and Mediterranean at Olive. There's a deli, too, and numerous bars and lounges. It's easy not to step outside for the whole holiday, but I was persuaded to do a little sightseeing. A trip to James Bond Island also included a look at a small rubber plantation, feeding monkeys beside a Buddhist temple, cruising through mangrove swamps in a long-tailed boat, and lunch in the Muslim village at Panyi Island. It's all well run and very commercialised. Roger More (right) and Christopher Lee on James Bond island in the film The Man with the Golden Gun . More off the beaten track is Khao Sok National Park, one of the oldest rainforests in the world, where you can meet elephants at one of the better camps. However, do be very careful to choose a well-run establishment when selecting this kind of adventure. We were taken by canoe - you don't even have to lift an oar yourself - down the Sok River, admiring the trees and waterfalls as we went. And, of course, there are dozens of snorkelling and diving sites to choose from. The JW Marriott Khao Lak itself offers numerous sports on site, a fitness centre, and there's golf galore nearby. Ko Phi Phi Lee featured in the 2000 film based on the Alex Garland novel and starring Leonardo DiCaprio . Naturally, it has plenty of places to sunbathe or take a dip, not least Khuk Khak Beach, a marvellously empty stretch of white sand fringing the Andaman Sea. The resort also claims to have South-East Asia's longest swimming pool - indeed, it winds around and in between the buildings like a huge lazy river, allowing some rooms to actually be swim-up, which is great for families. The best bit for me, though, was the very private hidey-holes complete with loungers, cleverly sheltered with hedges, but still with easy access to the water. Paradise found. GETTING THERE .

"Method of choice: Double murderer Ron Lafferty has chosen to die by firing squad . It is a macabre choice to make - and almost unique to some inmates on Utah's death row: would you be injected with toxic chemicals, or shot in the heart? But, amid cries of outrage against the southwestern state bringing death by firing quad back into law, almost half of those due to die that way have picked the punishment themselves. Ron Lafferty, who slit the throats of his sister-in-law and her baby daughter in 1984, is one of three who has opted to die by the bullet. Two others in Utah's eight-strong death row have made the same choice, the Los Angeles Times reported - though it is not clear who they are. The recent change in Utah's execution law revived the firing squad as a back-up method, in case no lethal injection drugs are available . It was outlawed in 2004, before which time inmates such as Lafferty had been able to choose between the two. Even while firing squads were banned, a legal technicality meant previous decisions were still valid. The last was carried out in 2010. In practice, Utah has no doses of lethal injection, and no way to acquire more. That situation means anybody the state executes is likely to be put before a firing squad - five marksmen with .30-caliber Winchester rifles - whatever their preference. The state is not due to kill anybody for several years yet, so a new source could be found - though many drugs manufacturers now refuse to do business with governments that carry out capital punishment. Human rights organizations criticize the method as a barbaric throwback to the days of the Wild West - the same charges which led to the scrapping in the first place. Scroll down for video . Execution chamber: Pictured above is the seat in which inmates are strapping ahead of a firing squad execution, in which five guards would gun them down from 25 feet away . Fan: Ronnie Lee Gardner, who was killed by firing squad in 2010, requested the method having previously said: 'It's so much easier... and there's no mistakes' A spokesman for Governor Gary Herbert, who signed the bill, said the state of Utah has an 'obligation' to provide a viable execution method. He said: 'Those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state. 'We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued. Others: Two other inmates have requested death by firing squad. It is unclear which. Above are (left to right) Ralph Menzies, Troy Kell and Taberone Honie . Death row: Anybody sentenced to death before 2004 has a choice of execution methods. Pictured above (left to right) are Von Taylor, Michael Archuleta and Floyd Maestas . 'However, when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant, enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch.' Refusal: Douglas Carter, pictured, has asked for lethal injection - but may be killed by firing squad anyway if none can be found . The move follows a series of high-profile botched executions around the U.S. in 2014 and 2015, many due to concerns about the efficacy of lethal injection drugs. Proponents of the punishment tout the speed of firing squads - provided some of the five bullets hit the heart, death can come in little longer than a minute. Lethal injections have in some cases dragged on for almost half an hour. The last firing squad death in Utah, and the United States, was that of Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. A New York Times report said that he told a Utah judge 'I would like the firing squad, please' a few weeks before his execution date. He explained his preference more than a decade earlier, in an interview with the Deseret News. He told the paper: 'I guess it's my Mormon heritage.' 'I like the firing squad. It's so much easier... and there's no mistakes.' As per his wishes, the marksmen opened fire at a 12:15am on June 18, 2010, ABC News reported. At 12:17am, he was declared dead. The prisoner is seated in a chair that is set up in front of a wood panel and in between stacked sandbags that keep the bullets from ricocheting around the room. A target is pinned over the inmate's heart. Shooters aim for the chest rather than the head because it's a bigger target and usually allows for a faster death. The prisoner is offered a two-minute window to offer final words. In 1977, Gary Gilmore used that chance to say 'Let's do this!' before he died. Five shooters set up about 25 feet from the chair, with their .30-caliber Winchester rifles pointing through slots in a wall. Assuming they hit their target, the heart ruptures and the prisoner dies quickly from blood loss. Weapon: Utah's marksmen fire the fatal rounds from a .30-caliber Winchester rifle, similar to the one above . The gunmen are chosen from a pool of volunteer officers, with priority given to those from the area where the crime happened. Thus far there have always been more volunteers than necessary. The shooters' identities are kept anonymous, and one of their rifles is loaded with a blank round so nobody knows which officer killed the inmate. Unlike lethal injections, death by firing squad leaves some of an inmates' organs - such as the eyes, kidneys and liver - unspoilt for donation, so long as they are not hit by stray bullets. .","State recent brought firing squad back onto the law books .

"A British internet troll has got more than he bargained for after he was slapped with £100,000 in libel damages and costs after abusing a US lawyer on Google. Jason 'Jay' Page, 20, from Telford, reaped a legal whirlwind when he posted a wounding review on Colorado-based Timothy Bussey's Google Maps profile. The anonymous post described the US lawyer as 'a scumbag' and accused him paying for his firm's positive reviews on the web. Punishment for troll: Jason 'Jay' Page, 20, from Telford, has been hit with £100,000 in libel damages and costs after abusing US lawyer Timothy Bussey on Google . Mr Bussey was left fuming by the anonymous post, which seemed to be from a dissatisfied client and stated to the world that 'he loses 80% of his cases'. The post remained live on the web for about a year and Mr Bussey and his firm, The Bussey Law Firm, suffered severe damage to their reputations. Mr Bussey was not willing to let the matter rest and, at huge expense, employed a Californian law firm to subpoena Google's records to find out who was responsible. That led him to the door of Mr Page, aged in his 20s, who was living with his parents in Sutton Hill, Telford, and ended up on the receiving end of a full-scale High Court libel case. Timothy Bussey's law practice in Colorado Springs: Jason Page was ordered to pay damages after leaving abuse on the lawyer's Google Maps profile . He insisted that he bore no responsibility for the post and that his Google account must have been hacked by someone else. He said that a hacker might have been seeking revenge for something he had done as a 'moderator' of the www.reddit.com website. However, Judge Sir David Eady said hacking into Mr Page's account would have been challenging, with the perpetrator needing to bypass passwords and sophisticated security. There was no indication that anyone held a grudge against him and the judge described the hacking explanation as 'extremely improbable'. The 'overwhelming probability' was that that Mr Page had either authored the post himself or authorised it. Mr Page was ordered by the court to pay £50,000 damages, along with Mr Bussey's legal costs, of which he must pay £50,000  on account . The judge added: 'Why Mr Page should himself choose to attack Mr Bussey and his firm is unclear, but the most likely explanation would appear to be a purely financial one'. Taking into account the 'grapevine effect' on the internet, the judge had no doubt that the post had caused serious damage to Mr Bussey and his firm's good name. He ordered Mr Page to pay £50,000 damages, along with Mr Bussey's legal costs. He must pay £50,000 of those on account, pending final assessment of the costs bill. Mr Bussey's solicitor, Will Richmond-Coggan, said later: 'This is a great result for our clients. 'Their reputations have at last been vindicated following this calculated attack through the medium of an online review site' He said that Mr Page's post may well have been 'solicited' by others and Mr Bussey would continue his legal fight on both sides of the Atlantic to find out who may have been responsible. Mr Richmond-Coggan added: 'We hope that this decision sends a message that fake negative reviews have a real impact on real people and those who post them can and will be held accountable.'","Jason  Page, 20, from Telford was sued by US lawyer Timothy Bussey .

"A National Hunt photographer escaped serious injury after the bookies favourite careered off the course taking one of his main challengers with him. With just two fences left to go in the Glenfarclas Handicap Chase, Nina Carberry on the JP McManus owned Quantitativeeasing was advancing along the rail when Jonathan Plougaou aboard the French favourite Toutancarmont ploughed into the Irish horse - forcing both of them off the track. Miss Carberry's horse went through the rail, knocking down photographer Patrick McCann from the Racing Post. These screen shots from above show the horses leaning left as they jump the second last . Quantitativeeasing is on the inside and hits the barrier first with Toutancarmont right behind . Mr McCann was treated at the scene by medics and had one of his legs placed in a splint before being taken away to hospital. Both jockeys and horses escaped injury following the crash, just two from home. Mr McCann is being taken to Southmead hospital in Bristol with a suspected broken leg. The drama let Davy Russel aboard the 16-1 shot Rivage d'Or make it a double for Davy Russell and Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, who won the first race of the day. Shortly before the incident, Ms Carberry was covering the ground very well and just jumped clear into second place when the French horse slewed hard to the left, crashing into the Irish challenger. Mr McCann was standing about 30 feet from the fence beside the rail when Quantativeeasing was forced through the plastic barrier. Mr McCann tried to dive out of the way, but he was struck by the rail, which is designed to give way if a horse loses control. The eventual winner of the race was just three lengths behind when the incident happened and jockey Davy Russell used the space which suddenly became available to power home to victory. Nina Carberry, in green and yellow, was pushed off the course by the following horse . Patrick McCann had no time to get out of the way as the horses came towards him at full speed . Mr McCann attempted to jump clear of the scene as he noticed the horses rapidly approaching . Cheltenham spokeswoman Sophia Brudenell told The Racing Post: 'Patrick was standing at the second-last fence. He's a regular racing photographer who understands the rules and at the moment, as it reads, we're not concerned with where he was standing. He was under the running rail and seemed to be moving away as the horses approached. 'Having looked at the images, the horse didn't go over him, he brushed past him rather than trampled over him. The horses just moved to their left as they were jumping, Patrick was in that position off the rail, where we'd expect him to be. They did violently move to the left and Patrick felt the consequence.' Stewards at the course reviewed the accident and noted that Any Currency, which finished second had 'jinked left' approaching the penultimate fence. This forced Toutancarmont to jump left into Ms Carberry's horse. The stewards said the incident did not involve a riding offence. However, Miss Carberry is facing a one day ban after she was accused of allowing her horse to canter into the start of the race.

"A politician who sued his rival for calling him 'Del Boy'  in a campaign leaflet is facing a £50,000 bill after dropping the lawsuit because he has 'developed thicker skin'. Neil McEvoy launched the legal action after Labour opponent Michael Michael distributed a circular which had his photo superimposed onto the face of the Only Fools and Horses character. Plaid Cymru's Neil McEvoy, a former deputy leader of Cardiff City Council, claimed the leaflet implied that he was 'not to be trusted'. Neil McEvoy (left) is facing a £50,000 bill after launching legal action against Labour opponent Michael Michael (right) over a campaign leaflet which depicted him as Del Boy Only Fools and Horses . But a top judge found it was not defamatory to compare someone to David Jason's on-screen character, instead labelling it 'the stuff of political disagreement'. Mr McEvoy later withdrew his High Court libel case, saying he regretted bringing the action. But he has now been ordered to pay £50,000 of his rival's legal costs. Speaking after the case, Mr McEvoy said: 'With hindsight, I now regret having started this action. 'I have developed a thicker skin, and in future if I dislike something written about me I will write a leaflet of my own instead of issuing a writ. 'I don't think anyone has gained from this case going to court. This is the end of it, and it's time to move on.' A judge ruled that comparing Mr McEvoy to David Jason's on-screen character was critical but not defamatory . The two councillors had become locked in a legal battle after the leaflet was distributed to around 2,000 homes in the Fairwater area of the Welsh capital. Mr McEvoy, a member of Welsh party Plaid Cymru, had claimed the leaflet 'questioned my probity'. His lawyer David Hughes had argued: 'We all know who Del Boy is - Del Trotter is best described as a ""loveable rogue"". 'The loveable element of Del Trotter's character comes from his good humour, his linguistic faux-pas, the amusing incidents that befall him, and the fact that he is fictional. 'The newsletters entirely eliminate any suggestion that Councillor McEvoy is in any way loveable. That leaves him being described as a rogue. 'He's not to be trusted. He's a rogue. Which of us would like to be compared to Del Boy?' Mr Michael had maintained it was a 'light-hearted' leaflet and that he was 'surprised' anyone was offended by its content. He said he had received feedback that people 'enjoyed' it. His lawyer Hugh Tomlinson QC argued that the comparison would not have been taken literally by residents. High Court Judge Andrew Keyser QC, sitting at Cardiff Civil Justice Centre, said the leaflet implied that Mr McEvoy was a ‘money-loving and money-seeking entrepreneur' who was ‘prone to unrealistic fantasies and improbable business ideas’. But he ruled that it was not unusual or defamatory to suggest that politicians' policies are fantasies, or lacking in realism. He said: 'The picture and words do not mean the claimant is a roguish character.' Mr McEvoy, who withdrew the case on legal advice, is covered by libel insurance.","Neil McEvoy launched the action against Labour opponent Michael Michael .

"A 24-year-old student nearly went blind, lost up to a staggering 90 per cent of her skin and was put into a medically-induced coma after suffering a rare allergic reaction to a common anti-seizure drug. Khaliah Shaw was a public health graduate student at Georgia College and State University when she was reportedly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed the medication, Lamotrigine, in 2013. Within a month of taking the drug, she had developed a rash on her face, while the skin on her lips had started to peel off. Although she visited her local ER, she was initially diagnosed with the flu. But two days later, Miss Shaw woke up in excruciating pain, with the skin on her face, neck, back and chest falling off and her mouth covered in blisters. She returned to the ER in Oconee County. Scroll down for video . Severe reaction: Khaliah Shaw, 24, lost up to 90 per cent of her skin after suffering a rare allergic reaction to common anti-seizure drug, Lamotrigine. Above, Miss Shaw is seen before (left) and after (right) her reaction . Hospitazlied: Miss Shaw, who was a public health graduate student at Georgia College and State University at the time, was put in a medically-induced coma (pictured) after she contracted Stevens-Johnson Syndrome . However, medics were not sure what was wrong with her, according to Miss Shaw's blog, which she started writing after her ordeal. They reportedly isolated her, fearing she had an infectious disease. After the student's condition deteriorated, she was rushed to The Medical Center of Central Georgia in Macon, where a dermatologist diagnosed her with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Fox reported. SJS is a rare disorder that  begins with flu-like symptoms, which Miss Shaw believes led medics to initially mistake her illness for the flu. It is typically a reaction to a medication, and can prove fatal. During her first night in hospital, Miss Shaw's skin continued to fall off, leaving her with huge, open wounds. Doctors reportedly decided to put her in a medically-induced coma to alleviate her pain. Prescription: The student (left, before her reaction) was reportedly prescribed the medication, Lamotrigine (right), for bipolar disorder in 2013. Within a month of taking the drug, she had developed a rash on her face . Misdiagnosis: Although she visited her local ER, she was initially diagnosed with the flu. But two days later, Miss Shaw (right, with a friend, after her reaction) woke up in excruciating pain, with her skin falling off . Damaged eyesight: After the student's condition deteriorated, she was rushed to another hospital, where a dermatologist diagnosed her with SJS. Above, Miss Shaw now wears glasses indoors to protect her eyes . 'They put me into a medically-induced coma, because they knew it was going to be really painful,' Miss Shaw said, adding that she was then taken 90 miles to Atlanta's Grady Hospital's Burns Unit. When the student woke up five weeks later, she was shocked to find she could not see and was breathing via a tracheotomy. She had lost all of her hair and her fingernails had all fallen off. Stevens-Johnson Sydrome (SJS) is a rare disorder that begins with flu-like symptoms. These are followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters. Then the top layer of the affected skin dies and sheds. The illness, which is a form of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, is typically a reaction to a drug or an infection, and can prove fatal. Treatment focuses on eliminating the underlying cause, controlling symptoms and minimizing complications. Patient recovery can take weeks to months, depending on the severity of the syndrome. Source: Mayo Clinic . She was reportedly later told she had also lost a whopping  80 to 90 per cent of her skin. Although Miss Shaw was, as she describes it, 'essentially almost blind', her vision gradually started coming back and she saw herself for the first time since suffering the devastating allergic reaction. To her horror, she was bald, with pink and white patchy skin instead of brown. 'It was a shock to see that... all my hair had come off. I didn't have any fingernails,' Miss Shaw told the news station. In subsequent days, Miss Shaw had to have her eyes treated by an opthamologist to limit any long-term damage, she writes on her blog. SJS can cause extensive tissue damage resulting in blindness. She also started to suffer from seizures, which 'were a result of being heavily sedated for a long period of time', her blog states. Doctors arranged for her to undertake physical and occupational therapy. Seven weeks after being transferred to the specialist burn center, Miss Shaw was able to go home. Now, 13 months on, the brave former student continues to see a variety of doctors, specialists, and therapists on a weekly basis. She has moved back in with her mother and still cannot see properly. Hospital: 'They put me into a medically-induced coma, because they knew it was going to be really painful,' Miss Shaw said, adding that she was then taken 90 miles to Atlanta's Grady Hospital's (pictured) Burns Unit . Life-threatening: When the student (pictured in hospital) woke up five weeks later, she was shocked to find she could not see and was breathing via a tracheotomy. She had lost her hair and her fingernails were gone . Contrast: She was reportedly later told she had also lost 90 to 90 per cent of her skin. Above, Miss Shaw is pictured taking a selfie before her allergic reaction (left) and in the same position after losing her hair (right) 'I would love to have my vision back,' said Miss Shaw, who has put her graduate studies on hold and is forced to wear sunglasses, even when indoors, because any bright light is painful to her. She is also 'terrified' to take any more medication to manage her bipolar disorder - which causes shifts in mood, energy and activity levels - fearing that it could spark another severe allergic reaction. In one blog post, she wrote: 'It still haunts me to think about everything they did to me while I was in hospital. I can still hear the IV machines beeping. I never want to end up in the burn unit EVER again.' Miss Shaw, who first fell ill in December 2013, added: 'There are still things I avoid to this day because it reminds me of that time. And no amount of discomfort is worth getting SJS again. NONE.' Looking ahead: Miss Shaw's hair is starting to grow back and her blogging is helping her to make sense of her ordeal and return to her old 'awesome' self. Above, she is pictured in a recent Facebook photo in a wig . Blog: Miss Shaw's blog, The Journey of a Butterfly (pictured), details the former student's battle with SJS . But despite her struggles, Miss Shaw's hair is starting to grow back and her blogging is helping her to make sense of her ordeal and return to her old 'awesome, hilarious, sassy, smart and articulate' self. Lamotrigina, the generic of the drug Lamictal, is approved in the US for the maintenance of bipolar disorder. The medication is also approved for the treatment of partial seizures in epileptic patients. It features a black box warning about deadly skin reactions, such as SJS, which is a form of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. The syndrome is also linked to other on-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. These include Allopurinol, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine and anticonvulsants.","Khaliah Shaw was prescribed the drug, Lamotrigine, for bipolar disorder .

"A Chinese mother who never gave up hope of finding her beloved son cried tears of joy as she was finally reunited with him - 26 years after child traffickers snatched the four-year-old from the street. Lan Mingxi's son Li Wei vanished in September 1989, taken from the street by two strangers who no one ever saw again. His disappearance left Mingxi distraught, and over the years she did all she could to find her little boy, writing nearly 10,000 letters and appearing on television countless times, always holding the only photo she had of Wei, taken when he was three years old. She even tried to infiltrate the child trafficker's network, in the vein hope it might lead her to her son. Yet in the end, it would be the picture she had showed to thousands over the years which would finally reunite her with the son who was living on the other side of the world, the People's Daily Online reported. Tears of joy: Lan Mingxi was reunited with her son Li Wei 26 years after he was snatched from the street . Delight: Mingxi, 53, had never given up hope - and the entire village turned up to celebrate the reunion . Shock: Wei, who was given a different name, had no idea he had been taken, thinking he was an orphan . Mingxi decided to give the search for her son one final push after her daughter Li Dan was diagnosed with leukaemia. Neither Mingxi nor her ex-husband were a match as bone marrow donors, but the 53-year-old knew there was one last chance: the son she hadn't seen for more than a quarter of a century. So Mingxi appeared on television once more - and this time, a man recognised the three-year-old in the picture as his friend, now called Jiang Xin. But there was another hurdle: Xi was now living half way across the world in Angola, where he had moved a few years before to work as a driver. It transpired Wei had been brought up by a foster family more than 1,000 miles away in Hebei, in the north of the country. He, like many other children in China, had no idea that he had not been orphaned, but snatched - so he had no idea the pain his mother was feeling back at home. Small chance: Mingxi only had this picture of her son, aged three, to help with the search . Luck: The picture was seen by one of Wei's friends, who thought they could be the same person. Pictured: Wei (far right) and his son, four, with his mother . Inspiration: Mingxi was spurred on to reignite the search after her daughter - pictured here with her brother and nephew - was diagnosed with leukaemia . Alone: Mingxi feared she would be left without a family - but instead managed got a new grandson . Mingxi said: 'I was devastated - but the whole thing was made worse by the fact that everybody, including my husband, blamed me for losing our son.' Mingxi's husband was so desperate to heal the hole in their lives, he even brought another boy back to the house on one occasion. Devoted: Mingxi, pictured here with her son, was so determined she once pretended to be a businesswoman to enter a child traffickers house in the hope it would lead her to Wei . But Mingxi told him to take the young boy back again. 'For all I knew this poor child could have ended up in the adoption process because of traffickers and I didn't want anything to do with it,' she said. The stress led the couple to divorce five years later, and Mingxi was left bringing up their daughter alone. But her search continued, although it led to many false leads, with people trying to extort money from the desperate mother. At one time, she managed to trace a young snatched boy right to his new home - only to discover it was not her son, but that of a neighbour's. Mingxi even disguised herself as a businesswoman to enter into the home of a suspected trafficker, but was exposed and had to flee. But Mingxi made the conscious decision to keep one vital piece of information secret, so she would not be tricked: a distinctive mole on Wei's face. So when the now-grown Wei's friend showed her a picture of her son as a 30-year-old man, it was the mole which meant she knew for sure it was him. So when Wei returned to China to get his visa renewed, he took a blood test - proving he was the missing youngster. Hunt: Mingxi, seen her with her daughter Li Dan, even once found the kidnapped son of a neighbour . Recognition: Mingxi and Wei were finally brought back together this week, to the delight of everyone . Large family: Wei is married, and Mingxi now has a daughter-in-law (pictured) and a grandson . Unbelievable: 'I never gave up hope, but it was getting towards the end of my life and I thought that maybe it wasn't meant to be that we would be reunited in this life,' Mingxi said . It lead to a tearful reunion between Wei and Mingxi, as well as her grandson - who, at four, is the same age as Wei when he was taken. 'I looked for my son for 26 years, and never gave up hope but it was getting towards the end of my life and I thought that although I know he's out there somewhere, maybe it wasn't meant to be that we would be reunited in this life,' she said. 'And it seemed as if everything was going wrong when my daughter was diagnosed with leukaemia. 'I can't believe I have both my children back now, plus my son has got married and I even have grandchildren.' As for Wei, he is still trying to come to terms with what has happened. 'I feel incredible,' Wei told Huaxi City Newspaper. 'I didn’t know how to tell my current mother the news, I didn’t know how to face either. 'But, one thing I’m certain of is that my birth-mother must have endured so much.' Wei, who was raised with three older sisters and a younger brother, is also clear on his responsibilities to his mothers, even if he isn't quite sure how it will work. 'I’ll try to take care of both mothers, they are both my mothers. I’m still coming up with a solid plan, and my birth-mother respects my choice,' he said.","Lan Mingxi was reunited with her son Li Wei after decades of heartache .

"The last time Lynette Austin saw the Afghan children, they were weak, wounded and broken. But when the nurse was reunited with them on Friday at Shriners Hospital For Children, she found two cheerful 8-year-olds who had learned to speak English and to walk and even paint with artificial limbs. They looked 'healthy and so grown up,' she said in a telephone interview. Scroll down for video . The last time Lynette Austin saw these Afghan children, they were weak, wounded and broken but when the nurse was reunited with them on Friday at Shriners Hospital For Children, she found two cheerful 8-year-olds . Then: Shah Bibi Tarakhail lost most of her right arm and her right eye when she mistook a discarded grenade outside her home for a rock, and it exploded, ripping her body with shrapnel and killing her brother . Reunited: Lynette Austin was reunited with the injured victims she helped on Friday at Shriners Hospital For Children and was happy to see they were feeling much better . In 2013, Abdul Wahid was working with his family in the garden of his home in a remote, war-torn area when a rocket exploded, killing his brother, taking his right leg and badly damaging his other leg. Shah Bibi Tarakhail lost most of her right arm and her right eye when she mistook a discarded grenade outside her home for a rock, and it exploded, ripping her body with shrapnel and killing her brother. The children were taken to a NATO hospital in Kabul. Austin, who at the time was a U.S. Army civil affairs officer, saw them there. She brought them a DVD player and some Disney movies, along with what comfort she could. 'Capt. Sam,' as she was known, also linked up with the nonprofit Los Angeles-based group Children of War and arranged for the children to be flown to Southern California for treatment and therapy. The children stayed with foster families. Doing better: The nurse was happy to see the children who were once badly injured by an explosion were now happy and smiling and nearly fully healed . After the explosion: Austin is pictured here with one of the children she helped in the explosion . Injured: The victims say they were happy to see Austin who is pictured here right after the blast in their village . On Friday Austin, who is now an operating room nurse in Virginia, finally saw the children again. She received hugs, smiles, and even a drawing of a heart from Abdul. 'I love Sam and she's a good lady...she was there for me always,' he said in a telephone interview. 'I'm happy when I see her,' Shah Bibi said. 'I say thank you for everything: you take me outside, you take me inside, you tell me stories, give me candy.' All smiles: The children are doing much better and once they are fully healed they will be able to return to Afghanistan where they are from . Austin remembered Abdul as 'unwaveringly smiling and singing' in the Afghanistan hospital but he had a surprise for her. 'To see Abdul walk was amazing,' she said. 'To see his smile again, and the joy that he has. His spirit is so good.' As for Shah Bibi, she was traumatized and could barely talk, Austin said. Now, Austin marveled, the girl not only spoke but has learned to skillfully paint with her prosthetic arm. Lucky to be alive: This child lost his leg in the Afghanistan explosion but says that now he is doing much better . Both children have completed their treatments and are scheduled to return soon to their Afghan homes. It won't be easy for them. 'They're going back to a war zone,' said Ilaha Omar, director of international outreach for Children of War. Shah Bibi went home briefly last year but word of her painting aroused the wrath of militants. Word spread to her family that she would be killed for adopting Western ways, and for a time the family had to flee its small home on the Pakistani border. 'She actually is worried about getting killed. She doesn't want to go back,' Omar said, but added: 'Her family wants her back.' 'Now it's time that she's reunited,"" Omar said.

"A lawyer for a notorious Dartmouth College fraternity accused of branding new members on their body compared it to a form of self-expression like piercing or tattooing. Alpha Delta - depicted in the 1978 film Animal House - was suspended in October for various incidents including hazing, serving alcohol to minors and hosting unregistered parties. Officials are now extending that punishment over new allegations that members were burned last fall, with one student reportedly having the skin on his buttocks seared. They are also considering closing the 46-year-old club for good depending on the outcome of discussions. A pledge of Alpha Delta (above) reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014 . Attorney George Ostler confirmed a small number of fraternity members voluntarily chose to get body brands, but the practice was never a condition of membership. He says no hazing occurred, no one was injured and members are cooperating fully with the college. News of the branding incident emerged this week via the website Gawker. A sophomore pledge of Alpha Delta reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014, according to a tipster. By agreeing to the branding, the pledge would theoretically be allowed to avoid 'more drinking-intensive pledge activities'. When the pledge went home for winter break, he realized something was wrong with his brand and went to the doctor, Gawker reported. The fraternity at the Hanover, New Hampshire, school was famously depicted in the 1978 film Animal House . Dartmouth's sitting president Phil Hanlon (above) - class of 1977 - is a member of the Alpha Delta fraternity . He had to be hospitalized after it was determined the brand was infected. Medical personnel alerted the college, which is in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the school handed down a suspension. This is not the first time Alpha Delta has been linked to branding. A 1992 Rolling Stone article reported that 'a few pledges were reportedly branded against their will this year'. Alpha Delta brothers did not deny that allegation at the time. The pledge whose brand became infected is now a brother in the fraternity. Earlier this year, Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon - who was a member of Alpha Delta in the 1970s - announced a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were 'hijacking' Dartmouth's future that included high-risk drinking, sexual assault and a lack of inclusiveness on campus. The college is banning hard liquor on campus, ending pledge or probationary periods for all student groups to reduce hazing, developing a mandatory sexual violence prevention program and creating new residential communities. Alpha Delta was initially founded by members of the Gamma Sigma Society but dissociated from its parent corporation and renamed itself The Alpha Delta Fraternity in 1969.","Dartmouth College's Alpha Delta has a significant record of disciplinary violations, including hazing, serving alcohol to minors and hosting unregistered parties .

"A Michigan man killed in a shootout that also left a rookie Wisconsin state trooper dead was part of a group of skinheads who attacked black and Hispanic people nearly 20 years ago, court records show. Steven Timothy Snyder was convicted in 1996 of disorderly conduct in Fond du Lac, the same city where he killed Trooper Trevor Casper on Tuesday. A third person was also found dead, but police have not said who was responsible. Shootout: Steven Timothy Snyder, left, killed rookie Trooper Trevor Casper, right, on Tuesday . Crime: According to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, Snyder robbed a bank in the Village of Wausaukee, a community in northeastern Wisconsin just a few miles from the Michigan border, early Tuesday afternoon . According to charging documents, Snyder, then 19, was part of a group of skinheads police noticed walking through downtown in April 1996. Police saw the group walk up to a house. A group of black and Hispanic people emerged and the two groups pulled out pipes and baseball bats and began swinging at each other. The groups dispersed as police arrived, and an officer chased Snyder down and captured him. The documents say he had several 'White Power' tattoos and was carrying several dozen printed cards in his coat promoting a neo-Nazi organization called the National Alliance. The cards contained messages such as, 'That no multi-racial society is a healthy society — that if the white race is to survive we must unite our people on the basis of common blood, organize them within a progressive social order, and inspire them with a common set of ideals,' the charging documents said. Snyder told officers that some of the black and Hispanic people who came out of the house were carrying guns. The documents listed Snyder's address as Macomb Township, near Detroit. Alone: Casper had just graduated from the State Patrol's academy in December and was on his first solo patrol on Tuesday when the fatal shootout took place . Remembered: A funeral for Casper will be held Sunday at his alma mater, Kiel High School. A private burial is scheduled Monday . History: Steven Timothy Snyder was part of a group of skinheads who attacked black and Hispanic people nearly 20 years ago, court records show. Police are seen at the scene of the shootout on Tuesday . He was convicted of disorderly conduct in May 1996 and sentenced to 50 days in jail. Online court records don't list any other charges against Snyder in Wisconsin. According to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, Snyder robbed a bank in the Village of Wausaukee, a community in northeastern Wisconsin just a few miles from the Michigan border, early Tuesday afternoon. Later that evening the 21-year-old Casper, who had just graduated from the State Patrol's academy in December and was on his first solo patrol, began following a vehicle in Fond du Lac that matched the description of the one used in the Wausaukee robbery. Casper ultimately got into a shootout with Snyder and both were fatally wounded, according to Department of Justice officials. The agency has released no other details and an investigation is ongoing. Meanwhile, Marinette County authorities said Wausaukee resident Thomas C. Christ was found dead Tuesday. They said Christ had been shot after an encounter with Snyder near Christ's property. The FBI and the state are investigating whether Snyder may be involved in other bank robberies in other states. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that a Fond du Lac bank was robbed around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, but Fond du Lac police said Thursday that investigators have found no evidence directly linking Snyder to that robbery. A funeral for Casper will be held Sunday at his alma mater, Kiel High School. A private burial is scheduled Monday.

"The grieving mother who lost her two sons in a house fire started by their father has revealed how her boys quoted Buzz Lightyear in their last words to her. Darren Sykes, 44, lured his two boys Jack, 12, and Paul, nine, to the attic of his house in Penistone, South Yorkshire, then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside. Now, their mother Claire Throssell, 42, has revealed how when she left the boys at school that morning, Jack told her ‘To infinity and beyond, mum’ - before Paul said: ‘To infinity and back.’ Three dead: Darren Sykes (left), 44, lured his two boys Jack (right), 12, and Paul (left), nine, to the attic of his house in Penistone, South Yorkshire, then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside . 'Proud' mother: Claire Throssell (centre), 42, has revealed how when she left the boys at school that morning, Jack (right) told her 'To infinity and beyond, mum' - before Paul (left) said: 'To infinity and back' Speaking of her sons quoting the Toy Story films, she told the Daily Mirror: ‘It rips my heart apart thinking about their last words to me. But I am so glad they knew I loved them. They were my life.’ Flames swept through the semi-detached house last October where the boys were staying with their carpet salesman father. Neighbours said they heard no screams or cries for help from inside. The bodies of Mr Sykes and Paul were found in the loft and Jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder - but died five days later in hospital from burns. Miss Throssell said she believed Jack attempted to save his brother, adding: ‘I think he tried to drag Paul out of the attic by his arm. Paul had a little scratch on his nose and drag marks on his arm. ‘Jack fell trying to protect his brother and ended up at the bottom of the ladders in a heap. I’m so proud of him, proud of them both and that pride will never die. They were brothers to the end.’ Miss Throssell also revealed in the interview with Mirror reporter Lucy Thornton that she married Mr Sykes in 1998 after they met at a carpet firm where they both worked and he wooed her with roses. Home: Flames swept through the semi-detached house in Penistone last year where the boys were staying with their carpet salesman father. Neighbours said they heard no screams or cries for help from inside . Lost both sons: Miss Throssell said she believed Jack attempted to save his brother Paul during the fire . But she added that he became ‘controlling’ over the family after their birth of their sons, and would regularly lose his temper and criticise her for being ‘fat’. They later divorced. Now Miss Throssell – who had her first Mother’s Day without the boys yesterday – said she has been helped through her grief by sleeping in the boys’ bedroom, and has their ashes in a ring. Two weeks ago,  a coroner recorded that Mr Sykes committed suicide, while the verdict on the two boys was unlawful killing. The inquest in Sheffield heard that before he died from burns in hospital, Jack managed to tell police it was his father who started the fire - saying: 'My dad did it on purpose.' Mr Sykes, worried over access rights to his children, had 'coldly planned' the fire at his home 'with the specific purpose of ending two young lives', the hearing was told. The inquest heard that Mr Sykes felt 'the world was against him' after a meeting with Cafcass - which represents children in family courts - two days before the tragedy. Emotions: Miss Throssell (pictured left at the funeral for her sons, right) said she has been helped through her grief by sleeping in the boys’ bedroom, and has their ashes in a ring . 'To infinity and beyond': The boys quoted a catchphrase from Buzz Lightyear (above) in the Toy Story films . He formed the impression that Paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights. Mr Sykes lived in Penistone after the split with his wife - and his sons lived with her at their grandmother's home in nearby Thurlstone. On the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets, transferring them into a female third party's account. He spent £600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be 'engine drivers'. Mr Sykes then bought petrol cans, fuel and posted letters to family and friends - and deliberately parked his van away from his house so neighbours would not realise anyone was at home. He picked up his sons on the evening of October 22 last year to play with the model railway and while they went up to the loft, he set the fire. Funeral: Mr Sykes lived in Penistone after the split with his wife - and his sons lived with her in Thurlstone . Family: In a statement to an inquest earlier this month, Miss Throssell said her 'boys meant the world to me' The inquest heard that after he had barricaded the door after lighting a fire in the bottom floor of the house, he then came out of the house through the patio doors and walked round to the front door, letting himself in and locking it behind him. He took the keys upstairs before lighting more fires on the first floor, including in the children's bedrooms. Once this was done he then entered the loft, closing the hatch behind him. Mr Sykes sent the same text to six separate people saying he was 'going to be at peace'. A minute later, neighbours spotted the blaze and the fire service were called with the downstairs well ablaze. Cord had been tied to the front and back garden gates as a barricade and a dining chair placed between the kitchen door and the door to the stairs so nobody could escape downstairs. Petrol was used as an accelerant to start the fire with 16 pools of fuel on the ground floor and first floor. A patio door had been left partly open downstairs to fan the flames. In a statement to the inquest earlier this month, Miss Throssell said: 'My boys meant the world to me. They were both polite, well-mannered and caring, and you can't imagine life without them.' Buzz Lightyear is a space ranger hero and action figure owned by a boy in the Toy Story films. Last November his catchphrase 'to infinity and beyond' was voted the greatest line in movie history.","Darren Sykes, 44, lured sons Jack, 12, and Paul, nine, to his home's attic .

"They say you don’t get much for your money these days – but a Scottish holiday home has just gone on the market for a pound. The one-bedroom flat in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, valued at £20,000, is coming up for auction at the end of the month, making it almost certainly the cheapest flat in Britain. Seller Catherine Scott, 58, said: ‘It was my late husband’s property and we are looking for a quick sale. Scroll down for video . Location, location, location: This one-bed flat on the holiday island of Bute, Scotland, is coming up for auction for just £1, despite being valued at around £20,000 . Seller Catherine Scott, 58, said the flat belonged to her late husband and the family chose the low asking price because they are looking for 'a quick sale' ‘It has been in his family for a long time, but it is a lovely flat and would make someone a very nice little holiday home.’ The sandstone property is in Rothesay town centre, close to the 13th century castle and a five-minute walk from the harbour – although it does not offer sea views. Auction House Scotland will put the property under the hammer in Glasgow at 2pm on March 26. The company’s website describes the auction sale as ‘an excellent opportunity to purchase a Scottish holiday home or a buy-to-let investment for only £1’. Auction House Scotland says the property has a large lounge, kitchen, shower room and bedroom, with gas central heating and double-glazed windows . The town of Rothesay, where the property is located, is close to a 13th century castle and a five minute walk from the harbour which has ferries to Wemyss Bay . It adds: ‘The surrounding area presents ample local shops, a golf course, beautiful Scottish scenery and great access to ferry links to Wemyss Bay.’ The traditional second-floor flat has a large lounge, kitchen, shower room and bedroom, with gas central heating and double-glazed windows. Gillian Cochrane of Auction House Scotland said: ‘We’re expecting a big turnout, there’s been a lot of interest so far. It was our idea to put the guide price at £1. ‘The reason we did that is, firstly, you get a lot of interest; and secondly, the sellers just want a fast and final sale. Market experts believed the flat could be rented out for around £364 per month, or could provide a nice holiday home for whoever snaps it up . Auctioneers say the guide price of just £1 has attracted a lot of interest so far, and they are expecting the property to be snapped up quickly on March 26 . ‘When the hammer falls, it’s a done deal. Whereas if you are buying from an estate agent, it can drag on – about 30 per cent of estate agent deals fall through . ‘The flat can be a place you can go to for a short break, or you can rent it out.’ Market experts said the flat could be rented out at £364 per month.","One-bed flat in Rothesay, Isle of Bute, has been valued at around £20,000 .

"A suspended Roman Catholic priest who authorities say dealt pounds of methamphetamine and bought a sex shop to possibly launder his drug money is asking a federal judge for leniency when he is sentenced next week. Monsignor Kevin Wallin's public defender filed a sentencing request in federal court in Hartford on Monday citing Wallin's three decades of charitable service as well as more than 80 letters of support, including one from the late New York Cardinal Edward Egan. Wallin, 63, dubbed 'Monsignor Meth', pleaded guilty in 2013 to a methamphetamine conspiracy charge and agreed to a potential prison sentence of 10 to 11 years. Kevin Wallin, 63, dubbed 'Monsignor Meth', pleaded guilty in 2013 to a methamphetamine conspiracy charge and agreed to a potential prison sentence of 10 to 11 years . Already imprisoned for the past two years, he is now asking for a sentence of no more than four years in prison followed by a year of home confinement, 500 hours of community service and drug treatment. Sentencing is scheduled for March 24. 'The record evidence demonstrates that Kevin Wallin is an extraordinary man whose remarkable character and acts have touched thousands of people,' Wallin's public defender, Kelly Barrett, wrote in the sentencing request. 'Kevin tragically became a methamphetamine addict. He fell from grace and did criminal wrong, but has confessed his crimes and has been working hard to atone for them.' Barrett wrote that Wallin's numerous accomplishments include serving as pastor of St. Peter's Parish in Danbury and the Cathedral Parish in Bridgeport, volunteering with a variety of community groups, helping found an AIDS ministry program, leading an inner city charity group, serving on the Danbury Cultural Commission and serving on the board of directors of Sacred Heart University. Egan, who died earlier this month, was bishop of the Diocese of Bridgeport from 1988 to 2000. He praised Wallin in a letter to the court. Wallin bought the Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place adult video and sex toy shop in North Haven and had apparently intended to launder drug proceeds . 'He was outstanding in the fulfillment of his assignments and in his concern for people in need,' Egan wrote. 'Father Wallin was held in highest regard as a dedicated clergyman and an outstanding citizen as well.' Federal prosecutors say Wallin committed serious crimes and most people convicted of conspiring to sell meth are sentenced to at least 10 years in prison. Federal investigators said Wallin had associates in California send him methamphetamine beginning in late 2008 or early 2009. By 2011, Wallin's partners were sending him one to three pounds of meth a month and Wallin was running the drug operation out of his apartment in Waterbury, investigators said. Wallin also bought the 'Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place' adult video and sex toy shop in North Haven and apparently intended to launder drug proceeds that totaled in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, federal agents said in court documents. Wallin served as the pastor at St. Augustine's in Bridgeport for nine years before taking a sabbatical in 2011 for health and personal reasons . Wallin's two accomplices in California — Chad McCluskey of San Clemente and Kristen Laschober of Laguna Niguel — were both sentenced last year to five years in prison. Two men who helped Wallin sell drugs in Connecticut also were convicted. Kenneth Devries of Waterbury was sentenced to more than two years in prison and Michael Nelson of Manchester awaits sentencing. Brian Wallace, a spokesman for the Diocese of Bridgeport, said Wallin is still a priest, but remains suspended from public ministry. 'We're asking for prayers for him, understanding and recognizing that many people ... suffer from addiction and they lose control of their lives,' Wallace said. 'It's time for him to try to rebuild his life.'","Kevin Wallin, 63, dubbed 'Monsignor Meth', pleaded guilty in 2013 to a methamphetamine conspiracy charge .

"Alabama police say a toddler has died after drinking from a bottle of grape soda believed to have been spiked with methadone. 31-year-old Cassie Townsend was babysitting 2-year-old Demonie Hendon Friday and noticed that a bottle containing methadone was not where she'd last placed it, Bessemer police told Al.com.

"Famed radio presenter John Laws has again shocked listeners after he berated an elderly man who began to break down on air as he revealed  he was sexually abused as a child. During the interview on Thursday morning Mr Laws called the elderly man - known as Brian - a 'wet blanket' and suggested he should 'go to the pub and have a lemonade, for god sake'. Scroll down for video . Mr Laws has come under fire after mocking an 80-year-old sexual assault victim . In the ten minute chat Brian recounted several instances where he was sexually abused when he was only eleven and fourteen years of age. Mr Laws quipped and chuckled that it 'took a little while for you to get around to talk about it.' Brian then told Mr Laws that he had in fact reported two instances to the police but he was told to 'go away and forget about it. No one would do anything about it.' It was at this stage Mr Laws added insult to injury as he told 80-year-old Brian that he should have fought the man off, as he himself had done when men had 'had a go' at him when he was younger. The disgraced shock jock called the elderly man a 'wet blanket' and suggested he should 'go to the pub and have a lemonade, for god sake'. 'Did you scream in fright? Did you yell out 'stop that you bastard'? Did you lash out with your fists? Did you hit him?' Laws asked. A meek sounding Brian responded 'no, no probably not.' 'I don't quite understand why you didn't lash out, you would have been a fairly big boy by that time. Didn't you kick or yell or scream or hit?' Mr Laws continued to press the issue and said he should have told his family or his boss, who it turns out was responsible for several of the assaults. Brian began to become audibly distressed at this stage when he explained he had no family support. 'No, we never had any uh, there was no such thing as ... family love,' Brian said. He explained that his abuse was a contributing factor to why he had no girlfriend, no romantic interests and very little human contact. Repeat offender: Mr Laws was criticised in 2013 after telling a female sexual assault victim that women who dress provocatively are 'rapebait' Mr Laws then tried to salvage the conversation saying he should have felt better after speaking to him and getting it off his chest. Brian responded that he was 'sad more than anything.' Mr Laws then shockingly claimed the interview was a waste of 'both of their time.' Brian continued to open up about his years spent in isolation after the attacks, trying to minimise human contact when Mr Laws thought it prudent to offer Brian some more sound advice. In a flood of support for Brian many twitter users have called for Mr Laws to be sacked . 'Have you ever stopped and asked yourself, why don't people like me? 'You're not the happiest soul, I don't know that you'd make people who are around you feel all that good. Have you tried to brighten up a little? Difficult I know. 'Do you hear me? But you're not taking any notice. 'You've got to be responsible for your own activity. You must make the move, go and talk to somebody about it. 'But don't be down all the time, don't be a wet blanket all the time. Try and have a laugh. 'Go to the pub and have a lemonade for god sake. He was met with silence. 'But don't be down all the time, don't be a wet blanket all the time. Try and have a laugh.' 'No? Well there's not a lot more I can do, is there?' To wrap up the uncomfortable ten minute conversation Mr Laws asked Brian to thank him for his time. 'Brian, could you say thank you?' The interview draws shocking parallels to a conversation Mr Laws had with a female caller in 2013 who had also experienced sexual abuse. Mr Laws blamed the victim and claimed that women who dressed provocatively were 'rape bait'. Twitter has erupted in support for Brian as listeners call for the so-called radio magnate to be sacked. The twitter community rushed to condemn the actions of Mr Laws labelling him a 'monster' Sarah Monahan, the former co-star of Hey Dad! who was among actor Robert Hughes’ child sex abuse victims, chimed into show support for Brian and said she hopes he can see that there are people out there who do care. She added Mr Laws needs 'genuine help' after listening to the insensitive call. Sarah Monahan wants Brian to know that he isn't alone and people do care . Karen Willis from NSW Rape Crisis Centre is among critics who say Mr Laws should be taken off the air. 'That man needs to hang up his hat,' she told Daily Mail Australia. She said the manner in which Brian was publically cut down after he had the 'courage to speak up' was 'completely irresponsible and unacceptable'. 'Brian, could you say thank you?': Mr Laws insisted Brian thank him at the end of the awkward conversation . ‘What we know  is that 40 years ago child sexual assault was rarely talked about. Children were told they made and any attempt they made to tell someone would have quite often  been met with rejection, punishment or blame,’ she added. 'After a lifetime of living with fear, to hear somebody they trust and respect to speak to them like that. It just reinforces a life of thinking it was their fault. It's just awful.’","Radio presenter John Laws shocked listeners as he berated an 80-year-old sexual assault victim Brian .

"As condemned Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran wait on 'death island' for their latest appeal to go to court, it's been revealed that almost 200 Indonesians on death row around the world have had their sentences commuted over the last three years - at the request of the Indonesian government. 189 Indonesian death sentences were suspended thanks to diplomatic efforts - and in some cases, money paid - by Indonesia,The Sunday Telegraph reports. The Indonesians who won reprieves were convicted of crimes which included drug smuggling in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, China, Iran and Singapore. 'I am not requesting of Indonesia anything that Indonesia does not request of other nations where Indonesian citizens face the death penalty,' Ms Bishop told the Telegraph. 'We urge the Indonesian government to show the same mercy to Andrew and Myuran as it seeks for its citizens in the same situation abroad,' she said in the Australian Parliament recently. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine pair Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan (left to right) , will have a legal appeal against their execution sentence heard in a Jakarta court on Thursday . 'We urge the Indonesian government to show the same mercy to Andrew and Myuran as it seeks for its citizens in the same situation abroad,' Australia's Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop told Parliament recently . With an estimated 360 Indonesians facing the death penalty abroad - about 230 of those on drug charges - Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has warned Indonesia's plans to proceed with the Bali Nine executions could risk the lives of its own citizens. Ms Bishop pointed to the case of Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad, an Indonesian maid who was saved  from beheading in Saudi Arabia by the previous Indonesian government after being convicted of murdering her elderly employer. It's reported Indonesia paid $2.1 million to stop the execution and that President Joko Widodo was among the politicians calling for mercy at the time. While President Widodo lobbies for his own people, he continues to reject Australia's appeals for clemency for the Bali Nine pair. Widodo told Al Jazeera Televsion that  his role, as Head of State, is to protect his citizens. 'But at the same time, we have to respect other countries that apply capital punishment,' he said. Last year, Indonesia made a substantial payment to a Saudi family to halt the impending execution of Indonesian maid, Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad.  Her sister-in-law, Sulastri, holds her photo in Central Java last year . Last month, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi told theJakarta Post that the Indonesian government was committed to helping release 229 Indonesian nationals  on death row around the world. 'The state is giving assistance by providing them with lawyers and regular visits in the prisons and carrying out diplomatic efforts with local authorities to solve the issue,' Retno told reporters. She also said President Widodo had ordered all Indonesian embassies and consulates 'to unite the death row convicts with their families as this would be helpful for their psychological well-being.' Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi says Indonesia is committed to helping release 229 Indonesian nationals on death row around the world - despite refusing to grant clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Ms Bishop told the Australian Parliament last month that Indonesian organisations like  Migrant Care and the National Commission on Human Rights, say Indonesia's  policy of proceeding with executions at home 'would risk undermining its representations abroad.' Of Chan and Sukumaran, she said Australia will not give up hope. 'The families of these two young Australian men have spoken openly and in heartbreaking terms of their hopes for a stay of execution,' Ms Bishop said. 'The Australian government stands resolutely with both families, after all, Australia is only doing what Indonesia is doing: making representations on behalf of Indonesian families in support of Indonesian death row prisoners abroad.' 'I believe it is Indonesia that will lose the most from executing these two young men.' The legal appeal for condemned Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be heard in a Jakarta court on Thursday. It comes after Friday's news that Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's executions have been indefinitely delayed due to ongoing legal proceedings. The delay and new appeal have been welcomed by the pair's legal team, as well as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, both of whom have voiced their optimism at the prospect for a repeal to the execution sentence, reports Yahoo News. The new appeal will be the men's second challenge to the clemency bid which was rejected in January. Julian McMahon (C), the lawyer for Bali Nine pair. The condemned Australian's legal team said the delay was a 'welcome development' as it represented a change to the previous position of the Indonesian Government' Michael O'Connell, one of the lawyers for the two Australians, said the delay was a 'welcome development' as it represented a change to the previous position of Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo. 'The indications that we've had yesterday are encouraging because there does now appear to be some regard to his principles.' Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she hoped the appeal represented a possible shift in the stance of the Indonesian government. 'There could be other reasons for the delay but I hope, in my heart, that it's a change of mind,' she said. Drug trafficker Scott Rush is led away for interrogation at Bali Police Headquarters. The now 29 year old has voiced his sympathy for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran after hearing they will face the firing squad .

Rush, 29, told The Weekend Australian via a friend he was 'shocked and heartbroken' by news of the their fate. 'I am praying for Myuran and Andrew and for the other condemned prisoners that even at this time mercy can't be shown,' he said. 'I send love and prayers to the families and loved ones. May God bless them all,' Mr Rush reportedly said.

"ISIS terrorists are stealing civilians' cars in an attempt to flee as Iraqi soldiers fight their way into the strategically important city of Tikrit. The massive operation involving more than 30,000 Iraqi Army soldiers is succeeding in forcing ISIS militants from the city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Local officials confirmed that Iraqi troops entered Qadisiya, and penetrated the northern suburbs, raising the Iraqi flag over Tikrit's general hospital. Scroll down for video . A member of the Iraqi forces poses with an Iraqi flag in Tikrit - taking the city would open a supply line for a future operation to besiege Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city that still remains under ISIS control . Iraqi forces entered the city and succeeded in driving out ISIS terrorists from the crucial stronghold . Later today, Iraqi forces (including the military, militias, Sunni tribes and police) also entered Tikrit from the south in a pincer movement to try and drive out the terrorists, although many fled in the face of the advance. 'The terrorists are seizing the cars of civilians trying to leave the city and they are trying to make a getaway,' Kheyon Rasheed told the state-run Iraqiyya television. Tikrit, which lies midway between regime-capital Baghdad and the ISIS stronghold of Mosul, was taken by ISIS in June. Retaking the ISIS stronghold is considered vital if government forces are to succeed in their plan to force ISIS out of the oil rich city of Mosul, the terror group's Iraqi power base which lies just 140 miles north of Tikrit on Highway 1 - a road that effectively marks the front line in northern Iraq. Most residents of Tikrit fled in the months after the extremist group took control. Those who stayed have fled in recent days, but a tiny fraction are still there, awaiting their fate. Iraq forces entered ISIS-held Tikrit city centre from Qadisiya in the north and also from the south - the terrorists still hold the town of al-Alam, north of Tikrit university . Militiamen laid down heavy machine gunfire in the neighborhood's dusty streets during the attack today . Taking Tikrit would open a supply line for a future operation to besiege Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city that still remains under ISIS control . Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces, but the attack by thousands of Shi'ite irregulars could severely test the government's ability to handle sectarian divisions. Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam Hussein, and the Shi'ite majority. Since the Islamic State insurgency began, the Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shi'ite militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq. US military officials - who have not been involved in the ongoing Tikrit offensive - have that said a coordinated military mission to retake Mosul is likely to take place next month or two and involve up to 25,000 Iraqi troops. But the Americans have cautioned that if the Iraqis are not ready, the offensive could be delayed. Iranian military advisers have been helping guide Iraqi forces in their advance on Tikrit. General Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, is taking part in leading the Tikrit operation. Most battlefield successes in Iraq have been coordinated efforts, with Iraqi, Kurdish and Shiite militias fighting on the ground and the US-led coalition providing air power. The siege on the village of Amirli just north of Baghdad, when many feared the capital itself might fall, was broken last year with the help of US-led airstrikes and a fighting force of mainly Shiite militias. Shiite militiamen, backed by a coalition air campaign, also retook the town of Jurf al-Sukhr, on Baghdad's outskirts, from the militants in October. Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has appealed for more aid for his country's beleaguered ground forces, despite the US spending billions of dollars training and equipping Iraq's army during its eight-year occupation.

The US went on to assemble a coalition to fight the militants, and has so far launched more than 1,400 air strikes against IS targets in Iraq since the campaign started on August 8. Meanwhile, the UK launched its first air strikes on September 30.","ISIS stealing cars to flee as Iraqi soldiers enter stronghold of Tikrit .

"A man who passed himself off as a Hare Krishna 'guru' has been sentenced to 19 years in jail for repeatedly raping three teenage girls he turned into mesmerised sex slaves. Sean O'Neil, an Australian 43-year-old computer programmer, was found guilty of multiple rape and of corrupting minors by a closed-door appeals court in the southern French city of Aix-en-Provence on Monday. O'Neil forced a total of four teenage girls to live as naked slaves in his French Riviera apartment in the town of Valbonne, where he subjected them to pornographic photo sessions and made them recite the Hare Krishna mantra 1,700 times a day. Sean O'Neil, an Australian 43-year-old computer programmer, was sentenced to 19 years in jail after being found guilty of multiple rape and of corrupting minors on Monday . The three girls he regularly raped between 2009 and 2010 while they were aged around 15 and made psychologically dependent on the Australian. The court rejected O'Neil's argument that the sex was consensual to confirm a lower court's October 2013 conviction, and to lengthen an original sentence of 15 years in prison. It also barred him from re-entering France once he had served his time. O'Neil forced a total of four teenage girls to live as naked slaves in his French Riviera apartment in the town of Valbonne, where he subjected them to pornographic photo sessions . One expert testified that the girls cooperated because they were in a trance-like state approaching 'hypnosis'. The victims described O'Neil as a 'guru' who urged them to recruit other young virgins of the same age with the aim of starting a commune in Australia. The crimes came to light in 2010 after one of the girls described what they were enduring to a school employee.","Sean O'Neil was found guilty of multiple rape and of corrupting minors .

"He's only just announced his plans to leave the Army but a new poll has revealed that the majority of Britons want Prince Harry to get back to work. But it isn't more royal duties that most have in mind. Instead, more than half say the Prince should combine official work with an 'ordinary' job. Harry is currently a captain in the Blues and Royals but will leave the Army this summer after a stint seconded to the Australian Defence Force. New job: The majority of Britons think Prince Harry should get another 'ordinary' job . Retirement: Harry announced that he will leave the Army this summer earlier this week . Deployment: Harry, who did two tours of duty in Afghanistan, will now spend four weeks with the Australian Defence Force in Sydney and Perth . The 30-year-old is due to fly to Australia next month and will follow his month-long deployment with an official tour of New Zealand. He will also travel back to this side of the world half way through to mark the Gallipoli centenary at a ceremony in Turkey alongside the Prince of Wales. Despite calls for the Prince to get a regular job, the majority of Britons say leaving the Army is the right decision. 56 per cent of those questioned by pollsters YouGov said the royal has made the right choice, compared to just eight per cent opposed. Harry, who has consistently topped royal popularity polls, was also deemed a good role model by the majority of those asked, with 61 per cent saying he is. An enthusiastic 22 per cent said the Prince is a 'very good' role model, with just four per cent saying he is a bad one and two per cent opting for 'very bad'. Although only 16 per cent believe Harry should concentrate exclusively on royal duties, his future beyond next autumn remains unclear. Along with announcing his decision to leave the Army, a statement from Kensington Palace revealed the Prince will travel to Africa this summer to take part in conservation and charity work. Yesterday, it was revealed that Harry will follow that with participation in the 1,000 mile 'Walk of Britain' alongside injured soldiers supported by Walking with the Wounded. The trek will be the third Walking with the Wounded expedition for Harry, who previously joined servicemen battling their way to the North Pole in 2011 and the South Pole in 2013. Next stop: Harry, pictured with the Kiwi Invictus team last September, will also tour New Zealand . Royal duties: Most think Harry should combine official work (pictured) with a regular job . Role model: Harry, who regularly tops royal popularity charts, is also considered a good role model by most . Speaking at the event yesterday, Harry reiterated his commitment to helping wounded veterans and also revealed that leaving the military would be 'challenging' for him. 'The public’s support for our Armed Forces continues to be extraordinary,' he added. 'However, as the memory of our military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan fade, we must encourage people to continue supporting our servicemen and women; particularly those who are seeking to transition into civilian life. 'This process can be challenging, as it is for anyone seeking a new career. As I make this transition myself, I'm determined to do all I can to help others.'","Majority of Britons say Prince Harry should get another 'ordinary' job .

"A Chinese man has accidentally set his wife on fire in the middle of a crowded restaurant, after becoming impatient with how fast his tea was brewing. Tang Kung set his wife ablaze after he poured alcohol over an open flame at his table in the restaurant in Guangzhou, a city in China's Guangdong Province, the People's Daily Online reported. He had  become impatient with the speed with which his tea was boiling, so decided to give in a helping hand. Explosion: The moment the fireball shot across the restaurant table was caught on camera . Help: Tang Kung is then shown desperately trying to put the flames out, which had engulfed his wife . Mr Tang said he had only wanted to make the flame a bit larger after noticing the burner was starting to run low on fuel. But as soon as he poured the alcohol on the flame - which was lit in the middle of the table - a massive fireball shot out, engulfing his wife Lu Mai, 43. Video footage shows the injured woman - whose clothes had caught fire - leaping up as her 53-year-old husband tried to extinguish the flames with his hands. Mr Tang told reporters later: 'The fire was extremely fierce. All the service attendants fled in terror when it happened. 'It was very difficult to put out.' In the end, Mr Tang was helped by other customers and restaurant staff, who extinguished the fire with the help of table cloths. Injured: Shocked restaurant customers then rushed to the burned woman's assistance . Mrs Lu was rushed to hospital, where she received treatment for second degree burns to her face, neck and left arm. Cooking items at your own table in a restaurant has become a trend in China, but it is not without its risks. Last September, a similar tragedy took place when a waitress at a barbecue restaurant in the city of Zhejiang poured liquid alcohol over the grill, causing it to burst into flames and setting a customer on fire. A spokesman for Xia Hsing, the restaurant where the most recent accident happened, said: 'Customers are not allowed to refuel the stoves but the man had ignored the rule and taken the matter into his own hands, saying he didn't want to disturb the waitress.'","Tang Kung said he wanted to make the flame a bit larger after fuel ran low .

"MPs will be banned from claiming expenses for dinners, TV licences and taxis before 11pm following the general election. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) confirmed that politicians' perks will be cut from May 8. The move, which is likely to cause anger among MPs who already complain that the system leaves them out of pocket, emerged as the watchdog announced a raft of changes for the next parliament. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has confirmed that certain perks for politicians will be cut from May 8 . Ipsa said: 'We will implement the rule changes agreed in December 2013, including removing hospitality claims and the late sitting food subsidy. We have tightened the rules on taxis and hotels after late sittings of the House. 'We will no longer allow claims, under the accommodation rules, for TV licences and home contents insurance.' Elsewhere, staffing budgets are to go up 1 per cent to £147,000 for MPs in the London area, and £140,000 for those from outside the capital. The office costs budget is rising 0.5 per cent to reflect inflation, but accommodation budgets have been frozen. The watchdog had proposed a raft of curbs to expenses in 2013 as part of a wider package that included salaries rising by 10 per cent from £67,000 to £74,000. It suggested that trimming perks and pension benefits would offset the costs of the controversial pay rise. Prime Minister David Cameron has said that a 10 per cent pay rise for MPs is 'unacceptable' at a time when public sector rises are restricted to one per cent . The changes will go ahead even though the pay rise is still subject to review and David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have signalled they may block it. Mr Cameron has said he regards the hike as 'unacceptable' at a time when public sector rises are restricted to one per cent, while Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg have said they do not believe it should go ahead. The move - which is likely to cause anger among MPs who already complain that the system leaves them out of pocket - emerged as Ipsa announced expenses rules for the next parliament. But while the expenses reductions will now come in to force automatically on May 8, the MP salary boost will be subject to a review due to be carried out in the weeks after the poll. The watchdog theoretically has the final decision on the issue - although there have been suggestions that the law could be changed in order to prevent the increase. The cross-party Commons Standards Committee has previously condemned the expenses cuts, arguing that the rules are already 'considerably less generous' than in many companies. Highlighting the plan to drop the £15 currently claimable for dinner when the House sits beyond 7.30pm, the committee said: 'If such expenses are not met by the employer, then the employee is able to claim tax relief on subsistence costs of travel between work places. 'The rules for MPs are already considerably less generous than this. 'We also note that when there is whipped business, members must be within easy reach of the division lobbies. 'Once again, we consider there needs to be a stronger evidence base before it can be asserted that these are costs which other professionals would expect to meet for themselves, unless they had been dealt with through a salary supplement rather than expenses.' The committee said MPs routinely worked 60 or 70 hours a week and the tightening of the expenses system in the wake of the scandal that rocked Westminster already meant some had taken to sleeping in their offices. 'We do not consider that Ipsa has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses,' the report said. The changes will see a halt to claims for tea and biscuits, and hotels only allowed if they are booked after 1am.","Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority says perks will be cut .

"Federal agencies made $125 billion in improper payments last year, including tax credits to people who didn't qualify, Medicare payments for treatments that might not be necessary and unemployment benefits for people who were actually working, said a government report released Monday. The level of improper payments was a new high after several years of declines. In addition to fraud, the errors included overpayments and underpayments, as well payments made without proper documentation. The federal government's entire budget deficit for 2014 was $483 billion, making more than 25 per cent of that spending shortfall a self-inflicted wound. And with the latest estimates of the total U.S. population hovering at 318.9 million, the misapplied spending represents nearly $392 for every man, woman and child living in America. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE REPORT . KISS IT GOODBYE: The federal government sent out $125 BILLION in payments last year that it shouldn't have . While the errors were spread among 22 federal agencies, three programs stood out: Medicare, Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Together, the three programs accounted for more than $93 billion in improper payments, according to the report by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. 'This taxpayer money was not spent securing our borders, it was not spent on national defense, and it was not spent contributing to a safety net for those in need,' WIsconsin Republcian Sen. Ron Johnson said during a Senate hearing on Monday. 'This is a problem that is going to get worse year after year if we do not get a handle on it now.' These federal government programs were responsible for the biggest chunk of the $125 billion wasted on improper payments in 2014: . Johnson chairs the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, which  held a hearing on reducing improper payments by improving death records maintained by the Social Security Administration. Social Security has no death record for 6.5 million people who would be at least 112 years old, according to a report by the agency's inspector general. In reality, only a few could possibly be alive. As of last fall, there were only 42 people known to be that old in the entire world. Only 13 of the people are still getting Social Security benefits, the report said. But for others, their Social Security numbers are still active, so a number could be used to report wages, open bank accounts, obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds. Social Security maintains a database of people who have died called the Death Master File, or DMF. It helps public agencies and private companies know when Social Security numbers are no longer valid for use. 'Their absence from the DMF could result in erroneous payments made by federal benefit-paying agencies that rely on the DMF to verify recipient eligibility,' said Patrick P. O'Carroll Jr., the Social Security inspector general. 'It could also hinder state and local government and private industry – banks, insurance companies, and others – from identifying identity theft and other types of fraud.' Social Security also makes mistakes by adding the names of people who are alive to the death list. Each year, the agency adds about 9,000 names to the death list of people who are still living, said Sean Brune, a senior adviser to the Social Security's deputy commissioner for budget, finance, quality and management. The agency adds 2.8 million names a year to the list so the error rate is less than 1 percent, Brune said. But the impact on a person's life can be devastating. Judy Rivers, a communications specialist living in Alabama, told the committee that Social Security has twice listed her as dead, once in 2001 and again in 2008. She couldn't get a job, a bank account or a credit card. She couldn't rent an apartment. 'Without a Social Security number, you can do nothing in the United States,' Rivers said. 'I had to move into my car.' Rivers said her name has been removed from the list, but she still has problems getting credit because some financial institutions think she is using the Social Security number of someone who is dead. The federal government's increase in improper payments comes after three years of steady declines. The level previously peaked at $121 billion in 2010 before dropping to $106 billion for the 2013 budget year. The Obama administration says reducing improper payments is a priority. 'While progress has been made over the years, the time has come for a more aggressive strategy to reduce the levels of improper payments we currently are seeing,' said David Mader, the controller at President Barack Obama's budget office. Mader outlined several proposals in Obama's proposed budget for next year. They include programs to reduce fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid, as well as budget increases at the IRS to combat tax fraud. Medicare's payments to doctors and hospitals had the most improper payments, at $46 billion. The report said many were caused by insufficient documentation for home health claims and errors on medical necessity forms for hospital patients. The Earned Income Tax Credit provides payments to low-income families through the tax code. The program had nearly $18 billion in improper payments, for an error rate of more than 27 percent. The report cited problems verifying incomes before the payments were issued.

"A hospital has permanently stopped specialist keyhole surgery after five cancer patients died from avoidable complications. The Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust halted upper gastrointestinal (GI) operations for throat and stomach cancer patients last year. It came after an internal review found the deaths of five patients between 2012 and 2013 could have been avoided. Patients requiring the surgery were referred to St Thomas' Hospital in London for a period of 12 months. But the Kent trust has now said the decision to stop the operations at the hospital will be permanent. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust said a decision to refer upper gastrointestinal operations for throat and stomach cancer patients to St Thomas' in London, taken last year, will be a permanent move . Medical director Paul Sigston said: 'The trust will not be resuming upper GI cancer resection surgery, but diagnostic work and cancer treatment will continue to take place locally at both Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells hospitals. 'Major upper GI cancer surgery will not be carried out at MTW and we are currently working with our NHS partners to plan the long-term strategy for patients needing this kind of treatment.' The service was given a high-profile launch in 2010 and included the opportunity for consultants and trainees to watch on screen at a lecture theatre next door. But subsequent investigations found more than 30 per cent of patients who underwent the surgery developed complications. The trust initially suspended operations in December 2012 following two deaths and resumed in January 2013 before three more fatalities forced them to stop again. A report by the Royal College of Surgeons last May concluded that surgeons at Maidstone Hospital were unable to provide a safe service. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust admitted potentially avoidable complications could have contributed to the five deaths between 2012 and 2013. Three surgeons were barred from carrying out the procedures, but all have been allowed to continue doing general surgery. The decision came after an internal review found the deaths of five patients between 2012 and 2013 could have been avoided . The report says the team was ‘dysfunctional’, their working practices were ‘secretive’, and they had a ‘difficult’ relationship with anaesthetists. It found there was a high rate of complications associated with the keyhole techniques, and that after care for patients was poor. Speaking last May, Dr Sigston, medical director of the trust, said: ‘I would again like to apologise to the families involved.’ The incidents were referred to the General Medical Council and the trust also conducted its own internal inquiry while procedures were suspended. Sharon Lam, from Thomson Snell and Passmore solicitors, represents the families of the five patients who died and said they welcomed the decision not to resume surgery. She said: 'If they have any doubt as to their ability to deliver a safe service to the patients then that must be a correct decision.'","Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust halted surgery last year .

"He's the internet-savvy modern leader who cuddles up to kittens and hobnobs with film stars on his wildly popular Instagram page. But Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov is also a former warlord accused of running the Russian republic 'like a medieval tyrant'. The 38-year-old came to power in 2007 after a vicious armed struggle with a number of other Chechen strongmen and a political battle with the man he succeeded as leader, Alu Alkhanov. Claims that Kadyrov keeps a 'murder list' of 300 names of people to be liquidated surfaced in 2008. Yet the brutal reality of how Kadyrov maintains his grip on power has been glossed over by his social media skills and voracious appetite for posting on Instagram. Scroll down for video . Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov with actress Liz Hurley and a kitten. The Austin Powers star was in Grozny to shoot thriller Turquoise when the snap was taken in May 2013 . Kadyrov in medieval garb.

Kadyrov is a fan of the big cats . The father-of-eight has uploaded more than 4,800 posts and has around 905,000 followers to his kadyrov_95 account on the photo-sharing site. He has shown a particular fondness for snaps of himself with cute fluffy kittens, baby birds, lambs and even tigers. In May 2013 he posted snaps of himself with Liz Hurley and a white kitten on Instagram after meeting the actress when she arrived in Chechnya to film thriller Turquoise with French actor Gerard Depardieu. The pair were seen  apparently bonding over the tiny animal having been introduced by Kadyrov's friend Depardieu. In another shot the Chechen strongman leans across the Austin Powers star and runs his finger over the smartphone she is holding as the two appear perfectly at ease with each other. Depardieu met the Chechen leader at his birthday celebrations two years previously and later controversially accepted Russian citizenship after quitting France to avoid a planned 75 per cent tax on millionaires.

The two are seen laughing and joking out and about with Hurley in the Chechen capital Grozny. Kadyrov's fondness for the high life is revealed as the devout Muslim and some of his cronies are seen cruising through the streets of Grozny in a Rolls Royce. Things get weirder as he shows a fondness for medieval costume in another shot and poses with yet more fluffy cats perching on his shoulder and reclining in his arms. The burly enforcer has a go at playing the world's biggest softy as he lovingly cups a baby chick in his enormous hands. And the shots of him with a tiger are probably the most bizarre of all, as he pillows his head on the young big cat on top of an ornate rug and has it on his lap with a lead around its neck as he sits between two associates. And yet this is the man whose widely feared 'Kadyrovtsy' militia several thousand-strong, are accused by human rights groups of involvement in kidnappings, assassinations and torture throughout their patron's rise to power. They were formed during the first Chechen war for independence between 1994 and 1995 when Kadyrov's father, Chechnya's Grand Mufti or highest Islamic official, declared jihad against Russia. The former warlord (centre) and another bizarre snap of him with a tiger which even has lead round its neck .

He rules the once restive Russian republic with an iron fist . Chechnya's president with a baby chick. He also posted this kitten on his wildly popular Instagram account . But the Kadyrov clan switched their allegiance to Moscow at the beginning of the second Chechen war in 1999, since when continued insurgents against the Kremlin have been ruthlessly dealt with by the militia. The paramilitary clashed with forces loyal to fellow warlord Sulmin Yamadayev in March 2008 and a year later Kadyrov's rival was dead, assassinated in Dubai in a hit reputedly ordered by one of Kadyrov's cousins. The son of assassinated former Chechen president Akhmad Kadyrov also prevailed in his fight with paramilitary leader Said-Magomed Kakiyev, while Kadyrov successfully angled for Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismiss Alkhanov and appoint him leader instead. Since then it is widely accepted that Putin has given Kadyrov carte blanche to run Chechnya as his own personal fiefdom, provided he keeps the separatist forces which temporarily ripped the republic from the Kremlin's grasp in the 1990s are kept in check. Aside from Yamadayev a string of other Kadryov opponents have wound up dead in locations stretching from Moscow to Istanbul and Vienna, though the man himself has always denied involvement in any of their killings. Kadyrov hugs a man in a bear suit in front of the neon backdrop of the Chechen capital Grozny's skyline . The former warlord posted this viral video of a panda rolling down a snow covered hill on his Instagram page . This short film of pandas on a slide at the Chengdu Panda Base in China was another posted by Kadyrov . The video has more than 9million times on Youtube, and likely picked up some of those thanks to Kadyrov . Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in the capital in October 2006 while she was reportedly working on a story about torture and human rights abuses in Chechnya. Some observers laid the blame for the killing at Kadyrov's door. A month later Movladi Baisarov, a former commander of the Chechen presidential security services turned Kadyrov opponent, was also shot dead in Moscow. He had branded Kadyrov 'a medieval tyrant', adding: 'If someone tells the truth about what is going on, it's like signing one's own death warrant. 'Ramzan is a law unto himself. He can do anything he likes. He can take any woman and do whatever he pleases with her. 'Ramzan acts with total impunity. I know of many people executed on his express orders and I know exactly where they were buried.' And In a remarkable statement posted on Instagram, Kadyrov praised one of the men charged with the murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow as a 'fearless and brave' 'patriot of Russia' who was 'ready to give his life for the Motherland'.","Ramzan Kadyrov is burly former warlord accused of being 'medieval tyrant'
