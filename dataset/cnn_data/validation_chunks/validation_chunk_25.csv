"Michael Carrick has credited the return to form which has seen him recalled to the England squad down to the influence of Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal. The midfielder, hailed by Sir Alex Ferguson last year as the best English player in the game, has won countless club trophies but struggled for consistency at international level throughout his career. Now 33 years old, he is one of the oldest heads in Roy Hodgson’s squad and is a strong contender for a place at the bottom of the midfield diamond the England manager so often prefers to deploy. Michael Carrick is happy to be back in the England squad and has credited his return to Louis van Gaal . Carrick had particular praise for the Manchester United manager's aura and straightforward nature . ‘Van Gaal has improved me,’ Carrick said. ‘Certain situations in games, he's helped, not just individually but as a unit, as a defensive unit, as a group of players. I've definitely learnt from him. ‘He's been great from the start for me. I couldn't ask for any more from him in terms of what he's given me, and the support and confidence to be a big part of the team. ‘A lot of people at the top of their field, whether it's business or sport, tend to have that aura, and he's certainly got that belief and clarity in what he wants and what he expects from players. 'He's really straightforward and honest. ‘What you guys see when he speaks publicly, he's exactly the same with us. He's straight down the line and honest and says it exactly as it is.’ Van Gaal puts an arm around Carrick after they helped United to victory against Liverpool at Anfield . Carrick says he couldn't ask for any more from Van Gaal in terms of support and confidence he has given . Carrick is still yearning to improve his game further, despite moving into the twilight of his career, and tries to learn from the very best in his role. ‘You can look at a few – Andrea Pirlo, Xabi Alonso, Sergio Busquets,’ he said. ‘Busquets probably doesn’t get enough credit for what he brings to Barcelona. There’re a few out there. ‘I thought Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta for Paris Saint-Germain against Chelsea were terrific, especially when they went down to 10 men. I like watching and still trying to learn from others.’ Carrick has also gained his footballing education alongside one of the midfield masters in Paul Scholes, and their former United team-mate and England coach Gary Neville compared the pair to ‘going into a bar and hearing a piano playing’ due to the calm they brought to the midfield together. Andrea Pirlo was the first name mentioned by Carrick in terms of midfielders around Europe he looks up to . Xabi Alonso (right) was also mentioned, as well as Sergio Busquets in midfielder for Barcelona . Carrick felt Marco Verratti (bottom) did a brilliant job for Paris Saint-Germain against Chelsea in Europe . ‘It made me laugh,’ Carrick said. ‘I can see Nev saying that, but it was quite nice in a way. Playing alongside Scholesy I learned so much. He’d take the ball anywhere, he’d put his foot on the ball and try to have influence on the game. ‘It is a lot about your personality, as a person, as a player, that is how I am really, quite quiet and understated, it suits me.’ Gary Neville (centre) compared Carrick's calmness to ‘going into a bar and hearing a piano playing’ Carrick has become a key part of United's side as they look to secure a place in the Premier League top four . In the absence of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, England’s midfield is crying out for an experienced head in the middle and Carrick, if he can stay injury free, is eyeing Euro 2016 as his tournament. ’That’s definitely what I’m striving towards,’ he added. ‘I’ d love to have another real crack at it. Trying to have a bigger influence in the team is the target.’","Michael Carrick has been recalled to the England squad by Roy Hodgson .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has asked his players not to play as many backpasses to goalkeeper David de Gea as he faces mounting criticism over his side's unadventurous performances this season. Despite travelling to Newcastle United on Wednesday in a Champions League spot, United fans booed their team during Saturday's 2-0 win against Sunderland, most notably when an attacking corner was played all the way back to their Spanish 'keeper. Though Van Gaal is keen for supporters to lay off his players, he does admit sharing their frustration at De Gea being over-used as a springboard for attacks. Louis van Gaal said he agreed with the fans that sometimes it was frustrating watching Manchester United . Van Gaal felt that sometimes his team passed the ball back to David de Gea unnecessarily . 'I agree with the fans that we don't have to use the goalkeeper so much,' he said. 'I have seen moments when we could play with a higher tempo without interfering with the goalkeeper. 'Sometimes the players may not see another solution. But I have to support them. Also, a fan has to see that. 'Of course, to attack is more or less the English style of playing a match. But I think the supporters have also enjoyed Manchester United playing in a possession game so it is always a mix of playing both. I think we can still improve in not losing the ball unnecessarily.' United's run of two defeats in 21 matches has failed to paper over some other cracks. Their supporters brought up in the successful Sir Alex Ferguson era chanted 'Attack, attack, attack' in the first half of their victory at Old Trafford at the weekend. Angel di Maria was brought off at half time during United's recent clash with Sunderland at Old Trafford . Robin van Persie remains out with an ankle injury for Manchester United's trip to Newcastle . Out: Van Persie (ankle) Probable line-up: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Evans, Rojo; Januzaj, Blind, Herrera, Di Maria; Rooney, Falcao. And record signing Angel di Maria was brought off after half-time with the £59.7million Argentine looking uncomfortable with Van Gaal's desire to win matches through controlling possession. Van Gaal admits the raft of players he signed in the summer including Di Maria are struggling to come to terms with English football and said it may take 12 months for United fans to see the best of them. 'The first season is always difficult. You can see it with every player we bought – Shaw, Blind, Herrera, Falcao and also Di Maria. 'How long it takes depends on so many different aspects of the game, the match and also the culture of the country. You can not give a general answer – but the general answer is one year! Colombian forward Radamel Falcao has failed to hit the heights expected of him at United . Van Gaal also felt that United's new players needed up to a year to settle in at the club . United's season rests on the next six weeks when they face Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea in the league and Arsenal in an FA Cup semi-final. Although it is a daunting schedule, Van Gaal is taking heart at their run at the end of last year when they rose from 13th to third after a run that included back-to-back away wins at Arsenal and Southampton followed by a thumping 3-0 win against Liverpool.' Robin van Persie is ruled out of the game at St James' Park with an ankle injury while Michael Carrick is only likely to be on the bench having not played since January 23 because of a ruptured muscle. Spanish midfielder Ander Herrera is available despite reports saying he was due in court in Spain on Thursday as part of an ongoing match-fixing investigation. The case, which involves 42 different football figures, has been put back until the summer.","Manchester United were booed by fans in their win against Sunderland .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says captain Steven Gerrard will not find an easy route back into his team on return from injury, particularly given the side's excellent form. Gerrard has been absent from Liverpool's last six matches with a hamstring injury but he could return in this weekend's FA Cup clash with Blackburn Rover having resumed training this week. But his manager says that with Liverpool in a good run of form, Gerrard will have to fight for a place in a side that has enjoyed success recently . Steven Gerrard is back in training with Liverpool, but he won't walk straight back into the team . Brendan Rodgers says Gerrard does not have a god-given right to return to the team straight away . Gerrard returned to training with Liverpool at Melwood after recovering from injury this week . 'There is no-one in the squad who has a God-given right to walk straight into the team,' Rodgers said. 'It probably would be (an issue) for other people but certainly not for me and it wouldn't be for Steven. 'He is very much a team player and if he was on the bench because the team was in good form and playing well I think everyone respects that.' 'It wouldn't be significant for me or for him. If the team is in good form, there wouldn't be an issue. The most important thing is having Steven available. Gerrard catches his breath as Liverpool prepare for the visit of Blackburn to Merseyside in the FA Cup . Gerrard performs a trick during Liverpool's training session as Raheem Sterling looks on at Melwood . Rodgers said Gerrard would not have a problem if he was benched for the in-form outfit . 'To have him back is the most important thing. Let's see how the season pans out. Steven is one of the best players of all time in the Premier League. 'He has still got a couple of days to go and we will assess it. He is still with the rehabilitation team. The team is playing very well. To have him back available for selection is the most important thing.' Rodgers brushed off comparisons between Gerrard and his vice-captain Jordan Henderson after the former Sunderland midfielder scored against Manchester City and Burnley. 'Jordan is a wonderful player, a different player,' he said. 'Because he shoots from outside the box doesn't mean he is the new Steven Gerrard. 'His stature as a footballer is growing all the time. He is already a first class footballer but he is going to go on and become even better. Henderson has stood in as Liverpool captain during Gerrard's absence and has scored twice in a week . Rodgers did not want to label Henderson as the 'next Gerrard' but talked up his development . 'He is vice-captain and has a wonderful role model in Steven but I would ask every young player to follow Steven Gerard by example because he is an incredible professional and football player. 'His stature as a footballer is certainly growing all the time and that is because of his performance level. 'He assists goals, he scores goals, and for me he is just improving every single day. His tactical understanding of systems is developing and he will go on over the next few years. 'He really is a first-class footballer but I think at a big club he will go on and show what a top player he is.'","Steven Gerrard is available for Liverpool again after a hamstring injury .

"The insignia on Floyd Mayweather's baseball cap reads TBE but whether or not he can enhance his claim to be The Best Ever boxer by beating Manny Pacquiao, he already holds the title of world's greatest self-promoting athlete. Not only will May 2 in Las Vegas be the most gigantic happening in the annals of human kind – or something like that – but even admission tickets for the official announcement which is about to take place are like gold-dust. Floyd the Money Man versus Manny the PacMan will be formally launched with more fireworks than a NASA moon rocket this Wednesday. Floyd Mayweather had the TBE cap on after beating Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas last September . Mayweather has also been sporting a TBE t-shirt during his training camp in Las Vegas . Invitations to these media events are usually pressed on we hacks by PR men pleading with us to attend and fans are often allowed in to help fill the room. This one is making a little history all its own by requiring that we apply for accreditation and such is the frenzy that we are warned 'space is limited.' Never mind the richest fight of all time, which was a sellout while still only a gleam in the eye of the promoters, but they could have sold tickets for this head-to-head sabre-rattling by the gladiators in Los Angeles. Given the cost of flights from London, we thank them for not doing so. Not so much as a twitch of a muscle or the flicker of a nerve is to be missed in these weeks in which all roads lead to the MGM Grand Garden Arena on that neon Strip in the desert. For this, Mayweather can take most of the credit. The five years in which he held to ransom the hundreds of millions around the world who have been begging him to face Pacquiao in the ring have generated a commercial monster of unprecedented enormity. Mayweather was on the famous Strip as he took a break from training for his fight with Manny Pacquiao . Pacquiao shadow boxes in the ring as he prepares for the richest fight in history of boxing . Even before these reluctant grooms affirm their vows to each other in public for the first time, estimates as to the potential worth of this fight have soared from a lip-licking $200million to at least an eye-watering $350m and maybe a gob-smacking half a billion. Whatever Mayweather's reasons for stalling – and he has been accused of everything from cowardice (outrageously) to an excessive obsession with his undefeated record (possibly) – he has proved himself to be an economic genius. Had he agreed to this shotgun wedding back in the year 2000 he and Pacquiao would have received half each of a total purse estimated at around $60m. Now he is getting the 60 per cent upside of a deal which is expected to deliver $210m to him and $140m to his arch-rival. The bulk of that money will come from pay-per-view television but claims that Showtime and HBO in America – and either Sky or BoxNation here – will be short-changed by fighters past their prime are being rebuffed by boxing men in the know. Pacquiao's seven-time Trainer of the Year in the US – Freddie Roach – tells us: 'This will be a much better fight for TV and the fans than if it had happened when it was first discussed. The Filipino legend had complained about 'feeling slow' but looked up to speed during his fifth day of training . The 36-year-old is completing his training regime at Freddie Roach's Wild Card Gym in Los Angeles . 'Floyd could well have won back then by running and dodging behind that highly technical defence of his. But now that his legs have slowed a little Manny will have more chances of getting to him, making a real fight of it and beating him. 'For me and Manny this will still be the biggest challenge of our careers. It will still be our most difficult fight. But it is one we can win.' That opinion will gain legs of it own in LA this week, all the time continue to build an already massive market around the world. Mayweather's business acumen has already made him the wealthiest sportsman on the planet. After this there will be no catching him in the foreseeable future. Even as he waits for the biggest pay cheque of all, he continues to enjoy the fruits of his punishing fistic labours. Mr Money's idea of a break from hard training in his hometown Vegas this weekend was a trip along the Strip for a little high-rolling in a casino. Who can deny that's he's earned it? And whatever anyone may think of him, there is no smarter operator in the whole wide world of sport. The first leg of what British boxing hoped would be a world-title double in Liverpool came nastily unstuck at the weekend. Chester's Paul Butler went in to his bid to become a two-division world champion full of promise but ended up flat on his back. After stepping up to bantamweight to defeat Stuart Hall, our somewhat vulnerable IBF belt-holder, Butler took the unusual step of training back down in poundage to challenge super-flyweight champion Zolani Tete. Paul Butler was knocked out by a brutal uppercut from Zolani Tete in the eighth round . Butler was bidding to become a two-division world champion but was beaten by South African Tete . Alarmingly, the rangy South African comprehensively outclassed him before landing a knockout uppercut in the eighth. British boxing is on the rise but this came as a sharp reminder that at its best the hardest game is never easy. Next up at the Echo Arena, on April 19, is Liverpool's own Derry Matthews. The veteran lightweight faces what appears to be an even tougher assignment against WBA champion Richar Abril and will need to box at the highest level of his career if he is to assuage the Butler disappointment.","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao battle it out in Las Vegas on May 2 .

Diego Simeone is expected to sign a contract extension at Atletico Madrid on Tuesday that will keep him at the club until 2020. In a blow to the clutch of English clubs watching the Argentine manager’s situation carefully the former Atletico player and captain has decided to stay in the Spanish capital. His sister Natalia Simeone who represents the Atletico Madrid coach is understood to have closed negotiations on Monday. Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone is expected to sign a contract extension at the club until 2020 .

But it now seems that any Premier League adventure will have to wait. Natalia Simeone told Cadena Cope last week: ‘If all goes well supporters who love Atletico will have some other good news to celebrate very soon.’ That news is now expected to be confirmed at an official presentation on Tuesday.

"Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar thinks Steven Gerrard's head is already in Los Angeles after he received his marching orders against Manchester United on Sunday. The Liverpool captain will leave Anfield in the summer to play for LA Galaxy in the USA, and got sent off in his final clash with Manchester United after just 38 seconds of being on the pitch. Gerrard came steaming into a challenge with Juan Mata initally, before an off-the-ball stamp on Ander Herrera resulted in a straight red card from referee Martin Atkinson. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard apologised to his team-mates and fans after being sent off on Sunday . Juan Mata (top) was on the receiving end of Gerrard's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch . Gerrard then appeared to stamp on Ander Herrera, and received his marching orders from the referee . Former Reds keeper Grobbelaar believes Gerrard wasn't fully focused on the match and is already looking ahead to the next step of his career. 'Steven Gerrard wanted to stamp his authority on to the match,' Grobbelaar told talkSPORT. 'I know that Gerrard’s heart is in Liverpool, and always will be, but his head unfortunately is in Los Angeles. 'He said himself that he takes full responsibility for what his actions were. A lot of other referees would have just given a yellow and warned him to stamp it out because there were some other hefty challenges and some tackles that could've gone either way.' Gerrard is shown the red card by referee Martin Atkinson after just 38 seconds of the second-half .

"Mark Halsey, the controversial former elite referee who lost his role as a regular BT Sport pundit following Premier League upset, has had an invitation to speak to a regional referees association withdrawn following intervention from the highest level. Halsey was due to address the Sheffield Referee Association on how he beat cancer to continue as a top referee. But an objection from an unnamed football figure led to the national Referees Association persuading their Sheffield branch to embarrassingly cancel the appearance of Halsey, who was giving his services free. The email from Laura Ritchie, chairwoman of the RA, read: ‘A senior member of the footballing world has brought it to our attention that you have invited Mark Halsey to be a guest speaker. It is a worry that a figure who is being very negative about top-flight referees won’t send the right message to members. It may be perceived Sheffield RA agree with his viewpoint.’ Mark Halsey was invited to speak to the Sheffield Referee Association regarding his battle against cancer . However his planned appearance was cancelled after an unnamed football figure objected against the talk . Sheffield management then informed members: ‘There was an agreement that we cancel Mark after pressure from the national RA and the wider football world.’ And the Sheffield response to the RA said: ‘Our irritation at having been placed in this position cannot be underestimated. Are we saying that as referees, we are above criticism?’ FA refs chief David Elleray is president of the RA but on Monday night HE denied any involvement. However, Halsey’s strong views on a decline in refereeing standards is certainly born out by the widespread furore around their performances this season. BBC rugby co-commentator Brian Moore reacted to his perceived ‘snub’ at being one of the few TV pundits not included in ITV’s giant World Cup team by tweeting ‘I’ve been told I’m too controversial for TV World Cup coverage. Too c***, I could take but controversial, b*******.’ However, it wasn’t ITV who told Moore he is controversial. The network, happy to employ the more volatile Roy Keane as a football pundit, have had no contact with Moore. BBC rugby co-commentator Brian Moore vented his frustration at being snubbed by ITV on Twitter . Van Praag bid blunder . FIFA presidential candidate Michael van Praag says, if elected, he intends to cut costs — something he’s never heard mentioned during six years of dealings with Zurich, where figures are just plucked out of the air, he claimed. Van Praag will also declare what his FIFA salary would be and wants to know what Sepp Blatter has been paid. The Dutch football leader, who has a budget of €400,000 from his national association for his campaign, is also concerned at the way Fox TV were given the rights to the World Cup in 2026 without a tender to end their resistance to a World Cup in Qatar. Yet all Van Praag’s good intentions are undone by his open offer to Blatter, who he says could carry on as a working honorary president concentrating on the Goal Project funding. Meanwhile, Portuguese contender Luis Figo is rich enough to fund his own campaign but this most charismatic of footballers couldn’t be more dull when he talks FIFA politics. Michael van Praag, pictured with Louis van Gaal in 2014, has said he will cut costs if he replaces Sepp Blatter . Blatter is said to be so confident of winning a fifth term that he feels no need to mount any form of campaign and is addressing the UEFA Congress on Tuesday in his FIFA president’s slot rather than as a candidate. However, the 79-year-old is understood to have engaged well-known Swiss PR figure Klaus Stohlker to advise him on his election strategy. Stohlker, former TV journalist and political author, founded his own PR and consulting business in 1982 and is a long-time friend of Blatter’s. FIFA president Blatter is confident of beating off competition from the likes of Van Praag to win a fifth term . For all the shenanigans, scandals and infighting at the FA over the years, at least there’s never been such an unseemly episode as Germany’s FIFA executive member Theo Zwanziger reporting his successor as German federation president Wolfgang Niersbach to FIFA’s ethics committee over alleged pay and pension irregularities. It is a blatant attempt by Zwanziger to stop Niersbach taking his executive seat. FIFA have cleared Niersbach and UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino said Zwanziger’s claims had been fully rejected, adding: ‘It’s all a bit embarrassing for him and sad for German football.’ Niersbach said: ‘I have not heard of a similar story anywhere in football.’ Theo Zwanziger (left) reported Wolfgang Niersbach (right) to FIFA's ethics committee over pay irregularities .","Mark Halsey was invited to address the Sheffield Referee Association .

"Europe's top human rights watchdog is to rebuke France for its failure to explicitly ban smacking children it was claimed last night. French law forbids violence against children, but recognises the parents' 'right to discipline' children. The Council of Europe is expected to say that the laws on corporal punishment are 'not sufficiently clear, binding and specific', according to Le Monde newspaper. The Council of Europe is expected to say that the French laws, which forbids violence against children, but recognises the parents' 'right to discipline' children are 'not sufficiently clear' It follows a complaint by British children's charity Approach, which argues that France and other council members are violating a section of the European Social Charter calling on signatories to protect children. The council did not comment last night. It is to issue its formal ruling on Wednesday. The council has called for all of its 47 members to ban corporal punishment of children.

"A clever mom in Boston, Massachusetts is giving people a behind-the-scenes look at her stay-at-home job with a heartwarming time-lapse video documenting her day. Kristin DeLano has two sons and a daughter who are all under five years old; each child has different needs, different schedules and different likes and dislikes. In her video, Mrs DeLano shows all these variables as well as her maternal ability to balance them every day. 'We never see what happens behind other family's closed doors, so I thought it would be fun to give everyone a peek into ours,' Mrs DeLano told Huffington Post. Scroll down for video . A well-fed family: The video shows Kristin, her two sons and her baby daughter through their entire day's routine, from breakfast all the way until bedtime . 'My entire day (almost) time lapsed in six minutes,' she explains in the YouTube video description. 'There it is. Minus about an hour or so. Started right after breakfast. Took a few phone calls, and didn't have it going right away when daddy came home, but that's it!' Despite Mrs DeLano remaining at home throughout the entire day, her video clearly demonstrates just how varied and challenging her role as a mother is; throughout the course of just one single day, she takes on the role of entertainer, nurse, teacher and parent all at once. In the video Mrs DeLano is seen preparing meals, changing diapers, arranging crafts and even treating a nosebleed. Part of being a mom: Kristin helps the boys through their playtime, teaching along the way, and when one comes down with a nosebleed, she comes to the resue with a roll of toilet paper .

"Former two-weight world champion Ricky Burns has been left with only £228 to his name after his legal battles with Frank Warren. The 31-year-old, who fights in Texas on May 9 against Omar Figueroa, has declared himself bankrupt this week with debts of £419,888 after a courtroom showdown with his former promoter. Warren had claimed unsuccessfully for £1.8million in lost profits at the High Court in London last year after Burns joined Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom stable on March 11, 2013. But the judge also ruled Burns was not entitled to end the promotional agreement with Warren’s company and owed him commission.

Frank Warren said: ‘I brought a claim against Ricky Burns because he wrongly terminated his management and promotional agreements. I offered to meet him to try to sort things out after he had terminated, but he did not take me up on this offer.’ Burns and Warren are pictured at a press conference in 2012 before they went their separate ways .

"Since September 1996, Arsene Wenger has ruled the roost at Arsenal, not just building a squad and controlling a team, but shaping a club. In almost 19 years in charge of the Gunners, Wenger has won three Premier League titles, lifted five FA Cups, led his team to their only ever European final and masterminded the move to the Emirates. When he does eventually decide to step down, Wenger’s legacy will not just be about his successes, but also his longevity. Arsene Wenger has been at Arsenal for almost 19 years, while every other team has changed manager . Wenger led the Gunners to their first Champions League final, and has won three Premier League titles . The Arsenal boss has been in north London since September 1996, surviving 156 Premier League bosses . In an era where Premier League chairmen are as forgiving to their managers as Jose Mourinho tends to be towards referees, Wenger is approaching two decades in the job – almost 15 years longer than the next longest-serving manager in the division. In fact, since the Frenchman arrived in north London, there have been 156 changes in management at the other clubs in the division. Here Sporstmail looks at the men Wenger has survived… . What counts as a change? With caretaker managers, interim appointments, and even the odd case of two men doing the job at the same time, it can be difficult to tell when exactly a club have officially changed managers. Counting caretaker managers would mean, technically, that David Pleat had been appointed Tottenham manager three times in five years. There were times when it seemed David Pleat just had to wait a few minutes to be caretaker at Spurs again . Ruud Gullit had already left two Premier League clubs before Wenger had been in the job three years . Gordon Strachan (left) replacing Ron Atkinson was the second change after Wenger arrived . So while ‘interim’ managers are included in our total, caretakers are not included unless they were given the job for a fixed term. Added to that, for those few occasions when two men have been in charge at the same time, they are counted as only one sacking unless, as with the case of Roy Evans when he worked alongside Gerard Houlier at Liverpool, one is sacked before the other. Landmarks . That all means that Gus Poyet’s sacking this month is the 156th managerial change since Wenger took over. Ray Harford’s resignation at Blackburn, less than a month after ‘the Professor’ got his feet under the desk at Arsenal, was the first, with five more coming in the 1996-97 season. Ray Harford (left) was the first manager to go after Wenger was appointed, while Gus Poyet is the most recent . Peter Reid’s dismissal from Leeds United in November 2003 marked the 50th reign Wenger had survived, while Steve Bruce’s decision to leave Wigan for Sunderland brought up the century in the summer of 2009. Tony Pulis’ shock resignation from Crystal Palace on the eve of this season was the 150th time a manager had left their job in the Wenger era. Peter Reid, sacked by Leeds in 2003, marked the 50th Premier League manager to go in the Wenger era . When Steve Bruce left Wigan for Sunderland it marked the 100th managerial change since Wenger arrived . Unsurprisingly the rate of change has dramatically increased in recent years. The first half of Wenger’s tenure at Arsenal produced just 63 sackings in a little over nine years. In the same time since then, there have been 93 changes, at a rate of around 10 a season. Last season’s total of 14 managerial changes was, in fact, the largest number in Premier League history. In contrast the 2002-03 season saw the fewest changes since Wenger’s arrival, with only five managers leaving their posts. Tony Pulis' resignation from Crystal Palace last summer was change No 150 since Wenger started . Method of change? The vast majority of the time, when a Premier League manager leaves his job, it’s because he’s been told to clear out his desk. A lucky few get to set their own date, as Wenger surely will in the coming years, but most are pushed before they can jump. Remarkably, in the last 18-and-a-bit years since Wenger joined Arsenal, only 18 managers left by choice to go straight into another job (and three of those went to international management rather than another club), while some resigned and a handful retired. Roy Hodgson is one of only two Premier League managers in the past two decades to leave for England . Steve McClaren also left a Premier League club to take the biggest job in English football . Three times a manager stepped down for health reasons, although two of those were Joe Kinnear, while one manager, Dave Jones, was placed on gardening leave in January 2000. Ron Atkinson (Coventry) and Steve Coppell (Crystal Palace) share the honour of being the two managers in since 1996 to have been removed from their job only to move upwards to director of football, something that may well happen to Wenger when he decides to end his term in management. Which clubs change the most? We all have a good idea who we consider to be the most trigger-happy owners, or the least stable clubs, and it should therefore come as no surprise which two clubs top the list of managerial changes. Chelsea and Newcastle United have each replaced 11 men since Arsene Wenger walked into Highbury. At Stamford Bridge there were only two sackings – Ruud Gullit and Gianluca Vialli – between the arrivals of Wenger and Roman Abramovich, but the revolving door has turned nine times since the Russian arrived. Glenn Hoddle (left) and Alan Shearer have both managed one of the league's most prolific clubs . Jose Mourinho's return for his second spell at Chelsea was the club's 12th appointment since Wenger started . Since Roman Abramovich took over at Chelsea the club have had nine managers, Jose twice, in 12 years . Manchester United - 2 . Everton - 4 . Liverpool - 6 . Aston Villa - 7 . Tottenham - 10 . Chelsea - 11 . Change has at least brought success for Chelsea, but the same cannot be said at St James’ Park, where John Carver is the 12th man to try and pick up a trophy since Arsenal last appointed a manager. The Gunners’ north London rivals Tottenham are just behind Chelsea and Newcastle, having replaced 10 managers since their neighbours went for Wenger. Gerry Francis, Jacques Santini, Christian Gross, George Graham, Glenn Hoddle, Martin Jol, Juande Ramos, Harry Redknapp, Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood have all left since Wenger arrived. Jacques Santini (left) and Martin Jol are two of the 10 Tottenham managers who have been replaced . Tim Sherwood (right) became the 10th Spurs manager to do battle with Wenger last season . Perhaps most impressive in their high number of changes though, are Southampton and Sunderland, who have managed nine Premier League managerial replacements each, despite spending a fair amount of time outside the top flight since 1996. Saints have had seven Wenger years below the Premier League – including two in Legue One – while Sunderland have had five. Of the top flight’s ever-presents, Manchester United have unsurprisingly had the fewest changes, with just Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement and David Moyes’ sacking, while Liverpool have said goodbye to six bosses during Wenger’s tenure. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and Wenger locked horns repeatedly until the former's retirement in 2013 . Who has managed the most clubs? It is not just clubs that can get restless. While Wenger has been happy to stick in one job since Deep Blue Something’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s was top of the charts, other managers prefer to move around. England manager Roy Hodgson has left four Premier League clubs – Blackburn, Fulham, Liverpool and West Brom – in the last 18 years. Harry Redknapp has left five Premier League jobs in the time Wenger has been in his only one . Redknapp won the FA Cup in one of his two spells at Portsmouth, which ended in October 2008 . Stoke City boss Mark Hughes is on his fifth Premier League job since Wenger arrived in north London . Stoke City’s Mark Hughes has matched that, his terms at Blackburn, Fulham, Manchester City and QPR all coming to an end while Wenger stayed put. But neither of them can match Harry Redknapp, who has left five jobs, at four clubs, since the Arsenal boss took charge of his side. Redknapp most recently resigned as QPR manager, but has also been in charge at Tottenham, West Ham and had two spells at Portsmouth in the top flight.","Arsene Wenger has been in charge at Arsenal since September 1996 .

"The father of Real Madrid youngster Jack Harper has revealed that Spain have been in contact over his son's international status following the 19-year-old's Scotland snub. Harper was a shock omission from Ricky Sbragia's Scotland Under 19 squad ahead of key clashes against Austria, Italy and Croatia with the former Sunderland manager citing 'purely tactical' reasons. Now, Harper's father John has warned Scotland that they could be in danger of losing his son to the Spanish national side. Real Madrid youngster Jack Harper has been left out of the latest Scotland Under 19 squad . Scotland Under 19s manager Ricky Sbragia claimed the reasons were 'purely tactical' Among Harper's coaches at Real Madrid are former France international Zinedine Zidane (centre) He told the Daily Record: 'The day after Scotland announced the Under 19 squad, and Jack wasn’t included, Spain were on the phone asking about his position and international status. 'Their national academy is just a few miles from Real Madrid’s own training ground, so they know about Jack because they watch his team often enough.' Despite being left out of Sbragia's latest UEFA Under 19 Championship squad, Harper's father insists that the Madrid starlet remains committed to Scotland. John added: 'Jack wants to play for Scotland. I’m Scottish, so is his mum and the rest of the family. He is committed to Scotland, but if nothing is happening by the time he is 21 then he will have a decision to make because he has a life and a career to fulfil. Hopefully, it won’t come to that.' Harper's father was contacted by Spain shortly after his son's international snub . Sbragia also still believes Harper, who was born in Spain, has a big future ahead of him in a Scotland shirt. He said: 'He's an exceptionally gifted lad, but sometimes we can't carry him. He can be a luxury sometimes. In some cases, if it's going well, he can be a good luxury.' 'Listen, Jack's time will come. The last time I spoke to him, he wanted to really settle in at Real Madrid and find a place there. That's been a big thing for him. 'I've gone with the boys I've seen most in the last six months. We keep tabs on Jack and see video clips of him. We have people over there who keep their eye on him. 'There are others I've left out like Dominic Thomas at Motherwell who will have gripes that they're not in the squad. 'But I've picked a group of 18 which will hopefully do well for us. It's my opinion and I'm not saying it's right. But the squad I've picked is an extremely strong one. 'I can only pick 18 when I really could have picked 26 or 27. I've gone for a physical side and runners. Hopefully I'm right. 'It's purely tactical and there certainly hasn't been a lack of enthusiasm from Jack about playing for Scotland.' Harper is currently midway through a five-year deal with Real Madrid and is tipped to have a big future .","Jack Harper has been left out of the Scotland Under 19 squad .

Bild also report that Bayern may wait until the summer of 2016 to make a move for De Bruyne, who they believe is currently worth around £35million on current form. Meanwhile, De Bruyne's Wolfsburg team-mate Marcel Schafer has urged the 23-year-old to stay for at least another season. He told reporters: 'I think that our chances [of keeping De Bruyne] are really good. He has already experienced not getting so much time on the field at Chelsea, a top club in Europe. Jose Mourinho deemed De Bruyne surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge last year . 'And that is why I think the best thing for him would be to stay for minimum one more year at Wolfsburg. Next year he could play Champions League here and win titles with us. 'If you want to win titles you need extraordinary players. And you really have to say that Kevin de Bruyne is at the moment the best player in the Bundesliga not only because of his stats. You can see that in every single game.

"Red Bull’s design guru Adrian Newey has been accused of lying by the boss of the team’s engine suppliers, Renault. The relationship between the two sides of the partnership that took Sebastian Vettel to his four world titles has disintegrated in recent weeks with Newey and Red Bull team principal Christian Horner both expressing their frustration at Renault’s slow development rate. Newey, 56, told the Mail on Sunday that there was ‘no light at the end of the tunnel’ for the team and accused Renault of failing to engage with them to find a solution. Adrian Newey, pictured with Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz, has been accused of lying by Renault .

He’s too old to change his ways.’ Abiteboul later tweeted a picture of a pair of boxing gloves and boots. 'Packing up to Malaysia. Race (round?) 2', he mischievously posted. Horner claimed after the opening race in Melbourne, when his cars were considerably off the pace all weekend, that the Renault engine was 100bhp short of Mercedes.

Our figures have shown that the lap time deficit between Red Bull and Mercedes in Melbourne was equally split between driveability issues, engine performance and chassis performance. ‘It’s therefore the overall package that needs some help and we have been working with the team to move forward. ‘We’ve been particularly aggressive in development and we should see the results a lot more clearly in Malaysia. Work is still ongoing but even now we are in a completely different place from where we finished Melbourne.’ Mischievously, the FIA have called Horner and Abiteboul to appear together at the official press conference in the Kuala Lumpur paddock on Friday.","Cyril Abiteboul called Adrian Newey a 'liar' after post-Melbourne comments .

"Marouane Fellaini believes Manchester United have what it takes to finish in the top four this season and insists they can become champions again next year. United entered the international break on a high after their 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. The victory stretched their lead over their arch-rivals to five points, with fourth-placed United only eight points adrift of Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea with as many games to go. Marouane Fellaini believes Manchester United can challenge for the Premier League title next season . The midfielder celebrates Juan Mata's goal against Liverpool that put United five points clear in fourth . Fellaini feels that United are ready to see the rest of the season through and secure European qualification . While Fellaini expects Jose Mourinho's men to lift the title in May, he has backed Louis van Gaal's side to become real contenders next season. 'I think Chelsea will win it (this year),' said Fellaini, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail. 'We need to be there next season to show everyone that we can be champions again. To do that we must work hard and to improve too.' For now, returning to the Champions League is the priority for Fellaini and United after their season-long absence from the elite European stage. Van Gaal's side face a difficult run-in to close the campaign with games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal all to come. Fellaini has been in top form during United's last two games, helping them beat Liverpool and Tottenham . Having been signed as David Moyes' only summer purchase in his fateful season, Fellaini had a tough start . But this season the big-haired Belgian has been a key part of the United side since returning from injury . But the win at Anfield inspired renewed optimism and Fellaini is confident that United will get over the line and finish in the top four. 'It's massive because this season we didn’t play the Champions League,’ he said. 'So, for a team like Manchester United, we need to make sure we qualify for next season.' The Belgium international, 27, is finally becoming a force on the field for United after enduring a difficult start following his £27.5million arrival from Everton 18 months ago.

Louis van Gaal and Fellaini shake hands at Anfield - and the latter believes his manager has done a good job . Fellaini has played more games for United this season but has failed to help them win any silverware . 'Van Gaal is good,' said Fellaini. 'He has his philosophy, his own tactics. He has a vision for the team and he knows what he wants from the players, so it is good to work with him. 'I’ve played more games this season, so that is good personally. 'However, this season we haven’t won a trophy but I now hope we finish in the top four to play Champions League. The United players approach their supporters in the Anfield Road end after Sunday's vital victory . Van Gaal has had his critics but his United side are now odds on to qualify for the Champions League . 'That is the most important thing that we focus on now.' Fellaini is part of boot makers New Balance's first football advert launch and follows in the footsteps of United legend Bryan Robson, who famously wore the brand during his playing days. 'Bryan Robson was a great player for United, so it is good to see a player like that play with New Balance,' he said.

"Cristiano Ronaldo shed tears of joy when he finally usurped Lionel Messi as the Ballon d’Or winner for 2013. He was also officially crowned the world’s best player, above Messi, for 2014. But here’s the bad news, Cristiano. Despite the gongs and the widely-held opinion that Ronaldo was superior to his great rival over the past two years, Messi still contributed more valuable goals to his club and country in 2013 and 2014. That is the view of the number-crunchers at The Economist, who have calculated the worth of each player's goals, based on how crucial the goal was to the match result (and the subsequent gains from that result), as well as the importance of the game. Lionel Messi (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) in action during last Sunday's El Clasico duel . Messi's Barcelona beat Ronaldo's Real Madrid 2-1 at the Nou Camp, with the Portuguese scoring . The explanations of the precise formulas used and the value of certain matches in relation to others are both long and complicated, so to read them in full click here. Sportsmail’s calculator also seems to be broken, so again to see the full numbers, let The Economists’s boffins guide you through. Be warned, though: the introduction contains a reference to 'The Pythagorean Formula Extended for Soccer', so it’s not for the faint-hearted. But the key facts are these. Messi’s (still fantastic) total of 86 goals over the period does not compare with Ronaldo's superhuman 105. Ronaldo shed tears of joy when he won the Ballon d'Or over Messi in 2013 . The Real Madrid hero stripped off to celebrate his goal in the Champions League final last season . But Ronaldo's penalty against Atletico Madrid was virtually worthless, according to The Economist . Each of Ronaldo’s 105 goals, however, were worth an average of 0.40 points to his team in relation to the most likely result of the match before the goal was scored. By contrast, Messi’s 86 goals were worth an average of 0.47 points each. And if that sounds like gobbledegook, essentially this can be explained in simple terms: a goal in a match where the score is tied 1-1 in the final minutes yields more points (or aggregate value in cup ties) to his team than a goal scored in a match where the player's team is already winning 3-1. The Economist uses Ronaldo’s three goals in the semi-final and final of last year’s Champions League as an example to show their relative lack of value. In the second leg of the semi-final against Bayern Munich, Ronaldo scored when Real led 3-0 and 4-0 on aggregate. And in the final against Atletico Madrid, his penalty in extra-time when Madrid were 3-1 ahead had a virtually negligible value. Messi has rediscovered his best form this season after losing out to Ronaldo since 2013 . Messi is on international duty with Argentina and is pictured here training in Washington . Messi was all smiles here at the 2013 awards nominations but Ronaldo walked off with the prize . The importance of Messi's goals means he should have claimed the big prize six times, says The Economist . Messi, however, scored a winning goal in the final 20 minutes of a match on five different occasions in 2013 and 2014, which hands him the advantage over Ronaldo. The Economist suggests that the only reason that the Argentina star has not claimed six Ballon d’Ors in a row is ‘Messi fatigue’. If you've got a spare week or so, a working abacus and Carol Vorderman available for a chat, you could try to prove them wrong… .","Cristiano Ronaldo has won the last two world player of the year awards .

"Arsene Wenger has branded Leonardo Jardim a liar after the Monaco coach accused the Frenchman of a lack of respect following Arsenal's exit from the Champions League. Jardim, whose side beat the Gunners on away goals in the last 16 of the competition, said Wenger left for the changing rooms early rather than shaking his hands after the Ligue 1 side's impressive 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg. The Portuguese boss thus decided not to thank the 65-year-old following Arsenal's 2-0 victory in the return fixture. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim reacts on the pitch at the end of their Champions League win on away goals . Arsene Wenger said he wanted to shake Leonardo Jardim's hand at the final whistle but he was celebrating . The Monaco coach claims he did so as Wenger didn't congratulate him after the first-leg victory . Speaking after their progression to the quarter-finals, Jardim said: 'In the first leg, when I wanted to thank Arsene and shake his hand, it's true that Arsene didn't shake my hand, so even though Monaco did everything to make life comfortable for Arsenal tonight, I decided not to thank him. 'I think it was disrespectful. Right now, we're celebrating and we think Arsenal did not show enough respect during the first leg.' Wenger though insists such claims are lies, and says Jardim was too busy celebrating with his team to notice that the Arsenal boss had waited to congratulate him in north London.

"Republic of Ireland winger James McClean has played down fears that he could miss Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland through injury. McClean was sent for a scan on Tuesday after limping out of training at Gannon Park in Malahide, leaving manager Martin O'Neill with his fingers crossed. However, the Wigan midfielder has insisted he will be ready for the Group D clash even if he may not train again until later in the week.

But the winger has brushed off injury fears and has insisted he's ready for Sunday's crucial clash in Dublin . McClean told the Irish Independent: 'The ankle should be fine. I said I'd give it a go in training, but unfortunately it was just too sore to carry out the session. 'I went and had a scan and thankfully it's just some bone bruising. It should be cleared up in time for the weekend's game, which is obviously positive news. 'I will just need to rest it now with plenty of ice and re-evaluate it in the morning to see if I can train. If not, then hopefully I'll be able to get a training session or two in before the game.' However, O'Neill still has concerns over full-back Stephen Ward and midfielder Darron Gibson, who are struggling with ankle and groin problems respectively.

"A grandfather 'used like a football' by hooligans was today in a coma and fighting for his life after a matchday pub brawl that police broke up using CS gas. Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, was found on the ground with serious head injuries following the fight involving about 15 people after his side’s match at Southend United in Essex. Football fans have already raised more than £5,000 towards transport and accommodation costs for Mr Dobbin’s family, who are travelling from Mildenhall, Suffolk, to visit him in Southend Hospital. Scroll down for video . Brain damage: Father-of-three Simon Dobbin (left), who is married to Nicole (right), 43, also suffered damaged hips, broken ribs and a broken nose in the attack - and he is now on a life-support machine . Before the trouble: Mr Dobbin (centre) with fellow Cambridge United fans at Roots Hall for the match against Southend United on Saturday. It was attended by 7,224 fans, including 791 supporters from Cambridge . His father-in-law Jim Faley told the Bury Free Press: ‘If Simon doesn’t come around soon, he may never wake up. We are all hoping - but in the back of our minds we are not 100 per cent sure.’ ‘Even if he comes out in a wheelchair, at least he will still be with us. There were 12 to 15 guys who came out of the pub, they were singing and dancing, and then they just jumped them. ‘The doctors aren’t holding out much hope. They [the attackers] just used him like a football. According to some people, if it wasn’t for his friend laying on top of him they would have killed him.’ Father-of-three Mr Dobbin, who is married to Nicole, 43, suffered brain damage, damaged hips, broken ribs and a broken nose in the attack - and he is now on a life-support machine. Terry Waye, manager of the Half Moon pub in Mildenhall, where Mr Dobbin is a regular, told the Cambridge News: ‘The last we have heard is that he may come off the ventilator on Wednesday. 'But he will still be in a coma and he may not pull through. If he does he may never walk again and has suffered brain damage. He is the most gentle man I know and very kind.' Scene: Mr Dobbin was found on the ground with serious head injuries following the fight involving about 15 people outside The Railway Tavern pub - next to Prittlewell train station, and a short walk from Roots Hall . Brawl: Police were called to the scene at about 7.20pm on Saturday, before arresting a 33-year-old man from Southend and a 23-year-old man from Westcliff on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm . Mr Dobbin's son Liam said on Facebook: ‘I can't explain how much we appreciate all the support. ‘My dad is a well-loved bloke who cares so much for everyone and it's nice to see when times get tough like this everyone pulls together and supports him. Thank you.’ The skirmish followed a League Two match between Southend and Cambridge at Roots Hall stadium, a short walk from The Railway Tavern pub - next to Prittlewell train station. Police were called to the scene at about 7.20pm on Saturday, before arresting a 33-year-old man from Southend and a 23-year-old man from Westcliff on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The first was due to answer bail yesterday, while the latter was bailed to May 27. Witnesses reported seeing about 20 police cars and a helicopter on Saturday night - while one fan claimed to have escorted his father and wife out of the pub's back door when the fighting began. Dan Wilson, a Southend fan who lives near the pub and witnessed the scene from his home, told MailOnline: ‘We heard shouting coming from the pub, and saw about four guys coming out. ‘There were guys inside the pub trying to get out, and then the guys outside the pub started chucking a billboard outside through the door. All you could hear was glass being thrown. ‘Four guys started walking towards Prittlewell station down the hill and about 20 people ran across the road. Someone said “you've just hit my old man”. Then they've all gone into the pub. ‘I saw people running across the road - and two guys punched the window of the pub with their hand, before coppers dragged them away. It happened so quickly.’ Another supporter named Rayleigh Dan, writing on the Southend fans’ forum ShrimperZone, said on Saturday that he heard a window being broken before people in the pub rushed outside. He added: ‘The next thing I knew the police had cordoned off the pub and we weren't allowed to leave for about an hour. Following this they examined everyone thoroughly. ‘We had to give full details of name and address, what we had and hadn't saw - they we're scanning and filming us with some sort of camera. Confrontation: In a completely separate incident, fans also told of trouble outside the Spread Eagle pub – next to the football ground – before the match, and a video (above) showed supporters being moved along on the pavement outside . Tense scenes: Six Southend fans were issued with banning orders last season, compared to one from Cambridge, according to Home Office data. Pictured above is another view of scenes before the match . ‘I'm not one for trouble so didn't recognise the device. It was horrible to experience and I hope anyone involved is caught and dealt with swiftly.’ A 47-year-old man from Cambridge was also arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage, after the pub’s door was smashed. He has since received a police caution. Earlier, fans told of trouble outside the Spread Eagle pub – next to the football ground – before the match, and a video showed supporters being moved along on the pavement outside. The game - which was billed in advance by Southend as a 'Community Day' - finished 0-0 and was attended by 7,224 fans, including 791 supporters from Cambridge. Cambridge chairman Dave Doggett said: ‘The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Cambridge United are with Simon and his family and friends.’ And a Cambridge club statement said: ‘Simon Dobbin was walking to Prittlewell train station with his friend and a small group of fellow United fans after watching the rugby in a pub following the U's 0-0 draw at Southend on Saturday. Match: Southend United's Barry Corr beats Cambridge United's Richard Tait to the ball during the 0-0 draw . Location: The Railway Tavern (file image) is next to Prittlewell station, on the London Liverpool Street line . ‘The U's fans made the 500m walk to Prittlewell station but were attacked as they made their way down towards the platform. Simon remains in Southend University Hospital in a critical condition.’ A statement on the website raising funds for Mr Dobbin - which had already doubled its £2,500 goal by 9am today – said: ‘A loving gentle giant who is a father, husband, son, brother, uncle, brother-in-law, son-in-law, grandad and a top friend was brutally beaten and left in a coma fighting for his life. ‘He is suffering brain damage. We are asking for your support and donations - however much you can afford - to help towards costs of transport and accommodation and any other general financial needs of Simon, his wife and children. I want to thank you for your donations and support. Please send a prayer to Simon for a full recovery.’ In addition, a charity football match has been organised in support of Mr Dobbin and his family at non-league side Mildenhall Town FC on Sunday at 1pm. An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Our officers were called to the road following reports from members of the public that around 15 football supporters were fighting in the street near the Railway pub.' Six Southend fans were issued with banning orders last season, compared to one from Cambridge, according to the Home Office. Both figures are relatively low compared to other League Two clubs.","Simon Dobbin, 42, found on ground with serious head injuries after fight .

"Barcelona defender Gerard Pique has admitted that if he supported La Liga rivals Real Madrid, Spain team-mate Iker Casillas would be his 'idol'. The duo came face-to-face as rivals in Sunday's El Clasico as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 2-1 to open up a four-point gap between the two clubs at the top of La Liga, with Pique being voted man of the match by his own fans. Madrid goalkeeper Casillas, on the other hand, hasn't had much too smile about lately and the 33-year-old has been on the receiving end of criticism this year after a number of high profile blunders. Gerard Pique was at his very best at the heart of the Barcelona defence against Real Madrid . The 28-year-old was voted man of the match by Barcelona fans after helping his team to a 2-1 win over Madrid . But despite the club rivalry, Pique, who made his Spain debut in 2009 against England, has backed his international team-mate and has suggested some criticism is unfair. 'He has been one of the best goalkeepers in the world for many years,' he told Cadena SER. 'To understand the whistles at the Santiago Bernabeu I guess you'd have to be there. 'If I was a supporter of Madrid, he'd be my idol, the standard I'd hold myself to. He is an example for all Madrid players.'

However, Pique, 28, has admitted that he doubts he'll ever switch allegiances as he would find it hard to leave Barcelona for their arch rivals. 'One can never say never, but I very much doubt it,' he added when asked if he'd ever consider a move to Real Madrid.

"Fraser Forster has been ruled out for the rest of the season and may miss the start of the next after scans revealed he has broken his kneecap. Forster came off injured during Southampton's win against Burnley on Saturday and was pulled out of the England squad, with estimates now suggesting he could be out for between nine months and a year. The Saints have made a statement to confirm that Forster has undergone surgery on the injury to his left patella tendon, and said they will wait to assess how long he will be missing for until the affects are known. Southampton keeper Fraser Forster suffered a knee injury after colliding with Burnley's Sam Vokes . Concerned Southampton stars look on as Forster receives treatment on the pitch following the collision . 'Southampton Football Club can confirm that Fraser Forster has successfully undergone surgery on the knee injury he suffered during Saturday’s win over Burnley,' read the statement. 'A longer-term prediction of when Forster will return to action will be made following further assessment once the effects of his operation have settled down. The club’s medical staff are confident he will make a full recovery.' It is bad timing for England boss Roy Hodgson after learning Ben Foster will be out for six months with a cruciate knee ligament injury. Rob Green was called up for the games against Lithuania and Italy.

Referee Roger East checks on Forster in the immediate aftermath of the challenge . England goalkeeper Joe Hart admitted that the injuries to Foster and Forster have hit the England camp hard but backs Rob Green to step up in their absence. Hart said: 'I was gutted for Ben and Fraser. It’s really, really sad news. It has rocked us all as a goalkeeping group and rocked all the lads in the squad because they are great guys and they are having a great season. 'But Greeny has come in and hopefully he can profit. He did brilliant in the Championship last year. I remember watching him in the play-off final, when he was man of the match for me. QPR are in a bad position but he has been fantastic this season. 'Greeny is rock solid. His mentality is great. And he is a very good goalkeeper who has been playing at the top level for a long time. There are no surprises.'

"Championship side Cardiff City have revealed their new badge to be worn on players' kits from the 2015/2016 season with an announcement on Twitter. Owner Vincent Tan had already approved to change the club's home shirts back from red to blue in January, following a prolonged dispute with supporters; and now, the 63-year-old has agreed to give Cardiff's Bluebird mascot a prominent position in the re-designed crest. The new design also features a small dragon at the bottom of the badge similar to the one found at Cardiff City Hall. Cardiff City have revealed their new club badge with the Bluebird mascot taking up a prominent position . A club statement read: 'Projecting our Welsh heritage, the stance was taken from the national flag, as has been seen on our crest or shirt for a number of years. 'Celebrating Asian linked culture, design and tradition influences, we also looked to create a dragon that could be primarily owned and appreciated locally. 'To achieve this the main influence was drawn from the dragon placed on top of Cardiff City Hall, as has been the case since 1904'. Cardiff's controversial switch to red shirts was introduced in June 2012 after Tan bought the club. He believed that the new colour would improve Cardiff's 'appeal in international markets.' The Welsh side were promoted to the Premier League in April 2013, but lasted just one season and fell to relegation in May the following year.

"Ever wished your odd-shaped boiled egg could roll around your mouth with spherical ease? This unusual kitchen gadget promises to do that - because it will transform your oval egg into a round golf ball. The Sports Huevos-Egg Shapers are perfect for sports fans wanting to serve dishes that feature the unmistakable shape of dimpled golf balls and were invented by design company Monkey Business. Scroll down for video . The Sports Huevos-Egg Shaper is able to transform an oval egg into a spherical ball . Tee-time! After just a minute in the gadget your eggs will now look like perfect golf balls . To create the ball-shaped eggs you boil one for a few minutes then allow it to cool enough to be able to peel the shell off. Once the shell is gone you place the warm egg in the shaper, squeeze it shut and submerge it in cold water for a few minutes to set. As it cools the egg takes on the shape of the golf ball. They also come in tennis and football varieties, and each pack of shapers costs £9.95 from Luckies of London. From left to right: To use them just boil an egg, peel off the shell and pop it in a Sports Huevos  Add the ball into a bowl or pan of cold water and leave for a few minutes for the mould to make an impression . Caroline Burman, from Luckies, said: 'Sports Huevos were dreamed up by Israeli design company Monkey Business. 'They come in three styles - golf, tennis and football. 'They're aimed at anyone who wants to make their breakfast more egg-citing. They make a great Easter gift for anyone sporty, even if it's an armchair tennis fan, she said. 'To use them just boil an egg, peel off the shell and pop it in a Sports Huevos while it's still warm. 'Add the ball into a bowl or pan of cold water and leave for a few minutes for the mould to make an impression. 'The reaction to them has been fantastic. 'People love personalising their cooking, and it's a great little gift for sports fanatics at Easter - it certainly makes a healthier alternative to chocolate.'

The kitchen gadget is three-inches long and two-inches wide and can also be used to sharpen parsnips and courgettes as well as other similarly-shaped vegetables . Monkey Business hit the headlines last year when they launched a carrot peeler in the shape of a pencil sharpener. The Karoto looks and works like an oversized pencil sharpener to peel vegetables such as courgettes and carrots or any similar-shaped vegetable such as the cucumber or parsnip. Its creators also claim the time-saving invention is safer than slicing the skin off vegetables compared to a standard peeler or knife. Karoto was designed by Avichai Tadmor for Monkey Business design studio in Israel. His team claim the Karoto can completely peel a carrot in less than 30 seconds and say that not only does it save time but the shavings can also be used to decorate salads.

"Mats Hummels is in the frame to leave for Manchester United, Ilkay Gundogan has yet to sign a contract extension and can leave in 2016 and even the much-vaunted re-signing of Marco Reus might have simply been a stalling tactic to wait for a move to Barcelona next summer. On top of all that, Borussia Dortmund, the club which charmed the world two years ago on their rampaging run to the Champions League final, have battled relegation all season and were comprehensively beaten by Juventus in the Champions League last week. You might be forgiven for thinking that here was a club on the slide. But what about the notion of Dortmund in Europe next season? It would seem a non-starter. Borussia Dortmund are starting to look up again following a nightmare start to the season . Part of Dortmund's remarkable 10,000-strong support in Hannover for their Bundesliga match last weekend . Defender Mats Hummels has been strongly linked with a summer move to Manchester United . For most of the world, their last sight of Dortmund's plight in the Bundesliga were those infamous photos of captain Hummels and goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller climbing the surround fencing to reason with angry fans from the 'Yellow Wall' after the home defeat by Augsburg last month left the team bottom. Yet the 3-2 win at Hannover at the weekend was a sixth victory in a run of eight games undefeated and sparked some crazy talk. 'Now we need to focus our eyes in the direction of the Europa League,' said double goalscorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Club chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke was a little more cautious. 'It's more important to put some distance between us and the relegation battle first,' he said. While manager Jurgen Klopp and Hummels struck some sensible middle ground. 'We're no longer in the middle of a relegation battle,' said Klopp. 'Let's get to the point whereby we mathematically can't be relegated and then let's see how many games we have.' Hummels, looking ahead to what would normally be a title-deciding clash with Bayern, said: 'We want to beat Bayern. At the moment we're in no-man's land but we could still slip back. If we beat Bayern, then we'll see.' Star man Marco Reus has signed a contract extension but could still move to Barcelona in 2016 . Ilkay Gundogan (right) has yet to commit to a new Dortmund contract and could leave in the summer . After an upturn in form, Dortmund find themselves just five points off a Europa League place . Manager Jurgen Klopp (second right) with Sebastian Kehl and Jakub Blaszczykowski after Saturday's win . Whether Europe is realistic or not - they are five points off the Europa League places with eight games to play - Dortmund are in a much better place than a couple of months ago. No-one truly believed they could go down, yet at times they seemed intent on testing the proposition to the full. But Reus signing a new four-year contract was an enormous boost, all the more so as it contained no release clause. It may well be that Reus joins Barcelona in the summer of 2016, the Catalan club where his friend Marc-Andre ter Stegen already plays understood to be his preferred destination. Even so, Reus should be at the Westfalenstadion next season. Hummels may not be. Louis van Gaal attempted to bring him back to Bayern Munich when coach there; he will undoubtedly try to do the same again this summer, though he will have to meet the £35m asking price. Interestingly, sources at Dortmund are already putting it about that £35m would make up for the shortfall of missing out in the Champions League, which sounds like a pre-sale process of softening up the fans. The lowest point in Dortmund's season came when players like Hummels had to front up to the fans . But an upturn in fortunes has lifted them out of relegation danger - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (left) and Marco Reus here wear masks to celebrate a goal in the 3-0 defeat of rivals Schalke . The Dortmund player salute their travelling support after last weekend's 3-2 win at Hannover . The key question remains about the man who has come to personify Dortmund, Klopp. Like Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, Klopp's personality, tactics and energy seem to embody every area of the club. Understandably Klopp is always considered when top jobs come up. He was on the shortlist to replace Roberto Mancini at Manchester City but did not impress in interview - the passion that drives his teams sits uncomfortably with the increasingly corporate world of football executives. It looks as though those pushing for him as a natural replacement for Arsene Wenger at Arsenal overplayed their hand somewhat. The intensity of the rivalry with Bayern Munich means he is highly unlikely to end up there when Pep Guardiola ends his time in 2016. Striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang poses for a photo with Dortmund fans after Saturday's win . Former Manchester United man Shinji Kagawa celebrates with Reus after scoring at Hannover . And there is a feeling that many teams are now adept at dealing with the frenzied counter-attacking style and that he needs to add nuance to the tactics that so recently shocked Europe's best sides. For now it looks as if Klopp and Dortmund's fates are bound together. At times, the rollercoaster season has seemed a projection on the ups and downs of Klopp's own volatile personality. Yet it's not so long ago he was a genuine wunderkind of European football. If he can emerge refreshed and re-energised from this season's chaos, there seems no reason why Dortmund shouldn't rise again in Europe. The next few weeks should tell us much. If Dortmund do make the Europa League, then you might conclude that the rebuilding process is already underway.","Borussia Dortmund have turned around their season after disastrous start .

"Martin Skrtel was hit with a three-match ban on Wednesday for stamping on Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, but the Liverpool defender escaped any further action after he appeared to mock the FA by posting a picture of clowns on social media. The photograph appeared on Skrtel’s Instagram account on Wednesday morning, shortly before the FA announced that he had been found guilty of deliberately treading on De Gea towards the end of Liverpool’s 2-1 defeat to their rivals at Anfield on Sunday. The FA are aware of the post but have decided not to take the matter further. Martin Skrtel's foot lands on David de Gea's leg in the incident which saw the FA charge the defender . Skrtel could have been in more trouble for posting this picture of clowns after the FA upheld his  ban . Premier League: Arsenal away,  April 4 . FA Cup Sixth round: Blackburn away, April 8 . Premier League: Newcastle at home, April 13 . Skrtel, 30, had denied the FA charge which was brought on the basis of video evidence, after referee Martin Atkinson confirmed that he did not see the incident with De Gea. The Slovakia defender becomes the second Liverpool player to be banned for violent conduct in the game after Steven Gerrard was given an automatic three-game suspension for stamping on Ander Herrera just 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute. Both players will now miss the trip to third-placed Arsenal a week on Saturday and Newcastle’s visit to Anfield on April 13, as well as Liverpool’s FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn five days earlier. Liverpool also have a number of injury concerns arising from the United game. Daniel Sturridge (hip) and Adam Lallana (groin) have withdrawn from England duty, while Raheem Sterling is expected to do the same after playing in tomorrow’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley. Skrtel was charged with violent conduct but claimed the alleged stamp was not intentional . A three-man panel of former elite officials reviewed the footage after it was missed by Martin Atkinson (right) Brendan Rodgers has a major selection headache ahead of the trip to Arsenal in the Premier League . Sterling has been having injections in a toe injury and is unlikely to risk aggravating the problem by playing in Tuesday’s friendly with Italy. Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has been having scans on an ankle injury at Belgium’s training camp after colliding with Wayne Rooney on Sunday and Dejan Lovren has pulled out of the Croatia squad with a recurring abdominal strain. Lovren would have been an ideal candidate to replace Skrtel, who made no secret of his feelings yesterday when the FA announced that he had been found guilty of deliberately treading on De Gea’s right shin. A three-man panel of elite officials reviewed the footage on Monday and agreed unanimously that it was a red card offence. The 30-year-old denied the charge and argued that any contact with De Gea was unintentional, but an independent disciplinary commission decided otherwise yesterday. Captain Steven Gerrard was sent off after stamping on Manchester United's Ander Herrera on Sunday . Gerrard will also miss three games after seeing red for this stamp during the 2-1 defeat . An FA statement was released at lunchtime shortly after Skrtel had posted a photograph of four clowns on social media in what was interpreted as a clear dig at the authorities. The FA have been known to punish thinly-veiled criticism before — not least when Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was fined £10,000 last season for bringing the game into disrepute after making sarcastic comments about match officials following a defeat by Sunderland. It is understood that they did not think there was enough evidence on this occasion to justify a similar charge against Skrtel. He is currently in Slovakia preparing for tomorrow night’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Luxembourg and next week’s friendly against the Czech Republic. Considering the problems afflicting Rodgers and his Anfield squad at the moment, it is probably just as well.","Martin Skrtel set to miss games against Arsenal, Newcastle and Blackburn .

The seven met chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Monday and  monitored training under Spaniard Pep Guardiola on Tuesday and Wednesday, Bayern said. In an interview for Bayern's official You Tube channel, Zidane said: 'It's an incredibly organised club with people like Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Matthias Sammer, who used to play football and really live and breathe the game . Then you combine that with someone like Pep Guardiola and the players that are full of desire and have a very precise footballing philosophy.'

"He's a top footballer with Hamburg, but Maxi Beister has more than just good ball skills, it seems. The midfielder has turned inventor, designing a combination beaker and bowl to help stop excitable football fans spilling food or drink while they are watching him on the pitch. Sportsman Biester dreamed up the double act - called the Maxicup - three years ago while he was trying to juggle a cup of Coke and a bowl of snacks during a trip to the cinema. Scroll down for video . Maxi Biester with his combination beaker and bowl, the Maxicup which can carry a drink and food at once . The 24-year-old footballer demonstrates that he has more than just good ball skills with his new invention . He said: 'I thought there has to be a better way than this and one of my friends said, ''Why don't you invent one then?""'. The 24-year-old Hamburg star added: 'I thought about it for a few minutes and then I decided that's exactly what I'll do. I'll make it myself.' Beister's new Maxicup carries a drink in a supersize cup while the attached bowl not only carries the snacks but also seals the top of the cup, too. He explained: 'It means you can carry everything in one hand without spilling anything at all.' The Maxicup holds a drink in a supersize cup while the snack bowl on top also acts as a sealant . This weekend 4,000 prototype cups were distributed at Hamburg's Imtech Arena stadium in the northern German city on Sunday during their match against Mainz. Beister said ahead of the handout: 'We'll be giving away free cups and food so we'll see just how the fans like them. In my experience, football fans are very vocal and soon let you know if you've got it wrong.' The soccer star's new Future Cup company is planning to trial the Maxicup at cinemas as well. Beister added: 'I'm very hopeful. It makes a change from football and I've got a good feeling about it.'","Hamburg midfielder Maxi Beister had idea three years ago when at cinema .

"Mesut Ozil is 'convinced' that he can win the Ballon d'Or within the next few years, as long as he continues to develop well at Arsenal. The German World Cup winner has endured a turbulent time since his £42.5million move to the Emirates in 2013, but has rediscovered his form in recent weeks. As Ozil continues to adapt to the 'physical test' of the Premier League, the creative midfielder believes he will one day reach the same level as the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.

'I’m feeling very positive. I’m a world champion and I play at a top club in the Premier League.

"Marouane Fellaini has revealed his ultimate five-a-side team - and there's even a spot for his old Everton pal Sylvain Distin alongside just one of his Manchester United team-mates. The Belgium international, 27, is back to playing his best football having endured a difficult start to life at Old Trafford following his £27.5million arrival from Everton 18 months ago. He has become a key figure in manager Louis van Gaal's plans, scoring four goals to help fourth-placed United maintain their quest for a return to the Champions League next season. Manchester United and Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini has picked his ultimate five-a-side team . Fellaini, pictured during a photshoot for New Balance Football, has been in excellent form in recent weeks . Former Everton star Fellaini includes one of his Manchester United team-mates in his dream five-a-side team . He impressed in United's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday and has now linked up with his international team-mates ahead of their forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Cyprus and Israel. Fellaini, however, was unable to accommodate the likes of Belgian pals Eden Hazard, Vincent Kompany or Thibaut Courtois in his ultimate fives team. He failed to find room for himself and the likes of Wayne Rooney, Angel di Maria and Robin van Persie too. Yet he did manage to select one United colleague in his fearsome starting line-up. Sylvain Distin is Marouane Fellaini's best friend and he says the Everton defender is a great player . Fellaini's United team-mate David De Gea has been in superb form this season and gets a place in goal . Real Madrid midfielder Zinedine Zidane nets a superb volley against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 . 'The keeper? I play with good keepers, it is hard to pick!' said Fellaini, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail as part of the launch for the first New Balance Football advert. 'But the keeper I choose... it has to be (David) De Gea. I need a defender too, so I will choose Sylvain Distin. 'He is my best mate and a great player as well. And then it has to be (Zinedine) Zidane, (Lionel) Messi, (Cristiano) Ronaldo.' It is no surprise to see Lionel Messi (above) and Cristiano Ronaldo (below) in Fellaini's five-a-side dream team . Indeed a formidable five-a-side team and one the towering Belgian cannot fit himself into. Although Hazard fails to make the cut, Fellaini believes the Chelsea star has been the best player in the Barclays Premier League this season. Jose Mourinho's side have a six-point lead at the top of the table, with a game in hand and Fellaini expects his compatriots Courtois and Hazard will be toasting glory in May. 'At the moment, Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League,' said Fellaini. 'I think Chelsea will win the title.' Fellaini says Eden Hazard has been the Premier League's best player this season while Chelsea will win title .

"Lewis Hamilton is determined to' create history' again this Formula One season after insisting there is more to come despite a perfect start to the new year. Reigning world champion Hamilton claimed pole, fastest lap and race win in the opening grand prix of the campaign in Australia earlier this month. With team-mate Nico Rosberg second it was abundantly clear Mercedes will take some stopping again this term following a dominant 2014. Lewis Hamilton poses for a picture with a fan at a meet-and-greet session in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday . Hamilton is expected to go head-to-head with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg once more in 2015 . Hamilton has vowed to create history at Mercedes as he bids to win his third world championship . Mercedes set a new record for victories in a season with 16 from the 19 races, surpassing the prior mark of 15 set by McLaren in 1988 and Ferrari in 2002 and again in 2004. The German manufacturing giant also equalled Red Bull's 2011 record of 18 poles for the year, with their only blip in Austria where both Hamilton and Rosberg made errors to let in Williams' Felipe Massa. The worry for Mercedes' rivals this year is the team appear to have taken a step forward, with Hamilton showing no let up in his desire to make it three world titles. 'In terms of my performance I've got more to come,' said Hamilton ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix. 'I've been spending time with the engineers and I'm going to work really hard to understand. 'Last year when I went to Malaysia I went fresh. It was like my first race of the year. The British driver appeared in relaxed spirits as he sets sights on a third Formula One title . The Mercedes drivers look set to dominate the remainder of the season after setting the pace in Australia . Rosberg and Hamilton sign autographs for the dozens Mercedes-supporting fans in Malaysia . 'I went into the race not really knowing how long the tyres would last, but what happened turned out to be exceptional. 'After that race there was this big debrief and a document done to explain everything I did. 'Now I've won in Australia I'm going to extract everything from my data and see how I can better my performance. I definitely feel in this next race I can be better than I was last time out.' Asked of Hamilton whether it was Mercedes' target to win every race this season, he replied: 'The target's always been to win every race, even in the bad days. 'But this year we have an awesome car with improved reliability, so the target is to create history again.' Hamilton won in Malaysia last year ahead of Mercedes team-mate Rosberg . Hamilton is aware, however, of the potential perils and pitfalls that lie ahead which could scupper such aspirations. 'To pick up where we left off last year was awesome, but if 2014 showed us anything it's that putting together a whole season is never easy,' assessed Hamilton. 'Winning the first race is just one small step in a long journey and I'm not reading anything into it. 'The next step is Malaysia and that's all I've been focusing on since we left Melbourne. 'The race is really tough with the heat and humidity, but I feel ready for anything right now and the aim is to repeat last year's performance. 'It took me eight attempts to win this race before I finally made it to the top step last year. I don't plan on waiting that long again. 'From an outsider's perspective it appeared Hamilton crucially drew first blood in what is expected to be another intense season-long battle with Rosberg. Hamilton, though, suggested otherwise, stating: 'Psychologically it doesn't make any difference for me. 'I won the championship again last year, and I felt like it wasn't a fluke. I'm deserving of where I am. 'And I worked damn hard to get that win in Australia. Again there wasn't any luck involved.'","Lewis Hamilton heads into Malaysian Grand Prix leading the championship .

"Vincent Kompany was benched by Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini for Wednesday night's visit of Leicester City. The captain was one of five changes from the side that lost 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday. Kompany, 28, has been criticised for a series of high-profile errors. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany (right) was dropped to the bench for the visit of Leicester . Kompany has come in for criticism this season following a number of high-profile errors for the champions . He gave away a penalty against Arsenal, could have done better with both of Barcelona's goals in a 2-1 Champions League defeat and was dispossessed by Philippe Coutinho in the build up to Jordan Henderson's strike for Liverpool at Anfield. A poll in the local newspaper, the Manchester Evening News, saw fans vote to drop Kompany from the squad. Pellegrini has backed the Belgian, who he described as 'a great player', but rested him for the clash with Nigel Pearson's bottom-of-the-table visitors. Midfield pair Samir Nasri and Fernandinho dropped out of the squad altogether while Pablo Zabaleta and Edin Dzeko were alongside Kompany on the bench. Wilfried Bony, a £28m signing from Swansea City, made his full debut alongside Sergio Aguero while Martin Demichelis partnered Eliaquim Mangala at the heart of defence in place of Kompany.

"An aspiring foreign manager emboldened by radical ideas meets a settled, ego-fuelled dressing room that’s enjoyed no little success. Sound familiar? For Peter Lawwell, the warning signs upon appointing Ronny Deila to the Celtic manager’s post last summer were to be found not a million miles from home. When Paul le Guen arrived at Rangers in the summer of 2006, there seemed solid grounds for fans of the Ibrox club not to question if the Frenchman would be a runaway success, but to just what extent. Celtic manager Ronny Deila (left) and chief executive Peter Lawwell launch new kit deal at Celtic Park . Lawwell has dismissed comparison between Deila and former Rangers boss Paul le Guen (right) After a difficult start, Deila has started to turn things around at Parkhead . This was, after all, not only a coach who had brought three successive titles to the Ligue 1 club Lyon, but one who had made them a name to be feared across Europe. If le Guen could drop just a little of his je ne sais quoi into the Ibrox water, the sky would be the limit. So went the theory, anyway. Yet, by January 4 the following year, the Frenchman was already history — his departure a cautionary tale of too much, too soon, resistance to change and the importance of unstinting backing from the boardroom. Disastrous though le Guen’s short tenure was, to this day it’s only natural for the rump of the Rangers support to wonder what might have transpired had he been afforded more time. Fast-forward eight years to the start of this season and — on the other half of the city — parallels with the Frenchman were being drawn. Whilst Stromsgodset were much further down the football food-chain than Lyon, Deila still arrived with the pedigree of being a league winner as a manager. And, just as le Guen had faced resistance from a squad used to Alex McLeish’s methods for so long, much of the Norwegian’s methodology was bound to grate with a squad that had thrived under Neil Lennon. When domestic reverses began to intertwine with European capitulations, there seemed a danger that history might repeat itself. Lyon's former league winning manager Le Guen arrived at Ibrox with a big reputation in 2006 . The Frenchman left Rangers the following January after losing games and the dressing room . ‘When we set off with him, we knew we were going to give him time,’ Lawwell insisted. ‘If you go back to le Guen — I always say to Ronny about the “le Guen hump”. ‘When he came in, he’d won three-in-a-row in France, had new ideas, a new philosophy and a new culture. ‘It didn’t work. It was revolution rather than evolution. Bang. The players revolted and he went out. ‘So we had to get over that le Guen hump if you like and manage through that. ‘You get the players on board and get everything settled down. He’s done that brilliantly.’ Notwithstanding Wednesday’s home defeat to St Johnstone, there is no disputing the fact that both the manager and his players are now in a much brighter place. Earlier this week, John Hartson eloquently described how he now looks at Celtic’ s early struggles under the Norwegian as almost being in a different season and few who witnessed them will find that difficult to relate to. But, asked if — in the dark moments of autumn — he privately harboured doubts about the man he championed, Lawwell was unambiguous. The Norwegian manager looks on during Celtic's 1-0 defeat to St Johnstone on Wednesday . Despite the defeat, the Hoops are six points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership table . ‘We’re paid for these judgment calls and there was never any question of knee-jerk reactions to a bad result, or a bad couple of results,’ he insisted. ‘Genuinely, when Ronny came in, we understood where he was strong and where he was weak; he was weak in terms of experience. ‘Nothing prepares you for Celtic, as a manager or even a player coming here. We knew there would be a transitional period. We knew it would be a baptism of fire. The Champions League was right on us. There was a risk. ‘But when we appointed him, we assessed that risk, and felt for the long-term good of the club it was the right thing to do. Ronny is a creator. He will create a team, he will create players. ‘We can’t afford or can get into the market for Champions League players so we need someone who creates Champions League players, and that is what he does. He is a developer of players and that takes time. ‘He is a highly intelligent guy; he is a progressive coach and, through time, it will prove that we were right. We feel we are making progress; we have won nothing, yet. But hopefully in the short and longer term, he will create a fantastic team for Celtic.’ The first opportunity for a tangible sign of that progress comes in the form of the League Cup Final with Dundee United at Hampden on Sunday week. In terms of a turning point for a season that at one point threatened to implode, Lawwell feels the injury-time win with 10 men at Pittodrie in early November — followed by the Ronny Roar at its most ferocious — was it.

Deila shares a laugh with Manchester City loanee John Guidetta (left) during a training session . ‘I think that was a change, yes,’ Lawwell reflected. ‘No question. That helped change the fans’ perception of him in terms of his emotion that day.’ Ultimately, Deila’s appointment was sanctioned by the board but it was the chief executive who first put his neck on the line for him. ‘My job is to recommend, and the board and Dermot (Desmond) backed that,’ he explained. ‘It is the same with any manager. ‘You get paid to make judgment calls. Some are right, some are wrong. This was the big one. It is the normal pressure for the job I am in. ‘We have a strong relationship. I have been here long enough. I have supported Celtic all my life. I know the west of Scotland, I know Glasgow and, hopefully, I know a bit about Scottish football. ‘So I think that was a help to him. No matter who it is, nothing prepares you for the intensity of this job. You guys (in the media) know the intensity of it, the scrutiny of it. He is a young guy, but he is a quick learner. With a tail wind and a bit of luck, he can be a great manager. ‘His personality is beginning to come out. He is a leader. He has all the attributes and qualities to be a great manager. All you need is a bit of luck and be in the right time and the right place.’ Deila will get his first chance for silverware when Celtic face Dundee United in the League Cup final . Lawwell has given Deila 8/10 for results and 10/10 for showing progress in his debut season . The destination of the season’s major prizes may yet be unknown but Lawwell isn’ t of a mind to hide Deila’s light under a bushel. Asked to rate his success to date in terms of a mark out of 10, Lawwell replied: ‘In terms of results, eight. In term of coming in and acclimatising and showing progress, 10. ‘He has become more relaxed, more confident. Results bring that. He is fitting in to the environment here and outside, which again is a big change for him. The players are buying into him. The players are with him, you can see that with the team. That is giving him the confidence to push on.’","Ex-Lyon boss Paul le Guen arrived at Rangers with big reputation in 2006 .

"The conclusion of a football match, particularly monumental ones like the World Cup final, often brings new debate and inquiry, questions about players, tactics and refereeing decisions. Very rarely do they result in a government investigation. Yet that is exactly what happened after Brazil's capitulation in the 1998 final against hosts France. Quite what transpired in the hours before the match, particularly with star player Ronaldo who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick-off, is one of football's most enduring mysteries. Ronaldo pictured following Brazil's 3-0 defeat by France at the 1998 World Cup final at the Stade de France . Ronaldo looks gutted after the loss as he was not himself in a final where the pressure seemed to get to him . France vs Brazil in the 1998 final led to a government investigation about Ronaldo's involvement .

Brazil manager: Mario Zagallo . Venue: Stade de France, Saint-Denis . Referee: Said Belqola . Attendance: 80,000 . Civil action in a Rio court, a Rio medical council action against two team medics (both of whom were unanimously absolved of blame) and an investigation in Brazil's national congress have shed some light on the events of  July 12 1998 but it continues to be a source of consternation in the country. The official records show the match ended in a 3-0 defeat for Brazil but the story of what happened in and around the Stade de France that afternoon is murkier in detail. Ronaldo, then just 21, had been outstanding all tournament in a Brazil side - including Cafu, Roberto Carlos and Bebeto - that were defending their title from 1994. The final was billed as a head-to-head between him and France's equally captivating talisman Zinedine Zidane. In the event, the France midfielder steamrollered a jaded Brazil outfit, scoring two first half headed goals in a man of the match performance with Emmanuel Petit adding a third after a late counter-attack. It was the first time France had been crowned world champions but it later transpired much of the drama had already happened, out of view of the many millions of TV viewers worldwide. The day had began in a relaxed fashion for the Brazil players. The whole squad had lunch at the Chateau de Grande Romaine, just outside Paris then returned to their rooms. Ronaldo was sharing with Roberto Carlos, neighbouring a room with Edmundo and Doriva. France's Zinedine Zidane sees his header go through the legs of Brazil's Roberto Carlos in the final .

France manager Aime Jacquet holds up the World Cup trophy and is surrounded by the world's media . Zidane was a worthy winner of the World Cup as he brushed aside Brazil with two goals in the final . Roberto Carlos implied Ronaldo was wilting under the weight of expectation of the nation. 'He was scared about what lay ahead,' he said, 'The pressure had got to him and he couldn't stop crying.' To government congress later, Edmundo described a viscerally shocking scene as suddenly Ronaldo started to have a fit. He frothed at the mouth and began to shake uncontrollably. Roberto Carlos, overwhelmed by panic, started screaming for help. 'When I saw what it was, I despaired,' said Edmundo, 'Because it was a really strong and shocking scene.' He ran through the hotel hitting on all the doors and shouting for everyone to come. A congressmen asked the striker for more details. 'Was Ronaldo hitting out or shaking?' 'Hitting out a lot,' replied Edmundo. 'Lying down?' 'Lying down and hitting himself with his hands like this, with his teeth...' 'Together?' 'Locked together and with his mouth foaming.' 'His whole body hitting itself?' 'The whole body, yes.' Defender Cesar Sampaio put his hand in Ronaldo's mouth to unravel his tongue and prevent him swallowing it. Ronaldo then fell asleep and, according to Edmundo, team doctors decided to pretend that nothing had happened when he woke up. Ronaldo had a fit before the World Cup final but was controversially allowed to play against France . Brazil supporters expected so much but were let down as their team were beaten 3-0 by a strong France side . The front page of French newspaper  L'Equipe ahead of France vs Brazil friendly on Thursday . Ronaldo woke up and went for tea. But he was subdued. Leonardo, one of the side's senior players at the time, insisted that Ronaldo be told what had happened and the doctors relented. At 6pm when the squad began the short coach journey to the Stade de France, Ronaldo went to the Lilas clinic in Paris. His name was left off the teamsheets, sending the assembled international press into frenzy but 40 minutes before kick-off he arrived after being given the all-clear and insisted he should play. Brazil's miserable showing on the pitch led to outrage in the country and rumours began to swirl about wrongdoing in the camp in the lead up to the match and even conspiracy. Manager Mario Zagallo was criticised for picking Ronaldo despite what had happened but he defended his decision. 'If you invert the situation and I didn't put Ronaldo on and then Brazil lost 3-0, people would say 'Zagallo is stubborn, he had to put him on, Ronaldo was the best player in the world.' So I think I would do the same again. Now was it his being chosen that caused Brazil to lose? Absolutely not. I think it was the collective trauma, created by the atmosphere of what had happened.' Brazil manager Mario Zagallo (right) pictured after the 3-0 defeat by France in the capital Paris . Zagallo consoles Ronaldo after the final as the Brazil manager controversially allowed the striker to play . Understandably Ronaldo, who continued to play for Brazil until 2011, tried to downplay the affair throughout his career. Last year, in a TV interview with Gary Lineker as his country prepared to host the World Cup, he lifted the lid on what had happened. He told the story of the fit and revealed he begged the manager to let him play. 'I had a convulsion, after lunch in the afternoon. I was unconscious for three or four minutes. I don't know why. Nobody knows. Was it pressure or nerves? It could be,' he said, 'When you are there and you breathe the competition, everything is about the competition. You cannot disconnect from it. It's a lot of pressure. But I pleaded with Zagallo to let me play.' Ronaldo went on to lift the World Cup with Brazil in Japan four years later and will go down as one of the great strikers of all time, but an air of intrigue continues to hang over that afternoon's events.","France hammered Brazil 3-0 in the 1998 World Cup final on home soil .

"Ever wondered what the football world would be like without Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo? Well naturally we'd miss their stunning goals and dazzling trickery, but it seems erasing them would shake up the order of things in Spain. Stats gurus Opta have calculated what the La Liga table would look like if the goals of the divine duo were taken away - and there's quite a dramatic change at the top. La Liga would look very different if the goals of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were taken away . The deadly duo have scored 57 goals between them in La Liga alone this season - Ronaldo 30, Messi 27 . Real Madrid currently enjoy a two-point advantage over their rivals Barcelona in the La Liga standings . How the La Liga table would look if goals by Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were taken away (Opta) In real life, Real Madrid currently enjoy a two-point advantage over their Clasico rivals, thanks in no small part to the 30 league goals of Ronaldo this season. But if they and Messi's contribution of 27 goals were subtracted, it's Barcelona who would enjoy a slender one-point advantage at the summit. Opta went through every match this season in which Messi and Ronaldo have scored and took away their goals from the final score. Ronaldo celebrates his goal in Real Madrid's 1-1 home draw with Villarreal at the weekend . The Portuguese was also on target in Real's 2-0 victory at Elche last month . Ronaldo celebrates one of his hat-trick of goals in Real's 3-0 home win over Celta Vigo in December . With Messi, Barcelona would still win all but one of the matches in which he has scored. That is the 3-2 home win over Villarreal last month, which would end in a draw. But taking away Ronaldo's goals affects Real's season more dramatically. The Portuguese scored four in the 5-1 home win over Elche, meaning they would only draw 1-1. Lionel Messi claims the match ball after his hat-trick in Barcelona's 5-1 rout of neighbours Espanyol . Messi's 27 league goals this season have seen him surpass the all-time La Liga scoring record . Messi celebrates with team-mates Pedro and Marc Bartra after scoring in the 5-0 rout of Levante last month . Removing his hat-trick against Celta Vigo would see them claim one point rather than three, and subtracting his goal against Villarreal last weekend means they would lose instead of draw. It does prove to an extent that Real are more reliant on the goals of Ronaldo than Barcelona are on the goals of Messi. But in such a nip and tuck title race, who's to say that won't change again by the end of the season. Cristiano Ronaldo's La Liga goals 2014-15 .

"It's a magical moment when a man finds out he is going to be a father for the first time. But when Tennessee man Jordan Cocklin was told the news by his wife through specially designed bottles of beer, his reaction wasn't exactly what she was hoping for.

He said: '[It was] total shock at first but as soon as she turned ioff [the camera] we were just ecstatic'. 'Any new dad is going to have an original feeling of shock - mine just happened to be caught on camera', he added.

"Kevin Pietersen has signed a contract to return to Surrey this summer and will donate all of his salary to his KP24 foundation. The move gives the record-breaking batsman the opportunity to press for an England recall, after being sacked in February 2014 following the Ashes whitewash defeat in Australia. Pietersen cleared the way for a return to The Oval by agreeing a release from the majority of his Indian Premier League contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad - which clashed with the start of the English domestic season - and he will be available for Surrey's first County Championship match against Glamorgan in Cardiff on April 19. Encouraged by new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves' indication that he may be back in the mix if he can impress again in county cricket, the 34-year-old Pietersen has two months to do that if he is to achieve his dream of a Test recall in time for this summer's Ashes rematch. Kevin Pietersen will have nine County Championship matches at the most to impress England's selectors . He's secured a released from Sunrisers Hyderabad to stake his claim for an England return in the Ashes . Pietersen told Surrey's website kiaoval.com: 'I'm absolutely thrilled to be back at Surrey. 'It's a club very close to my heart - and (director of cricket) Alec Stewart, (coach) Graham Ford and everyone at the club has been exceptionally supportive. 'There is a fantastic group of lads here, and I hope we can deliver what the great Surrey fans want to see - lots of runs and comprehensive victories.' Pietersen also wrote in his column in the Telegraph: 'When I heard Colin Graves say that I would be considered for selection again if I play county cricket and score runs I realised I had the opportunity for a fresh start. I always said this was not about money and I will be donating my full Surrey wage to my foundation. 'Even if this does not work out and I do not get back in the England team, I will at least end my career knowing I gave it another shot. I would kick myself for a long time if I walked away now without having a go. 'A lot of people thought I would not be prepared to put in the hard yards and play county cricket but I will do anything to get that England cap back on my head.' Pietersen will donate his full salary from Surrey to his KP24 foundation . Imminent Surrey signing Pietersen says he will 'do everything in my power to earn a recall' with England . Stewart added: 'A Kevin Pietersen with ambitions to play for England and a real determination to score big runs for Surrey will be a huge asset to us.' The apparent clinching development in Pietersen's negotiations to rejoin the club which de-registered him at the end of last season was the Sunrisers' willingness to release him from the majority of his contract. Pietersen would have been in India for more than seven weeks - and Surrey, for whom he played only Twenty20 cricket last summer, did not appear immediately keen to secure his services again unless they knew his availability would be more comprehensive this time. The controversial South Africa-born batsman's ambition to play for England again may not depend entirely on him demonstrating form and fitness. But irrespective of mixed messages from the ECB, that is where he must start. He was described by ECB managing director Paul Downton as 'disengaged' during England's heavy defeat in Sydney almost 15 months ago - his last Test to date, in which the Ashes whitewash was completed. Pietersen was axed by England following their 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia last winter . Pietersen in action for Surrey in the Natwest T20 Blast last summer . Pietersen started the year by playing more short form cricket for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash . Weeks later, Pietersen was sacked - in a meeting attended by Downton and also Test captain Alastair Cook. Downton, Cook, national selector James Whitaker and returning coach Peter Moores - contrary to the tone of Graves' remarks - have all reiterated, in their different forms of words, that Pietersen remains firmly on the outside as far as they are concerned. England embark on a three-Test tour to West Indies, without Pietersen of course, early next month - and have already been left in no doubt by Graves, set to begin his tenure officially in May, that victory over what he describes as 'mediocre' opponents is non-negotiable. While they are busy with their Caribbean mission, Pietersen has his chance to impress and make headlines on home soil - and therefore put his name back in the mix in time for the start of the Ashes in July.","Kevin Pietersen  signs with Surrey for the County Championship .

The French midfielder has been linked with the biggest clubs in Europe with the likes of Real Madrid, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain reportedly showing interest. Although Marotta admits it may be difficult to hang onto Pogba should the youngster wish to leave, the Juve chief hopes Pogba will remain in Turin. Paul Pogba is yet to show any indication that he wants to leave Juventus, according to Giuseppe Marotta . The 22-year-old midfielder is a target for clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain . Marotta told Corriere della Sera: 'Pogba is the protagonist of his own destiny and if he decides to leave then we can't stop him,” the Bianconeri chief told Corriere della Sera. 'Pogba has not indicated a willingness to leave, though. The problem will come when the player is offered a contract that is two or three times what he already earns. We're talking in the tens of millions per year.' Pogba has scored seven goals and set up two more in 22 league appearances to help Juve remain on course for their fourth successive scudetto.

"Mauricio Pochettino isn’t the selfie type. So when the Tottenham manager slipped his camera phone out at Loftus Road on Saturday, you couldn’t help but notice. ‘My family was in the stands, my two sons (Maurizio, 13, and Sebastiano, 20) and my older brother (Javier). They were sitting just behind the goal in the top tier. ‘My brother is over from Argentina, he came over for the Capital One Cup final. They have the chance to go to the executive box or be in a better area but they prefer to sing the songs with the fans. So I took the photo as a souvenir. It was a fantastic moment for me and them.

Harry Kane heads past Robert Green to give Tottenham the lead over QPR at Loftus Road . Spurs striker Kane celebrates as his goals keep Tottenham in the hunt for a top four finish . Javier still works on the farm where 43-year-old Pochettino grew up in Argentina’s Murphy province. Their career paths have taken different directions but that doesn’t stop Javier providing his younger, more high-profile brother with an honest assessment. ‘He is very honest — sometimes too much! He’s six years older than me. He works on the farm and watches every game live, all the games are on in Argentina.’ Whether Javier, Maurizio and Sebastiano joined in with the Harry Kane ‘He’s one of our own’ chant is not known. They certainly had the chances to do so as two more goals took Kane’s tally to 26 for the season. He is certain to be in the England squad when Roy Hodgson, who was at Loftus Road, picks his players for the clashes against Lithuania and Italy later this month. But another ‘one of their own’, Ryan Mason, would also have impressed Hodgson. ‘Is Mason close to a call-up?

You can only control what you can control and the points target now is three points in the next game,’ said Ramsey.","Mauricio Pochettino's sons and older brother were at Loftus Road .

"Spurs claim him as one of their own. Arsenal fans beg to differ. But it is starting to get to the point now where, for the rest of football, it doesn’t really matter. Match by match, week by week, Harry Kane is announcing himself as the kind of talent who will soon belong to all of us. Kane did not just score the two clinically taken goals that took Tottenham to victory over QPR at Loftus Road on Saturday and lifted them into the scrap for the Champions League places. He led the line with authority and verve. He was not only the best finisher; he was a constant source of creativity, too. The England manager, Roy Hodgson, watched from the directors’ box and it must surely have reached the stage now where naming Kane in his squad for the forthcoming matches against Lithuania and Italy later this month is a formality.

Kane has not just knocked on Hodgson’s door. He has smashed straight through it. The sub-plot in west London was that the Tottenham striker won his personal goalscoring duel with Charlie Austin. Kane has now scored in six consecutive away games for Spurs, whose victory took them to within three points of Manchester United, the side sitting uneasily in fourth place. Kane’s 15th and 16th league goals of the season also lifted him above Austin in the goalscoring charts. Only Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa, of Chelsea, have scored more. Austin did not do his own reputation any harm with another full-blooded performance brimming with threat and endeavour, but he could not prevent his team from being dragged deeper into the mire at the foot of the table.

Even though QPR mounted a spirited late comeback, they were again undone by familiar defensive failings that leave them in danger of being cut adrift. Defender Rio Ferdinand was singled out for particular criticism from disgruntled home supporters, but it was a collective failure at the back that undid Ramsey’s team. ‘We need to go away and regroup,’ the QPR head coach said. Rangers had started the match well. Striker Bobby Zamora forced a flying save out of Hugo Lloris inside 60 seconds but referee Craig Pawson got his own afternoon off to a poor beginning by awarding a goal-kick. Spurs soon shook off their uncertainty, though, and five minutes later Kane met a cross from Kyle Walker at the near post with a glancing header and brought a brilliant point-blank save out of Robert Green. This time, even Mr Pawson realised it was a corner. The half sank into a stalemate until a defensive error by Walker almost allowed QPR to snatch the lead. The England full-back attempted a headed backpass but Austin saw it coming and intercepted it, turning it goalwards. Lloris got his hand to the ball and scrambled it clear. Even though Tottenham were dominating possession and Christian Eriksen was orchestrating play beautifully, the best chance of the half fell to QPR after half an hour.

Matt Phillips played the ball into the box and when it ran on to Austin, his left-footed rising drive beat Lloris but smashed against the underside of the bar and away to safety. On the QPR bench, Ramsey held his head in his hands. All of QPR’s efforts were undone 10 minutes before half time when Andros Townsend floated a free kick into their box. None of the QPR defenders attacked the ball, Nedum Onuoha ducked under it and Kane beat Green to the ball to head it past the onrushing keeper and into the empty net. Luck ran against the home team before the interval when Mauricio Isla ran on to a clever through ball from Steven Caulker and appeared to be brought down by Lloris. To bitter protests from QPR, referee Pawson waved play on. Kane showed in stoppage time at the end of the half what a fine all-round player he is becoming with a fine pass out to Townsend. Townsend’s shot took an awkward deflection and Green scrambled to his right to push it out. And Spurs began the second half in the same vein when a ferocious, whipped shot from Eriksen beat the despairing dive of Green only to rebound off the inside of a post.

QPR were desperately trying to stay in touch now and it took some desperate defending to stop Spurs extending their lead. Kane showed great vision again to play in Walker on the right and when Green smothered his attempted cross, Eriksen followed up with a crisp volley that was blocked on the line by Austin. QPR couldn’t hold Spurs at bay any longer, though, and midway through the half, Kane put the match out of their reach. He beat the offside trap and ran on to a ball from Ryan Mason, whose energy and ability will also have caught Hodgson’s eye, before taking the ball round Green and sliding it into an empty net. That goal sparked a frantic QPR fightback. Fifteen minutes from the end, Austin, who had worked himself into the ground, crossed for Zamora. He laid the ball back into the path of the Brazilian, Sandro, whose neat side-foot beat Lloris low to his left. Rangers then laid siege to the Spurs goal in the dying minutes but Tottenham defended stoutly and Ramsey’s team were left to rue their shortcomings at the back and contemplate an increasingly forlorn fight for Premier League survival. Ramsey, whose side have lost their last three games, was asked after the match whether he would pick Kane for England. ‘Me?’ he said, smiling. ‘Yes, I would.

"Five Chelsea supporters suspected of involvement in an incident in Paris in which a black man was prevented from boarding a train will fight applications to impose football banning orders, a court heard. Controversy erupted when fans were filmed singing racist chants and refusing to let the man on the Paris Metro train ahead of the west London club's match against Paris Saint-Germain last month. Several Chelsea supporters chanted: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it.' Richard Barklie of Northern Ireland leaves Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on Wednesday . Barklie and four other men appeared at court in regards to a police application for football banning orders . Jordan Munday, 20, of Sidcup also appeared at the north-east London court . The Metropolitan Police are applying for football banning orders to be imposed on five men who they believe were involved in the incident. They all attended Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court in north-east London for a preliminary hearing. They are: Richard Barklie, 50, Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland; Dean Callis, 32, Islington, north London; Jordan Munday, 20, Sidcup, south-east London; Josh Parsons, 20, Dorking and William Simpson, 26, Ashford, Surrey. Joshua Parsons leaves Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court after the preliminary hearing . William Simpson, seen here leaving the court, was one of five men who appeared in regards to a police application for football banning orders . Prosecutor Ian Rees Phillips told the court - which was packed with legal representatives and reporters from the UK and France - that the five men opposed the implementation of the banning orders. District Judge Mary Connolly said the orders would involve severe restrictions to civil liberties. They are designed as a preventative measure to stop potential troublemakers from travelling to football matches at home and abroad. The French commuter kept off the train, Souleymane S, has said the incident 'destroyed' him and left him unable to work or travel on public transport. He said his children had been left 'traumatised' by reports of what happened and that he had become depressed. The men were smartly dressed in suits as they sat in the court during the short hearing. The case was adjourned for an administrative hearing at Thames Magistrates' Court, east London, on June 5. The full hearing is expected to last two days and will take place at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on July 15 and 16. 32-year-old Dean Callis leaves the court after attending the preliminary hearing . Souleymane S, a black man, was prevented getting on a train by Chelsea fans in Paris in February . Fans appeared to be chanting: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' The five Chelsea fans suspected of being involved in the disgraceful incident have been suspended from attending matches . Barklie, a former policeman, has previously apologised for his involvement on the night of the incident. The ex-Royal Ulster Constabulary and Police Service of Northern Ireland officer insisted he was not a racist person. A spokesman for the law firm representing him said: 'He did not participate in racist chanting and singing and condemns any behaviour supporting that. 'He accepts he was involved in an incident when a person now known to him as Souleymane S was unable to enter a part of the train. 'He has an account to give to police which will explain the context and circumstances as they prevailed at that particular time.' Jose Mourinho (left) admitted he felt 'ashamed' by the racially-motivated incident involving Chelsea fans . Souleymane S says he is still traumatised and has not accepted the invitation to watch a game in London . Chelsea fans unfurled a 'Black or white, we're all blue' banner during last month's clash at home to Burnley . A picture emerged of finance worker Parsons posing with Ukip leader Nigel Farage, but the party denied that he is a member and claimed that it has never heard of him. His manager at the Business and Commercial Finance Club in Mayfair said he faced disciplinary action at work if he was charged over the incident. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said the club was 'appalled' by the racial abuse, adding that owner Roman Abramovich was also 'disgusted'. An investigation revealed earlier this week that Chelsea supporters have been involved in the highest number of reported racist incidents as they travelled to and from matches on trains. The British Transport Police said that since 2012 it had dealt with 15 incidents of alleged racism involving Chelsea fans, the most of any club in the country. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Group of Chelsea fans stopped Souleymane S, 33, getting onto the train .

"Brittany Maynard says in a video recorded 19 days before her assisted suicide death that no one should have to leave their home to legally end their life under doctor's care. The 29-year-old California woman had terminal brain cancer and moved with her family to Oregon before killing herself last November. 'Unfortunately, California law prevented me from getting the end-of-life option I deserved,' she said in the recording released Wednesday, hours ahead of a Senate health committee hearing on the issue. 'No one should have to leave their home and community for peace of mind, to escape suffering, and to plan for a gentle death.' Scroll down for video . Speaking from beyond the grave: Brittany Maynard, the terminally-ill woman who became the face of the right-to-die movement, appeared in a new video released by her family on Wednesday in support of a California bill legalizing assisted suicide. The 29-year-old moved to Oregon last year to apply for fatal drugs and died in November . Staying strong: Maynard's widow, Dan Diaz, stands to the right of a television screen airing the video at the California State Capitol on Wednesday . While Maynard appeared calm and collected through most of the video, she did turn passionate when she spoke about her state government forced her move to states in order to get the drugs she needed to end her life. 'How dare the government make decisions or limit options for terminally ill people like me,' Maynard said. 'Making aid in dying a crime creates undue hardships and suffering for many people who are terminally ill and suffering tremendously. 'The laws in California and 45 other states must change to prevent prolonged, involuntary suffering for all terminally ill Americans. 'Freedom from prolonged pain and suffering is a most basic human right,' Maynard says. While the video played, Maynard's husband Dan Diaz stood to the side and fought back tears. Tragedy: Maynard found out that she had terminal brain cancer a little more than a year after she married Diaz . When she spoke to reporters afterwards, he said that assisted suicide isn't for everyone, but that every American should have the option of dying the way they want. 'What my wife did on Nov. 1 was by her design,' Diaz said. 'She avoided a painful, drawn out process and harmed no one else.' Maynard's mother,  Deborah Zieglar, also spoke, saying: 'Life is more than breathing air in and out of your body. The definition of a good life and a good death varies person to person. Californians need the freedom to deal with terminal illness as they determine.' The bill is expected to face a strong challenge, led by medical and religious groups. Opponents see huge consequences for allowing doctors to prescribe fatal drugs. Among the opponents are other terminally ill patients such as Kara Tippetts, a 38-year-old Colorado mother of four, who wrote an open letter to Maynard in October urging her not to end her life. Tippetts wrote that suffering can be 'the place where true beauty can be known.' She died this month of breast cancer. Advocates for aid-in-dying laws say legislators in at least 17 states have introduced similar measures this year. But past proposals have foundered in statehouses amid emotionally charged debates and strong opposition. Loved: Maynard died in her Oregon home in November, surrounded by her husband, parents and other members of her family . Some medical groups say prescribing life-ending medication violates a doctor's oath to do no harm, while some advocates for people with disabilities fear some sick patients would feel pressured to end their lives to avoid being a financial burden. Advocates have said they would consider taking the issue to voters if it fails in the Legislature. The practice is legal in five states, including Oregon. The other states are Montana, New Mexico, Vermont and Washington. Before her death, Maynard had made her case public with online videos, which were viewed tens of millions of times. Maynard's husband, Dan Diaz, and her mother, Deborah Ziegler, joined state lawmakers in Sacramento on Wednesday to release her taped testimony in support of Senate Bill 128. The proposal by Sens. Bill Monning, D-Carmel, and Lois Wolk, D-Davis, would allow terminally ill patients to kill themselves in California with drugs and dosages recommended by a doctor.","Maynard, 29, moved to Oregon from California last year when she learned she had terminal brain cancer .

"Juventus striker Alvaro Morata has slammed Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti for leaving him on the bench without an explanation last season. The Spaniard left Madrid last summer and joined Serie A champions Juventus in search of first team football, where he has scored seven goals in 22 appearances. Speaking of his last few months in Madrid, Morata told Onda Cero: 'I do not understand what happened – I went from playing well to being sat on the bench. Alvaro Morata has claimed he had 'barely any relationship' with Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti . 'I wasn't asking to be in every starting line-up, but I wanted better treatment. 'I barely had any relationship with Ancelotti. Massimiliano Allegri, for better or worse, is very aware of my presence within the squad.' Morata, who is currently on international duty with Spain, is also hoping to take advantage of Diego Costa's absence from national squad. Costa was forced to pull out of the squad after picking up a hamstring injury during Chelsea's 3-2 victory against Hull last Sunday. The Spanish frontman struggled to find a regular first team spot under Italian boss Ancelotti . Morata joined Juve from Real Madrid after coming through the European champions' youth ranks . 'I will have to work very hard to get any playing time,' he told a news conference at Spain's training base outside Madrid on Tuesday. 'There are a lot of people who are in great shape and it will be tough to get into the side but I will give my all,' he added. 'I am playing well for my team. I am very happy with my season and I am coming here to enjoy myself, to try to perform and to learn.' With four matches played, Spain are second in Euro 2016 qualification Group C on nine points, three behind leaders Slovakia, who beat them 2-1 in Zilina in October, and level with Ukraine.

The central midfielder, 27, has not agreed a new deal with the club and has been linked with a return to the Bundesliga, with Bayern Munich and Schalke possible destinations. A switch to the Premier League has also been mooted but Khedira says he will fight for the club until the day he leaves, which he will do with a heavy heart.

"Roy Hodgson has gained a wealth of experience during almost 40 years as a manager and will have sat through thousands of interviews. The 67-year-old boss, however, will never have been asked to have a conversation with an iPad on wheels while answering recorded questions from fans via an interactive 'Fanbot'. Hodgson reveals the toughest manager he’s ever faced in nearly 40 years in the dugout, which former England players he’d love to be able to call up to his current squad and who he'd choose between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Roy Hodgson will lead England out at Wembley ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday . HODGSON REVEALS ALL IN 4GEE FAN Q&A . What’s the best way for a young captain to get players playing together? I don’t think it’s the captain’s total responsibility. To get all of the team together and playing off the same hymn sheet and playing together as a team, I think that it’s a question of what goes on in the training sessions, what the coach or manager is asking of the players and encouraging the players to do. The captain plays an important role of course, as the game starts the manager or coach will have less chance to influence what’s happening on the field of play and that’s where the captain comes to the fore. He very much needs to be in tune with what the team is trying to do, how they’re trying to play and what’s s been agreed upon and hopefully what’s agreed upon has been a matter of discussion and work amongst the players and training staff. Hodgson believes as an England captain, Wayne Rooney must be in tune with the rest of the players . It’s also important that the players feel as though they trust their captain, hopefully look up to him but most importantly can go to the captain with their problems or doubts and with fears. And if he can’t answer himself with the problems they have he can at least point them in the right direction. It’s important for the captain to show he cares about all of the players and takes responsibility and, most importantly, accept that being captain puts more burden on him both before and after games, to lead from the front and if some of the unpleasant jobs sometimes need doing – with us at the level I’m talking about it can mean spending more time with the press or doing things for the commercial department. The captain sometimes has to take more of a share of that work than some of the other players, he is the captain, he is the one that everyone wants to see and talk to. He is the one of course who has the most responsibility. It’s a question of responsibility and making sure you’re a good listener. If you could pick one player from previous squads to be in your current squad, who would it be? From previous squads, well I suppose that depends on how far back you would go. When selecting players, of course there’s a question of what you need most at any one time. One’s tempted to look to centre forwards of course and Alan Sheerer would be an obvious choice for his goal-scoring ability. Also a guy like Bryan Robson was a fantastic captain for England and a tremendous midfield dynamo I would choose between those too. The Three Lions boss plumped for Alan Shearer (above) when asked to pick a player from previous squads . Who’s the best manager you’ve competed against? Usually it’s teams that concern me the most, and the players within the teams, but I’ve been lucky enough to have a long career to come across some very good ones. All the ones I’ve come across over the last eight or five years before taking this job, when I was in the Premier League, outside of that to national managers I would have to say Arrigo Sacchi. I would have to say he revolutionised Italian football, he was a big fan of English football. He based a lot of his ideas on what he had seen English teams do in the past. I enjoyed my battles with Arrigo when he was managing Italy and I was managing Switzerland and was lucky to get to know him and hear about his philosophies. Hodgson believes former Italy boss Arrigo Sacchi (centre) revolutionised Italian football . What’s the strangest thing that’s ever happened to you during a game? It was during a qualifying match for Finland. We were playing against Serbia in the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki when the game was held up for five or six minutes by an eagle owl, which was nested in the stands, decided it was going to fly up and down the pitch and land on the crossbar. It was an amazing sight because these birds are really, really big. It made the game all that more interesting for the spectators and luckily we won and the eagle owl was adopted as a mascot by the Finnish national team afterwards. Hodgson was answering recorded questions from supporters via a 'Fanbot' during a Q&A at Wembley . The 67-year-old manager also revealed his admiration for Swiss tennis star Roger Federer . Outside of football what athletes do you admire most, past or present? Not an easy one to answer – there are so many great athletes that have done such great things outside of my own sport, the sport I understand most. I would maybe look to tennis which is the sport I have played most outside of football. The two sporting heroes in that regard that have had great achievements are firstly Bjorn Borg, Swedish champion and latterly Roger Federer. Who was your favourite football player when growing up? I had three I guess going through the different stages of my youth. The first was at Crystal Palace, Johnny McNichol, and then there were two who were fairly contemporary but both shared my affections, one was Johnny Byrne at Palace and West Ham and the second was George Eastham when he came down to the Arsenal. If you could steal a player from an international team, who would it be? Good question – lots to choose from. I would plump for Lionel Messi. Hodgson chose Barcelona star Lionel Messi as the one player he would steal away from their national team .","Roy Hodgson reveals players from England’s past that he’d love to call on .

"I understand the angst that many Arsenal supporters feel over the future of the club under Arsene Wenger. I understand why a swathe of the club’s support has started to give up hope that Wenger can recreate the success he brought to the club more than a decade ago. I even started to inch in that direction myself last autumn after Arsenal made a poor start to this season. Sometimes, it feels like Wenger is the problem, not the solution. He is a stubborn man and it can be hard to defend the choices he makes. Arsene Wenger is facing increasing calls for his resignation from Arsenal fans after an undulating season . Wenger look despondently as Monaco tear Arsenal side apart in the last 16 first-leg Champions League tie . After the desperately dispiriting defeat by Monaco, Wenger will come under fierce scrutiny again  when Arsenal visit Manchester United to contest an FA Cup quarter-final. Lose and people will say that their season is over. Lose and the ‘Wenger Out’ bandwagon, which is already accelerating, will move up another gear. Well, maybe they should be thinking about slamming the brakes on it instead. Because in the last five months, Arsenal have taken great strides forward. I don’t buy the idea that the club is standing still or even going backwards. The defeat by Monaco notwithstanding, there are real signs of progress at last. Put it this way, if you are an Arsenal fan, which team in the Premier League would you swap places with today? Look around. Which team looks more upwardly mobile or better set for the future than Wenger’s side? Manchester City? I don’t think so. City are creaking. They’re starting to look like a side at the end of an old cycle, not at the start of a new one. Manchester United? Be serious. United may have spent lavishly under Louis van Gaal but they are beset by doubts about Radamel Falcao, Angel di Maria and Robin van Persie. And that’s before we start on their defence and the continuing absence of a dominating central midfield player. Despite all their lavish investment, Manchester City do not look like defending their Premier League crown . Angel di Maria has been a disappointment since joining Manchester United for £60m from Real Madrid . Spurs? Well, Tottenham might well be advancing under Mauricio Pochettino but they’re still a way away from the level they achieved under Harry Redknapp. Liverpool? Liverpool are looking good again under Brendan Rodgers and, like Arsenal, their prospects are improving. OK, so that leaves Chelsea. And everybody would swap with Chelsea at the moment, but the point is that Arsenal’s future looks bright again. It is easy, and valid, to point out the occasional failings of Per Mertesacker, but why not consider Arsenal’s array of attacking talent instead? Alexis Sanchez, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Santi Cazorla, Danny Welbeck, Mesut Ozil, Theo Walcott and, yes, Olivier Giroud are formidable forward- thinking players close to their prime. And that’s before we talk about Jack Wilshere and Mathieu Debuchy, coming back from injury, and the emergence of Francis Coquelin as a holding midfielder. Calum Chambers has not made the strides expected of him since his summer move from Southampton but his qualities are not in doubt. Per Mertesacker winces during the defeat by Monaco, but Arsenal will surely strengthen their defence . Alexis Sanchez is surrounded by an embarrassment of attacking riches in the Arsenal ranks . There is no reason why he should not bolster Arsenal’s defence next season. If Wenger signs another central defender in the summer and perhaps a more experienced central midfielder, there is no reason why they should not challenge for the title next season. It would be a shame if Arsenal lost their nerve on Wenger now just when it feels as if they are on the verge of being real contenders again. Their victory over City at the Etihad in January was the clearest evidence yet of the fact they are casting off the inferiority complex they had developed against the other leading clubs. The tie against United, at the venue where they were humiliated 8-2 in 2011, will be another good test. Arsenal are the FA Cup holders, let’s not forget. There is plenty to suggest that they are about to re-emerge into the light. Defeat by United won’t change that even if it will, inevitably, lead to renewed calls for Wenger’s head. It has got to the stage now where some Arsenal fans behave as if Wenger is the only thing standing between them and the Premier League summit. There seems to be an assumption that, once liberated from the yoke of the professorial tyrant, Arsenal would be free to soar. Free to soar back to the top of the Premier League table as if that were their rightful place, as if that were the position that their history demanded. Wenger celebrates breaking his trophy drought last May... and more could follow if Arsenal hold their nerve . Wenger last won the Premier League title in 2004, and his side may well challenge for the title next season . There is another inconvenient truth here: even in the last 10 years under Wenger that fans like to characterise as a desert of achievement, Arsenal have played at a higher level than they had in the 30 years before he arrived. It may come as a surprise to some of those Arsenal fans who think that football began in 1992 but in the period from 1966 to Wenger’s arrival in 1996, Arsenal’s average position in the league was between sixth and seventh. Their traditional place in English football pre-Wenger was not in the top four. There is no worth in lionising Wenger just because of his longevity. Nor is he entitled to remain in situ because he is the father of the modern Arsenal and his achievements built the Emirates. But he worked stoically through the period of retrenchment that followed the building of the new stadium and kept Arsenal among the elite. It is only now that Wenger has been given the tools to aim for the top again. He has got Arsenal moving forward. He deserves the chance to try to finish the job. Stadiums no longer a haven for bigotry . The defenders of the faith bemoan the fact that you can’t do anything at a football ground these days without attracting sanction. Can’t throw bananas on to the pitch and make monkey chants like we used to because it will upset black supporters. Can’t sing songs about Auschwitz and Belsen or make hissing sounds to mimic gas chambers like we used to because it will upset Jewish supporters. Can’t sing songs using a derogatory term for people who have Down’s Syndrome because it might upset supporters who have kids with disabilities. Can’t even yell abuse at women in the directors’ box or sitting on the bench and sing songs urging them to get their kit off because it might upset female supporters. ‘It’s getting ridiculous,’ the legions of the disaffected say. ‘What has happened to the football we used to know?’ Well, the answer is simple. What has happened is that our society has decided stadiums should no longer be havens for those who wish to vent their bigotry and their ignorance without fear of disapproval or repercussions. What has happened is that we have come to the conclusion that it is wrong for swathes of our population to be made to feel uncomfortable when they go to watch their team play. People can lament that if they wish to. The shame is that it has taken us this long to come to our senses. At least spitting doesn’t threaten careers . I have always found it hard to understand why biting a player on the shoulder during a football match and not even breaking the skin attracts far more opprobrium than snapping the same player’s leg with a terrible tackle, sending him to hospital and putting his entire career in doubt. Up to a point, it is the same with spitting. ‘If a player spat at me,’ Stoke striker Jon Walters said on Thursday, ‘he’d be eating his supper through a straw.’ I wonder if Walters has considered that if an opponent committed the altogether more acceptable offence of deliberately smashing his jaw with a swinging elbow, it would be Walters who would be eating through a straw. Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates . Manchester United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA after the ugly incident . ‘There is nothing worse in football than spitting,’ player after player has said after the altercation between Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse at St James’ Park on Wednesday. I’m sorry but I don’t agree. There is nothing worse in football than depriving another man of his livelihood. Pathetic and unpleasant though it may be, spitting never threatens that.","Many Arsenal fans fear for the future of the club under Arsene Wenger .

"Every new mum is desperate to show off her little ones - and this lioness is no different, even if that means having to put up with becoming a climbing frame for an afternoon. The proud mother was spotted playing with her six young cubs in the Masai Mara, in Kenya, by French photographers Laurent Renaud and Dominique Haution. However, should they get too rowdy, it is only too clear who is boss - as the pictures clearly show. Scroll down for video . Placid: The lioness might be a honed killer, but she is gentle as anything with her young brood . Adorable: The relaxed lioness with one of her six young cubs climbing over her . Sibling rivalry? The cubs were seen play fighting together while the lioness looked on . Young: It is thought the lion cubs were only about six weeks old when they were photographed . But while most lionesses keep their cubs out of the limelight, this one seemed keen to make sure the photographers captured their best side. 'It was a beautiful and touching moment,' Ms Haution revealed. 'The whole family were extraordinarily cute. Mum was definitely showing off her new cubs. 'Normally, lionesses will hide their children away from predators. But she was so proud, carrying them out into the open in her mouth for us to see. 'You could see how happy she was when the cubs were climbing all over her. 'It just shows that even the biggest beasts can show love.' Indeed, the photos captured the youngsters clambering across the predator - who doesn't bat an eyelid. Roar: The cubs may still be tiny, but there is already a hint of the lions they will grow up to be . Friendly: But in other shots, the cubs look so sweet they could be household pets . Victory: But being the winner is still important - as this cub seems to be learning . Control: However, the cubs were left in no doubt of who was in charge when push came to shove . Ms Haution believes the cubs are around six weeks old, which presented a difficulty when trying to photograph them all. She said: 'There were about six in total, but they were running around all over the place so it was hard to capture them all. 'They are so adorable though. Big family: The photographers believe there may have been as many as six cubs, but it was hard to tell . Serene: This little cub seems remarkably calm about being bitten by its sibling .

The 20-year-old, who joined the Blues in the summer of 2011, has made 11 Chelsea first-team appearances, including games in the Champions League and was an unused substitute in the 2015 Capital One Cup final win over Tottenham. Ake, who can play as a defensive midfielder, left-back or centre-half and has a long-term contract at Stamford Bridge, will gain some more valuable experience with the Royals, who are now managed by former Chelsea assistant boss Steve Clarke.

"A late Lukas Podolski strike from an Andre Schurrle cross saved Germany from back-to-back home defeats by Australia at the Fritz-Walter-Stadion in Kaiserslautern. Podolski rescued the World Cup champions nine minutes from time with his 48th goal for his country as he combined with his fellow substitute and former Premier League outcast. The Socceroos' last visit to Germany in 2011 ended in a 2-1 shock loss for the hosts in Monchengladbach and it looked to be going that way again for much of the second half when captain Mile Jedinak gave his side the lead with a sensational curling free-kick.

James Troisi hit back for the recently crowned Asian Cup champions with a header from Nathan Burns' pinpoint cross. Then, five minutes into the second half, Crystal Palace stalwart and Socceroos captain nailed a perfect curling free-kick that left German keeper Ron-Robert Zieler flailing and in the back of his own net with the ball. History was on the visitors' side at this stadium. It was here that Australia made history with their first goal and first win in a World Cup when they beat Japan 3-1 in 2006. Their star striker Tim Cahill, who scored a double that night, was out injured here after being instrumental in delivering Australia's first major trophy win after beating South Korea in extra-time in January.

"The sun that attracts most people to southern Florida was torture for Heather Watson on Wednesday but she refused to wilt in her best unyielding fashion. The British No 1 was resilient in the fierce mid-day heat, and edged closer to beating her career-high ranking with a sometimes agonising 3-6, 6-1, 7-5 victory over Russia’s Evgeniya Rodina to make the Miami Open second round. Having beaten a host of highly regarded players to reach the fourth round of Indian Wells last week, she nearly came unstuck against the nuggety Russian, ranked a modest 95 in the world. It was a testament to Watson’s fighting qualities, rather than an advert for the silky skills of the WTA Tour, but hardly less worthy for that. Heather Watson celebrates during her three sets victory over Russian qualifier Evgeniya Rodina . Watson is currently ranked 41 in the world, three off her all-time best. She now faces Germany’s Angelique Kerber, the number fifteen seed, who has tumbled out of the top ten and is scratching around for any kind of form in 2015. The British No 1 is having to do it solo as well, as the only female player from Wimbledon’s host nation to inhabit the top 150 in Laura Robson’s absence. It is a bleak situation, and there seems little in the way of any coherent performance plan from the Lawn Tennis Association to improve things. The 22 year-old from Guernsey usually benefits in these conditions from having spent much of her teenage years in Florida, although not much can make the kind of steaming heat encountered on Wednesday much more comfortable . 26-year-old Evgeniya Rodina hits a forehand during the prolonged contest in Miami with Watson .

When serving for it at 5-3, however, she could not finds a first serve and was broken. She just about squeezed through when she broke Rodina at 6-5, the Russian hurling her racket across the court on the final point that she lost via a net cord. Earlier Andy Murray had found out his opponent in the second round of the men’s event to be played on Friday after receiving a bye. American Donald Young, who he beat recently in the Davis Cup, went through when his opponent Yen Hsun Lu defaulted with injury at 1-5 down.

"Minnesota United were officially confirmed as the next Major League Soccer expansion team on Wednesday. Minnesota, who have competed in the second-tier North American Soccer League since 2010, will make their MLS debut starting with the 2018 season. Coupled with already-announced expansion plans for Atlanta and the recreation of the team formerly known as Chivas USA in Los Angeles, Minnesota United will be the 23rd franchise in MLS. Minnesota United will be the 23rd MLS franchise, joining Kaka's new Orlando City team in the league . Kaka and David Villa have both started  for expansion franchises this season, with Villa at New York City . 'We have a plan here that we believe in,' MLS Commissioner Don Garber said during a news conference at the home of Major League Baseball's Minnesota Twins. 'A plan that we believe will take the sport to a higher level.' MLS grew to 20 clubs this season with Orlando City and New York City FC both joining the league. Miami is in line to become the 24th MLS franchise but the Florida team is in doubt as the would-be owners have been unable to secure a stadium deal.

"Richard Scudamore’s elevation from CEO to Premier League chairman at Thursday's club summit will also see the world’s richest league have a new-look set of directors. But the board will remain remarkably different from the company director structure at the top of other multi-billion-pound businesses. The three-strong PL version is expected to consist of just Scudamore and two newly appointed independent directors to be unveiled on Thursday, who will hopefully provide some gender and race diversity. Richard Scudamore (left) will be elevated from CEO to Premier League chairman at Thursday's club summit and be joined by two newly appointed independent directors . FA chairman Greg Dyke will be under pressure to explain his campaign for more homegrown players . The formation, which will need a change of PL statutes, is at least a step nearer fit-for-purpose governance than the current two-man board of Scudamore and Peter McCormick, the interim chairman who is standing down. The PL still regard their six-times-a-year club summits as board meetings with their 20 shareholders, despite most of the top-flight foreign owners never bothering to attend. Meanwhile, FA chairman Greg Dyke has tended to keep quiet in PL meetings, but he will be under pressure on Thursday to explain his campaign for more homegrown players in PL squads to help the national team. Dyke has strong backing from UEFA for this initiative, which hasn’t been supported by the PL representatives on the FA board. It will not please Derby fans but the strong word is that their manager Steve McClaren is heading for Newcastle at the end of the season, irrespective of whether County are promoted. It would seem odd for McClaren, who will not comment about his future, to swap the solid Derby set-up for the madness of St James’ Park, but football rarely fails to surprise. Derby manager Steve McClaren is looking a strong possibility to head to Newcastle at the end of the season . Surrey were seemingly expecting their entire global membership to buy tickets for Kevin Pietersen’s return this season, judging by emails received on Wednesday from Ticketmaster confirming the purchase of seats. The botched memos went to the full Surrey database, much to the county’s embarrassment, with a phone message on the Oval ticket office voicemail telling callers to disregard the mass posting. Ticketmaster are infamous for their computer system continually crashing during the sale of London 2012 Olympic seats. Kevin Pietersen's signing back at Surrey coincided with a bothed mass email to members about tickets . Giles Clarke, who stands down as ECB chairman in May, has been the loudest autocratic voice on most English cricket issues since he took the helm in 2008. Yet Clarke has chosen to stay noticeably silent on Kevin Pietersen’s return to Surrey. The Football League are taking a lot longer than promised to probe the Financial Fair Play returns of Leicester and QPR. The Leicester issue centres on a Far East marketing deal to offset losses, agreed with a Sheffield agency owned by former Premier League chairman Sir Dave Richards and his son. And investigating QPR owner Tony Fernandes writing off £60million of debts to counter massive breaching of FFP limits is proving hard enough without the extra difficulties of CEO Phil Beard having left the club and finance director Rebecca Caplehorn moving to Spurs.

Beckham has spent more than a year being frustrated by complex state and city Miami politics stopping him finding a suitable stadium site. US football heads are fearing David Beckham’s Major League Soccer plans could out of time . And US chiefs do not believe the proposed venue close to the Marlins baseball arena is the right location. Powerbrokers say Beckham should build a waterfront downtown ground to maximise the appeal of the new franchise. Team Beckham remain 100 per cent confident that the project will work and are concentrating on funding that will determine the club’s ambitions. Sajid Javid, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who has shown no interest in sport during his year in the job, bizarrely chose the last week before the election recess to make his first speech on the subject.

"Harry Kane's participation in this summer’s Under 21 European Championship is in doubt after it emerged that Tottenham are considering a post-season friendly in Malaysia. Spurs are committed to an exhibition match against Sydney FC in Australia on May 30 and are to hold talks about a friendly in Kuala Lumpur on the way. Kane, 21, has been told he will travel to Australia with the rest of the squad and would also be in the party stopping off in Malaysia for another lucrative end-of-season game. Harry Kane could miss the Under 21 European Championship due to a friendly in Malaysia . Kane trains after being called up to his first senior squad after a sensational season with Spurs . Kane helped England U21s to the tournament in the Czech Republic with six goals in eight games . Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has expressed his fears about burn-out for the Premier League’s joint leading goalscorer as he prepares to make his England debut against Lithuania. The FA are in talks with Kane and Tottenham officials, including Pochettino, about playing for Gareth Southgate’s England Under 21 team in the Czech Republic. But negotiations have become increasingly tense because of Tottenham’s commitments in Australia after the final game of the season on May 24. Pochettino wants Kane to miss this summer’s tournament to make sure he has enough recovery time before the start of next season, but the striker wants to play in the championship. Kane has been told he will not be required for the senior friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 or a Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia a week later. Instead he is wanted by Southgate for the Under 21 tournament which runs from June 17-30. Kane hit his first Premier LEague hat-trick against Leicester, taking his tally for the season to 29 .

Meanwhile, Roy Hodgson will attend the World Cup draw in July as England manager but with no assurances that he will be in charge for the campaign to reach Russia in 2018. Hodgson is keen to extend his contract which will expire next year, although FA chairman Greg Dyke has warned him that negotiations may not begin for another 12 months. ‘I get on quite well with Roy and we chat all the time but we have not talked about contracts yet,’ said Dyke. ‘We genuinely haven’t discussed it. We will have that discussion in the next nine months to a year. ‘When we decided in Brazil that we wanted Roy to continue with his contract, we thought, “He’s got a contract, he sees it through”. Some time in the next year we will discuss what happens afterwards.’ Roy Hodgson says he has not discussed a contract extension beyond next year . Hodgson's England are top of their qualifying group and look set for a spot in France . The draw for the World Cup qualifiers is in St Petersburg on July 25. Hodgson will represent England but Dyke plans to miss the event after reacting to a tough 2014 World Cup draw by making a cut-throat gesture. ‘Roy will go, I’m not allowed after what happened last time,’ he said. England are cruising towards Euro 2016 after winning the first four qualifiers to establish a six-point lead at the head of a group from which the top two go through automatically. Hodgson will be 70 at the time of the World Cup in Russia but has proved a popular manager with FA chiefs and players alike since he replaced Fabio Capello in 2012. The Euro 2016 qualification process has been so tame, however, that a final decision on his contract may even be shelved until after the finals. ‘Without being disrespectful, this group isn’t the toughest,’ said centre half Phil Jagielka. ‘Time will tell in the tournament. There is a bit of pressure on and that is when the judgment will be clearer. We need to have a good tournament in France to back him if Roy is going to stay on, and the boys are desperate to do that. He’s a likeable person and a good man-manager.’ Additional reporting: Matt Barlow .","Kane's participation in the Czech Republic is in doubt due to Spurs' friendly in Malaysia as part of their post-season tour .

"Joe Hart did not need a blinder in Barcelona to confirm his status as England’s No 1 goalkeeper, but serious injuries to his two deputies will revive concerns at the lack of cover available to Roy Hodgson. Fraser Forster met with specialists on Wednesday after scans confirmed he broke his left knee-cap in Southampton’s win against Burnley on Saturday. Forster will miss the rest of this season and may not play again this year which is a blow for Saints as they aim for Europe, and also for England boss Hodgson at a time when Ben Foster is out for six months. Joe Hart talks to the media on Wednesday ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday . Manchester City goalkeeper Hart makes a save during training at St George's Park with the England squad . Foster damaged cruciate ligaments in his left knee while playing for West Bromwich Albion against Stoke 12 days ago. Hodgson will be exposed if Hart is hit by injury or suspension, although the Manchester City goalkeeper has backed the decision to recall QPR’s Rob Green for the first time in nearly three years. ‘Greeny is rock solid,’ said Hart. ‘His mentality is great. And he is a very good goalkeeper who has been playing at the top level for a long time. There are no surprises. ‘I was gutted for Ben and Fraser. It’s really, really sad news. ‘It has rocked us all as a goalkeeping group and rocked all the lads in the squad because they are great guys and they are having great seasons. ‘But Greeny has come in and hopefully he can profit. He did brilliantly in the Championship last year. Robert Green (right) trains with Joe Hart (centre) at St George's Park in Roy Hodgson's England squad . Fraser Forster suffered a knee injury after colliding with Burnley's Sam Vokes at the weekend . West Brom keeper Ben Foster makes a save against Tottenham in January but is out injured for six months . ‘I remember watching him in the play-off final, when he was man of the match for me. QPR are in a bad position but he has been fantastic this season.’ Green has 12 caps, but only one since the World Cup in South Africa when he was pilloried for a mistake which gifted the United States an equaliser as England drew 1-1 in their opening group game. He did not play again for Fabio Capello, and his only game since was against Norway, in Hodgson’s second game in charge. Neymar attempts to nip the ball away from Hart's clutches at the Nou Camp during the Champions League tie . Lionel Messi tries to find a way past Hart but the England stopper was in fine form at the Nou Camp . The English keeper once again thwarts Messi during the Champions League last-16 encounter . Green, 35, has not been in the squad since Euro 2012 despite his reliable form at QPR, but will be on the bench for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday and probably for the friendly against Italy in Turin on Tuesday. Jack Butland, 22, has been promoted from the Under 21 squad. He has been capped once at senior level, in a friendly against Italy in Switzerland in 2012, but he has had little first-team action this season. Butland played six times during a loan spell at Derby and has played five cup games for Stoke, where he has been unable to oust Bosnian international Asmir Begovic since signing from Birmingham. Others who might come into Hodgson’s thinking are John Ruddy, who also has one cap — as a half-time substitute for Butland in that Italy game — and is enjoying a good season in the Championship with Norwich, and Tom Heaton at Burnley. Heaton is at least playing regularly in the Barclays Premier League, where 75 per cent of the goalkeepers are foreign. Butland’s step up leaves Under 21 boss Gareth Southgate with two Championship goalkeepers — Jonathan Bond, 21, understudy to Heurelho Gomes at Watford, and Marcus Bettinelli, 22, who has recently broken into the Fulham team. Some experts believe the next keeper to emerge as a serious challenger to Hart will be Manchester City and England Under 19 keeper Angus Gunn, 19-year-old son of former Scotland international Bryan Gunn. Hart will win his 50th cap in Italy on Tuesday, if he plays in both these international games, and is still only 27. He could play at the top for another decade if he can stay fit — Hodgson will pray that he does — and that would bring Peter Shilton’s record of 125 England caps into range. Shilton was 31 when he played his 50th game for England but went on until he was 40. ‘It’s exciting, 50 caps would be an amazing milestone, but I want to get there first,’ said Hart. ‘We have two games and we’ve seen recently that you never know what’s going to happen. I just want to push on and earn my right to keep playing for my country. Peter Shilton was 31 when he won his 50th England cap, while Hart could win his against Italy next week . ‘I want to be here for as long as I can, but there are plenty of other English goalkeepers who want to be in my place and I’m going to have to be at my very best to keep that position.’ Tottenham defender Danny Rose on Wednesday night withdrew from the squad with hip and hamstring problems. Rose was called up by England after Manchester United’s Luke Shaw withdrew on Saturday. But the left back has now been sent back to his club with an injury of his own. With Leighton Baines and Keiran Gibbs already in the squad, Hodgson has decided not to call up a replacement.","Southampton keeper Fraser Forster has undergone surgery on his knee .

"Manny Pacquiao suffers from such bad leg cramps during training that he spends a staggering $1,800 on a tube of anti-inflammatory cream. The Filipino superstar is into the fourth week of his training camp ahead of his $300million mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather Jnr on May 2. And his trainer Freddie Roach revealed the problems he has due to the size of his calves. 'There's no magic cure for it,' Roach told Yahoo. 'We're doing what we can do. I've got the doctors working on it. There are some Filipino guys here who are massaging it for him. The cream cost $1,800 for a single bottle. I wasn't too happy about that.' Manny Pacquiao jogs round the track as he makes an early start to his workout on Wednesday . Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach (right) revealed his fighter suffers from bad leg cramps in training . The cost is so high because Pacquiao does not have health insurance in the United States and the cream had to be run past USADA who are conducting drug tests in the build-up to the Las Vegas showdown. Roach has also changed Pacquiao's training regime to reduce the pressure on his legs. 'We did change his running schedule because I don't like him running the hills six days a week,' he added. 'I've got him on the track a lot more now doing fast sprint-type workouts instead of hill workouts. I think it's better for the older fighters sometimes to stay away from the hills so much.'

"No-one will linger long over this. At some point on Thursday morning it will be gone, expunged from the memory, all thoughts turning to a significant European Championship qualifier with Gibraltar on Sunday. For both nations this was what it was. An improving Northern Ireland have their own qualifier against Finland and, like the Scots, had an eye on the bigger prize. The 85th-minute corner from debutant Matt Ritchie which placed the ball onto the head of goalscoring substitute Christophe Berra salvaged the night from irrelevance. Christophe Berra gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for Scotland . Berra celebrates his late goal, which was one of the few memorable moments in a game lacking intensity or quality . The Ipswich Town centre back celebrates with his team-mates after securing the win five minutes from time . Steven Fletcher gets a shot away, one of few clear cut chances created by either team, but was unable to put his team ahead . The Sunderland striker is denied again by Michael McGovern as he goes through one on one to try and break the deadlock . Scotland: Gordon (McGregor 45 mins), Whittaker (Russell 78), Greer, Martin (Berra 45), Forsyth, McArthur (Morrison 63), Darren Fletcher, Ritchie, Maloney (Naismith 45), Steven Fletcher (Rhodes 63), Anya. Subs not used: Brown, May, Robertson, Hutton, Bannan, Reynolds, , Forrest, Marshall. Goal: Berra 85 . Northern Ireland: McGovern, Danny Lafferty, Jonny Evans (McCullough 81), Baird 9Hodson58), Dallas, Reeves (Ryan McLaughlin 70), McNair, Hughes, Norwood (Davis 69), Magennis (McKay 75), Grigg (McCourt 58). Subs: Mannus, Conor McLaughlin, Kyle Lafferty, Brunt, Ward, Cathcart. Referee: Martin Atkinson (England) A captain’s performance from Darren Fletcher was also worthy of note. Throw in some decent runs and crosses from Derby left back Craig Forsyth in his first start and Gordon Strachan will take value from this. With Ikechi Anya, the enigmatic Watford winger who tried his utmost to enliven a comatose friendly, there was evidence of a promising new line of attack. Yet the truth is this. It was no night for snap judgments. Strachan fiddled with his resources, never really fielding anything resembling his strongest first 11. At times this was a stark reminder of why the Home International Championships are now a distant, mothballed relic. ‘I thought it was important to win this game,’ said the Scotland boss. ‘Just to make us feel good about ourselves. The performance was good at times. We got used to the pitch as well - which is a bit slick. Northern Ireland have improved immensely over the last year, beating Hungary and Greece.’ They never threatened a repeat. Their boss Michael O’Neill, an old face on the Scottish scene, said: ‘For us I thought there were more positive than negatives. But we didn’t get enough good balls in the box. We left a lot of our first-choice players out, seven or eight of our players that will probably start on Sunday [against Finland].’ Berra’s breakthrough came in his first appearance for his country since November 2013. It came late, as people crept towards the exits, resigning themselves to a mediocre scoreless draw. The Ipswich defender’s header from the penalty spot crept through a ruck of bodies and into the net via the inside of the post. Northern Ireland's Stuart Dallas carries the ball away from Shaun Maloney as both sides warmed up for competitive football . Scotland captain Darren Fletcher issues instructions from his position in front of the back four . Ikechi Anya (right), who was one of Scotland's livelier players, takes on Manchester United defender Patrick McNair on the wing . It was a reward Scotland just about deserved. They had given it a go in the opening half, but looked to have run out of ideas after a raft of substitutions. Thank goodness for Anya, a cult figure amongst the Tartan Army, who brings an energy and industry to his work. Even on nights like this. Nights when, bluntly, others can’t quite find their game. Reared a mile or so from Hampden his endeavour and tempo kept things interesting when an unspecified crowd estimated at less than 30,000 allowed their minds to drift towards the latest plot on Coronation Street. Anya was at the heart of the first major chance in just four minutes, scurrying down the left flank and playing a one-two with Forsyth. A sharp cut-back was turned towards goal at the second attempt, Northern Ireland keeper Michael McGovern – also Hamilton’s keeper – producing a terrific save to push the ball over the bar. The early touch gave the keeper confidence. He would need it as Anya embarked on a one-man war of attrition. The little winger, whose goal in Germany last September has already become an iconic moment, was hellbent on adding to his tally. He smashed a low right-foot shot from 20 yards in nine minutes. Scuttled forward and hit one wide with his right in 20. Then wasted a great chance after James McArthur nicked the ball off the toe of Chris Baird and teed him up two minutes later, thumping past the post again. Dallas goes up for a header against Steven Whittaker as the two sides attempted to stamp their authority on the friendly fixture . Bournemouth star Matt Ritchie, who made his debut in Wednesday night's game, controls the ball in midfield . It took half an hour for another Scotland player to have a crack on goal, Steven Fletcher’s low shot from 18 yards taken comfortably by McGovern. Five years have passed since Fletcher, Sunderland’s £14million man, last scored for his country. The only strike in 19 appearances for a player people screamed for during the infamous Craig Levein spat. No-one remembers the goal – in a 2-1 World Cup qualifying win over Iceland in April 2009. Instead they remember Barry Ferguson’s V-sign to photographers or goalkeeper Allan McGregor’s smirk in the aftermath of the infamous Boozegate episode. A Steven Fletcher goal celebration in a Scotland shirt is now a solitary event. He had another chance to change that before half-time, making the run to take a Maloney pass and trying to dink a shot over McGovern. To his credit the Irish keeper – an old hand around these parts – would not be beaten. Fletcher lasted an hour before accepting that this, once more, would not be his night for a goal. Manchester United's Jonny Evans (left), the Northern Ireland captain, holds off Steven Whittaker as the ball goes past . McGovern gets up well to punch away, under pressure from Scotland striker Steven Fletcher, as McNair watches on . The substitutions are a necessary nuisance in these games. Keen to try as many players out as possible before Sunday, Strachan made plenty. Steven Naismith and, critically, Berra joined McGregor as half-time replacements, the Hull City No1 replacing Celtic’s Craig Gordon. On the hour mark, James Morrison and Jordan Rhodes – Fletcher’s replacement - were also handed a half hour to turn things around. For Northern Ireland, the arrival of the mercurial Paddy McCourt - scorer of extraordinary goals for Celtic - and former Rangers skipper Steven Davis also raised interest levels. For Matt Ritchie, it was a tentative, but promising debut. He ran around a lot and showed sharpness, and almost made the decisive impact in 69 minutes – taking a neat lay off from Naismith and thrashing a long-range shot a couple of yards wide. With the best assist record in English football, he also takes a decent corner. A swirling inswinging ball picked out Naismith for a firm header which hit the target, but failed to seriously trouble the confident figure of McGovern. Ritchie had better luck with his delivery from a corner five minutes from time when Berra claimed his third goal for Scotland. And just when Northern Ireland boss O’Neill thought his young, inexperienced side had come through the game unscathed. Against a Gibraltar team who have shipped 21 goals in four qualifiers, O’Neill expects Scotland to do likewise. ‘There is a lot more depth in the Scotland squad at this moment in time,’ he said. ‘They moved the ball well and looked strong and powerful. Anya, in the first 15 or 20 minutes, caused us problems. I don’t anticipate Gibraltar will give you too many problems. I certainly hope not.’ In that regard he probably spoke for a nation. Anya and McNair battle for the ball in a game that had plenty of endeavour without much quality from either side . The teams observed a minute's applause for the late Dave Mackay before the game at Hampden Park .","Christophe Berra heads in 85th minute winner in front of sparse crowd .

"David Haye insists his long-awaited comeback is still on and is already plotting a route to WBC king – and his old sparring partner – Deontay Wilder. Former two-weight world champion Haye, now 34, has not been seen in the ring since he stopped Dereck Chisora in the fifth round of their thrilling clash at West Ham's Upton Park back in July 2012 . Since then, two fights with British rival Tyson Fury have fallen through, the second of which as a result of shoulder surgery that threatened to end his career for good at the end of 2013. David Haye has vowed to return to the ring after almost three years out of action through injury . Then, last June, Haye revealed that he would fight on and predicted a return to the ring in the following autumn. However he is still yet to re-lace the gloves and it has been suggested that he might never do so again. But 'The Hayemaker' is adamant he will box on, has already set his sights on American knock-out artist Wilder and thinks a world title showdown within just 18 months could be possible. Haye said: 'Yes you will see me back in the ring. I've been taking it easy of late as obviously I had a bad shoulder injury so I needed reconstructive surgery on it. 'That's good now, I've got all the movement back and I'm banging harder than ever with that. I'm just surveying the land at the moment and seeing what's happening out there. 'The heavyweight division is looking as good as it has done for a long time. You've got Wladimir Klitschko still doing what he does, you've got the emergence of Deontay Wilder, the WBC champion, big guy, perfect record. He just had a great win and I was in Vegas when he fought Bermane Stiverne. He looked like the real deal, he really did.' Haye was last in action when he stopped British rival Dereck Chisora at Upton Park in 2012 . Haye knows all about Wilder having shared the ring with him during training back in 2013. Footage of that spar can be found on Youtube and, despite the big gloves and headguard, Haye appears to have the American in real trouble. But it is the 'Bronze Bomber' who now sits on top of the world having beaten Stiverne to win the title, taking his record to 33 wins from 33 fights, with all but one coming inside four rounds. Haye added: 'He helped me out in the past with sparring so I know him very well and I think that has really spiced up the heavyweight division. 'I think a great route would be to go to America and try to navigate a way to the WBC title. Deontay Wilder is a very good champion and if i start fighting regularly I am probably a year or 18 months away from being in a mandatory position to fight him. 'I'm not stupid and I don't think I will just jump straight in there. I think it would be disrespectful to the champions and a bit idiotic of myself to think that just because three years ago I could fight at a good level I can just come straight back . 'Not even Usain Bolt can take three years out and come straight in and expect to beat the world.' It is almost four years since Haye lost a unanimous points decision to Klitschko on a rain-soaked night in Hamburg. Haye twice saw a fight against Tyson Fury fall through after he suffered injuries in training . Since then, all seven of Dr Steelhammer's fights have taken place in Europe. But Klitschko's next outing, a defence of his WBA, WBO and IBF belts against Bryant Jennings, will be at New York's iconic Madison Square Garden on April 25. 'It makes a change,' Haye said. 'In America things are starting to shake up and I think he's realised by continuously fighting in Germany, only German people watch that. 'Worldwide he doesn't do great business and I think he realises time's ticking and he doesn't have many fights left in him. For the next couple of years he wants to really finish his legacy with some really big fights. If he has to travel he has to and he deserves respect for that.' Haye was speaking at a visit to the Double Jab ABC in New Cross as part of Join In and England Boxing's launch of 'Backing Up Boxing'. Their aim is to drive more volunteers to help out at similar boxing clubs across the country. Haye said: 'All of my coaches when I was a kid, from the age of 10 to 20 were volunteers. They weren't getting paid. Out of the goodness of their hearts they came down to Fitzroy Lodge in Lambeth and trained a bunch of kids. 'Even if you don't make a career out of it, there is so much badness out there on the streets on a daily basis. The more youth centres, boxing gyms and football academies, the more stuff we have for kids, stops them smoking, drinking, smoking weed, taking drugs. It's a slippery spiral. 'Hopefully people listening to me will want to try and help. You can go to joininuk.org and see if there is anything you can get involved in.'

"Sir Alex Ferguson has described Hearts owner Ann Budge as ‘a guardian angel’ for galvanising the club following the devastating effects of administration. The former Manchester United manager was in Edinburgh this week to attend the funeral of Hearts’ greatest-ever player Dave Mackay. But the 73-year-old also took time out to pay tribute to the leadership of Budge after head coach Robbie Neilson guided the team to the Championship title last weekend with seven games to spare. Ferguson said: ‘I think Dave would be very proud of Hearts. As you know, they’ve been through a terrible time. I go back to when I was a boy and they were my sort of second team after Rangers, with the great players John Cumming, (Willie) Bauld, (Alfie) Conn and (Jimmy) Wardhaugh.

I’m really proud of the job that Ann Budge has done. ‘I think it is onwards and upwards,’ Ferguson told Hearts TV. ‘I don’t think there’s anyway back now and you’ve found your way. Sometimes you get lost on the road to where you want to go to and now they’ve found their way again. ‘They look more than a useful team because I’ve watched them a few times this season. They play some really good football and I think you’ll be very welcome in the Premier Division, I’m sure of that, and you’ll do well.’ Ferguson arrived at Hearts' Tynecastle earlier in the afternoon prior to leading the tributes . Ferguson was in distinguished company, with former Manchester United man Denis Law (back) also present . Meanwhile, Hearts legend John Robertson insists there is no chance the newly-crowned Championship winners will slack off out of respect for the teams still chasing promotion. Neilson’s side have a role to play when it comes to who finishes among the three play-off places in the second tier.

Owner Ann Budge has steered Hearts back to the Scottish Premiership . Budge pictured with Hearts director of football Craig Levein and head coach Robbie Neilsen . ‘We’ve got players that have not had a lot of game time and they’ll want to play,’ he said. ‘They’ll want to show between now and the end of the season they’re good enough for the Premiership. ‘There is also the integrity of the competition. Queen of the South are in a huge battle and there’s no way Robbie Neilson or the staff will rest players or put out what people perceive as a weakened team. ‘Last Saturday, guys like Sam Nicholson, James Keatings and Kenny Anderson came on. There are still guys like Soufian El Hassnaoui, Kevin McHattie, Jordan McGhee and Brad McKay sitting on the bench and they are all bona fide Premiership players that want to play. ‘Now the league is won, the next target is that Hearts fans are desperate to see the team score 100 goals.

"These are the dramatic moments that coastguards carried out a 'miracle' rescue to save a stranded puppy after it plunged 40 ft off a cliff. The six-month-old Rhodesian ridgeback, called Crouton, fell down the steep cliff while it was trying to catch a rabbit. Crouton landed a ledge which prevented the pup from a further fall of 60 ft into the raging sea below. Scroll down for video . A member of the rescue teams from Durness and Melness abseils down to rescue Crouton after the fall . Reunited with his owner, Crouton jumps for joy and has a well deserved biscuit to recover from the ordeal . Shetland coastguard teams from Durness and Melness were involved in the Highland rescue attempt . Shetland coastguard teams from Durness and Melness rushed to the incident at Durness in the north west Highlands. They were assisted by an officer from the Scottish SPCA who oversaw the rescue. After the colossal effort, the pup escaped safe and unscathed. Gordon Kerr, 54, a prison officer from Ayrshire who saw the rescue, said: 'I was walking around Smoo Cave when I heard a dog barking loudly. 'Originally I thought it was just a farmer's dog. As I walked a bit further I could see the coastguard were setting up - initially thinking that it was a training exercise. 'When I asked a stranger what they thought was going on, he told me that he had been out walking his dog when it bolted for a rabbit and fell 40 feet. 'It luckily managed to land on a ledge.

'When the dog came back up, it started jumping around, high-fiving its owner and asking for biscuits.' A spokesman for Melness coastguard said: 'The owner of the dog was extremely grateful for all the help provided by the Coastguard Teams and the SSPCA. The elaborate rescue involved two coastguard team and a number of cables to ensure their safety . The coast guard described the operation as a 'text book' rope rescue and said its teams had worked well . 'It was a successful outcome with a happy ending, teams worked well together, resulting in a text book rope rescue. 'Be aware that if your dog is unfortunate enough to fall over or get stuck down a cliff, do not under any circumstances attempt a self rescue.

"Steve Smith scored a brilliant century to lay a solid platform but Australia lost a string of wickets in the second half of their innings to finish with 328 for seven in the World Cup semi-final against India on Thursday. On a good Sydney Cricket Ground pitch in perfect weather conditions, the reigning champions will fancy their chances of overhauling the target of 329 and taking their place in Sunday's final against New Zealand in Melbourne. Smith (105) came back to torment India in a partnership of 182 with opener Aaron Finch (81) to lead Australia to a comfortable position with close to 200 runs on the board, nine wickets in hand and over 15 overs to bat. With Umesh Yadav (4-72) to the fore, however, India struck back to remove the power-hitters in Australia's middle order and disrupt their attempt to plunder runs in the later overs. ""I think it's a good total, we're going to have to bowl and field well though,"" said Smith. ""At the start, if you're offered 330, I reckon you take that nine times out of 10. It's going to be about squeezing and hopefully the bowlers can do a job for us. ""It's always nice getting hundreds at the SCG and hopefully the boys can back it up in the field now."" Smith had come to the crease in the fourth over after Yadav had bounced out opener David Warner for 12 and rarely looked troubled for the remainder of his 122-minute knock. The bouncers were pulled, he called for a cap when the spinners came on and hit 11 fours and two sixes to give India a rude reminder of his prolific form in the test series around New Year, when he scored a century in all four matches. The 25-year-old secured his fourth straight half century at the World Cup in 53 balls and was soon surging towards his fourth ODI century, which he secured with a six and a four off successive balls. Aaron Finch at the other end was looking less assured as he sought to end his run of poor form but he too reached the half century mark before his partnership with Smith was broken in the 35th over. Yadav again did the damage, his bouncer cramping Smith as he attempted the hook with the ensuing top edge flying to Rohit Sharma at deep square leg. Glenn Maxwell came out ahead of his skipper Michael Clarke and hit a brisk 23 off 14 balls before sweeping a Ravichandran Ashwin delivery to Ajinkya Rahane at deep backward square leg. The crowd, the majority wearing the blue of India, were roused and Finch soon departed as Yadav's third victim with Clarke (10) and James Faulkner (21) following him back to the dressing room as Australia tumbled to 284 for six. Even the experienced partnership of Shane Watson and Brad Haddin (seven not out) was unable to steady the ship as Australia tried to balance the imperative of scoring quickly with making sure they did not run out of batsmen. Watson departed for 28 to give Mohit Sharma his second wicket and it was left to paceman Mitchell Johnson to bolster Australia's tally closer to a par score with his 27 not out off nine balls. It was the first time in eight matches at the World Cup that India had failed to dismiss their opponents .","India need 329 runs to beat Australia and make World Cup final .

"England Under 20s defeated Mexico 4-2 in a penalty shootout in their friendly at Barnet on Wednesday night. The Young Lions converted all four of their spot-kicks, while Mexico's Luis Marquez struck the crossbar and Alejandro Diaz fired an awful kick out of the stadium. The game had ended 1-1 in normal time after Chuba Akpom won and then drilled home a spot kick to cancel out Jose Ramirez’s opener early in the second-half. Chuba Akpom of England scores their equaliser from the penalty spot for England Under 20s . England: Walton; Iorfa, Odubajo, Hause, Cargill; Hanson (Reed 74), Baker (c) (Swift 69), Osborn (Grimes 69); Barmby, Akpom, Robinson .

Scorer: Ramirez 48 . Sent off: Gudino . Booked: Terran, Gutierrez . Coach: Sergio Almaguer Trevino . Referee: Andy Davies (England) The Arsenal forward, who has been on the fringes of Arsene Wenger’s first team this season, burst clear in the 78th minute and was upended by Mexico goalkeeper Raul Gudino, who was shown a red card. The 19-year-old, enjoying a prolific season for club and country at youth level, dusted himself off to fire home and draw Aidy Boothroyd’s side level in the match. They had fallen behind three minutes after half-time when Ramirez found himself totally unmarked to sidefoot a low cross past England goalkeeper Christian Walton. This encounter, under floodlights at The Hive, home of Vanarama Conference promotion hopefuls Barnet, was the first in a double-header this week, with the United States lying in wait in Plymouth on Sunday. Mexico, who won the CONCACAF Under 20 Championship in Jamaica in January, booking their spot at the Under 20 World Cup in New Zealand later this year, were always going to provide stiff opposition. Tasked with preparing another crop of players for under 21 standard, Aidy Boothroyd mixed rising stars from the Premier League academies with names who have featured regularly at Championship level this season.

England started positively but the first chance fell to Mexico, who moved the ball slickly on the counter-attack all night and often favoured a cross-field ball to catch out the home defence. Daniel Rios collected the ball on the edge of the area, traded passes with Diego Gama, before firing in a shot that goalkeeper Christian Walton blocked with his body. England’s first sniff of goal fell to Arsenal’s Chuba Akpom, having his best campaign yet on the fringes of Arsene Wenger’s first team, but his daisy-cutter from range lacked power. One of those cross-field pings almost caught England out on 19 minutes when the impressive Luis Marquez found Ramirez wide on the left. Instead of looking for options centrally, he shot from a tight angle and Walton gathered. Nottingham Forest midfielder Ben Osborn pinged a shot a couple of feet wide of the post but Mexico enjoyed the best chance of the half just after the half-hour. An inswinging corner from Marquez was met by Gama, who had burst to the near post, but his header crashed back off the crossbar with Walton beaten.

Two minutes after that, Leicester City man Jack Barmby lost out to Marquez in a battle for the loose ball and the Mexican wasn’t too far away of steering a low shot inside the far post. It didn’t take long for Mexico to find the breakthrough in the second-half. From their first attack, the ball was worked quickly across from the right wing and there was Ramirez, completely unmarked, to sidefoot past Walton from close range. It was a frustrating goal to concede and Mexico offered little respite. The half-time substitute Irving Lozano curled a shot just over and the visitors looked the more likely to score. Boothroyd introduced one Chelsea man for another when John Swift came on for Lewis Baker, while Matty Grimes of Swansea City replaced Osborn. Slowly, England started to carve out chances and a mazy run down the left from Barmby saw him fire across the face of goal. Their reward would soon arrive through Akpom and he could have won it but struck the outside of the post late on.

"Roy Hodgson will attend the World Cup draw in July as England manager but with no assurances that he will be in charge for the campaign to reach Russia in 2018. Hodgson is keen to extend his contract which will expire next year although FA chairman Greg Dyke has warned him that negotiations may not open for another 12 months. 'I get on quite well with Roy and we chat all the time but we have not talked about contracts yet,' said Dyke. 'We genuinely haven't discussed it. We will have that discussion in the next nine months to a year. England and Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart is kept busy during training at St Georges Park on Tuesday . Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling controls the ball during training on Tuesday . Roy Hodgson will be hoping to continue England's unbeaten run in Group E against Lithuania on Friday . 'When we decided in Brazil that we wanted Roy to continue with his contract, we thought: 'He's got a contract, he sees it through'. Sometime in the next year we will discuss what happens afterwards.' The draw for the World Cup qualifiers is in St Petersburg, Russia, on July 25. Hodgson will represent England, but Dyke plans to dodge the event after reacting to a tough World Cup draw by making a cut-throat gesture. 'Roy will go, I'm not allowed after what happened last time,' said Dyke. England, who play Lithuania at Wembley on Fridayare cruising towards Euro 2016 in France, winning the first four qualifiers to establish a six-point lead at the top of a group from which the top two automatically go through. England and Everton centre back Phil Jagielka speaks to the media after training on Tuesday . Hodgson will be 70 at the time of the World Cup in Russia but has proved a popular manager with FA chiefs and players alike since he replaced Fabio Capello, in 2012. The Euro 2016 qualification process has been so tame, however, that a final decision on his contract may even be shelved until after the finals as England bid to improve on their World Cup flop, when they failed to win a game. 'Without being disrespectful, this group isn't the toughest,' said centre-half Phil Jagielka. 'Time will tell in the tournament. There is a bit of pressure on and that is when the judgment will be clearer. Wayne Rooney (centre) leads his England team-mates on a lap as they continue their preparations for Friday . 'We need to have a good tournament in France to back him if Roy is going to stay on, but the boys are desperate to do that. He's a likeable person and a good man-manager. 'We want to play well and get as far as we can. We will be looking, and should be looking, to go and win the tournament. We want to keep progressing. We have a good, youthful and talented squad.

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is under no illusions about the potential repercussions of Monday night’s visit to Old Trafford. Any clash against Manchester United, particularly in the Wenger era, carries added value for the Gunners. The fact that it is an FA Cup quarter-final with a place at Wembley at stake merely adds to the occasion. And for Wenger it’s a chance to land what could be a crucial psychological blow on Louis van Gaal’s side ahead of the tense season finale. Theo Walcott holds off Nacho Monreal as Arsenal trained on Sunday at their London Colney training ground . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain lets fly with a shot, as Arsene Wenger promised his team would attack United . The Gunners squad are put through their paces as they look to reach Wembley for the third time in two years . Arsene Wenger is confident his team can beat Manchester United by playing attacking football . The FA Cup isn’t the only competition in which these two giants are going toe to toe. They are also battling for a Champions League position, a race which is perhaps more pertinent to both clubs’ long-term ambitions. There are no points at stake tonight but Wenger said: ‘It’s a big game, and every big win in a big game has an impact subconsciously in the belief of the team.’ However, the reverse is also true. Losing against United could plant a seed of doubt in Arsenal’s quest to finish in the top four — and their poor recent record at Old Trafford doesn’t bode well. United have won nine out of their last 10 home games against the Gunners. We shouldn’t forget, though, that Wenger also has pleasant memories of the Theatre of Dreams. He lists Sylvain Wiltord’s goal that clinched the title for Arsenal at Old Trafford in 2002 as his favourite. And the Frenchman insists his current crop of players can produce another win in United’s back yard on Monday night. Arsenal's World Cup winning playmaker Mesut Ozil has been in top form since returning from injury . Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez, who scored a brilliant goal in midweek against QPR, looks lively in training . Per Mertesacker, whose place was in doubt before an injury to Gabriel, gestures to his team-mates . ‘I don’t believe our recent record at Old Trafford (to be a factor). When the team is less good, they lose. When the team is not as good, they lose,’ said Wenger. ‘It doesn’t matter what shirt they wear, or what stadium they play in. It is down to quality. ‘If I’ve learnt something in my life it’s that the performance on the day decides the outcome of the day, not where you play. ‘The fact that we can win away from home, that is important. If you haven’t won away from home all season it’s more difficult. But we know we can do well away from home.’ Tomas Rosicky attempts to control the ball as Walcott, Mertesacker and Ramsey watch on . Indeed, their victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium earlier this season proved they can produce big away performances against England’s elite, and Wenger insists last season’s FA Cup triumph has bolstered belief that his side can become English football’s top dogs once more. ‘Yes, of course we want to dominate again,’ said Wenger. ‘I think today you have more competitors and it will get worse with the seasons coming because you get more money in. That means even the smaller teams will be capable to buy the best players in Europe. Sylvain Wiltord’s goal at Old Trafford in 2002 that clinched the league title for the Gunners at Old Trafford . ‘Maybe the competition will become harder for everybody. Winning the FA Cup gave us energy because we had a few years without winning a trophy and so on that front it was vital. ‘This team has a good mentality because we had a slow start this season and every time we lost a big game you see how much the players are touched. ‘I think the mentality is very healthy, they want to do well and we will be focused on Manchester United. ‘Once you get to the quarter- final you think that’s a good opportunity to win a trophy. You want to do it, but it’s at that stage where it’s conflicting always with the Champions League.’","Arsenal face Manchester United in the FA Cup sixth-round on Monday .

"Fuel retailers are ripping off the public and businesses on diesel charges, according to the RAC. The wholesale price of diesel is 1p a litre more than for petrol, yet diesel is almost 6p more at the pumps, it said. There is scope for a diesel price cut of around 4p a litre to restore some parity to the market, the RAC added. The automotive company calls out retailers, saying businesses in particular are paying excessive charges on Diesel as sales of the fuel increase . The RAC’s comments came as it highlighted Government figures which showed total fuel sales were up 3.5 per cent in February compared with the same month last year. Diesel sales last month, at 2.42billion litres, represented the fifth highest monthly total since 1990. But petrol sales are among their lowest for 25 years. Businesses, which are more likely to run on Diesel are being ripped off by retailers who are looking to offset losses from low petrol prices . Because companies traditionally run on diesel, they are particularly hard hit by the fuel rip-off. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘It’s hard not to think that business is being taken for a ride. 'With sales of diesel at an all-time high the retailers have maintained a higher margin on diesel, perhaps to subsidise petrol sales.’","RAC says individuals and business paying unfair charges on diesel .

Andy thought he was going to have a laugh and put me in the spotlight but he didn't realise I had just started a relationship. 'We thought there was a girl that might have the hots for me and boys like to take things out of hand, but there's nothing to it whatsoever. 'But I was like ""oh my god, now my girlfriend's going to think I've actually done something"". 'But I called her up and said what had happened and within two minutes we were laughing about it.

"Rio de Janeiro's mayor unveiled the city's controversial Olympic golf course on Wednesday and laid out an ardent defence of a project that has been criticised by environmental activists and is at the centre of legal wranglings. The course, part of which has been carved out of a nature reserve, had been kept strictly under wraps during a construction phase that is nearly complete after more than a year's work. Gently rolling hills covered with lush grass that looked like it would be at home in Scotland surrounded small islands of native plants. Sprinklers were hard at work under a harsh midday sun during the visit by news media. The new Rio de Janeiro course for the 2016 Olympics was unveiled on Wednesday . Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes (second right) walks the almost complete Olympic Games golf course . A worker cuts the grass on the course that until now has been kept largely under wraps . Prosecutors have repeatedly requested for work on the course to be halted over alleged irregularities in environmental impact studies . The bucolic setting has been embroiled in a controversy stretching back years that has overshadowed what was meant to mark golf's triumphant return to the Olympics after a 112-year absence. Prosecutors have repeatedly requested for work on the course to be halted over alleged irregularities in environmental impact studies, though a judge rejected the latest demand late Tuesday night. In a separate case, another prosecutor is weighing up whether to bring charges against Mayor Eduardo Paes for allegedly granting concessions to developers. Still other questions persist about the ownership of the land. Paes dismissed the allegations, insisting in an agitated, two-hour-long presentation that the course has been built in strict accordance with the law. 'It's hogwash, it's a lie ... it's a fallacy,' Paes said, as he delivered a barrage of facts, figures, photos and images of documents about the golf course. 'Lies cannot prevail.' He pledged total transparency, with Brazil in the midst of an investigation into a massive corruption scheme at the state-run oil giant, Petrobras, which has rocked the country with near-daily revelations. 'Rio City Hall and I personally are very conscious that we are going to have to explain and re-explain (things) and prove ourselves more than we would have to if we were staging the London Olympics, for example,' he said. Protesters stand outside the Olympic course that is at the center of complicated legal wranglings . Activists protest against the construction of the course that was carved partly out of a nature reserve . Paes also insisted that while some land from the nature reserve was bulldozed to make way for the course's grassy knolls, because the lion's share of the terrain used to be a sand quarry, the course has actually increased the amount of native plant life in the area. 'Does this look like an environmental crime?' he exclaimed, arms akimbo, as he led reporters over the course's spongy grass. Earlier, Paes projected aerial photos from the 1980s apparently showing what's now the golf course dotted with concrete structures. Environmentalists contend that hardy subtropical vegetation had since retaken the area and that before the bulldozers descended it had become home to several endangered species, including species of butterflies and frogs. 'He (Paes) thinks that all green's the same,' said Jean Carlos Novaes, a member of the Golfe Para Quem (Golf For Whom) group that has been protesting outside the site for months. 'But non-native grass is just not the same thing as the native ecosystem.' Novaes, who was among a small group of protesters on Wednesday, insisted it was unnecessary to build a new course in the first place, since Rio already has two other golf courses - despite golf's status in Brazil as an unpopular sport played almost exclusively by the moneyed elite. The owner of one of the courses has said he wrote to authorities to offer it up for the Olympics but never heard back. Rio mayor Paes insists the course is in strict accordance with the law . Protesters say Paes spearheaded the course's construction in order to favor a campaign donor, a developer who is building luxury residential towers alongside the course . Protester props associate 'wildlife crimes' with the counstruction and call Paes a 'climate terrorist' Novaes said that donations made to Paes' political campaign by a wealthy and powerful developer who's building luxury residential towers on the margins of the golf course were the real motor behind the construction of the course. The exclusive marble-and-glass units are being pre-sold even before construction is completed for several million dollars a piece. Asked whether he had received a campaign donation from the developer, Pasquale Mauro, Paes said he didn't know and that in any case 'it wouldn't have been illegal.' He added that one of the existing courses was deemed too small, while modifications to the other would have cost nearly as much as building the new course. Paes also brushed aside questions over the ownership of the land, contending that much of the wealthy western suburb of Barra da Tijuca, where the course is located, is beset by long-running conflicts over land ownership. Attorney Alberto Murray Neto, a former member of Brazil's Olympic Committee, dismissed Paes' explanations, saying it made no sense to press ahead with construction of the course on such legally complicated land. 'Even if they had to build a new course, they could have picked any other terrain - one not in a protected nature reserve - or also one where the ownership is clear,' Murray said. 'The whole thing is just a pretext for land speculation.'","Rio de Janeiro's mayor unveiled the 2016 Olympic golf course .

"The US Navy has charged seven sailors over video recordings made of female officers and midshipmen without their knowledge aboard one of the first gender-integrated submarines. Among the sailors on the Georgia-based USS Wyoming are three men accused of making the recordings that were passed on to other crew members, documents released showed. While previous reports alleged that the victims were only female officers, documents obtained by Navy Times stated sailors also recorded female midshipmen temporarily aboard the sub. Violated: US Navy has launched investigation into allegations that some of the first women to serve on the USS Wyoming were secretly videotaped in the shower by a male sailor . Vile act: A 24-year-old second class petty officer is accused of recording at least three women while they were showering on undressed aboard the Ohio-class ballistic missile sub . A Navy official told the Navy Times that dozens of women could have been filmed, as sailors had used cellphones on board the Wyoming as far back as August 2013. One of the sailors charged allegedly traded videos of officers showering for two energy drinks. Another reportedly said the video recordings were 'like Pokémon, gotta catch them all.' Two of the seven sailors have been referred to court martial. Electronics Technician 2nd Class Joseph Bradley, 25, is charged with distributing videos and destroying evidence. Charge sheets state Bradley asked an unnamed technician to send over videos of the women when the ship was docked at its home port in Kings Bay, Georgia, which he then passed along to others. Missile Technician 3rd Class Brandon McGarity, 25, is charged with failing to report the videos and making a false official statement. In addition to the sailors from the USS Wyoming, an individual stationed at Trident Training Facility in Kings Bay is being charged. According to an incident report written last year, the unsuspecting women were recorded bathing and changing aboard the ballistic missile submarine. A 24-year-old second class petty officer allegedly made the videos over the past year and distributed them among his male colleagues. The clips were said to depict at least three servicewomen in the shower and in various states of undress aboard the Wyoming - an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine. The first female sailors were introduced to American subs beginning in 2011 as part of a concerted integration effort, which has been labeled a success by the Navy. The privacy violation scandal comes at an especially sensitive time as Navy officials are preparing to integrate Virginia-class attack submarines. Come January, six female officers will join the crews of USS Virginia and USS Minnesota, according to a statement issued in October 2013 by Vice Admiral Michael Connor, commander of Submarine Forces. A ballistic missile sub such as the USS Wyoming typically has 15 officers and 140 enlisted crew members on board. Officers of both sexes use the same bathing facilities, but whenever a woman is in the shower she is expected to put up a sign indicating her presence inside, and her male comrades must wait until she comes out before entering. Smooth sailing: The integration of ballistic missile submarine crews, which got under way in 2010, had been labeled a success by the Navy . According to Navy Times, some of the women depicted in the videos are unhappy with the way Navy brass has been handling the incident. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service has launched a probe into the matter, and a spokeswoman for Submarine Group 10 in Kings Bay said the Navy would hold those involved accountable. The man accused of videotaping his female colleagues has not been named in the November 14 incident report, but he has been described as a petty officer assigned to Trident Training Facility. Investigators were first tipped off about the videos last month by an officer from another submarine who received the recordings. The USS Wyoming was at the forefront of the integration effort, welcoming a dozen female supply and line officers in 2011. A retired supply officer who was in charge of mentoring the new arrivals recalled how on the first day of their tenure she was approached by a male sailor who asked her: 'Where are the females?' ‘I looked at him and said, “All right, let's get one thing straight: They're not females, they're junior officers on this boat, they're division officers, and you will address them as Ensign So-and-So, and you can tell everybody else on the boat, ‘"" she told the paper. Serious incident: The videotape scandal comes at a time when Navy officials are preparing to introduce female sailors to Virginia-class attack subs . In an ABC News story from May 2012, female submariners talked in glowing terms about how smoothly the integration has been going, and how their biggest challenge was becoming junior officers. ‘Outside of being female on a submarine, all of us are trying to qualify, all of us are trying to support the ward room and trying to be a team member. That is challenging, in itself,’ Ensign Abigail Holt said at the time. Female officers now serve on at least seven subs. By 2020, the Navy will allow enlisted female sailors to serve on submarines as well. Since the Navy lifted its ban on female submariners in 2010, at least 43 women have joined the service.","The charges come after an investigation by the navy into allegations of privacy violations aboard the gender-integrated USS Wyoming .

"Teddy Sheringham says James Wilson could score 20 goals a season for Manchester United if Louis van Gaal played him. Sheringham has heaped praise on Wilson and claimed the exciting 19-year-old has all the attributes to be a top striker. Talking to United Review, Sheringham, who is forwards' coach at West Ham United, takes a keen interest in strikers across the Barclays Premier League, and said: 'I really like James Wilson. Teddy Sheringham has backed Manchester United striker James Wilson to become an Old Trafford success . Wilson, pictured scoring against QPR, has scored two goals in 16 appearances for Manchester United . Wilson (right) remains behind Radamel Falcao (centre) and Robin van Persie in United's pecking order . 'It’s a shame for him that Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie are in front of him. Louis van Gaal said recently that he doesn’t have a striker who can score 20 goals a season, but I think if you put Wilson up there with Wayne Rooney then you’d have two players who can reach those figures for you.' Wilson made his first-team debut at the end of the 2013-14 season under former interim manager Ryan Giggs but has mainly been on the bench during Van Gaal's time at the club. Having sat on the bench again for Sunday's 3-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur, Wilson was handed some playing time for the Under 21s on Monday and scored the opening goal in a 2-1 victory over Everton. Sheringham added: 'He’s very direct, scores goals, has good pace and that added bonus of being a left-footer – they always tend to catch defenders off guard and it always looks more special when the left-footed strike goes in. 'I like his attitude, he looks a good player, a good prospect and one that everyone needs to keep an eye on.'

"The British tennis player left red-faced when Andy Murray claimed he had a 'little girlfriend in Glasgow' - as well as his long-term partner in London - has insisted it was all a joke. Dominic Inglot covered his face with his hands as Murray's relationship claims 'landed him in it' on live TV after Great Britain beat the United States in the Davis Cup yesterday. Inglot returned home today insisting the whole episode was a wind-up by Murray and he has now explained it to his 'understanding' girlfriend. Homecoming: Tennis player Dominic Inglot returned home today after he was left embarrassed when Andy Murray claimed he had a girlfriend in Glasgow, a joke Inglot later had to explain to his girlfriend in London . Speaking outside his home in Chiswick, west London, he told how the shock hit him as Murray made the joke to Eurosport presenter Annabel Croft. The 29-year-old told MailOnline: 'It's just a bit of banter that went wrong. Andy thought he was going to have a laugh and put me in the spotlight but he didn't realise I had just started a relationship. 'We thought there was a girl that might have the hots for me and boys like to take things out of hand, but there's nothing to it whatsoever. 'But I was like ""oh my god, now my girlfriend's going to think I've actually done something"". 'But I called her up and said what had happened and within two minutes we were laughing about it. 'I explained that Andy likes messing with his team and that's what makes this team really close together. 'Me and Andy were on the aeroplane last night and he said ""Oh my god I'm so sorry, everything's going to be blown out of proportion"".

"Former footballer Clarke Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence which happened just days before he attempted suicide. The 35-year-old, who played for Leeds, Burnley and QPR, today admitted failing to provide a sample on December 20. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence on the same date, when police officers spotted his Mercedes travelling in an 'erratic' manner. Former footballer Clarke Carlisle has admitted failing to provide a sample when he was suspected of drink driving. Days after he was pulled over by police, he attempted suicide . Carlisle still bears the facial scars from his December 22 suicide attempt in a crash which left him in a coma until mid-January. The former Professional Footballers' Association chairman spoke clearly as he admitted the charges from the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London today. Deputy District Judge Margaret Dodds told Carlisle  he would 'inevitably' be disqualified when he next appears at the same court for sentencing on May 14. She also ordered that reports be made in the case after being told of Carlisle's medical situation. The court heard he was spotted by police 'swerving' his Mercedes and nearly hitting another vehicle on Pentonville Road, north London, on December 20 at about 7am. Prosecutor Zahid Hussain said the car was seen 'swerving in the lane, to the pavement on the nearside, almost mounting the pavement' and that the tyres were 'grinding on the curb'. When the officers stopped and spoke to Carlisle 'alcohol was smelled on his breath', Mr Hussain added. The court was told that Carlisle did not blow long enough in the breathalyser when he was tested at the roadside to provide an adequate sample. Carlisle later said he fell into a spiral of decline after his contract as a TV football pundit was cancelled . He was taken to Islington police station but would not co-operate and said: 'Sergeant, I would like to speak to my counsel first.' The court was told that Carlisle had been involved in excess-drinking offences in 1999 and 2011. Krystelle Wass, defending, told the court: 'Two days after the incident Mr Carlisle attempted suicide, which is why matters have taken some time to come to court.' She said there were 'ongoing mental health issues'. The deputy district judge replied that she would order reports ahead of the next hearing as 'he is clearly in some trouble'. The deputy district judge told Carlisle that he would get credit for his early guilty plea but noted that he has a 'bad record'. Carlisle, who was released on unconditional bail. said 'Thank you, ma'am' as he stepped out of the dock. The former footballer (pictured playing for Burnley) has previously told of past thoughts of suicide when his career was coming to an end and he suffered serious injury . The married father-of-three was  left critically injured when he was struck by a lorry near his home on the morning of December 22 on the A64, near York. He later told how he threw himself in front of the lorry in an attempt to take his own life. Carlisle said he felt his life was spiralling out of control after he was told by ITV he was losing his £100,000-a-year Champions League pundit role. He said he went straight to a casino and blew his and his wife's savings. He told The Sun last month: 'I had to die. This wasn't escaping or running away. This was the perfect answer. It made everyone happy and it ticked every box.' He said he had sat in the police cell and concluded that he could not let his children 'have a criminal father'.

"Tour de France winner Stephen Roche has offered his support to Geoff Thomas, arguing that cycling should not object to Lance Armstrong joining the former England footballer in France this summer to raise money for the fight against cancer. Roche, the 1987 Tour winner whose own son suffered with leukaemia, believes Armstrong’s involvement with Thomas’s ‘Le Tour - One Day Ahead’ event will only help raise awareness and cash for the cause. Thomas and Armstrong are united by both being cancer survivors but some senior figures in cycling – UCI president Brian Cookson and Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford – have objected to the controversial American returning to the French roads. Lance Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Le Tour title, wants to return to work fighting cancer . Former Tour de France champion Stephen Roche, pictured with former footballer and charity organiser Geoff Thomas, supports Armstrong's return to raise money and awareness of the disease . Armstrong is set to be part of a team of cyclists rising the route on a day before the Tour de France starts . The US cyclist revealed details of his doping scandal in an interview chat show host Oprah Winfrey . Lance Armstrong's former team-mate Jonathan Vaughters said he would support the disgraced cyclist’s plan to ride part of the Tour de France route this summer if it was for ‘altruistic’ reasons. Vaughters, who rode with Armstrong in the US Postal Service team in 1998 and 1999, was however wary of his motives for accepting an invitation from fellow cancer survivor Geoff Thomas to join him in a charity ride. ‘I sincerely hope his reasons for wanting to do that are altruistic.I have no idea what his motivations are. If it's altruistic then it's hard to condemn anything altruistic, across the board. If it's part of a greater commercial strategy or legal strategy, then I feel like that's disingenuous.’ Vaughters, speaking at a UK anti-doping conference, said Armstrong’s lifetime ban from competition was not the only way he had been punished. ‘One of the biggest penalties that guys face when they are caught for doping is the loss of their social group,’ he said, ‘They're no longer accepted amongst their tribe, their people that they were once close with. He would like social acceptance again. I'm assuming that's a little bit what he's after (with the charity ride).’ Vaughters welcomed reports that Armstrong has met with US anti-doping boss Travis Tygart in Denver, Colorado. It's positive news. I don't know what his motivations are, but to me that's good news. My experiences with Travis have been nothing but positive.’ Thomas and a team of cyclists will ride the route of this summer’s Tour one day ahead of the professional peloton, with Armstrong planning to join them for two stages. But Cookson branded Armstrong’s involvement ‘inappropriate and disrespectful’. Roche, who in 1987 became the second of only two cyclists to win the Triple Crown of the Tour, the Giro D’Italia and the world road race title, said: ‘I believe in what he’s (Thomas) doing,’ said Roche. ‘I know that by having Lance involved with Geoff Thomas in his charity to generate funds for leukaemia - I think that his overall picture will be a lot brighter. 'He will bring in a lot more money for very, very worthy causes. It's about going forward. We can't change the past. We must use the past to make the future better.’ It was Roche’s son, Florian, who suffered with leukaemia and the Irishman, speaking to the Newstalk Breakfast radio show earlier, said: 'I can speak from my heart because my son had leukaemia and he's on the straight now, thank God,’ he said. ‘And when you're involved with that, to see how far a euro goes, and how euros are lacking to fund research. 'So I'm speaking from a different perspective maybe than someone who just a general cyclist that's very disappointed in what Armstrong has done to the sport. So I know the power he has. 'I know that people are going to despise me for saying so, but I think we have got to move on. I think that he faulted - he wasn't the only one that faulted - he's been punished. 'He'll be punished for the rest of his life for what he did. But there is a redemption somewhere as well. Where does it start? Does it start this year, next year, in ten years' time? Does it start by doing a charity cycle?'

"Watford fan Nick Cruwys (pictured) was left fighting for his life after he was attacked following a match with Wolves. A 13-year-old has now been arrested by police investigating the incident . A 13-year-old boy has been arrested by detectives investigating an attack which left a football fan fighting for his life in hospital. West Midlands Police said officers arrested the youngster on suspicion of assault at an address in Wolverhampton, just before 5am today. The boy is the second person to be arrested by detectives investigating an attack on 44-year-old Watford supporter Nick Cruwys in Wolverhampton on Saturday, after an 18-year-old man was detained yesterday. That man has since been bailed until April 8. Police described the latest arrest as 'significant'. Mr Cruwys was tripped and kicked in the head in an unprovoked attack in the street, following Watford's 2-2 draw with Wolves. The father of two, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, was attacked in Little's Lane, Wolverhampton, shortly after 5pm as he made his way to the railway station with friends. An online appeal to raise funds to help Mr Cruwys, set up by a Wolves fan, has now raised more than £25,000. After the latest arrest, police directly appealed to anyone involved in the attack to 'do the right thing' and hand themselves in. Detective Inspector Toni Naylor, of West Midlands Police, said: 'We are pleased with how the investigation is progressing and the arrest of a second suspect is significant. 'But this is not the end of our inquiry, it's only the beginning. 'I am now appealing to anyone who was involved in the incident to think about their actions and to do the right thing and contact us or hand themselves in to a local police station. 'We will leave no stone unturned to find the people involved and by coming forward you will be in a position to give your side of the story.'

"Jelena Jankovic eased into the last four at the BNP Paribas Open on Thursday when Ukrainian qualifier Lesia Tsurenko retired from their quarter-final with an ankle injury while trailing 6-1, 4-1. Former champion Jankovic broke an error-prone Tsurenko twice to breeze through the opening set in 22 minutes and twice more in the second before the Ukrainian walked across to her opponent and told her the match was over as they shook hands. 'It's never nice to end a match in that way,' Serb Jankovic, 30, said on another hot day at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. 'In the second set, she started limping and I saw that she had some problem. Jelena Jankovic plays a forehand as she reaches the semi-finals of the BNP Paribas Open in California .

Tsurenko, ranked 85th in the world, injured her right ankle during her upset of sixth-seeded Canadian Eugenie Bouchard in the previous round and was noticeably restricted in her movement against Jankovic. She failed to hold serve in the second and sixth games of the match to be swept aside in the opening set before calling for her trainer to re-tape her ankle.

"Manny Pacquiao received a surprise visit from drug testers prior to his Fight of the Century with Floyd Mayweather. Pacquiao was approached unannounced by an anti-doping examiner at the house he is renting in Los Angeles where he is preparing to face Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2. Both fighters can expect to be tested under the US Anti-Doping Association programme to which they have both signed up. Manny Pacquiao was paid a surprise visit by an anti-doping examiner on Sunday to take a drug test . Pacquiao has a plaster applied after giving a blood sample to the examiner . Pacquiao was visited only four days after the packed red-carpet media event in LA which formally launched the build up to the $350million richest fight of all time. The inspector called at the house, where Pacquiao was relaxing with members of his team between work-outs with master trainer Freddie Roach at the fabled Wild Card Gym . The PacMan readily complied with tests for both blood – a process about which he had previously expressed his dislike – and urine. ‘No problem,’ he told the medic, with a smile. Earlier, his promoter Bob Arum had made it clear that Pacquiao had issued a $5m challenge to Mayweather with regard to the testing, and offered to surrender that amount should he fail the examination. In addition to the giving blood, Pacquiao also gave a urine sample during the test . Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather can expected to be randomly tested before the bout on May 2 in Las Vegas . Arum explained: ‘Manny proposed that if either of them did not pass a test, that man should pay the other $5m. ‘Floyd’s team declined. Not because anybody here is afraid of the outcome but because they realised they could legally get a lot more if it happened. ‘Fine with Manny. If Floyd fails we will be looking for much more compensation than $5m.' Pacquiao has already been paid damages – reportedly in seven figures – after taking legal action for remarks made by members of the Mayweather team, when they began demanding drugs-testing, which inferred that he might have used performance enhancing drugs in the past. Under the US procedures, which comply with the World Anti-Doping Agency standards applied for the Olympics, both boxers must submit to random testing in the weeks leading up to the fight and to another immediately after the event. Pacquiao was happy to be filmed by a camera crew from the Philippines, who are documenting the build up . Pacquiao proposed that if either boxer failed a drug test they would have to pay the other $5million . Pacquiao has had to overcome an element of paranoia that a loss of blood prior to fights might weaken him in the ring. But he is so cool about testing now that he allowed video-taping of Sunday’s test by a Philippines camera crew which is filming virtually his every move between now and fight night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Mayweather has campaigned vociferously in the last two years for the implementation of random blood testing for all fights. However, with a split purse of up to $180m for Mayweather and $120m for Pacquiao at stake, it seems inconceivable that either man would even remotely risk detection. Pacquiao has been documenting his training , seen here going fr a road run on the streets of LA . Mayweather hits the speed bag as his training camp continues in his Las Vegas gym . Mayweather vs Pacquiao is widely considered to be one of the biggest boxing fights of all-time . VIDEO Mayweather and Pacquiao camps exchange verbal blows . Not all boxers make hundreds of millions of dollars for risking their lives in the ring. Compared with the most lucrative pickings ever which await Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 2, our own Michael Watson was on a modest stipend when he climbed through the ropes to fight Chris Eubank. That London evening in 1991 ended with Watson suffering crippling brain damage. It is nothing short of a miracle, made possible by rapid and brilliant medical intervention, that Watson has survived to celebrate his 50th birthday, let alone along the way complete a London Marathon in six days with the ever-supportive Eubank for company. Michael Watson (centre), pictured fighting Chris Eubank in 1991, turned 50 on Sunday . The bout left Watson with crippling brain damage and there will be a fund-raining dinner to celebrate his 50th . To celebrate Watson’s half-century, which he turned on Sunday, a fund-raising dinner will be held in London next month to help pay for the constant care he needs. The Teenage Cancer Trust will benefit, also. David Haye and Joe Calzaghe will be among many star British boxers in attendance at The Park Lane Hotel on St George’s Day, April 23, along with American legend Marvin Hagler.

"Steve Coppell is sipping afternoon tea in the lounge of a hotel just off the M25 when the conversation turns to football’s ‘f-off mentality’, as he calls it. ‘A lot of young players have an “f-off mentality” these days, but I honestly didn’t mind it because I was the one picking the team,’ he admitted. ‘The dressing room is a heated environment at half-time and full-time, and if a player said that to me and could justify their argument then no problem. If not, they were down the road.’ Steve Coppell has been out of work since leaving his role as director of football  at Portsmouth a year ago . Coppell played as a winger for Manchester United for eight years between 1975 and 1983 . Coppell leads his Crystal Palace side onto the Wembley pitch in the first 1990 FA Cup final against United . Coppell knows all about the sport’s ‘f-off mentality’, on the receiving end after leaving an unpaid role as director of football at Portsmouth last March. It seems incredible that this man, with more than 1,000 games in the dug-out and who has twice been named League Managers’ Association manager of the year (2006 and 2007), is out of work. No-one really knows why. It just doesn’t feel right to see Coppell, a man of integrity and honour, on the fringes of football. Something, somewhere, has gone wrong when Coppell is working on his golf handicap every day. ‘I won the LMA award two years on the bounce with Reading and looking back, yes, massive,’ he admitted. ‘They talk about comedians being on the road for 20 years and suddenly they become an overnight sensation — I had done that time. ‘All John Madejski ever asked of me was to come up to the boardroom after a game and have a pint with him — no interference, nothing. Sometimes we wouldn’t even talk about the result.’ At 59 Coppell is a statesman of the game, one of the shrewdest operators in the sport. After a playing career on the wing with Manchester United he spent nearly 30 years in the dug-out. Coppell issues his side with instructions after drawing 3-3 with United in the final before extra-time . Coppell poses with his Manager of the Month award in 2006 during his spell in charge of Reading . ‘I just wanted to be known as a good manager, I never wanted to be famous,’ he admitted when he was reluctantly coaxed to the Runnymede-on-Thames Hotel. It is clear, after a couple of hours in Coppell’s illuminating company, that he has the itch to work again, but it will only be on his terms. ‘There are 70 clubs you don’t want to manage because you have no chance. ‘Steve Heighway always talks about Bob Paisley at Liverpool: create an environment for your players to win matches. That is the art of management. I can get you promotion within two years if you back me, the Championship is my division, I know what it’s about. If you want a five-year plan, fannying around, building from the bottom up, I’m not your man. I have done that.’ He did it at Palace, taking over at the age of 28 and leading them into the top flight when he put together the team that included Ian Wright, Mark Bright, Geoff Thomas, Andy Gray and John Salako. ‘You could never do that now because the game wouldn’t give you five years to get promoted and because Bosman changed everything in favour of the players,’ he said. ‘Pre-Bosman Ian Wright could have been on £100 a week, his contract could be coming to an end and we could offer him £101 and he would have no choice but to stay. ‘In modern terms, Ian Wright would have disappeared from Palace after a year.’ Coppell celebrates with then Crystal Palace chairman Ron Noades after winning the 1997 play-off final . Coppell, pictured at the Spain 1982 World Cup finals, won 42 international caps for England . To recap, Coppell won two promotions with Palace, took them to their only FA Cup final, won promotion with Reading to the Barclays Premier League and finished eighth in their first season in the top flight. There has been the occasional blip, such as the aborted spells at Manchester City and Bristol City, but after three decades in management, it is no more than a footnote to his career. ‘If I got really busy around football clubs then I could work again but I choose not to be, in the footballing sense,’ he admitted. ‘I don’t go looking for it. I have an agent but he doesn’t go looking for it, either. ‘I still go to games and I enjoy the core things that football gives me, which is working out how people win matches and influence players.’ Coppell is a student of the game, a manager who travelled all over the country to watch players at every level and build up an encyclopaedic knowledge of teams and tactics. He would rather sit in the stands than head for the directors’ box, convinced that speaking to the supporters who watch the players week in, week out will give him a far better education. ‘It is a simple game and the fans aren’t fools, they know what they’re watching. They will give you a far better idea of who is consistent and who is a fanny merchant than listening to anyone in the boardroom or allowing your mind to be affected by another scout or coach.’ Palace players doused Coppell with champagne after winning the Division Two play-off final in 1989 . Coppell admits being a manager consumes every part of your life and he found it difficult to switch off . Coppell's last job in management was with Bristol City in 2010 . Coppell is a fascinating man to listen to as he talks through his management career. ‘Managing clubs is unhealthy because you are time deprived. It is all-consuming, certainly the way I did it. You can be at the cinema and all you can think about is: how can we beat Arsenal on Saturday? It gets you like that. ‘The game has changed. The Premier League is a handicap system, with the big clubs putting 25 or 30 players out on loan — football should be provocative and change it. Have a squad of 25 by all means, chop and change them in January, but you don’t need 70 players. ‘If you know someone at a big club it’s all so sycophantic — “we will guarantee him a game, he will play”. We are prostituting ourselves to get a few scraps from the big boys. ‘Greg Dyke is trying to improve things but the FA are a toothless tiger. The Premier League are 100 per cent successful in what they set out to do, which is to make as much money as possible. When I was a player, if Manchester United played Oldham in Division Two they had to share the gate receipts.’ When you sit down with Coppell, he is a million miles away from the monosyllabic character who would turn up at press conferences when he was in work. The 59-year-old won consecutive LMA Manager of the Year awards in 2006 and 2007 . ‘I look at Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots, and he’s won four Super Bowls in 11 years. Watch his press conferences. One-word answers, but he delivers.’ So did Coppell, a popular figure in dressing rooms at his clubs. He knows how to knit together a winning team. This is a man who consciously spent a year out of the game when he left Reading after they failed to beat Burnley in the Championship play-off semi-final in 2009. ‘I used to go to Fulham to watch Roy Hodgson. A lot of people don’t share my opinion of Roy but to work across Europe consistently and mainly be successful — and to act with integrity — and do things the right way, is something I admire.’ Coppell is tempted to move abroad himself, to test himself in another country if England really has turned its back on him. ‘Football owes me nothing but I feel I have something to contribute to the game,’ he said. ‘I don’t expect people to bend over backwards. Ideally I would probably like to work abroad and I am at an age where if it doesn’t happen now it might never happen. Maybe football’s finished with me.’ With so much still to offer? You’ve got to be kidding.","Steve Coppell has been out of work since leaving Portsmouth last March .

"Lance Armstrong has been told it would be ‘completely disrespectful’ to ride part of the Tour de France route this summer by the head of world cycling. As revealed by the Mail on Sunday, Armstrong has agreed to a request by former England footballer and fellow cancer survivor Geoff Thomas to join him in raising money this summer in the battle against the deadly disease. Thomas and a team of cyclists will ride the Tour route one day ahead of the professional peloton and he travelled to Austin last month to persuade the controversial American to support the event for two stages. But the initiative has divided opinion in cycling, with Sir Dave Brailsford suggesting Armstrong has already ‘done enough damage’ and UCI president Brian Cookson also urging the man stripped of his seven Tour titles for doping to stay away from France this summer. Lance Armstrong (left) will join Geoff Thomas's Cure Leukaemia charity ride of the Tour de France course . Lance Armstrong back on the Tour de France circuit as Geoff Thomas persuades disgraced former winner to ride stages ahead of peloton for cancer charity . Speaking at an event in London on Tuesday, Cookson said Armstrong ‘would be well-advised not to take part’ in the an event hoping to raise £1million for blood cancer. ‘I'm sure that Geoff Thomas means well, but frankly I think that's completely inappropriate and disrespectful to the Tour, disrespectful to the current riders, and disrespectful to the UCI and the anti-doping community,’ said Cookson. ‘I think Lance would be well-advised not to take part in that.’ Only a week after the CIRC report into cycling doping – ordered by Cookson – revealed that the use of banned substances is still a major problem in the sport, some might question whether professional cycling should even concern itself with a charity bike ride. The disgraced rider, who was stripped of his seven Le Tour title, wants to return to work fighting cancer . Thomas is set to undertake a charity ride . There are convicted dopers currently running pro Tour teams and right now the UCI is considering revoking the race licence of the Astana team that boasts last year’s Tour winner, Vincenzo Nibali, but has seen five of its riders test positive in recent months. It’s team manager, Alexander Vinokourov, is a convicted doper while questions continue at Team Sky over whether their employment of sporting director Servais Knaven represents a challenge to their zero tolerance policy. Travis Tygart, the head of the US anti-doping agency whose investigation ultimately brought down Armstrong, had no great objection to him rejoining the cancer battle. ‘As long as it's not a sanctioned competition that falls under the rules, it's not a direct concern,’ said Tygart, who only last week said he now feels ‘sorry’ for Armstrong and other riders in the light of the CIRC report into the doping culture in cycling and is now prepared to discuss reducing the American’s life ban from sport. ‘That's outside the technical rules.’ Christian Prudhomme, the Tour de France race director, also did not object to Armstrong’s involvement, making the point that he e would riding on public roads. Cookson, meanwhile, challenged the charity argument. ‘I've heard that reason rolled out throughout Lance A's career as well,’ he said. ‘I'm not critical of people trying to raise funds for charity, let's be clear. ‘But I think maybe Lance could find a better way of continuing his fundraising efforts than this. Lance Armstrong can ride his bike around France as often as he likes, it's got nothing to do with me or the UCI.’ Armstrong has been criticised by cycling boss Brian Cookson for taking part in the charity ride . Brian Cookson, president of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), says Armstrong would be best advised not to take part in the charity ride . Thomas responded with a statement, making it clear it is a fundraising issue and not a cycling issue. The statement said: ‘When I was being treated for blood cancer I was inspired by Lance Armstrong’s book “It’s not about the bike, my journey back to life”. It gave me strength to deal with my predicament and a purpose which crystallised into the 2005 charity ride along the route of the Tour de France. Whatever Armstrong has done since, and I have gone on record condemning his use of performance enhancing drugs, this doesn’t remove the importance that he played at that critical period of my life. 'We have stayed in touch intermittently – he presented me with the Helen Rollason Award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award in 2005 – and have had occasional chats over the last year about how he might support my charity endeavours. I went to see him a few weeks ago at his home in Austin and he genuinely wants to help improve the situation of those with blood cancer. 'We are still confirming details of how Armstrong will support Le Tour – One Day Ahead but it is likely to involve him riding a couple of stages and hosting a training camp for the team. I understand that some people will find it hard to accept Armstrong’s support but my take is a simple one: If Armstrong’s involvement in Le Tour - One Day Ahead and my goal to raise £1 million for blood cancer can help save one more life then surely that can only be a good thing.’ Armstrong issued a statement, saying: ‘I'm honoured and humbled to have been invited by legendary footballer and fellow cancer survivor Geoff Thomas to accompany him on parts of his ride around France. ‘Since my own diagnosis, I've been 100 percent committed to fighting this dreadful disease that affects millions, and that holds true today.’","Lance Armstrong will ride the route of one day of the Tour de France for chairty .

"Online music videos are to be given age ratings in a bid to protect children from explicit images and lyrics. Top artists including Sam Smith, George Ezra and Joss Stone could see their music videos handed 12, 15 or 18 certifications under the government-backed pilot scheme. The British Board of Film Certification, which is running the initiative, has estimated that one in five videos released will be deemed unfit for those under 12. Video sharing sites YouTube and Vevo have signed up to the scheme and pledged to include the warnings on clips uploaded to their sites. Vevo puts the rating in the top corner of the video, while YouTube includes it in the information beneath . However some of the world’s raunchiest performers, such as Miley Cyrus and Rihanna, are not covered by the scheme and there are no measures in place to enforce the guidelines . Rapper Dizzee Rascal has already seen his video ‘Couple of Stacks’ rated 18 under the initiative. Ellie Goulding’s ‘Love Me Like You Do’, recorded for the film Fifty Shades of Grey, was handed a 15 warning and Kasabian’s ‘Stevie’ was rated 12. But even with these ratings in place, there is nothing to stop younger music fans stumbling across the inappropriate clips which often include sexual imagery, violence and obscene language. Only videos released by the British arms of Sony Music UK, Universal Music UK and Warner Music UK are covered by the scheme and the companies are free to choose which videos they want to submit for certification. This means videos from artists such as Miley Cyrus, Nicky Minaj and Rihanna, who are not signed to those labels and are known for their raunchy videos, will not be included in the ratings system. Video sharing sites YouTube and Vevo have signed up to the scheme and pledged to include the warnings on clips uploaded to their sites. Vevo puts the rating in the top corner of the video, while YouTube includes it in the information beneath. However, there are no checks to make sure the person watching is of the correct age. YouTube is the world’s most popular video sharing platform, with one billion worldwide users. It hosts videos for the vast majority of musicians. Some of the world’s raunchiest performers, such as Miley Cyrus and Rihanna, are not covered by the scheme and there are no measures in place to enforce the guidelines . A spokesman for Vevo said: ‘There is no signing in as such or filters – although this is a next step that may be added in time. At the moment this is about giving parents and users the information they need to make a more informed viewing choice and decision. To be effective it requires that parents also take an active interest in what their children are watching.’ Campaigners said last night that the latest move is a ‘fantastic step’ but called for stricter enforcement and for all music videos to carry the ‘kite mark’ of an official age rating to help parents protect their children. The scheme has been running since October last year and has so far seen 84 videos rated, with 27 given a 12 classification, 39 a 15 and one a 18. The BBFC has estimated that one in five videos released will be deemed unsuitable for children under the age of 12. Top artists including Sam Smith, George Ezra and Joss Stone could see their music videos handed 12, 15 or 18 certifications under the government-backed pilot scheme. Dizzee Rascal’s video was given the highest rating because of ‘strong bloody violence, gore, very strong language’. The three and a half minute clip contains extreme violence with the rapper ripping the heart out of a stripping woman, brandishing a knife while covered in blood and decapitating a woman whose body then stumbles around the room. He also holds a family hostage and serves a cake with severed fingers instead of candles. He is shown pulling out a person’s eyeball, slitting one woman’s throat and cutting another’s head in half. Vivienne Pattison, from campaign group Media Watch-UK, said: ‘When parents are surveyed, the two areas that came up as being particularly problematic were soap operas and music videos, those are the two areas that come up again and again as the issue. One in five, that’s a huge number of videos. 'What happens is one video pushes the boundaries and the next artists is under pressure to do the same in order to get people talking about it. It becomes a great merry-go-round and I think that is a fantastic illustration of exactly where this is gone, it’s quite extraordinary. ‘It’s not a magic bullet but it’s a fantastic step and I think it will really make a difference. I don’t know where we will end up down the line but I would like this to act as a kite mark for music videos. This is not a move about censorship, the videos will all still be there, but I think artists and record companies need to take seriously that if they are targeting young fans they have got to do it responsibly.’ On the lack of enforcement of the ratings, she said: ‘You can’t go into a shop and buy a 15 rated film without ID and we need to see about extending those protections online.’ Dizzee Rascal’s video was given the highest rating because of ‘strong bloody violence, gore, very strong language’. The three and a half minute clip contains extreme violence .","Videos from artists including Sam Smith could be given age ratings online .

"Dunga has dismissed suggestions his Brazil squad is over reliant on Barcelona striker Neymar after naming a 23-man squad for upcoming friendlies against France and Chile later this month. Neymar almost single-handedly carried Brazil to last summer's World Cup quarter-finals against Colombia before fracturing his vertebra and missing his side's 7-1 semi-final humiliation against Germany. Dunga has named Neymar his new skipper since the World Cup and admits to building his newlook Brazil side around the Barcelona attacker. Neymar almost single-handedly carried Brazil to last summer's World Cup quarter-finals against Colombia . But Neymar fractured his vertebra and missed his side's 7-1 semi-final humiliation against Germany . After playing France in Paris later this month, the all-South American clash at the Emirates Stadium against Chile on March 29 is particularly mouthwatering and will see Brazil star Neymar facing Arsenal striker Alexis Sanchez – the pair are former Nou Camp team-mates. Chelsea trio Willian, Oscar and Filipe Luis have been named in the squad by Dunga alongside Manchester City's Fernandinho, Real Madrid left-back Marcelo and Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho. 'Our captain is not a surprise,' said Dunga. 'The numbers are here to demonstrate that he is in a very good period. Neymar celebrates with former Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari in Belo Horizonte last summer . 'Since he has been designated captain of the team, he has had an upgrade on his level of football. 'He likes challenges, the more responsibility he has, the more he will develop and get better. 'We are very happy to have him; he is doing fantastic things in Europe. 'Every time that Brazil was World Champion, we had a strong collective spirit, from which appeared some outstanding players. Dunga says Brazil do not rely too much on Barcelona star Neymar, who he has named his captain . 'We don't want that one only player resolves everything. 'Our priority is first to have a strong collective, and then as a second step, one outstanding player can naturally differentiate himself and help us to be better. 'The creativity of Brazilian Football is dribbling. Players must have a good attitude, they have to take decisions . 'What we are trying to do in this new era of Brazil is the following: to increase the value of our heroes of the past and use them as references of the principles of Brazilian Football for helping develop our new young players. Neymar scores for Spanish giants Barcelona against Villareal on the Copa del Rey semi final second leg . 'People say Brazilian Football is improvisation. No, Brazilian football is not improvisation, our football is creativity.' Brazil's game at the Emirates will take on extra significance as Dunga's men secured a dramatic penalty shootout win against Chile to reach the last eight at the 2014 World Cup last summer and set up an all-South American quarter-final against Colombia. Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar was the hero, making two crucial spot-kick saves to thwart Chile, who were denied victory themselves by the woodwork with seconds to spare in extra time. As well as key World Cup qualifiers, Brazil will travel to Chile in July for the Copa America and Dunga is convinced the next 12 months will be a major test for his new look side. Neymar celebrates scoring Barcelona's third goal against Villareal to send them through to the final . 'We first changed all the staff of Brazil,' said Dunga, speaking about the rebuilding job after the World Cup. 'The most important thing is working hard; working hard is the only solution to overcome this traumatism. Then, results will follow. 'We are explaining to the players that we must be strong collectively. We are discussing a lot with the players about the things that did not work during World Cup. 'Our principal objective is Qualifying Games for World Cup and Copa America will help us to get to our main objective. Hulk, Neymar and Dani Alves sit on the bench prior to the World Cup 2014 third place match with Holland . 'We need to gain a winning mentality. This is a new decision from Brazil; we will try to be more open in terms of giving more opportunity for new players to be called in the squad. 'We want to have a new meritocratic philosophy. The ones that will deliver most are the ones who will be called. 'We have decided this squad based on what we observed up to now in previous Friendly Games of Brazilian National Team. Neymar  tries to lift the crowd during the Group A match of the 2014 World Cup between Brazil and Mexico . 'We have had to take into consideration the fact that some players are still in Pre-Season period in Brazil and others are in the middle of their seasons in Europe. 'We want to mix young players with players of experience. At this point in time nothing is definite, we will have two friendlies, we will have Copa America and then we will have our biggest objective, which is qualifying for World Cup 2018. 'The players that are not on this list don't have to feel excluded and the one that are on the list don't have to think that they will be there forever'. 'Our main objective is the Qualifying for World Cup and all the players have to be ready for it.'

"Rhiannon Blair was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work in a few seconds of mindless vandalism . This is the shocking moment a gang of bullies set fire to a schoolgirl's GCSE coursework - before sending her a video of the cruel prank. Rhiannon Blair was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work. The 15-year-old had not realised the work was missing until she was sent the video by her tormentors - who were suspended for just three days after the act of mindless vandalism. The footage shows the teenage bullies laughing and joking as they poured lighter fluid over the pile of papers on a picnic bench and set it alight. One boy even attempted to fan the flames by spraying it with a deodorant can while another threw in a lighter which eventually caused the notes to explode. A pupil then climbed onto the bench to trample over the cindered books. Police yesterday were investigating after the footage was posted online, but confirmed there had been no arrests so far. Rhiannon said she has been the victim of a campaign of bullying at Easthampstead Park Community School in Bracknell, Berkshire, since last September and suffered from anxiety and depression as a result. She now fears the stunt may put her entry to college in jeopardy. She said: 'I was shocked and disgusted when I was sent the video by one of the pupils involved. None of them seems to be sorry for what they have done or show any regret. I am just very upset and tearful that all my hard work has gone to waste. 'I have always wanted to work with children and it is what I had set my heart on doing for the rest of my life. I am not even sure if I can get a place on my course at the college anymore. I can't understand why anyone would do this.' The  teenager, who dreams of a career as a nursery nurse, was just two weeks away from submitting the coursework when the bullies destroyed her work. One of the bullies shouts 'put a lighter on it' as another prepares to set fire to Rhiannon's coursework . Two boys reel away as the flaming pile of notes explodes thanks to a lighter that had been thrown on them . Her mother, Debbie Groom, said: 'I am so angry. These pupils have ruined my daughter's life. I would be mortified if that was my child carrying out that sort of behaviour. 'This incident is going to scar Rhiannon for life. She has been very stressed and upset but the reaction to the video being posted online has been amazing - it just shows that people do not like bullies.' Another pupil, 15-year-old Kayleigh Holloway from Hanworth, also had her child development coursework destroyed in the pile. Her uncle Neil Holloway said: 'I am disgusted by what has happened. I don't think the three days suspension given to the children involved was not enough punishment. 'They have all probably seen it as a nice holiday. Even though the school has said her grades won't be affected that is not the answer or what we want to hear. 'Kayleigh was very upset when she found out - she has got enough going on in her life without all of this.' Rihannon's mother Debbie Groom (pictured with Rhiannon's family, L-R:  aunt Anne Yates, mother Debbie Groom, Rhiannon Blair and her sister Katie Blair) said the incident had scarred her daughter for life . Headteacher Liz Cook said letters had been sent out to everybody involved in the incident and assured the victims that their grades would not be affected. She said: 'The school has investigated the incident at length and its origins were a falling out between girls, property was taken as a spiteful act designed to disrupt the victim's lesson the following day. 'On reflection students have realised this act was a huge error of judgement on their part and have been shocked that their act has attracted a social media storm. 'This has been a steep learning curve for them all. The victims of the theft are also being supported as we make every effort to make sure their hard work and studies are not compromised.

"Apple CEO Tim Cook still remembers the last movie he ever saw with Steve Jobs before he succumbed to cancer: the sentimental football flick Remember the Titans. 'I was so surprised he wanted to watch that movie,' Cook recalls in the new biography 'Becoming Steve Jobs,' out in bookstores now. The 2000 film starring Denzel Washington tells the true story of a newly integrated Virginia high school football team in 1971. Scroll down for video . Heir: Tim Cook (left) was tapped by Steve Jobs as his successor in August 2011, just months before the co-founder of Apple succumbed to pancreatic cancer. Here the two are pictured at a press conference on antenna problems with the iPhone4 at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, July 16, 2010 . Movie night to remember: In the new biography 'Becoming Jobs,' Cook recalls how six days before Jobs died, he invited his over to watch the sentimental 2000 football flick Remember the Titans (pictured) 'I was like, ""Are you sure?"" Steve was not interested in sports at all. And we watched and we talked about a number of things and I left thinking that he was pretty happy,' according to a CNN review of the book. Six days after Cook and Jobs' movie night, the co-founder of Apple passed away at his Palo Alto, California, estate from complications related to pancreatic cancer. He was 56 years old. The new biography of the late Apple CEO by veteran tech journalists Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli traces his decades-long evolution from a 'reckless' young inventor tinkering with early computer models into the leader of a global tech giant. The book, based on numerous in-depth interviews with Jobs' colleagues, friends and competitors, also allows a glimpse into the Apple CEO's inner sanctum in the final weeks of his life. Cook, who took the reins of Apple in August 2011, less than two months before his mentor's death, described to the authors of the biography the moment Jobs invited him over to his house to offer him the top job. ‘He told me he had decided that I should be CEO. I thought then that he thought he was going to live a lot longer when he said this, because we got into a whole level of discussion about what would it mean for me to be CEO with him as a chairman. Evolution of a genius: The new tome (left), penned by a pair of tech journalists, traces Jobs' transformation from a brash young inventor (right) into a a 'visionary leader' Music fan: Jobs, pictured here in 1977, loved the Beatles, with John Lennon being his favorite member of the band. He even reportedly named his company after the band's Apple Corps Record . ‘I asked him, “What do you really not want to do that you’re doing?” Cook recalled. ‘He says, “You make all the decisions.” I go, “Wait. Let me ask you a question.” ‘I tried to pick something that would incite him. So I said, “You mean that if I review an ad and I like it, it should just run without your okay?” And he laughed and said, “Well, I hope you’d at least ask me!”’ Cook said that every time he visited Jobs, his boss appeared to be on the mend, and he asked him two or three times whether his decision to step down as the CEO was final. Jobs never wavered. According to Tim Cook, his boss wanted a successor who would not try to copy his style of leadership but rather use his own talents for the good of the company - a model he referred to as a 'Beatles concept,' named after Liverpool's Fab Five. In an interesting titbit, the book reveals that Jobs' favorite Beatle was John Lennon, and that he reportedly named his company after Beatles' Apple Corps Record. Stepping down: Cook said that every time he visited Jobs, his boss appeared to be on the mend, and he asked him two or three times whether his decision to step down as the CEO was final. This image shows Jobs at a June 2011 presentation of the iCloud . In the days and weeks leading up to his death, Jobs was busy meeting with peers and friends . In the weeks leading up to his passing, Jobs also met up with John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar, the award-winning digital animation company founded by Jobs and later sold to Disney for $7billion. ‘We talked all about Pixar... And then I kinda looked at him and he said, “Yeah I need to get a nap now.” I got up to go, and then I stopped, and I looked at him and came back. I gave him a big hug, and a kiss, and I said, “Thank you. Thank you for everything you've done for me,""’ Lasseter recalled. The Pixar animator described in one passage how a few years after Steve Jobs' death, he ran into Tim Cook at a birthday party for Jobs' widow, Laurene Powell. The two men bonded over how much they both missed Jobs, and Lasseter confided in the new Apple CEO that he still had his late boss' number on his phone. 'I said, “I'll never be able to take that out.” And Tim took out his iPhone and showed me—he still had Steve's number in his phone, too,’ he said. John Lasseter (far right), chief creative officer at Pixar, got to meet Jobs (left) one last time before his passing and thank him . Kindred spirits: Bill Gates, pictured here alongside Jobs in 1984, got to visit his former rival-turned-friend at home and talk about their legacy and what was ahead for their industry . The co-authors of 'Becoming Steve Jobs' also interviewed Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who was among the people who paid a visit to his one-time rival's Palo Alto mansion not long before his death. ‘We just talked about the things we'd done, and where we thought things were headed,' Gates recalled, graciously adding that his competitor-turned-friend was the one person who had the biggest impact on the personal computer history. In the memoir, which was released Tuesday, Tim Cook did not miss an opportunity to take a swipe at the unauthorized Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson, which debuted just weeks after the Apple co-founder's death. ‘You get the feeling that [Steve’s] a greedy, selfish egomaniac. It didn’t capture the person,’ fumed Cook. ‘The person I read about there is somebody I would never have wanted to work with over all this time. Life is too short.’","New book 'Becoming Steve Jobs', out now in stores, is based on interviews with Apple co-founder's friends and peers .

"Chelsea captain John Terry has revealed how manager Jose Mourinho keeps his Barclays Premier League title-chasing team on their toes and says he sometimes goes wild even when they are winning. Mourinho has guided Chelsea to the top of the Premier League this season, six points clear of nearest rivals Manchester City with a game in hand, and it seems his methods are getting results. Captain Terry says that the Portuguese coach is unpredictable, calmly reacting to games when Chelsea are struggling or kicking off with his players when they are winning. Jose Mourinho keeps his Chelsea team on their toes, according to captain John Terry . Terry says Mourinho can flip tables over when Chelsea are winning but stay calm when they are losing . 'Sometimes you're losing a game at half-time, which doesn't happen often at this club, and you expect to come in and get a rollicking,' Terry said. 'But you come in and the manager is calm, collected, the complete opposite. He's like, ""Listen, we're going to win the game. We're going to get an early goal"" and he talks you through it.' While Mourinho's calmer side has been used to get his team through difficult periods, such as when they were drawing 2-2 with Hull City at half-time on Sunday after taking an early two-goal lead, he can also operate at the other end of the scale. Mourinho sometimes knocks tables over and sends water flying during his half-time speeches . The Blues boss used his calmer side to help them through a difficult moment against Hull City . But Terry feels those little details from Mourinho's behaviour keep his team ready for anything, something that has helped them take the initiative in the title race all season while winning the Capital One Cup earlier this month. 'Other times you'll be winning 2-0 or 3-0 and you'll come in happy at half-time and he'll go ballistic,' Terry told Chelsea Pitch Owners. 'Tables will go over, bottles of water will go flying. You think ""where's that come from?"" 'But you go out for the second half and win the game 5-0 rather than scraping through 3-1, 3-2. 'He knows when players take their foot off the gas. He can sense something before the game. He just gets a feel for everyone and every single game. And I look at that and think no one else has got that that I’ve experienced.' Terry and his team-mates celebrate at full-time at the KC Stadium as Chelsea took another step towards a title .

"Roughly 30 kilometres southeast of Brisbane sits a café with a scandalous burger. But the chefs at Fins n Fries café in North Stradbroke Island say their Bali Nine Burger is only named after its ingredients. The café has been serving the item for over four years, but they conceded the looming execution of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran has prompted questions about the burgers future, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . Fins n Fries café in North Stradbroke Island has been serving a Bali Nine burger for over four years . Owner and head chef Cameron Tobin said customers are asking: ''are you going to call it the Bali Seven in a couple of weeks time?'' Mr Tobin clarified he thought this suggestion was 'distasteful.' He claimed the burger earned its name from having nine ingredients and a Balinese sauce, rather than referencing the nine people arrested in 2005 for trying to smuggle eight kilograms of heroin into Australia. 'People have a bit of a laugh, but then I explain to them the theory behind it and tell them that there are nine ingredients on the burger,' he said. Mr Tobin discovered the recipe for the burger when travelling through southeast Asia. While it is apparently his most popular item, that could be in part due to some customers believing it contains drugs. 'It is my best seller, but I get lots of people ask me if there are illicit products used in the making of the burger,' he said.

Mr Tobin said the looming execution of the two Australians has prompted questions about the burgers future .

It comes as news broke on Thursday the legal appeals of Bali Nine members Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been adjourned until next week, because president Joko Widodo lacks sufficient legal representation.","Fins n Fries café in North Stradbroke offers a Bali Nine burger .

"A 17-year-old who was caught attempting to flee Australia to join jihadi militants in the Middle East had also been stopped by police just one day earlier during a first escape attempt. Wearing a lime green cap and carrying a black backpack, the teen was removed from a plane at Sydney Airport on March 12 and interviewed by counter-terrorism officers, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton revealed on Wednesday. However this was already the second effort the boy had made to escape the country after he had attempted to hop on a flight to Abu Dhabi - allegedly on his way to Syria - on March 11 before first being stopped, News Corp reports. The third teenager to be caught by authorities trying to join Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East, was stopped from leaving the country by federal police two days in a row . 'His name triggered the system and his passport was ­cancelled. He then turned up the next day and tried to board the same flight,' a senior source told News Corp. Police then intercepted the teen during his second attempt, detaining and interviewing him before releasing him to his parents. It comes after two teenage brothers were also discovered trying to travel to the Middle East earlier this month. The first incident occured on March 11 and the second on March 12 . The boy is the third teenager government officials have intercepted and amongst about 200 people stopped from heading overseas to become foreign fighters with terrorist groups. He has since returned to his family again, with the Australian Federal Police and ASIO investigating the matter. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that while it was hard to believe people who had grown up in Australia's free and open society could be susceptible to brain washing by extremist groups such as Islamic State, it was clearly happening. 'It is very dangerous for you. It is very dangerous for others,' he told reporters in Canberra. It follows two brothers who were detained for doing the same earlier this month (pictured above) The siblings aged 16 and 17 were questioned by counter-terrorism officers before they were sent home to their mother in Sydney's south-west . There are fears that more teenagers could end up like Abdullah Elmir (pictured) who has been dubbed the 'Ginger Jihadist' Elmir (front centre) has appeared in propaganda videos since he arrived in the Middle East (above) 'We will do everything we can to stop you if you do try.' The two brothers who were stopped earlier this month were aged 16 and 17. The siblings were south-west Sydney and were reportedly brought home by their mother after being detained. Authorities' suspicions were aroused after the two had booked flights to an unidentified country in the Middle East and their luggage was searched. The latest teenager to be caught were trying to fly to the Middle East like notorious extremists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar . Mohamed Elomar (above) has caused a stir on social media after posting photos of him with weapons and severed heads . Meanwhile Khaled Sharrouf made international headlines after he posted photos of his children posing with guns . The above photograph is Sharrouf posing with his children in front of an Islamic State flag and rifles . They were stopped on the night of March 6, Mr Dutton said at the time of the revelation. Their parents were unaware of their plans to travel to the Middle East. The brothers were later issued court attendance notices. Under the new Foreign Fighters Act, customs officers are allowed to detain people where the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is intending to commit a Commonwealth offence or is a threat to national security or the security of a foreign country. Sydney jihadists Mohamed Elomar, Khaled Sharrouf, and teenager Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadist - are so far the most high profile Australians to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State. Elmir, a former Condell Park High student, was filmed on the banks of the River Tigris in Iraq last October. While Elomar and Sharrouf have appeared regularly in Islamic State videos. One of which included a beheading of a prisoner.","Third teenager has been caught trying to flee Australia to join Islamic State .

Storm chasers took to the windy streets to capture photos of the blasts and posted their images to Twitter. The tornado season usually ramps up for parts of the U.S. in March, but weather patterns funneled cold air into much of the country, depriving the atmosphere of the warm, moist air necessary for form bad storms for most of the month. That all changed this week. Southerly winds pushed temperatures into the 70s and 80s across the Ozarks and Southern Plains, while weather fronts churned the air into Wednesday's storms. Meteorologist Jeff Hood in Little Rock said a weak 'waterspout' tornado briefly touched down in Bull Shoals Lake in Marion County in northwest Arkansas on Tuesday night. He said it will likely be classified an EF0 — the weakest tornado with wind speeds of 65 to 85 mph. A 'waterspout' forms over water.

'This will be the 'tornado' that breaks the drought for March,' Greg Carbin, warning coordination meteorologist for the Storm Prediction Center, said Wednesday. Before this week, only about two-dozen twisters had been recorded this year during a period when about 120 are typical. The last time the U.S. had no twisters in March was nearly 50 years ago, according to figures from the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. The National Weather Service called the storm 'extremely dangerous.' 'You are in a life threatening situation. Flying debris will be deadly to those caught without shelter. Mobile Homes will be destroyed. Considerable damage to homes, businesses and vehicles is likely and complete destruction possible,' said a Google weather update posted just minutes ago. Severe weather warnings: Oklahoma's first severe weather of the Spring kicked off with bang as scattered reports of small tornadoes and large hail came in from all around the state .

The Storm Prediction Center had warned that a clash of warm and cooler air masses could lead to violent storms. It predicted mostly hail and high winds, but said tornadoes couldn't be ruled out. Tornadoes were also reported in the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas. No injuries were reported there, either.

"Cricketer Graeme Smith revealed to his wife that he wanted a divorce when he mistakenly sent her a text message he’d meant for his lawyer, according to reports. The former captain of Somerset and South Africa left wife Morgan Deane Smith devastated at the news having led her to believe that he wanted to save his marriage, her friend reportedly told South Africa’s Sunday Times newspaper. Smith, 34, has been following the South African team at the Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in recent weeks after he retired from the game last year. Scroll down for video . Friends of his Morgan Deane Smith,  a singer from Ireland, accused the sports star of ‘abandoning’ his family in favour of touring and partying with his friends . Friends of his 29 year-old wife, a singer from Ireland, accused the sports star of ‘abandoning’ his family in favour of touring and partying with his friends. The couple, who were married in 2011 following a brief romance, have two young children – a two year old daughter and a son aged one. Mrs Smith, who was a backing singer for Jedward in the 2011 Eurovision song Contest, has not spoken publicly since news of the couple’s separation was revealed two weeks ago. However ‘unnamed friends’ of the mother-of-two revealed details of the acrimonious break-up which has shocked Smith’s fans in South Africa. ‘He is only interested in going out with his friends and partying. He is obsessed with the limelight and would go to the opening of an envelope. He finds her boring and thinks she is a nag when she asks him to spend time with his family,’ a friend told the newspaper. The report revealed that the singer, whose band Industry twice topped the charts in Ireland, was under the impression that her husband was keen to make their marriage work and had agreed to attend couple counseling sessions. Instead, she learned that he wanted a divorce in a text message he’d sent to her in error, only minutes after reassuring her that their relationship could be saved. Former South Africa and Somerset captain Graeme Smith has split from his wife Morgan, pictured with their children . A source loyal to Mrs Smith told the Sunday Times, ‘She does everything for her children not to see her cry, but she just can't believe how he has treated her. He has watched her go through this alone. ‘The man has completely isolated her. Her whole life was his life, his friends were her friends, and she has just been left on her own with the kids. She has become reclusive in their home - only going to the gym and to take the kids out.’ Smith reportedly became cold towards his wife some weeks ago after she’d flown home to Ireland to visit her family. After arriving back in Cape Town, she was given the number of a lawyer to consult by an intermediary acting for Smith. When she confronted her husband, he denied he wanted a divorce or had sought legal advice, her friends told the paper. Last year, Smith bowed out of top-flight cricket, saying he wanted to ‘see my children grow’, prompted by a terrible accident in which his daughter suffered burns from boiling water . Minutes after this reassurance, Mrs Smith received a text from her husband – apparently intended for his lawyer – demanding to know ‘why Morgan had been informed, because he [Smith] wanted to tell her himself.’ The haste with which Smith has insisted on a divorce has led his distraught wife to wonder whether he has met someone else. ‘She has been thinking about this, because the divorce came so quickly. She doesn't know for sure if there is another woman, but if there is, she will have a lot to say to her,’ the friend said. The couple met when the Irish pop singer was on holiday in South Africa exactly four years ago. When Smith proposed just three months later, in Ireland, the singer abandoned her career and family and moved to Cape Town to be with him. Within a year they were parents - daughter Cadence was born in 2012 followed a year later by son Carter. But the strain of being alone in a strange city with two small children, while her husband toured with the South African team or made public appearances, began to take its toll on the young mother. She gained a lot of weight and rarely went out. ‘She is the one who has been raising those children for the past two years. He has had a million jobs. She is a stay-at-home mother. From Monday to Friday she doesn't even leave the house. She doesn't go anywhere, she doesn't have a fancy lifestyle, she doesn't go to social events,’ the friend told the Sunday Times. Last year, Smith bowed out of top-flight cricket, saying he wanted to ‘see my children grow’, prompted by a terrible accident in which his daughter suffered burns from boiling water. However, friends of his wife claimed ‘family life bored him’ and his retirement led to even more conflict between them with Smith seeking out the company of friends and spending time drinking. And when Mrs Smith attempted to relaunch her own music career by entering South African Idols last year, her husband did not even bother to watch her on television. ‘He has not made himself available to Morgan. He slotted them in when he could, but he was busy with his own things from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to bed. He could never come down from the hype. He wanted the hype. If he wasn't on TV doing the commentating, he had to be with the boys where they were all bigging him up, drinking and making him feel good. It was a joke. In 2011, Mrs Smith was a backing singer for Irish pop due Jedward, who represented Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest, pictured . ‘He told Morgan he wanted a family life, but he just couldn't do it. He spent so long being the king that family life bored him. Morgan was constantly fighting with an ego that wanted to be out there.’ ‘He didn't even watch her on the show [South African Idols], it was nothing to him. He didn't care, he was too busy doing his own thing."" Smith’s agent, Kirsti Lyall, last night issued a joint statement from the couple emphasising that ‘our marriage has broken down purely due to irreconcilable differences. 'We understand that there will be speculation as regards the breakdown of our marriage ... [and] would once again request that our privacy is respected during this difficult time. As parents we continue to have the deepest respect for each other and our ongoing priority remains the security, happiness and best interests of our children.’","South African cricketer Graeme Smith has split from his Irish wife Morgan .

"Lions prop Adam Jones has become the latest Welsh player to commit his future to the Aviva Premiership after agreeing to join Harlequins for at least two years. The 34-year-old, who has been capped 100 times, retired from international rugby in January and will bring a wealth of experience to the Quins front row. Adam Jones poses with the Harlequins shirt after completing a deal for next season . Harlequins have announced the signing of former Wales and British and Irish Lions prop Jones . Jones (background) will leave current club Cardiff Blues to join the Aviva Premiership side . He joins a healthy contingent of Welshmen plying their trade in England. Rhys Priestland has signed for Bath, while Jamie Roberts and Taulupe Faletau could join the likes of George North, James Hook and Bradley Davies. Jones said: ‘I’m really excited about this new challenge. Harlequins are an ambitious and progressive club with good values.

Harlequins director of rugby Conor O’Shea said: ‘Not only is it apparent that Adam wants to keep going for some time to come. But the work he will do in supporting and pushing our young tightheads, Kyle Sinckler, Will Collier and Matt Shields, will benefit us for years.

"Steve Smith hit a sublime century as Australia reached the World Cup final with an imposing 95-run victory over reigning champions India on Thursday. The 25-year-old hit 11 fours and two sixes as he made 105 as the co-hosts posted a daunting 328  for 7, despite suffering a mid-over collapse. India’s response never materialised and although MS Dhoni made a run-a-ball 65 Australia always looked in control with Mitchell Johnson (2-50) and James Faulkner (3-59) bowling India out for 233.

Smith whacks the ball for six runs during his innings of 105 from 122 balls as Australia set India 329 to win . Smith plays a shot during his impressive century that was the backbone of Australia's innings . In a sport dominated by statistics there were plenty that were pointing towards a home victory with India having beaten Australia just once in 13 previous meetings at the Sydney Cricket Ground. With the sub-continental side having continually suffered at the hands their opponents since arriving in the Southern Hemisphere in late November, Australia looked strong favourites. But Dhoni, India’s exceptional if not a somewhat underrated leader, ensured the world champions rose to the occasion of defending their crown and the result of the semi-final was far from a foregone conclusion. Having won the toss, it came as no surprise that Michael Clarke chose to bat – opting to put runs on the board and attempt to apply pressure on India. The rejuvenated Indian pace attack began aggressively and the build-up of early pressure saw David Warner lose patience and send a leading edge off Umesh Yadav to Virat Kohli at cover. It brought Smith, India’s kryptonite over the past four months, to the crease and he provided further evidence as to why many view him as the man to lead Australia in the near future. Despite the pressure of the situation Smith never looked fazed and having weathered an early storm of short-pitched deliveries he punished one Yadav over for four fours. Meanwhile, at the other end Aaron Finch was struggling to time the ball but Smith’s ability to attack and keep the run-rate rising allowed his partner to find his feet. After becoming just the second Australian player, after David Boon, to score four successive World Cup half-centuries Smith finally made his maiden World Cup century. In the first over of the batting powerplay, the right-handed batsman hit three boundaries, the last a four pulled from outside off that saw him complete a 89-ball ton. The match seemed to be swerving dangerously out of reach for India with their bowlers continuing to offer short-pitched balls that were being dispatched to the stands. But, Dhoni brought back Yadav (4-72) and the eerily quiet SCG erupted as Smith attempted to hook a short ball and saw a top-edge fly to Rohit Sharma at deep square leg for 105 off 93-balls. Ravichandran Ashwin is clean bowled by Australia's James Faulkner for five runs . Mitchell Johnson celebrates with wicketkeeper Brad Haddin after combining to remove Virat Kohli .

As Smith walked off the SCG the Indian fans were relieved to see the back of the outstanding batsman, who has plundered 921 runs in 10 innings this summer against them. Having broken the 187-run second-wicket partnership India looked to go on the attack but all-rounder Glenn Maxwell was equal to task, hitting three fours and a six in a quick-fire 23. As Maxwell departed Australia were faltering and Finch, who had grafted his way to 81, was the next to go - caught at mid-wicket by Shihkar Dhawan - having become increasingly frustrated at a succession of dot balls. Captain Clarke (10) quickly followed him back to the hutch with Mohit Sharma claiming his first wicket as India slowly began to claw the match back to an even keel. Though Smith, Finch and Clarke were all dismissed by the short ball, the Indian bowlers were guilty of relying on it far too much and Shane Watson and Faulkner cashed in late on to push Australia past 300. A cameo from Johnson (27 not out) took the co-hosts to 328-7 as India conceded 89 in the final 10 overs. If India were going to finally win their first match in Australia this summer they needed to get off to quick start. Rohit was lucky not to be dismissed for a duck in the first over off Mitchell Starc as he drove a fuller ball to Watson at slip only for it to be adjudged to have just fallen short. Steve Smith watches as the ball runs away during his important innings of 105 . Umesh Yadav (left) and Suresh Raina celebrate after taking the wicket of Australia's David Warner . Fellow opener Dhawan then enjoyed his own bit of luck as he danced down the track to Josh Hazlewood but wicketkeeper Brad Haddin dropped a big outside edge. The second lives for both batsmen was gleefully accepted and the pair put on a 76-run first-wicket partnership as India looked to make inroads into the substantial target. But Hazlewood soon had his man as Dhawan (45) looked to have timed his shot perfectly only to pick out Maxwell at deep extra cover. It was a desperately required wicket for Australia and three overs later India’s star batsman Kohli was dismissed by Johnson for just a single. The 26-year-old has scored 13 centuries in victorious chases for his country but failed to add to that in Sydney, as he top-edged a bouncer high into the sky and straight into Haddin’s gloves. Knockout matches bring about a unique pressure and the impressive Indian batting line-up collapsed from 76 without loss to 91 for three. as Rohit was bowled - via an inside edge - by Johnson for 34. In their previous seven matches in the World Cup, at least one of India’s top-five batsmen have scored a half-century or a hundred to anchor their side’s innings. But as Suresh Raina departed for an 11 ball seven and India were wavering on 108 for four, the task of taking India to victory again rested on the shoulders of Dhoni.

Ajinkya Rahane shared an important 70-run fifth-wicket partnership with his captain before Starc has him caught behind off the slightest of edges on review. Smith continued to affect the outcome of the match and with the required run-rate rapidly rising, reaching over 13 with 10 overs left, as he ran-out Ravindra Jadeja for 16. On 40 occasions in which the 33-year-old has finished unbeaten when his side was chasing, Dhoni has taken them to triumph 38 times. Having prodded his way to 47 off 54 balls, the Indian captain smashed the recalled Watson for successive sixes. Paceman Mohit Sharma (left) celebrates after taking the wicket of Michael Clarke . Australian fans enter into the spirit of the occasion at the Sydney Cricket Ground . India were also very well supported at the SCG as they continued the defence of their title . But Dhoni’s innings was eventually ended as Maxwell, with one stump to aim at, ran the Indian captain out 65. India had not lost more then seven wickets in their previous seven World Cup matches and the previously unexposed tail were quickly dismissed. Faulkner bowled Ravichandran Ashwin (5) and Shami (0) in successive balls before Starc wrapped up the innings, bowling Yadav for a five-ball duck, with 19 balls spare.

"Brazil legend Pele has praised his country's current star Neymar as 'an excellent young player' but says he will never replace him as the footballing 'king' even if he matches his goalscoring record.

"Most women rely on a mirror and an avid eye to apply make-up with precision. But for one beauty blogger, who lost her eyesight in 2007, it isn't so simple. Christine Hà, an American chef, writer and blogger from Houston, Texas, has released an inspiring video tutorial showing how she applies her make-up with a tried-and-tested formula. Christine Hà, who lost her sight in 2007, has released an inspiring video tutorial showing how she applies her make-up without a mirror . Christine, 35, who has a video series on YouTube called 'Blind Life of Christine Ha', explains that she decided to release a beauty tutorial after a lot of people asked her how a visually impaired person does their own make-up. The chef, who was the first blind contestant of MasterChef and won the show in 2012, said: 'I remember back when I was filming Masterchef we had to do our own hair and make-up. 'I would sit and put on my own make-up and a lot of my friends on the show would watch me in awe because I don't use a mirror.'

'The first thing is foundation,' she begins. 'Now I am in my 30s, I've been told we have to worry more about redness on our skin so I have started wearing it. Brush it all on, which helps it blend really well so I don't have to worry too much about streaks. 'As you can see, I am covering the area around my nose where I get the most redness, or so I've been told.' She then takes a pair of eyelash curlers and says: 'A lot of people think this is scary because I can't see, but I can feel the eyelash curler so I know that I have it pressed up against my eyelid.'

She then takes her mascara, which she says is 'very tricky', but, she says, once you know how long the wand is, you know where to put your hand. She explains: 'You approach you lashes very gently and once you feel the brush on your lashes, you know to start stroking it on. I do two layers on both eyes.' While she waits for her mascara to dry, she puts on her blush. 'I do about five swirls across my face and always tap before I put it on to get rid of excess,' she says. Next, she applies lip liner, which she says she also does  by feel. Lastly, she applies eyeliner. She finally applies lipliner and lipstick, which she says she does by feel . She says: 'Some people may think it's backwards to do your eyeliner last but I want to make sure my mascara is dry because I can't see if it smudges.

"Joe Hart considers Sergio Aguero to be a better finisher than Lionel Messi. The England goalkeeper has backed his Manchester City team-mate ahead of the Barcelona star when it comes to their natural ability to score. Messi is always put forward as one of the greatest to ever play the game when the debate is raised, but Hart believes Aguero has the advantage when it comes to tucking them away. England goalkeeper Joe Hart views Sergio Aguero (left) as a better finisher than Barcelona's Lionel Messi . Hart works with Aguero on a day-to-day basis at Manchester City and is impressed with what he's seen . ‘From working with him on a daily basis and from what I've seen this season, Aguero just knows how to score,’ Hart explained. ‘In training he particularly excites you most days but he's also got that ability on the day to do it. We've got a good team, but a long clearance could turn into a goal because he's got that ability to take it round five people and score. ‘It's a great thing to have. Sergio is a very natural player and in a situation one-on-one there is nothing complicated about it. He takes that option to score. Messi is absolutely awesome, he is a phenomenal player, but I'm backing Sergio.’ Messi is denied by Hart at the Nou Camp during City's Champions League exit to Barcelona last week . Messi could not find a way past Hart over the two legs and missed a penalty at the Etihad Stadium . Hart has faced Messi four times in the past two season, not conceding to the Argentine at all this campaign but twice last year, a penalty and a delicate strike. ‘He scored past me with the outside of his foot,’ Hart said. ‘He managed to dink it back past my shoulder and didn't have the momentum to do that, he shouldn't have been able to do that, but it appeared like a very simple finish for him. He's definitely one of the best players I've ever played against.’ Hart got one over Messi by saving his penalty in their Champions League last-16, second-leg tie last week, but he takes no credit for the stop. ‘The only reason he missed is because he probably didn't take it as well as he wanted to,’ Hart added. ‘I don't think it was down to me. ‘I'm sure in years to come when potentially he's being honoured as the greatest player ever to play football then it will be a nice one to have.’ Aguero is third-top goalscorer in the Premier League this season behind Diego Costa and Harry Kane .

"Isis militants threatened to give anyone caught watching last Sunday's Real Madrid versus Barcelona football match 80 lashes.

"Chelsea captain John Terry was made to warm up toilets seats early in his career  for then-skipper Dennis Wise. Terry revealed his duties as a young player included cleaning Wise's boots and making hot drinks for senior players at Chelsea's old Harlington training ground - a far cry from the facilities the club's youngsters enjoy at their world-class Cobham base now. But easily the strangest thing that Terry did to impress was make sure the likes of Wise, Kevin Hitchcock and Michael Duberry did not have to sit on cold toilet seats. John Terry may be Chelsea captain now, but when Dennis Wise was skipper and Terry was a junior player at the club, his duties included warming toilet seats for senior players, making drinks and cleaning boots . John Terry (left) warmed up toilet seats for Dennis Wise and his senior Chelsea team-mates as a young player and would receive £25 from Wise every time the former captain scored while wearing boots cleaned by Terry . Terry grew from a young player to a senior member of the side during training sessions at Harlington . 'I'd do anything for them,' Terry said. 'I'd make their teas and coffees, even silly things like sit on the toilet to make the seat warm for them in the cold winter days at the training ground. It's bizarre when you think about it but that was part of growing up.' Terry, now earning around £150,000-a-week as one of Chelsea's key players, used to take a tip of £25 from Wise whenever the feisty midfielder scored with the boots Terry had cleaned. 'I used to clean his boots and he wanted them perfect so I took really good care of them,' Terry told Chelsea Pitch Owners. 'Every now and then he gave me a little bonus. Every time he scored I was on £25, which was half my wages at the time! I used to be praying we'd get a penalty or he'd score.' Jon Harley, Wise and Terry (L-R) pose in Chelsea kit ahead of an Umbro launch back in 2001 . Wise's boots were cleaned by Terry and he used to give his eventual successor as captain a £25 tip . But Terry could not just rely on his toilet-warming skills to get him noticed by the senior players. 'I would go in and win tackles against first team players, and  I remember at the time people were going, “Ooh, you can’t do that"",' he said. 'Sometimes, the foreign guys especially, didn’t like it. Dan Petrescu, once, he got me round the throat, and said “What do you think you’re doing?!” 'The first one over, to back me up, was Wisey: “If you’ve got something to say, you say it to me, not the younger players.” Me and Dan laugh about it now.' Terry also revealed how current manager Jose Mourinho prevents complacency from creeping in. 'Sometimes you're losing a game at half-time, which doesn't happen often at this club, and you expect to come in and get a rollicking,' Terry said. 'But you come in and the manager is calm, collected, the complete opposite. He's like, ""Listen, we're going to win the game. We're going to get an early goal"" and he talks you through it.' While Mourinho's calmer side has been used to get his team through difficult periods, such as when they were drawing 2-2 with Hull City at half-time on Sunday after taking an early two-goal lead, he can also operate at the other end of the scale. 'Other times you'll be winning 2-0 or 3-0 and you'll come in happy at half-time and he'll go ballistic. 'Tables will go over, bottles of water will go flying. You think ""where's that come from?"" 'But you go out for the second half and win the game 5-0 rather than scraping through 3-1, 3-2. 'He knows when players take their foot off the gas. He can sense something before the game. He just gets a feel for everyone and every single game. And I look at that and think no one else has got that that I’ve experienced.' Terry says Dan Petrescu was not pleased with the way Terry went around tackling the seniors in training .

"Brighton midfielder Rohan Ince is being chased by a host of top-flight clubs ahead of a potential summer move. Liverpool, Newcastle, West Ham and West Brom have all had the 6ft 3in midfielder scouted in games in recent months. The 22-year-old is a former youth player at Chelsea, having joined the club aged seven and coming through their academy before failing to make the senior team. Rohan Ince is wanted by a host of clubs including Liverpool, Newcastle, West Ham and West Brom . However, since his move to Brighton in 2013 his stock has soared and, under former boss Oscar Garcia, he was awarded the club’s Young Player of the Year trophy in his first season. It was Garcia who converted him from a centre-back into a defensive midfielder. Under Sami Hyypia he struggled for games but has since been brought back into the fold by current manager Chris Hughton. ‘There is no doubt he has ability,’ Hughton said last month. ‘He is a physical player as well. He can give us something on set plays. Garcia converted from a centre-back into a defensive midfielder under former Brighton boss Oscar Garcia . ‘When you are as big as Rohan you know he has the ability to get on the end of set plays. He also likes to break from midfield. ‘He has an athleticism about him and his past was playing a little bit deeper, so he is always going to be seen as that more defensive type of player. ‘In a team with good footballers it gives him an opportunity to improve his game on the ball. At this moment he has been playing and he'll look to keep developing.’ But Brighton could struggle to keep hold of Ince in the summer with his contract moving into its final year in June. If Liverpool were to win the race to sign him, he would be the third member of the Ince family to play at Anfield after his second cousin Tom Ince and his father Paul.","Liverpool, Newcastle, West Ham and West Brom havescouted Rohan Ince .

"This is the horrific moment a woman was pinned to the ground while writhing in pain as priests performed an exorcism. The 22-year-old woman, identified only by her first name Laura, was held down in a church in Buenos Aires, Argentina as Bishop Manuel Acuna, 52, ordered a demon to leave her body. As she screamed 'no, no' and shouted abuse at one of the women holding her down, Bishop Acuna was heard muttering: 'Leave, leave her now.' Pictures have emerged of a woman being pinned to the ground while writhing in pain as priests performed an exorcism . The 22-year-old woman (pictured), identified only by her first name Laura, was held down in a church in Buenos Aires, Argentina . Bishop Manuel Acuna (pictured), 52, stood over Laura and ordered a demon to leave her body . Before the exorcism, locals gathered at the Lutheran Charismatic Church praying for her soul and redemption. Bishop Acuna told them: 'The demon exists. He's not an idea, he's not a theory, he's not something abstract. 'The devil is a personality and therefore has a strategy. We are talking about something terrifying, a fallen angel. The devil is not a metaphor. 'The devil is something real that Jesus Christ faced. The devil looks for the perdition of the human being and for this he will use any possible evil instrument.' Laura (pictured) screamed 'No, No' and shouted 'Whore' at one of the women holding her down . Intervention: Bishop Acuna was heard muttering 'leave, leave her now' as the woman was being pinned down . Locals said they could hear Laura 'screaming and crying' from inside a chamber at the church in Buenos Aires . Laura was then led into a chamber where church helpers held her to the ground. Local man Augustus Amador Arevalo, 32, who had gone to pray for her said: 'We could hear her screaming and crying and we prayed for her deliverance. 'She was a good girl but turned bad when the devil possessed her. She had to be exorcised, she had to be free.' The exorcism came to an end when she suddenly gave a strangled cry and closed her eyes, falling backwards exhausted. The exorcism reportedly took place at the Lutheran Charismatic Church in Buenos Aires, Argentina . Bishop Manuel Acuna (pictured) said Laura had encountered 'a group of demons similar to the ones that Jesus faced' The exorcism came to an end when she suddenly gave a strangled cry and closed her eyes, falling backwards exhausted . She could be seen wiping away tears as the priest once again made the sign of the cross over her body. Bishop Acuna said: 'Thank God, we've recovered a daughter of God. You haven't seen a major exorcism. 'This was a group of demons similar to the ones that Jesus faced. Her delivery is God's gift for us today.'","Woman was held down while bishop carried out the exorcism in Argentina .

"West Bromwich Albion will honour club legend Jeff Astle by wearing a retro kit in their Premier League match with Leicester City on April 11. To mark the launch of the Jeff Astle Foundation, the Baggies will don a replica of the white kit worn in the 1968 FA Cup final win over Everton at Wembley. Astle scored the winner that day, his most famous Albion moment, and he will be remembered and honoured on 'Astle Day' at The Hawthorns for the Leicester game. Saido Berahino (left) and Darren Fletcher model the historic 1968 FA Cup final kit that West Bromwich Albion will wear in next month's Premier League match with Leicester in honour of club legend Jeff Astle . The white kit, which doesn't feature any sponsorship, will be worn on 'Jeff Astle day' when a new foundation will be launched in his name to raise funds for research into CTE, the condition that caused his death . A close-up of the special West Brom logo that will be worn on the white shirts . Jeff Astle was a prolific centre forward who scored 174 goals in 361 matches for West Bromwich Albion in a decade-long spell at The Hawthorns between 1964 and 1974. Known as 'The King' by supporters of the club, Astle's crowning glory came when he scored the extra time winner in the 1968 FA Cup final against Everton at Wembley. Two years later, Astle scored in Albion's 2-1 defeat to Manchester City in the League Cup final, becoming the first player to score in finals of both English cup competitions at Wembley. Astle won five caps for England and was part of the squad at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. He passed away on January 19, 2002 at the age of 59, with a coroner finding that repeated minor traumas caused by heading the heavy leather footballs of his era were the cause of his death. Baggies fans applaud in the ninth minute of every game - No 9 was his shirt number - in tribute to him. His family will officially launch the Foundation, which will raise funds for research into CTE or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Astle died of the condition in 2002 at the age of just 59. The disease is normally linked to boxing but coroners at the footballer's inquest ruled Astle's brain had been damaged by heading heavy leather footballs in the 1960s and 1970s. The Justice for Jeff campaign was launched after this and at every game this season, Baggies fans have held a minute-long round of applause in the ninth minute as he wore the No 9 shirt for the club. The historic kit, modelled by club captain Darren Fletcher and striker Saido Berahino, features no sponsorship logos and the players will be numbered 1-11 as was tradition at the time. It is only the second time the Premier League have given special dispensation for a replica strip to be worn - the other was for Manchester United on the 50th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster in 2008. Jeff's widow Laraine and daughters Dawn and Claire chose the Leicester fixture because they provided the opposition on Astle's debut for the Baggies 50 years ago. Astle played 361 matches for West Brom between 1964 and 1974, scoring 174 goals . Astle died at the age of 59 in 2002, with coroners ruling the cause was heading heavy leather footballs . Club chairman Jeremy Peace said: 'We promised at the start of the season to honour both Jeff and his family's efforts to raise awareness of an important issue by dedicating a home game to him - and it promises to be a special day. 'We are absolutely delighted the Premier League have granted permission for this kit change as an additional salute to a footballer who remains much loved. 'We are mindful that it is only the second time this has happened which I think says much about Jeff's standing and the gravity football places on the issues his death raised. 'We must not forget to also thank our sponsors Intuit QuickBooks and kit suppliers Adidas. When we presented them with the idea they immediately grasped the spirit of the project and graciously stepped aside. 'The one minute ovations for Jeff and the 'if in doubt, sit it out' campaign this season have been well supported by fans up and down the country and now the launch of the Foundation gives a new impetus to the family's efforts. 'There is a need to support the research required to understand more about the issues the Astle family have fought so hard to raise. Astle's (left) finest hour came when he scored the winning goal for West Brom in the 1968 FA Cup final .

Astle - back in the Baggies traditional colours - in action during a 1970 match with Blackpool . 'I hope that on April 11, Jeff's old club will be seen to be honouring a promise and helping them. He would have wanted that.' FA chairman Greg Dyke, who has met with the family to discuss their campaign, said: 'I am delighted to see West Bromwich Albion dedicate this day to their great hero, Jeff Astle. 'I know a few West Brom fans and I know how much Jeff meant to them and with how much regard they still hold him – you only need to see the reaction to the Justice for Jeff campaign to understand that. 'I think the Astle family's dedication to their father and husband is inspiring and the idea of an Astle Foundation is important. 'I know we at The FA are now progressing positively with an expert panel to look at head injuries and we remain committed to ensuring the notion of research in this important area of sports medicine is taken to the highest levels at UEFA and FIFA.'","West Brom will wear white kit from 1968 FA Cup final win over Everton .

"Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney poked fun at Barack Obama's penchant for golf, Hillary Clinton's emails and even discussed One Direction on the Tonight Show. In the interview with Jimmy Fallon, Romney talked to his 'reflection' in the mirror and cracked jokes at the President's expense and at his own failed attempt to reach the White House. Earlier this year Romney declared he would not be running for the presidency again, which gave him free rein in the interview. Scroll down for video . In the interview with Jimmy Fallon on Tonight Show, Mitt Romney made jokes at President Obama's expense . In the 'Mitt in the Mirror' sketch, Romney pretended to talk to himself in the mirror with host Jimmy Fallon . Obama has played more than 200 rounds of golf as President - a point Romney joked about in the interview . Referring to his upcoming charity boxing bout against Evander Holyfield, Romney quipped: 'I guess it's not the first time we lose to a black guy' Fallon, pretending to be Romney in the mirror, opened up by asking the real Romney whether he was ready for the big interview. 'Well, actually I'm a little nervous,' Romney admitted. 'Jimmy is probably going to ask me why I didn't run for president. What should I say?' 'Just tell him you enjoy the freedom. You get to sit back, relax, golf all the time, go on vacation whenever you want,' Fallon said as Romney's reflection. 'Aka, be president?' Romney quipped. Obama - who was derided by basketball ace Michael Jordan as a 'hack' on the course - has played more than 200 rounds of golf since he entered the White House. Romney joked about Zayn leaving One Direction saying it was one of the 'important issues facing this nation' Romney made light of the numerous rounds of golf Obama has played since he entered the White House . Romney then went on to discuss his upcoming bout with former heavyweight boxing champion, Evander 'the Real Deal' Holyfield. Romney's reflection wanted some assurance they were not crazy for taking to the ring with the four-time heavyweight champion. The real Romney replied: 'It's all in good fun. It's for charity, what's the worse that can happen?' His reflection joked: 'That's true, I guess it's not the first time we lose to a black guy'. Romney will be squaring off against Holyfield - who famously had part of his ear bitten off by 'Iron' Mike Tyson in 1997 - for Charity Vision's 'Fight Night' in Salt Lake City on May 15. The pair clearly enjoyed the sketch, which mocked Hillary Clinton's emails and Obama's love of golf . Romney then delved into the world of showbiz to discuss Zayn Malik's departure from boy band One Direction. He said: 'There are important issues facing this great nation; turmoil in the Middle East, an immigration crisis here at home and now Zayn has quit One Direction. Thanks Obama.' Moving back to more familiar ground, the real Romney interrupted saying: 'I've got an email here. Hold on, let me take a look.' Fallon, as Romney's reflection, asked: 'Is it work or personal?' To this, Romney quipped: 'Well, the email is from Hillary Clinton, so I guess it's both.' This joke comes in the wake of revelations that Mrs Clinton did not have a government email address from 2009 to 2013. The correspondence of federal officials is considered government records under federal law. While there are exceptions for classified materials, most documents are kept for the use of journalists, congressional committees and historians. Following the controversy, Mrs Clinton said she had simply used private emails out of 'convenience' during her time as Secretary of State. In response to the attention, Clinton said she had in December 2014 handed over 55,000 pages of e-mails to the State Department following their request and now wanted them made public. Romney joked about Mrs Clinton's emails - she did not have a government email address from 2009 to 2013 . Referring to Zayn's split from One Direction, Romney remarked: 'There are important issues facing this great nation; turmoil in the Middle East, an immigration crisis here at home and now Zayn has quit One Direction' Romney, a former Governor of Massachusetts, was defeated by Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In January, he revealed he would not be running for the presidency again. Mr Romney, 68, said he had decided it was 'best to give other leaders in the party the opportunity to become our next nominee'. This week, Ted Cruz, the firebrand Texas senator, became the first Republican candidate to declare himself officially in the race before a crowd of thousands at Liberty University in Virginia.","Romney, who will not run for presidency, joked about Obama's love of golf .

"It won't come as much of a consolation after he was snubbed again by England manager Roy Hodgson, but West Ham midfielder Mark Noble has shown himself to be an impressive fisherman. Noble has been unwinding during the international break with Hammers team-mate Alex Song, and pulled out a monster on an early morning fishing trip. Song posted an image on Instagram showing Noble with a huge fish in his arms, evidently taking advantage of the extra time off he has been afforded as West Ham recharge ahead of a difficult Barclays Premier League run-in. West Ham midfielder Mark Noble caught a huge fish while enjoying time off during the international break . Noble is hoping that if he impresses further with West Ham, he will eventually get the call from England . Song posted: 'A man of many talents! Midfield And lakeside général!' with the image, clearly impressed at Noble's carp, which is thought to weight around 50 pounds. Noble has spoken in the past to Sportsmail about his passion for fishing, but admitted he has struggled to find team-mates who shared his love for the sport. ‘Modibo Maiga, Guy Demel and Momo Diame can’t understand how you go fishing and chuck them back,’ Noble explained in 2013. ‘They say, “Bring it in, I’ll eat it.” I say, “You’re not allowed to do that here!”’ Diafra Sakho, Winston Reid and Noble pose outside the Olympic Stadium, which West Ham move into in 2016 . Noble holds off the challenge of Sunderland midfielder Jack Rodwell in West Ham's 1-0 win at the weekend . The 27-year-old midfielder was disappointed to miss out on Hodgson's squad once again, even with a raft of injuries depleting the England manager's selection. But Noble still believes he can make it into the national squad ahead of next summer's European Championships in France if he knuckles down and keeps working hard with West Ham. ‘I have made it clear what I think about the situation and I would love to play for my country,' he said. 'Obviously at the moment it doesn't look like it is going to happen. ‘I will keep playing as well as I can at West Ham and enjoying it every week. You never know what will happen in the future.' Song, meanwhile, faces an uncertain future after it was revealed that West Ham's board hold serious reservations about signing him on a permanent deal from Barcelona. Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell went fishing with Mark Noble back in 2013, read the full interview HERE. ‘You just switch off really,’ Noble said. ‘It’s so peaceful. You’re concentrating on your rods so you tend to forget about everything else. ‘I used to do a lot of fishing with my dad, usually in Beckton Boating Lake. That was a little bit different from this (at Honeypot Lakes in Essex) - there are no shopping trolleys here! Then I moved out and forgot how good it was. I’m pretty sure my mum sold all my gear. 'This summer I was on holiday in Florida, on an island called Boca Grande, and went fishing every day. That got me hooked again. We would do it all night from about 10 o’clock to five in the morning. It was one of the best experiences of my life.’ Mark Noble has a passion for fishing and posed for this image with one of his catches in the past .","Mark Noble was shown in a photograph with a huge fish on Thursday .

"Nico Rosberg has revealed the secret weapon which he hopes will fire him to victory at the Malaysian Grand Prix. This week's race in Sepang is renowned as one of the most physically demanding on the Formula One calendar due to the extreme heat and humidity. And Rosberg, who finished behind Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton at the season opener in Australia, has a rather unconventional way of dealing with the warm temperatures in Asia. Nico Rosberg revealed he will wear a sanitary towel on his forehead at this weekend's race in Malaysia . Rosberg appeared in the FIA pre-race press conference ahead of the second round of the championship . ‘I have an issue with my eye when I sweat a lot,’ Rosberg began. ‘I do have a sort of headband in my helmet, but it is my trick. ‘I put a women’s… what do you call them? The thing you put in your underwear.’ When asked if he meant tights, Rosberg said: ‘No, inside the underwear.’ Sky Sports reporter Craig Slater then asked: ‘A sanitary towel?’ The German replied: ‘Sanitary towel. Is that what it is called? Yes. I put that on my forehead in the helmet to soak up the sweat.’ Rosberg has described the Malaysian Grand Prix as one of the trickiest of the Formula One season . The German's revelation that he uses a sanitary towel provoked much hilarity in the media pen on Thursday . Since its inception on the F1 circus in 1999, the Malaysian Grand Prix is widely renowned as one of the toughest on the calendar. It takes place at the Sepang International Circuit, just outside the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. With air temperatures in excess of 30 degrees Celsius and humidity levels over 70 per cent, the 90-minute race is a gruelling experience for the driver. They can  lose up to four litres through sweat. Temperatures are forecast to be 36 degrees Celsius for Sunday’s race, the second of the championship. But that still falls short of the 42 degrees Celsius recorded at the 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix, regarded as the hottest in recent memory and won by Fernando Alonso (pictured below). Temperatures are expected to nudge 36 degrees Celsius for Sunday’s race with a humidity of 75 per cent. Rosberg added: ‘The race is one of the toughest on the calendar because of the intense heat and humidity, so you have to be very fit. 'It is vital to stay hydrated, too because during the race I can sweat up to four litres which is massive and probably double the amount of a regular race. ‘It will be very demanding. By the end of the grand prix, your concentration levels will not be as high as they were at the beginning.’ Rosberg appeared alongside Fernando Alonso in the drivers' press conference on Thursday. The Spaniard returns to the McLaren cockpit after he was declared fit to race by FIA medics after missing the Australian Grand Prix. Valtteri Bottas, also absent from the curtain raiser with a back injury, has also been given the green light to race for Williams on Sunday.

"Jonas Gutierrez says he will never forgive Newcastle United for the way he was treated during his battle with testicular cancer. The 31-year-old was told to find a new club when he returned having beaten the illness for the first time in November 2013. Gutierrez was eventually loaned out to Norwich City for the remainder of the season. The cancer, however, returned last summer and he underwent a course of chemotherapy in Argentina. Jonas Gutierrez has admitted he will never forgive Newcastle United for the way they treated him . Newcastle winger Gutierrez runs for the ball with Mathieu Flamini during their defeat by Arsenal . Gutierrez swaps shirts with Olivier Giroud after Arsenal beat Newcastle at St James' Park last week . Alan Pardew has since left Newcastle for Crystal Palace but the manager told Gutierrez to find a new club . He returned to Tyneside in December and was afforded an emotional welcome when he made his first appearance earlier this month during the 1-0 defeat at home to Manchester United. But Gutierrez – who paid for his own medical treatment - says he remains hurt by the manner in which the club hierarchy and manager Alan Pardew told him he was not needed following his initial battle with cancer. 'I won't be able to forgive the way I've been treated, no,' he said in an interview with Canal+. 'I don't think it was the right time nor the circumstances and I think at times like that, you should look after the individual, the player. 'I was operated on in Argentina. They removed the testicle. The post-surgery studies were good and well, I went back to England after being discharged. 'I returned mid-November (2013) and at the beginning to mid-December the manager said I should find myself another club, that it was best. I understand a lot of things about football that, well, that for the directors it is a business, no? Gutierrez pictured when he competed in the Buenos Aires marathon while he battled testicular cancer . Gutierrez gives a thumbs up as he ran the race in support of a cancer charity following his diagnosis . 'It is clear that they look after the club's interests, but I think in a situation like that, you need to save (consider) other things, even more as I had been playing for five years before having this problem. I was always playing. 'And I never asked for anything. I paid for it [medical treatment] because, for me, the most important thing was my health.' Gutierrez is out of contract in the summer and it is thought he will leave after seven years at St James' Park. However, the winger admits he would prefer to stay for at least one more season. 'I know the situation here (at Newcastle) isn't the easiest but I'm going to fight to remain here. Time will tell what I can do and it's in my control to leave everything, to give the best of me and see how far I can get,' he said. Gutierrez has returned to Newcastle and hopes to stay despite admitting he can never forgive them . Gutierrez smiles during Newcastle's warm-up ahead of their Premier League loss to Arsenal on March 21 . 'Without doubt one, after a problem like I had, sees things from a different perspective and the order of priorities changes. 'But it's also difficult to get other people to understand because for everyone their own troubles are more important, aren't they? 'I think the most important thing is health. Health and happiness.

"The Germans are still bleary-eyed and they’ve just rolled out of bed to see the World Cup trophy knocked over on the floor, sticky with spillages from last night’s steins. A sharp pain is spreading from temple to temple; the tongue is dry, throat coarse. There is a sick, dull feeling in the pit of the stomach from a 4am kebab. As hangovers go, World Cup ones can be the worst. Three wins from their seven games since Mario Gotze scored in stoppage time against Argentina to lift football’s greatest prize - two of those against against Scotland and Gibraltar - and this one is proving particularly hard to shake off. Germany have struggled for results following their 2014 World Cup victory last summer . Mario Gotze scores the winning goal for Germany against Argentina to hand Germany their fourth World Cup . Germany 2-4 Argentina (friendly) Germany 2-1 Scotland (Euro 2016 qualifier) Poland 2-0 Germany (Euro 2016 qualifier) Germany 1-1 Ireland (Euro 2016 qualifier) Germany 4-0 Gibraltar (Euro 2016 qualifier) Spain 0-1 Germany (friendly) Germany 2-2 Australia (friendly) They have not been helped by the loss of influential captain Philipp Lahm through retirement, or that his successor to the armband Bastian Schweinsteiger, another key figure in Brazil 2014, has been out injured since. His return to the squad for their draw with Australia, through which he sat on the bench, and the Euro 2016 qualifier against Georgia, has been welcomed by manager Joachim Low. ‘We need him on the field and outside as well,’ Low said. ‘It's a great benefit for us to have him back.’ He could be the strong coffee they need to wake up after defeat by Poland and a draw with Ireland in their group means, on current form, they are heading towards disaster, admittedly still a long way in the distance. Germany have not been helped by the loss of influential captain Philipp Lahm through retirement . Bayern Munich star Thomas Muller is one of the few Germany players to maintain his fine form . Thomas Muller has continued where he left off, their five-goal World Cup top scorer netting four times since, but he is one of the few to maintain last summer’s form. He is clearly one of those annoying people who get up after the night before and are out of the house before anyone else is awake. The Germans have prided themselves on bringing through youngsters and Low has handed 74 players their debuts since he took over in 2006, during which time he led them to runner-up in Euro 2008, third in the 2010 World Cup and also to the semi-finals of Euro 2012. Yet in their most recent squad he named 16 of the side who featured in the World Cup and invited no newcomers. Low has already been backed beyond France 2016 to stay in charge until after the 2018 World Cup in Russia, and is adamant they can build on their achievements. ‘It was a decision where my heart and my mind both said yes,’ Low said, on signing a new contract earlier this month. Argentina claimed revenge on the World Cup winners with a 4-2 friendly victory in September last year .

Germany boss Joachim Low (centre) is adamant his side can build on their achievements . (Left to right) Schweinsteiger, Muller, Manuel Neuer, Toni Kroos and Roman Weidenfeller were on the bench for Germany during the 2-2 draw against Australia on Wednesday night . ‘We waited a long time for the success that we had in Brazil and we all want to experience that again. We have the prerequisites to achieve it once more.’ His assistant Thomas Schneider and goalkeeping coach Andreas Kopke have also extended their stay with him. The main additions Low has made to the squad are those returning from long-term injuries. Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has been brought back into fold following 14 months out with a back injury. Defender Holger Badstuber missed two years with consecutive knee injuries and has returned. So too midfielder Marco Reus after his ankle ligament tear ruled him out of playing in Brazil. Germany suffered a 2-0 defeat by Poland in their Euro 2016 Group D match last October . Australia players celebrate during their 2-2 international friendly draw against Germany on Wednesday . Low has been experimenting in recent months. Against Australia, he tried a three-man defence of Benedikt Howedes, Shkodran Mustafi and Badstuber, who had not played together before and clearly struggled. Lahm, one of the best full backs and defensive midfielders in the game, was always going to be difficult to replace, and that will be a key test for Low. If the World Cup last summer is still looking a little fuzzy for Germany, the future is far from clear either.

"Audley Harrison has revealed he is suffering from traumatic brain injuries and is facing bankruptcy after announcing his decision to retire from boxing. The heavyweight, who won Olympic gold in 2000, has not fought since he was knocked out by Deontay Wilder in 2013.

'He had a fantastic career, he boxed for a world title and won the European title. All the best to him.' In a statement, Harrison said: 'I am no longer a professional boxer, and that is good with me. After locking myself away for the last five weeks, I've tried to focus and turn back the clock to get myself into fighting condition. 'I've also seen specialists for my brain, eyes and various other experts to test my body functions in regards to strength, power, speed, reaction time, cognitive function and agility. 'Additionally, I looked at the latest research into concussions and traumatic brain injuries (TBI). After years of denial and sticking to my guns, I'm finally getting out of my own way. 'I've suffered a few TBIs and will have to work hard to reverse some of the effects taking punches to the head has brought about to my overall health. 'I have vision problems, vestibular issues that lead to balance disturbances, and have serious bouts of irritability and moodiness that comes with TBI recovery.' The heavyweight, who won Olympic gold in 2000, has not fought since he was knocked out by Deontay Wilder . Wilder inflicted a first-round defeat on Harrison in 2013 which led to his retirement before he went back on it . Harrison initially retired following his first-round defeat by Wilder, who is now the WBC world champion. But he reversed that decision within days as he struggled to accept his career was over. Harrison also admitted he has been reckless with his earnings and could face bankruptcy in the UK. The 43-year-old currently lives in California and added: 'I've made many mistakes and learned some tough lessons along the way. I made tons of money and splurged lots of it away with reckless money management, immaturity and a desire to build my empire like Tony Montana. Harrison boxes against Paolo Vidoz on his way to winning Olympic gold at the games in Sydney in 2000 . Harrison plants a kiss on his gold medal in Sydney . 'Thankfully, my wife Raychel started a hair salon business and threw chunks of money into real estate, but I'll still likely have to file for bankruptcy in the UK. Thankfully, I invested in a pension while living in the UK, so that will be good when I'm much older. 'Without my boxing income, I will not be able to pay the huge tax bill I pay each year to satisfy the film partnership I invested into in 2004, and encashed my investment by 2009. The hefty tax bill each year does not finish until 2022.' Harrison started boxing at 19 and became the first British boxer to win Olympic gold in the super-heavyweight division when he triumphed in Sydney. His triumph paved the way for future medalists Amir Khan, James DeGale, Anthony Joshua, Luke Campbell and Nicola Adams through increased funding. He turned professional the following year, signing a £1million deal with the BBC for his first 10 fights. Six million people watched his debut - a first round knockout of Mike Middleton - but his contract was terminated in 2004 after he had accumulated a record of 17 wins from as many contests. Harrison suffered his first defeat when he challenged Danny Williams for the vacant Commonwealth title. Although he would later avenge that loss, it was the first of several high-profile bouts in which Harrison failed to produce the goods. Michael Sprott knocked him out in the third round of their European title clash - although that defeat was also avenged three years later in a rematch for the same belt. Harrison twice used the short-format Prizefighter to his advantage, first in 2009 when he defeated Coleman Barrett, Danny Hughes and Scott Belshaw. That propelled him into his second clash with Sprott which saw him finally win a major honour. The world title opportunity he so craved arrived in 2010 when he challenged David Haye for his WBA strap in Manchester. Six million people watched Harrison's professional debut - a first-round win over Mike Middleton on the BBC . But Harrison landed just one punch as he was dismantled inside three farcical rounds. The British Boxing Board of Control initially withheld some of his purse while a full investigation was carried out but he was later awarded the full amount. After 18 months in the doldrums, Harrison made a comeback against Ali Adams in 2012, a bout he won with a fourth-round knockout. And once again he earned himself a high-profile fight, this time against the British and Commonwealth champion David Price. Harrison gets revenge over Danny Williams for the Commonwealth title in 2006 after earlier losing out to him . But yet again, he was unable to walk the walk as the Liverpool giant knocked Harrison out cold after just 82 seconds. Those who urged him to retire were left disappointed when he again turned to Prizefighter for redemption in 2013. And his three victories over Derric Rossy, Martin Rogan and Claus Bertino produced his familiar rhetoric of finally being at one with himself and the sport. Harrison landed just one punch on David Haye as he was dismantled inside three farcical rounds . But in Wilder he faced another hurdle that could not be overcome. The American hope had knocked out all 27 of his previous opponents added another notch to his record when his right hand sent Harrison to the canvas for one last time after just 70 seconds. Harrison plans to start an agency to ensure boxers are given the financial advice he appears to have missed out on. He also intends to take out a trainer's license in California in a bid to develop a future champion. He said: 'If I'm to achieve my goal of becoming a world champion it will now have to be as a trainer and manager to a bright young star, who will hopefully learn from my mistakes, rather than learning from his or her own.'

"Arsenal star Theo Walcott appeared to contradict his manager Arsene Wenger on Thursday by denying he had started talks over a new contract at the club. Wenger earlier this month said that Arsenal had 'started early' in trying to persuade the forward to sign a new deal. But, moving to deny reports of a bust-up between himself and Wenger, Walcott only served to further muddy the waters by contradicting his boss. Theo Walcott (left) has denied Arsene Wenger's (right) claims that he has started contract talks . He tweeted: 'I don't normally comment on false stories about myself but reports about contract demands & bust-ups with the boss are complete nonsense. 'There have been no contract talks as yet and my current focus is not on contracts but on doing my best for Arsenal FC.' Yet, on March 14, Wenger said: 'The first contacts have been established with the embassy. We will see how that (negotiations) progresses politically. 'Walcott was difficult to convince (in 2013) and that is why it took us much time. 'We have started very early with him, but it was slow progress - he is very quick on the pitch, but off the pitch not always.' Wenger continued: 'I always wanted to keep him and I still want to keep him now. Walcott has only recently returned from injury and is struggling to hold down a regular first-team place . 'I want him to stay and be a regular player and fight for his place, but no matter where you go if it is a big club you have to compete for your place.'

"Australia captain Michael Clarke warned his side were yet to play their perfect game in the World Cup, despite booking their spot in Sunday's final with a 95-run victory over defending champions India. Steven Smith clocked his first World Cup century on Thursday, his 105 off just 93 balls propelling Australia to 328 for seven, with opener Aaron Finch kicking on to 81 after a slow start. It meant India's run-chase was under pressure from the start, and, barring skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni's run-a-ball 65, Australia had a relatively easy route to the finish line and now have the chance for a fifth World Cup title when they face co-hosts New Zealand. Michael Clarke and his Australia team-mates celebrate during their World Cup victory over India on Thursday . Clarke shakes hand with Indian players after the 95-run win that saw Australia progress to the final . Mitchell Johnson celebrates after taking the wicket of India's Virat Kholi at the Sydney Cricket Ground . The Black Caps are the only unbeaten team of the tournament so far, having trumped Australia as well in the pool stages, but Clarke said on Sky Sports World Cup: 'We're playing some really good cricket at the moment. 'Losing to New Zealand gave us that kick up the backside. I still don't think we've played the perfect game yet. I think we've improved every game and now we're excited to be in the final. 'I think the boys have played some outstanding cricket. Smithy was exceptional once again. He's hitting the ball so sweetly, and I'm really proud of the execution under pressure there from our bowlers.' Smith's century comes in a tournament that has already seen him make scores of 95, 72 and 65, and the stand-in Test captain hopes there is plenty left in the bag for Sunday. 'Another big hundred would be nice,' he said. 'It's nice to contribute to a few wins. It was a pretty big stage, the semi-final of a World Cup. I'm just happy that we got over the line in the end.' Steve Smith plays a fine shot on his way to a 100 against India in the Cricket World Cup semi-final . The all-rounder raises his bat to a bumper crowd after reaching his century on Thursday . Dhoni, meanwhile, feels his side can walk away with their heads held high after a World Cup that belied many pre-tournament expectations. India came into the showpiece on the back of a disappointing tour of Australia, with no competitive wins to their name, but marched to the knockout phase by topping their pool and then easily beat Bangladesh. 'Overall, I'm quite happy,' Dhoni said. 'Where we were at the start of the tournament, a lot of people didn't think we'd get this far. 'At the same time, when you come to the knockout stages you have to lift your game. 'There were too many (runs) to chase. If you lose quite a few wickets and you're supposed to chase over six runs an over... Our lower order, I don't think they can contribute as much in these conditions. 'Overall, it's good exposure for them. Maybe next time, in other conditions, they'll know how to bat and do better.' Dhoni was undecided when asked after the match whether this would be his last World Cup. 'I'm not sure about that,' he said. 'I'm 33, I'm still running, I'm still fit. 'But I'll have a (think in a) year's time. Maybe next year during the T20 World Cup I would like to decide if I can continue until the 2019 World Cup or not.'

"Louis van Gaal will continue with his big-spending 'Galacticos' transfer policy this summer as Manchester United prepare to go big in their search of title glory. And the Dutchman will focus his attentions on landing proven international talent, rather than high-risk, big-money youngsters, that have become a feature of the club's transfer policy in recent seasons. United spent close to £150million on the likes of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria last summer - deals that have not gone as well as expected. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is planning to spend big money on proven talent this summer . United spent close to £150m on the likes of Radamel Falcao (above) - one deal that has not gone as expected . Nevertheless, as long as United qualify for next season's Champions League, the Old Trafford money-men will sanction another £100m-plus transfer splurge to help turn the club into realistic title contenders again. And Van Gaal will continue to focus his attentions on high-profile deals, rather than unproven potential, despite having his fingers burned by Falcao and Di Maria. United signed a clutch of young talent in recent seasons as the club look to build for the future. Borussia Dortmund defender and World Cup winner Mats Hummels, 26, is a prime target at Old Trafford . Juventus midfeidler and former United youngster Paul Pogba is also on Van Gaal's radar . But the strategy has not proved as fruitful as they'd hoped. And Van Gaal will target players he feels are in their prime and can hit the ground running. Borussia Dortmund defender and World Cup winner Mats Hummels, 26, is a prime target, as is Holland international Memphis Depay. Juventus star Paul Pogba, widely regarded as one of the best box-to-box midfielders in the world, is also on United's radar. Kevin Strootman (right) has been a long-time target of United but has suffered injury problems . Holland international and PSV star Memphis Depay (right) could be heading to Old Trafford . United have a long-standing interest in Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman, 25, but a serious knee injury has thrown a potential move to Old Trafford into doubt.

Porto's Danilo, who is valued at £30m, is a target as Van Gaal looks for a new right back.

"Roy Keane insists the Republic of Ireland will head into Sunday's Euro 2016 showdown with surprise Group D leaders Poland with nothing but victory in mind. The Poles currently sit on top of the pile, three points clear of Germany, Scotland and Ireland having claimed the scalp of the newly-crowned world champions in Warsaw in October. Martin O'Neill's men, the Germans and the Scots are locked together behind them on seven points, but assistant manager Keane is adamant there will be only one approach as the Republic attempt to close the gap at the Aviva Stadium. Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane (centre) watches on during training at Malahide on Monday . Keane is targeting a crucial Euro 2016 qualifier victory over Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday . He said: 'A win would be nice after the disappointment of [November's 1-0 defeat in] Scotland. 'You can't have too many draws. Some days, you get good draws and bad draws, like the one in Germany is no doubt a good one. But the mindset at home is to go win the match. 'Afterwards, a draw might not be a bad result, but our mindset before the game is to go and get the win. The slip-up in Scotland is one that we don't want to cost us too much, but the mindset with the manager, staff, players and fans behind us has to be to go try win the football match.' The Aviva Stadium will be packed to the rafters on Sunday as Ireland set about their task of hoping to rekindle the memories of their last major victory on home soil, the famous 1-0 win over Holland in which Jason McAteer's goal set the nation on the road to the 2002 World Cup finals. Keane played in that game and set the tone for the afternoon when he thundered into a first-minute tackle on Marc Overmars. Darren Randolf (left) is pursued by David Forde, Cyrus Christie and Richard Keogh during the session . Asked if he could wield the same sort of influence from the sidelines this time around, he replied: 'No, I cant tackle anyone can I? 'No, it's difficult, but we have good players and good characters. Creating a good tempo in the game can come from anyone. Some days it's a tackle and others, please God, it's goals.' Lansdowne in its current incarnation has perhaps proved less of a fortress than in its past, and Keane admits the Republic have to make life more difficult for visiting teams. He said: 'It used to scare the home team! If you want to do well in any campaign, you have to have a decent home record. 'I'm guessing a lot of teams have come here and enjoyed the Aviva, but it's up to us to be on the front foot and get the fans behind us. The atmosphere will be brilliant, but it cant just come from the fans, it has to come from the players too. 'But we will be making tackles, creating chances and putting bodies on the line, and that will get fans right behind us. Stephen Quinn (left) and Kevin Doyle stretch their legs at the Republic of Ireland's team base at Gannon Park . 'The old Lansdowne was brilliant, always a great atmosphere. But in terms of the atmosphere for Sunday? That's the least of our worries. That will take care itself, I think it will be electric.' Keane met up with O'Neill, the rest of the staff and the players on Sunday for the first time since relinquishing his similar role at Aston Villa under former boss Paul Lambert, and he remains convinced he made the right decision. He said: 'I hope so, that was the aim when I left Villa, to focus on Ireland a bit more. It was a chance to get to games and see the players a bit more often, so that's not an issue. 'I was always comfortable with the decision and I felt it was right for everybody.' Keane spoke to the media after a training session in which James McClean, Stephen Ward and Darron Gibson were unable to take part because of injury, and within hours, Everton midfielder Gibson's persistent groin problem forced his withdrawal. A statement said: 'The Football Association of Ireland today confirmed that Darron Gibson has withdrawn from the Republic of Ireland squad to face Poland on March 29 due a persistent groin injury. 'Darron will return to his club today for treatment.' Full-back Ward's ankle remains a concern, but winger McClean said he is '100 per cent' sure he will be fit after a scan on his left ankle on Tuesday revealed no lasting damage.","Poland are currently sitting top of Group D on 10 points .

"World champion Lewis Hamilton is amused by Red Bull's complaints about Mercedes ongoing dominance, accusing the sport's preceding power of double standards. Mercedes are expected to dominate this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix, just as it did at the season opener in Australia with a one-two finish, and the entire 2014 season. The huge edge Mercedes enjoys prompted calls for rule changes to make F1 racing closer, and after the Melbourne procession, Red Bull even floated the idea of withdrawing from the sport if the situation does not improve. Lewis Hamilton has accused Red Bull of double standards after their threat to leave Formula 1 . The Mercedes driver romped to victory at the Australian Grand Prix with Nico Rosberg in second . Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull were hugely successful before Mercedes' improvement in the last two years . 'I genuinely find it quite funny,' Hamilton said Thursday, noting that Red Bull saw no problem with the sport when it was dominating and Sebastian Vettel won four straight championships. 'It's an interesting opinion coming from individuals who had so much success. To already have comment after one race I find quite funny,' he said. Hamilton said Mercedes had simply done a better job than its rivals, who need to work harder to catch up rather than seek to change the rules. 'Not once did this team ever complain to others to equalise things,' Hamilton said. 'Now we are the best team, we pulled together and did an amazing job.' Hamilton walks in the paddock ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grnad Prix . Red Bull's Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo chats to team principal Christian Horner in Kuala Lumpur . The re-introduction of mid-season engine upgrades this year does promise closer racing late in the year, but in the meantime Mercedes is expected to remain in a class of its own at the front of the field in Malaysia and beyond. However Hamilton was wary of Ferrari's performance during race-pace long runs in Melbourne, and saw the Italian team as the main threat. 'Definitely Ferrari have made a huge step and that is good to see,' Hamilton said. 'They put in some really spectacular sectors in the last race weekend.' Mercedes had cheekily invited Vettel to its Friday engineering briefing at Sepang after the German accepted an offer from Mercedes' Nico Rosberg made during the post-race media conference in Australia. However, Mercedes had since broadened the offer to any rival team to attend, and Ferrari said neither the team nor Vettel would be taking up the offer.

"Manchester City midfielder James Milner claims the champions can win their remaining 10 games and retain their Barclays Premier League crown. City and their manager Manuel Pellegrini suffered a barrage of criticism last week after defeats to Barcelona and Liverpool damaged their European and domestic title hopes. They at least got back to winning ways on the home front in midweek as they edged to a disjointed 2-0 victory over bottom side Leicester at the Etihad Stadium. James Milner scored Manchester City's second goal in Wednesday night's 2-0 win over Leicester City . Chelsea remain five points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand but, after the late charges that won titles in 2012 and 2014, Milner is not giving up hope. The England international, who scored City's second goal against the Foxes in the 89th minute, said: 'I think we have played better but it is pleasing to get a result. 'It was important to bounce back after the disappointment of the weekend. 'Now it is about recovering from this period and getting back to 100 per cent, then working on things that we have been struggling on and getting back to the form we know we can hit and have shown in games, for periods of maybe 10, 15 or 20 minutes at a time. City have dropped points recently but Milner helped get them back on track against the newly-promoted side . 'We have got a bit sloppy. It is important we step that up and do it for the 95 minutes of a game and not just in periods. That is what you need to do to be successful. 'We know what is in front of us now. The remaining games, we have to win, and we are more than capable of doing that. We have done it before. 'It is important we build on this win and take that forward.' City were not fluent but still created numerous chances and seized the initiative when David Silva struck from close range in first-half stoppage time. City captain Vincent Kompany (second left) was on the bench after a few out-of-character performances . Mark Schwarzer produced several fine saves to prevent further damage but Milner came off the bench to make the result certain in the closing moments. The result was an important statement by Pellegrini, who had dropped out-of-form captain Vincent Kompany and playmaker Samir Nasri among five changes. Goalkeeper Joe Hart said: 'We've had criticism off people who don't particularly matter to us. What matters is what our manager thinks, and what we think as players. We showed where our heads are at with this result. 'We'll keep trying to win every game we've got, same as we have done for the past couple of years, when we've been chasing titles and cups.' Joe Hart was pleased to brush off criticism of City, even though he said it did not matter to the players .","Manchester City beat Leicester City 2-0 at the Etihad on Wednesday .

"Sebastian Vettel has knocked back an invitation from Nico Rosberg to visit the Mercedes garage this weekend, fearing a PR stunt. Ferrari star Vettel and Mercedes ace Nico Rosberg became involved in a spat during the post-Australian Grand Prix press conference. It resulted in Vettel suggesting Mercedes should open up their garage at the Sepang International Circuit for an inspection of their cars in the wake of a dominant display at Melbourne's Albert Park. Sebastian Vettel, speaking ahead of the Malaysian Grand Prix, has snubbed an invite from Nico Rosberg . Vettel branded Rosberg's invitation to visit the Mercedes garage in Malaysia as 'staged' and a 'PR stunt' Rosberg then invited Vettel, with the latter suggesting the debrief in the engineers' room for his visit. Now, however, such a plan has been knocked down as Vettel said: 'When I was joking with Nico in the press conference the deal was the invite was for all the paddock. Now it seems the invite has shrunk to just me. 'Initially I think it was called off by Niki (Lauda, Mercedes non-executive director) and Toto (Wolff, Mercedes motorsport boss). Rosberg finished second behind race-winner Lewis Hamilton at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . 'Now they've told (Rosberg) yes, so I think they are using it as a bit more of a PR thing rather than a proper invite, so the answer is no I won't be going.' Asked as to whether it was his decision or that of Ferrari, he said: 'It wasn't really discussed to be honest. 'Initially it was called off and then I think they tried to use it as ""Ah yeah, we are so friendly and open to everyone"". 'Even if I went there, do you think they would really open up? That means I won't go, because even if I go it's all staged.'","Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg involved in spat after Australian GP .

"Kell Brook has vowed not to make the same mistake as the man from whom he ripped the world crown when he makes the first defence of his IBF welterweight title in Sheffield on Saturday night. Brook takes on Canada-based Romanian Jo Jo Dan in a bout which bears all the hallmarks of a triumphant homecoming before the 28-year-old sets his sights on much more lucrative 147lbs assignments. Brook had himself been considered a convenient underdog when he went to California in August and surprised the incumbent champion Shawn Porter to wrest the belt by split decision. Kell Brook (left) poses alongside Jo Jo Dan ahead of their IBF welterweight title fight in Sheffield . Promoter Eddie Hearn sits in between Brook and Dan as they discuss Saturday evening's fight . Brook will not make the mistake of underestimating Dan, according to his trainer Dominic Ingle . And his extraordinary recovery following a life-threatening stabbing while on holiday in Tenerife last September has left Brook in no mood to make assumptions about how his first bout in his home city since October 2013 is going to end. Brook's trainer Dominic Ingle said: 'Shawn Porter under-estimated Kell Brook and believed his own hype and then he was forced to admit he had over-looked him. 'There is no danger of Kell overlooking Jo Jo in the same way. Jo Jo has got into the mandatory position and he wants to win that title. Kell is looking for big fights ahead but Jo Jo sees no reason why he shouldn't get them too.' Brook's long recovery since the horrific and unprovoked stabbing incident has left Ingle convinced he will step into the ring on Saturday in the shape of his life - even if his long slog to super-fitness did come at a price. Brook and Dan stare each other out as they go face-to-face in front of the media on Thursday afternoon .

"Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has admitted he learned to hate north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur during his eight-year stint under Arsene Wenger. Henry, now a pundit for Sky Sports, is the club's record goalscorer and playing a huge part in their 'Invincibles' season of 2003-04 when the Premier League title was wrapped up with a draw at White Hart Lane. The Frenchman is still a huge fan of the club and it is evident that he embraced the culture during his time in England. Arsenal players celebrate after clinching the Premier League title at White Hart Lane in 2004 . Club legend Thierry Henry (pictured after scoring against Spurs in 2002) says he learned to hate rivals . Henry also says he had to fight for his place when he first arrived, calling Dennis Bergkamp a 'God' 'During my eight years there, something came into me,' Henry told l'Equipe. 'I have learned the culture of this club... I learned to hate Tottenham.' Henry also added that Dennis Bergkamp was a 'God' at the club, as well as admitting he had to impose himself upon arriving at Arsenal as well as Barcelona. 'We often forget that when I arrived at Arsenal, it was to follow Nicolas Anelka. Not easy at all. No matter that he went to Real Madrid, he will forever remain in my eyes one of the best strikers with whom I played. 'I would have loved to play in the club with him as I would have also liked to do with Paul Scholes and Steven Gerrard. When I arrived, I found myself competing with Davor Suker, Nwankwo Kanu with God - and God is at Arsenal Dennis Bergkamp. 'If I had not come to impose myself, I would have had to go left and fight for a place with Marc Overmars. In short, I had to get up early. At first, nothing was easy. When I arrived in Barcelona, ​​it was the same - I was nobody.' Dennis Bergkamp is embraced by his Gunners team-mates after scoring against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 .

"Kevin Pietersen's former Test captain Andrew Strauss remains convinced it is 'very unlikely' the record-breaking batsman will ever play for England again. Pietersen, sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board after the 2013-14 Ashes defeat, has set his heart on pushing for a return in time for this summer's rematch. The 34-year-old signed for Surrey on Wednesday, to that end - and after indications from new ECB chairman Colin Graves that he may yet be considered again for selection, he is hoping a welter of county championship runs over the next two months could press his claims. Andrew Strauss (right) believes Kevin Pietersen's efforts to play himself back into the England Test team for thei summer's series with Australia will be in vain . Pietersen has rejoined Surrey and will attempt to find his form in the County Championship . Pietersen in action for Surrey during a T20 Blast fixture at the Kia Oval last summer . Strauss, however, predicts Pietersen's efforts will be in vain. The dual Ashes-winning captain believes Pietersen's age and history of confrontation are against him, and suggests his only realistic chance of resuming his international career is if an 'extraordinary' sequence of events first cost either or both of coach Peter Moores and Test captain Alastair Cook their jobs. Strauss had his own difficult times with his fellow South Africa-born batsman, including the 2012 saga in which Pietersen admitted sending 'provocative' texts about his captain to opposition players. The contents of Pietersen's autobiography, published five months ago and including much criticism of several ex-colleagues and management staff, may be another barrier to his recall. Strauss told Sky Sports News: 'If you just look at everything that has gone on in the past ... his book ... that's a significant hurdle he'll have to get over. 'Then also, from a cricketing point of view, in one-day cricket we've got to build towards the next World Cup. Strauss and Pietersen together during happier times - the victorious 2011 Test series against India . The pair celebrate with the trophy after England's victory in that 2011 series with India . 'Kevin Pietersen (will be) 36 years of age, (so) I can't see how he would necessarily play in that. 'Also, in the Test match arena, our top five or six have all been in excellent form. 'So it's not as if there is an obvious place in the side for him either.' England will head to the West Indies next week, for three Tests, and Graves has already made it clear he will not tolerate defeat there against 'mediocre' opposition. Graves' hint that Pietersen's England career might not be finished after all is at odds, meanwhile, with all other public remarks from within the ECB. Strauss appears impressed by Pietersen's willingness to play county cricket again, after agreeing his release from the majority of his Indian Premier League contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad. But he will still be shocked if it leads to an England return. 'I think you can't fault his ambition,' Strauss added. Pietersen and Strauss at the crease together during England's Test series with Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in 2012 . Pietersen was axed by England following unrest during last winter's turbulent Ashes tour to Australia . 'He's doing everything right, putting himself in position. He felt that Colin Graves offered him an olive branch, and he's taking it with both hands ... obviously he's going to have to go out there and score runs. 'But I have to say I still think it's very unlikely that he'll play for England again. 'It's going to take something extraordinary, England to lose a lot of games and for Pietersen to score a lot of runs - and probably for a captain or a coach, or both, to lose their jobs in the process.' Strauss senses too that it will be this summer or never for Pietersen, who will be 35 by the time the Ashes begin in July. 'I'd be surprised if he plays in this Ashes series - and if he doesn't, then it's counter-intuitive that he would then come back in the side when they'd be building again towards the next Ashes series in two-and-a-half years' time. 'There would have to be a lot of things that go wrong with the England cricket team between now and the start of the Ashes for him to come back.'","Pietersen has joined Surrey aiming to return to England Test team .

"Meeting the parents of your romantic interest can be a terrifying experience. But imagine how much worse it would be if they had read the sexts you had sent their son to kick off the romance! YouTuber Riyadh Khalaf, 24, bravely invited his mum Lorraine, 46, to join him on his Youtube channel to filter some potential dates by reading out messages he had received on gay dating app Grindr. Ahead of filming Riyadh left the app open on his phone for an hour each night for three weeks, and in the video the pair sit sipping wine as Lorraine proceeds to read out the uncensored messages to her son, who has yet to hear them himself. The experience makes for a cringeworthy but quite adorable video that sees Lorraine shocked by some of the explicit messages that her son has received. 'Group fun.' She reads from one user, 'What does that mean?!' 'That they want to play Monopoly together,' a joking Riyadh responds. Like any good mother Lorraine is quick to offer advice on who might be suitable match for Riyadh. 'He's nice' she says about one Grindr member. When asked why she adds: 'Nice body. Lovely muscles, lovely skin.' Youtuber Riyadh Khalaf invited his mother Lorraine to read his Grindr messages to him on video . But Lorraine isn't impressed by everyone, saying of one user: 'He is gross. Well he's scruffy. His hair's all over the place, he's just a dog.' Despite some awkward messages cropping up including a semi nude picture, Lorraine makes a stoic effort to act cool before admitting that she is 'slightly traumatised' at the end of the video. Ahead of filming Riyadh left the gay dating app open for an hour each night to allow the messages to pour in . Lorraine says she was left 'slightly traumatised' after reading some of the more explicit messages to her son . Speaking to the MailOnline Riyadh says that he couldn't think of anyone better to sift through potential dates than his own mother. 'I decided to get my mom involved because I wanted her to say which ones she found appropriate. 'She has this amazing filter for who would be right for me and so does my dad, they are both very protective of who would be good enough for their boy.' Riyadh says he could not think of anyone better to filter through potential partners than his own mother . Although Lorraine took a little convincing to take part Riyadh says that she turned out to be the more enthusiastic of the two. 'It took me about a month to persuade her. When I first asked she said ""absolutely not."" 'But I promised to give her complete editorial control and when I had actually edited it  she wanted to put more in! 'There were some I had to cut though. I wasn't going to put clips of my mother discussing male appendages online, those clips will never see the light of day.' Although he proved popular on Grindr Riyadh says that the experience hadn't encouraged him to use the app again. 'It's not for me. I'm not into one night stands, an old soul that's what I've been called, a real old romantic.' Riyadh says that the experience had not encouraged him to continue using Grindr but that he had received several date offers from around the world . Despite some of the nature of the video Riyadh says that the majority of the feedback he has received has been positive, with lots of people commenting on his 'beautiful' relationship with his mother . Despite ditching the app Riyadh has seen the offers pouring in since uploading the video. 'I have also received a lot of date offers from people all over the world! I won't ever need to pay for a hotel again!' But Riyadh isn't the only popular one, with many viewers leaving comments on how much they love Lorraine. 'Most people have been commenting on how beautiful our relationship is. My mom has been very popular I've had people saying they want to be her best friend and they want to bitch with her.' The video which has only been online for three days has already received over one million views, however the 24-year-old admits that he had his doubts on whether the video would be a success. 'I did have this fear that I would have the finger pointed at me for promoting a gay stereotype but 99 per cent of the comments have been positive.'

The centre backs Chris Smalling and Phil Jones, who have missed part of the season, are doing well. 'The competition is hotting up - except in the goalkeeping area.

"Kevin de Bruyne scored twice to put Wolfsburg in control of their Europa League tie with Inter, before the former Chelsea star jumped into the crowd to conduct the celebrations. De Bruyne produced a brilliantly display on the pitch, and then led the Wolfsburg supporters in their post-match chanting, as the German side came from behind to give themselves an excellent chance of progress. Rodrigo Palacio had put the visitors ahead after just five minutes, but Inter struggled to defend what should have been a valuable away goal, and Naldo powered a header home to equalise after half an hour from a De Bruyne corner.

Subs not used: Handanovic, Andreolli, Dodo, Puscas. Booked: D'Ambrosio, Ranocchia, Icardi, Vidic . Goal: Palacio . Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland) And in the second half De Bruyne, formerly of Chelsea, stole the show, finding the net from a neat cut-back and then an excellent free kick, although both goals owed much to the poor goalkeeping of Juan Pablo Carrizo. The Belgian's first goal came after Vierinha had seized on a poor clearance from the Inter keeper, surged into the box, and crossed perfectly for De Bruyne to slide home. Then, with 15 minutes to go, the former Chelsea forward's free kick snuck past Carrizo, despite it being aimed at the side of the goal he was meant to be covering. De Bruyne could easily have completed a hat-trick, but he shot wide when through on goal in the closing stages, with only Carrizo to beat. Wolfsburg showed that they could continue their good form without goals from Europe's hottest striker at the moment, Bas Dost. The Dutchman was well below his best before he was replaced midway through the second half by Niklas Bendtner, but De Bruyne took up the slack. Inter, meanwhile, under former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini, were poor for large periods of the game, offering little going forward, and unable to keep up the defensive solidity they had shown in the first half once they began to tire in the second 45.

"A 14-year-old has admitted manslaughter after he threw a single punch at Paul Walker, who later died . A 14-year-old has admitted killing a man celebrating the new year with a single punch, while his friends filmed the attack on a mobile phone. Paul Walker, 52, from Blackpool, Lancashire, was thought to have been celebrating the start of 2015 before he was found lying unconscious in a street at the seaside resort at around 2am on January 1 and later died. Police said footage of the attack, which show the teenager being encouraged to throw the punch by two older men, was filmed on a mobile phone but has since been deleted, Preston Crown Court heard. The court heard that Mr Walker, a Celtic fan who had lived in Blackpool for at least 10 years, died of injuries to his head, face and neck. The teenager, who cannot be named, pleaded guilty to manslaughter. He was initially charged with murder but prosecutors decided to accept the lesser charge. Nicholas Clarke QC, prosecuting, said: 'There were a number of witnesses who all similarly relate to a friendly encounter with the deceased. 'Unexpectedly there was this one punch thrown by the defendant.' Defending, Julie Taylor said the incident was filmed on a mobile phone which showed the boy being encouraged to throw the punch. She said: 'Police can confirm there was a video but they have been unable to retrieve it because it had been deleted from the phone. 'They're going to use their best endeavours to see if anyone has a copy or whether it's on social media anywhere.' After he was found Mr Walker was rushed to Blackpool Victoria Hospital where he later died. Mr Walker was a Celtic fan and is believed to have been celebrating the start of 2015 near his Blackpool home . Pictures of Mr Walker, who is from Glasgow, posted on Facebook show him in his Celtic football kit . The Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell, adjourned the case until April 10 and told the boy the 'first option the court will consider is custody, not withstanding your age.' Mr Walker was born in the Pollok area of Glasgow and was a dedicated Celtic fan. Describing himself on Facebook as a 'graduate from Glasgow Caledonian University' he posted a series of photographs of himself in his Celtic shirt and images showing support for Celtic and previous manager Neil Lennon. He also posted a series of photos of his young son. The father was found lying unconscious in Sutton Place, Blackpool, at about 2am on January 1 . Mr Walker had lived in Blackpool for at least 10 years. His sister Harriet posted a photo online of the two of them together with the caption: 'My lovely brother. Can't take it in, we never see each other again.' His nephew Luke said: 'I'm in bits. We has such a good night as well. Then this happened.'","Paul Walker was celebrating the start of 2015 near his Blackpool home .

City have struggled to keep the pace in the Barclays Premier League title race this season and are out of all three cup competitions with critics noting that their first-choice starting XI has not changed much since Roberto Mancini's spell as manager. Manchester City are looking to sign Lazio midfielder Felipe Anderson this summer, according to his agent . Anderson does not want to leave Lazio though, who he is pictured scoring a header for against Hellas Verona . And according to Anderson's agent Stefano Castagna, the 21-year-old has been identified as a potential reinforcement in midfield. Castagna told Rome radio station Radiosei: 'The rapport with the club has always been excellent and in this case our interests coincided with those of the directors. 'It was not difficult to reach an agreement for a renewal. The president and his staff deserve praise and we are very happy with the faith shown in us. Anderson (centre) has also been linked to City's local rivals Manchester United but he is happy in Rome . 'It's a good sign that Manchester City are coming to see him, as that means he is doing very well. He has just signed a new deal and is very happy in Rome.' Anderson has also been linked to City's local rivals Manchester United, but Castagna sees no reason for him to leave Rome even if Lazio fail to reach the Champions League. 'I see no particular problem in keeping him, even without Champions League qualification. Playing in that tournament would be ideal, but the Europa League is good too.' Stefano Castagna said that even if Lazio did not qualify for the Champions League, he would happily stay .","Felipe Anderson is a Manchester City target, according to his agent .

"Staff and patrons were in for a shock after spotting a severed pig's head on a stake left outside a fast food restaurant. Michelle Louise stopped in for a cup of coffee at Coolalinga McDonald's, south-east of Darwin, after dropping her daughter off at work when they made a grisly discovery at about 7.45am on Monday. Ms Louise told NT News that she had noticed a group of people standing around a post so she walked over to see what it was when she was confronted by the bizarre sight. Staff and patrons were stunned to find a severed pig's head on a stake left outside a fast food restaurant . 'It was this pig's head, it was really strange,' she told NT News. 'I joked to my son that it looked like there was now pork on the menu.' Ms Louise said she was stunned to see the head left near the new site where a local shopping centre will be built. ‘I don’t know how long it had been there, it obviously happened in the night,’ she said. Michelle Louise and her daughter made a grisly discovery outside of McDonald's on Monday morning . When Ms Louise returned to the fast food giant to pick her daughter up after work, the head had been removed. 'I know people like pigging around here but I have never seen something like this,' she added. Northern Territory police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that the incident is currently being ‘looked at’ for possible leads. ‘We’re certainly looking into it to figure out how, why and who someone would put it there,’ the police spokesman said.","A severed pig's head was left on a stake outside of a fast food restaurant .

"The Premier League, the world’s richest competition, will share £1billion over three years with the rest of English football. The size of the hand-outs, which amounts to £50million per club, will go to five specific areas of the game. The deal is said to be unprecedented in global sport and amounts to an increase in excess of 40 per cent over the previous redistribution figure. The numbers were unanimously agreed at Thursday's summit of Premier League clubs — the first meeting since the £5billion domestic TV rights deal. Sharing the bonanza so quickly will go some way to countering the Premier League’s ‘greed is good’ image. Premier League CEO Richard Scudamore says the top flight is 'sharing in the success of English football' Premier League clubs agreed on Thursday to make a £1bn contribution to the rest of English football . Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: ‘You can’t find me another sport that is committed to this level of sharing. You can use other fancy words like redistribution but this is sharing. It’s sharing in the success of English football.’ The targeted investments are in grass-roots facilities, participation, fan engagement, solidarity payments to the lower leagues and supporting disadvantaged groups. They include all clubs committing to adopting the living wage (£9.15 per hour in London and £7.85 outside London) for full-time employees by the start of the 2016-17 season. The clubs voted in favour despite being told that title sponsors Barclays will not be renewing their endorsement when their current contract expires at the end of next season. But the loss of that £120m deal — sure to be replaced at a higher price — didn’t stop clubs committing £50m each to the PL’s good causes. Ironically, around 50 fans were demonstrating outside the meeting in Piccadilly, London about the Premier league re-distributing their wealth. The only caveat is the result of the current Ofcom investigation into how the TV rights are sold and the monies raised from the international rights sales. Scudamore, who will become executive chairman in June, said: ‘These are unprecedented levels of redistribution in world sport, let alone football, which will deliver long-term progress for English football whether you are a fan, lower league club or involved in the grassroots. The summit meeting is the first since the new record £5bn TV rights deal was secured by the league . BT Sport and Sky Sports (above) took their share of Premier League fixtures in the bumper new deal . ‘I don’t think our clubs have ever made such an early stamp in the ground that says we are committed to what we’ve always done but actually extending and growing. ‘I’ve never seen them unanimously want to say “We want to make a statement. It’s a big statement to give away £1billion of our UK TV deal”. ‘We’ve had commercial success and we are going to share that success and we’ve done this at very short notice. Rarely do we get things through as quickly as this. ‘I do hope over time people will appreciate what we do. Those who know most about us respect us the most. What we do in this space is hugely motivational to me — I absolutely believe in it to my core.’ Scudamore added: ‘I was hugely encouraged about the fact that I don’t think anybody in the room doubted this was the right thing to do. It was all about how it would work.’ About the living wage commitment, he said: ‘We absolutely get and the clubs absolutely get that if you are paying players X and X is a big number it does look a little incongruous if you are only paying your employees Y. ‘My only plea is that we have to be allowed to do this in our own time, We are only halfway through our sales process and we do have the big issue of Ofcom still sitting over us.’ However, acting so quickly in sharing their jackpot rights will certainly make it a lot more difficult for Ofcom to rule against their TV riches.","Premier League to share massive portion of £5billion TV rights income .

I told them that for the first time in my life, I’d been seeing a therapist and dealing with a lot of my issues, and finally addressing all the pain and anger that was inside of me. 'Twice a week, I also worked with an Eastern medicine healer in Seattle who had incredible experience helping some of the greatest athletes perform at the highest levels.

"It could be football's greatest ever dynasty – Zinedine Zidane as Real Madrid's head coach and his four sons out on the pitch in the famous white shirts playing for him. It sounds far-fetched, but then so does the idea that Zidane could be Real's B-team coach and that his offspring would be at various levels of the club's youth system – which is already a reality. Sportsmail looks at the chances of things going to the next level. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch Theo prove he's a chip off the old block . Zinedine Zidane is currently Real Madrid's B-team coach and could replace Carlo Ancelotti at the Bernabeu . Zidane enjoyed a glittering career as a player at Real and his sons are all currently at the academy . The coach . Zinedine Zidane has spent three days in Munich this week under the tutelage of Pep Guardiola and Real Madrid are hoping that what the teacher did for Barcelona the pupil will one day do for them. Club president Florentino Perez has decided he wants the former player to lead the side one day and Zidane is preparing for the possibility that it could come as soon as next season. He is one of seven French coaches spending this week at Bayern Munich's training facilities where along with former Real Madrid team-mate Claude Makelele he is seeing first hand how Guardiola works. Next season he could be in the same position Guardiola was in 2008 – having graduated from his club's youth system to take charge of the first team. He will cut the same sharp-suited imposing figure on the touchline and he will command the same respect among rivals, players and media, but will he be as prolifically successful? Zidane visited Bayern's training ground with Bernard Diomede (left) and Claude Makelele (right) this week . Real hope Zidane can emulate Pep Guardiola's transition from a player to boss with Barcelona and Bayern . Zidane currently coaches Real Madrid's second team, Castilla, in one of Spain's four regional third-tier divisions. If Castilla win their division they will go into a play-off for a place in the second division next season. But by then Carlo Ancelotti may have moved on and Zidane may have stepped up to replace him. There is no question a career as a coach is what the former Ballon d'Or and World Cup winner wants. As well as this week's masterclass with Guardiola he has also been to Marseille to watch Marcelo Bielsa work. He wants to coach the France team one day and if their 2016 campaign on home soil were to end in tears there would be calls for him to take charge of the national side he once lead to the biggest prize in football. The Madrid job will probably come before the national team however. Those who have seen him at close quarters on the training pitch say he's inspirational and has none of that haughtiness that sometimes prevents great players from being able to improve lesser mortals. Zidane lead France to World Cup glory in 1998 and is touted as a future national team coach . With Zidane in charge, Real Madrid's Castilla team are in one of Spain's four regional third-tier divisions . Zidane fights for the ball with Manchester United's Roy Keane during a Champions League tie in 2003 . He's tough and media-savvy after years of coping with the intense spotlight shone on him in France where he is adored far more than Michel Platini – his rival as the country's greatest ever player, but one who never won the World Cup. Ultimately expecting him to emulate Guardiola might be asking too much – the Bayern Munich coach's tactical brain and obsessive character make him unique. He also has the baggage of having been so good as a player. Diego Maradona and Pele never made it as managers, but Alfredo di Stefano and Johan Cruyff did, so there are precedents. Johan Cruyff was a fine player and also excelled as a manager at Barcelona . And the sons… . Enzo . Star of Real Madrid C, Enzo, wears the Fernandez name on his back, the family name of the Zidane boys' mother Veronique Fernandez – a dancer who he met in 1988 playing for Cannes. It perhaps weighs less heavily on the shoulders of the young prodigies. Already a Spain Under 19 international Enzo, just like his siblings, has the choice of three countries. Playing for France would please his father; and so might playing for Algeria, which is his third possibility because of his grandfather. He is the player who most resembles his father in playing style. He plays as a No 10 and is one rung on the ladder below  Castilla. Enzo Zidane Fernandez is the star of Real Madrid C and is already a Spain Under 19 international . Enzo's style as a gifted No 10 with Real's lower ranks most resembles that of his father . Luca . Enzo is very much the French romantics' choice to make it – being named after Uruguayan playmaker Enzo Francescoli and playing in Zidane's position. But many in France believe it will be goalkeeper Luca – born just before his father won the World Cup in 1998 – who will go further. He currently plays for Real Madrid's Under 17s Juvenil B team and is impressing everyone at the club. Luca Zidane Fernandez has impressed at Real Madrid as a goalkeeper while Iker Casillas (right) struggles . Zinedine watches a Thai boxing match with son Luca in Bangkok in 2007 . Theo and Elyaz . Zidane's youngest sons have both grown up in Spain. Elyaz has recently turned 10 and is a midfielder and Theo is also a midfielder who will be 13 in May. They are both in Real Madrid boys' teams and in theory they would both also have the option of playing for Spain, France or Algeria if they reached international levels. If all four sons made it to international football and didn't pick the same country, they could even replicate the situation at the last World Cup when the Boateng brothers Kevin-Prince and Jerome faced each other for Ghana and Germany. Elyaz (left, 10) and Theo (right, 12) are both in Real boys' teams and could play for Spain, France or Algeria . Theo Fernandez (right,) scored a superb goal Real's youth side after a wonderful left-footed touch . He placed the ball past the goalkeeper as three defenders tried to close down the space around him . Will the Zidane dynasty become a reality at the Santiago Bernabeu? It's impossible to say how the youngest two will develop but the eldest are well on their way to becoming professionals. Can they do it at Madrid with Zidane as their footballing as well as natural father? Well Zidane has to get the big job first, then the boys are in the realms of 'famous footballers with famous footbaling fathers as manager' syndrome. Nigel Clough and Jordi Cruyff didn't match the achievements of their coaching dads but did make good careers for themselves. It is always tough for the sons of great players. Pele's son, Edinho, served Santos as a goalkeeper but also served time for drugs and money-laundering offences. Diego Maradona is one of the world's greatest ever players but son Diego Sinagria (right) failed to impress . Jordi Cruyff (right) tried to emulate father Johan and briefly featured for Manchester United . And when Diego Maradona's son, Diego Sinagra, was playing youth football at Napoli, an Italian journalist was overheard assessing the boy's chances of emulating his father and saying: 'If you threw Maradona an orange he'd catch it on his foot, juggle it and balance it on his head. If you threw his son an orange he'd catch it in his hands, peel it and eat it.' Zidane's children clearly have the talent to follow their father's footsteps and with their dad on the verge of a managerial career at Real Madrid the possibilities of a 'Zizou Dynasty' cannot be ruled out.

"Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel insists he does not feel guilty about the challenge on Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea which resulted in his three-match ban. The Slovakia international, currently away preparing for a Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Luxembourg on Friday, failed in his appeal against a violent conduct charge. Skrtel had argued the action of standing on De Gea's right shin as he chased a through-ball in the final seconds of Sunday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield was unintentional but an independent panel disagreed with him. Martin Skrtel's foot lands on David de Gea's leg in the incident which saw the FA charge the defender . A three-man panel of former elite officials reviewed the footage after it was missed by Martin Atkinson (right) Skrtel could have been in more trouble for posting this picture of clowns after the FA upheld his  ban . The 30-year-old has continued to profess his innocence even after his ban was confirmed, meaning he misses Premier League matches against Arsenal and Newcastle, plus an FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn. 'It feels strange because we appealed against those charges and still I was hit by a three-match ban,' he told his personal website martin-skrtel.com. 'I didn't want to stamp on him. It was an accident and I didn't do it on purpose. I don't feel guilty. It was a long ball and he went towards me and I wanted to jump over him. Simple as that.' The defender is unlikely to punished after he posted a picture of clowns on his Instagram account on Wednesday - which has been widely viewed as his comment on those who sat on the panel and decided the outcome of the hearing. Steven Gerrard will also miss three games after seeing red for this stamp during the 2-1 defeat . Captain Gerrard was sent off after stamping on Manchester United's Ander Herrera on Sunday . Skrtel will be joined on the sidelines by Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who will also serve a similar three-match ban after his moment of madness saw him sent off less than a minute after coming on as a substitute for the second half after stamping on United midfielder Ander Herrera. With Skrtel and several of his team-mates away on international duty the club's Under 21 squad have been invited to train at the first-team's Melwood base. However, one of their number Jordan Lussey will be getting competitive action elsewhere after completed a loan move to Bolton, currently 17th in the Sky Bet Championship.

"Sporty Jemma Rozier (pictured) was found slumped in the driver's seat of her car after suffering a heart attack while driving to a party on March 14 . A sporty 28-year-old woman with an existing heart condition died after suffering a fatal heart attack at the wheel of her car while driving to a party. Jemma Rozier, 28, from Swindon Village in Gloucestershire, was found slumped in the driver's seat of her car at a junction. Paramedics were called and she was taken to hospital but doctors were unable to save her. Her heartbroken mother Clare, 49, said: 'It shouldn't be this way round. Devastation is the first thing that hits you. 'We were talking about her finding a husband and having children. 'She was just a normal 28-year-old living her life.' Tragedy struck after Ms Rozier left her family home and headed to a party at around 8.45pm on March 14. She was found unconscious in her car just a few miles away by a passer-by who dialled 999. Ms Rozier, who worked at Capita Insurance in Bishop's Cleeve, was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where doctors could not save her. The keen sportswoman had a 'floppy valve' due to a heart condition but lived an active life and had shown no signs of ill health before the incident. She was a Brownie leader in Guiting Power, a keen cyclist and had recently taken up salsa dancing. Her mother added: 'She'd had regular check-ups and everything was fine. 'She was fun-loving. She was very keen on fitness. She cycled everywhere and went running with me. We're all runners in the family. 'I don't think many people probably knew about her heart condition, because it didn't restrict her. 'Never once was it a problem for her. It was a complete shock.' Ms Rozier was a Brownie leader in Guiting Power, a keen cyclist and had recently taken up salsa dancing . Her father Edward, 54, said: 'It was all so surreal until we went through and saw Jemma. We went through the motions but it just didn't seem real.' Jemma leaves behind her younger sister, Natalie, 25, who recently returned from a 13-month trip around Australia, New Zealand and America. Natalie, a fitness instructor, said: 'She meant the world to me. We were best friends as well as sisters.' Jemma's funeral takes place 2.30pm Friday March 27 at St Michael's Church in Guiting Power. Ms Rozier was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where doctors  battled in vain to save her . The mitral valve separates the upper left heart chamber from the lower left heart chamber, and helps control blood flow through the heart. During each heartbeat the smaller upper chambers of the heart contract to push blood into the larger lower chambers. The mitral valve opens to allow this passage of blood from the left atrium, and closes when the left ventricle is full of blood, to prevent backflow. When the valve closes, its two leaflets (flaps) normally seal the valve shut. Tendons attached to these flaps keep them taut and prevent them collapsing through to the other side. Problems with the mitral valve can make the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body. Severe problems can lead to heart failure - which is where the heart can no longer pump enough blood around the body if the valve is not surgically repaired or replaced. There are three main types of problem: . - Mitral regurgitation (also called 'mitral incompetence') – where there is a backflow of blood through the valve, often as a result of a problem called mitral valve prolapse . - Mitral stenosis – where the valve doesn't open as wide as it should, restricting blood flow . - Mitral valve prolapse - where one or more of the mitral flaps are floppy and don't close tightly, often leading to backflow of blood . These conditions can each occur alone or in combination. Source: NHS conditions .","Jemma Rozier, 28, suffered a fatal heart attack while driving to a party .

She said: 'My youngest daughter was the first one to see it and she said there is a 1 and a 2 on his forehead. 'We did not worry about it, his doctor said it will fade as he gets older.' According to NHS Choices, birthmarks come in two main categories, vascular or pigmented. Vascular birthmarks tend to occur in the head or neck area, being caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin, which can fade after a few months. In comparison, pigmented birthmarks are tan or brown-coloured, caused by a cluster of pigment cells. Most birthmarks are harmless and don't need to be treated.","Little Hanru van Niekerk was born with the number 12 on his forehead .

Adam Smith was the former CFO of an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, before he was fired after posting a video of himself berating a Chick-fil-A employee for the fast-food chain's anti-gay marriage stance . Three years later from the viral video that shook his life from riches to rags, the married father of four is still searching for a job (Smith above with his family) At the time he was working as CFO for Vante, Smith was earning $200,000 annually and had more than $1million in stock options, but he said it was all taken from him when he was fired. His 2012 firing was reported on the same day as the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day as thousands of gay couples flocked to restaurants to kiss during the summer of 2012. Things were looking rough for Smith and his wife, Amy, along with their four sons after they lost their home and moved into an RV. But there was silver lining for him and the chance for a new start when he was offered a new job as a CFO in Portland a few months later. 'I felt like, ""yeah, I got it. I am back'',' he said. However, nearly two weeks later, he was fired once again after his boss realized he was the man from the video. In the 2012 video that went viral, he told Chick-fil-A employee Rachel Elizabeth while at the drive-thru window that he did not know how she lived with herself and worked there . Smith posted a follow-up video apologizing to Elizabeth (above) which she accepted . As the incident continues to haunt him, he said he does not regret the stand he took but he regrets the way he spoke to Elizabeth. While Smith is unsure if the incident will ever go away, he has turned to meditation, and has written a memoir, A Million Dollar Cup of Water: Discovering the Wealth in Authenticity. The controversy surrounding one of America's biggest fast-food chains began in 2012 after a series of anti-same sex marriage statements from Chick-fil-A's COO Dan T. Cathy. Local media had previously reported that the company, founded in 1946 by Cathy’s father, S. Truett Cathy, sponsored several organisations and group which actively oppose LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A donated more than $3million between 2003 and 2009 to Christian organizations with a well-known anti-gay agenda, and in 2010 alone Chick-fil-A gave nearly $2million to such causes, according to reports. In June and July 2012, Dan Cathy made several statements against gay marriage. When asked about Chick-fil-A’s backing of ‘traditional’ families with a husband and wife, Cathy responded 'Well, guilty as charged’. He also stated that Chick-fil-A is runs on 'traditional Christian values' and is 'very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit'. In response, gay rights protesters launched nationwide boycotts and staged same-sex 'kiss-ins' at Chick-fil-A stores across the country. The book tells of how his backlash from the public took him from riches to rags, to 'true wealth'. In job interviews Smith is honest about the video, he said, but he thinks employers are scared to hire him because they think it could possibly reoccur again. In the original video posted three years ago, Smith waits in line for a free promotional water at a Chick-fil-A before expressing his disdain for the firm's support for traditional Christian marriage. Filmed by Smith on his own phone, the former CFO gets to the window of the drive-thru and starts to all-out bully the young female employee behind the counter, who remains calm and polite throughout the whole exchange. He said: 'I don't know how you live with yourself and work here. I don't understand it. This is a horrible corporation with horrible values.' Elizabeth tells him repeatedly to have a nice day and that it is a pleasure to serve him as well as saying: 'I'm staying neutral on this subject. My personal beliefs don't belong in the workplace.' As he drives off he tells the worker: 'I'm a nice guy by the way, and I'm totally heterosexual. Just can't stand the hate. It's gotta stop guys, stand up.' Once he posted the video and went back to work, he said his employees were shocked. Smith told 20/20: 'I got into work and the receptionist, the first thing, big eyes, 'Adam, what did you do?', she said. 'The voicemail is completely full, and it's full of bomb threats.'' After the video went viral, according to a MarketWire statement, Smith was fired from his job at Vante, Inc. They released a statement saying: 'The actions of Mr Smith do not reflect our corporate values in any manner. Vante is an equal opportunity company with a diverse workforce, which holds diverse opinions. In his apology video, Smith told Elizabeth he was sorry for the way he spoke to her and that she handled the situation with dignity and grace . Wanda Flory, of Swanton, Ohio, center, watches with Terry, (left), and her husband Richard, (center right), as Thea Grabiec, (right), kisses Sarah Shovan during the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day . Smith also told Elizabeth in his apology video that he was angry by the number of people who were supporting Chick-fil-A during the Appreciation Day and became unraveled . 'We respect the right of our employees and all Americans to hold and express their personal opinions, however, we also expect our company officers to behave in a manner commensurate with their position and in a respectful fashion that conveys these values of civility with others.' After losing his job at Vante, Smith removed his original video from YouTube and posted an eight-minute video apology to Elizabeth. 'I am so very sorry for the way I spoke to you,' said Smith in the video. 'You handled my frustrating rant with such dignity and composure. 'Every time I watch the video I am blown away by really the beauty in what you did, and your kindness, and your patience with me.' Smith explained that he was enraged by the number of people that had come out to support the chicken fast-food firm during last weeks 'Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day' and lost his cool. Shown Smith's apology by an anchor on Fox News at the time, Elizabeth accepted it. She said: 'I do forgive him. I think he realizes how bad it was to make that tape. 'I feel sorry for him and his family, and for everything that has happened to him since.'","Adam Mark Smith, 37, was publicly shamed after posting the video of himself berating a Chick-fil-A employee .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has been said to have had a miserable demeanour of late at Real Madrid, but the current Ballon d'Or holder was all smiles while on international duty on Thursday. Ronaldo showed his jovial side as he played a prank on Portugal team-mate Ricardo Quaresma - in a move that would have taken a lot of time and effort. The 30-year-old took to Instagram later that afternoon to show off the artwork of his stunt - as he redesigned Quaresma's car with tinfoil into the style of his Nike Mercurial Superfly CR7 football boots. Cristiano Ronaldo took to Instagram to showcase his car prank on Portugal team-mate Ricardo Quaresma . Ronaldo re-designed Quaresma's car into the style of his Nike Mercurial Superfly CR7 football boots . Ronaldo was wearing his signature model  boots during Portugal's training session on Thursday . Accompanied with the caption: 'Did you see what I did to @RicardoQuaresmaOficial's car on @nikefootball’s Snapchat?! And yes Quaresma, it’s still funny!!,' the devastating forward was grinning from ear-to-ear as he holds one of his trademark boots alongside the car. The prank didn't seem to sit too well with Quaresma, however. He posted on Instagram: 'Seriously @cristiano ?! My newly redesigned CR7 #Mercurial car on @nikefootball's snapchat.' Portugal coach Fernando Santos will be hoping his two forwards can let the prank slide and get things back on track as the Iberian nation prepares to host Serbia in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday night. Victory for Portugal in Lisbon would stretch their gap over Serbia to eight points after four matches. Santos' men currently sit second in Group I on six points - just one behind leaders Denmark who have played a game more.

"The Premier League can easily accommodate an initiative to limit away fans tickets at £20 to protect the 'spectacle' of their product, according to the chief executive of the Football Supporters' Federation Kevin Miles. Chairmen of English football's 20 elite clubs met in central London on Wednesday for the first time since the bumper new £5.14billion television broadcasting deal was announced. The FSF presented an open letter to the chairmen, which was co-signed by fan groups from every Premier League club, detailing what it believes are key elements to such as the cost of attending live matches, facilities for away fans, more supporter engagement as well a fairer distribution of football's wealth throughout the domestic game and grassroots. Football Supporters' Federation campaigners demonstrate outside the meeting of Premier League chairmen . Ticket prices have long been a thorny issue within the modern game, particularly for the away supporters, who often feel they are not being given a fair price especially those of the leading clubs. A recent survey by the FSF showed the likes of Arsenal's top price for visiting supporters was £64, QPR charged £55 while Sunderland were cheapest at £39. Crystal Palace charged both home and away fans £40 at Selhurst Park. FSF chief executive Miles believes making such a gesture would not only show a level of good will to paying customers, but also maintain the unique live atmosphere which makes the Premier League such an attractive proposition. The FSF's Chief Executive, Kevin Miles, speaks during the 'Share TV Wealth' demonstration . 'The uplift on domestic television rights alone, not including the overseas deal, is the equivalent of more than £40 for every single ticket sold at each game over the three years, so that gives you an idea of how much manoeuvre the clubs have got - and with that much money going into the game, how they could afford to treat people a lot better,' Miles said. 'The Premier League has already set one or two precedents, there are already rules to benefit away fans, like how many seats they have to allocate in the stadium and how they cannot charge away fans more than the home fans for similar accommodation. 'They also ring-fence money via the ""Away Fans Initiative"" to be invested into increasing numbers of away fans. 'What we are proposing out of this huge increase in money is they increase the amount of money involved.' The FSF have argued that away fans should get in to Premier League games for £20 pounds at every ground . Miles continued: 'Our ""Twenty's Plenty"" idea to be implemented, we believe would cost the clubs around £20million a season, which is £1million per club, then talk to the fans about how they want that money used, it could make a huge difference to the experience of away support. 'They could make this contribution easily and relatively cheaply, to guarantee the atmosphere with participation of away fans to keep their numbers up, which have declined over the last 10 years and that is something which needs to be addressed.' Miles believes any moves to increase the travelling supporters at all Premier League stadia could only have a positive impact. The Premier League's new £5.1billion TV rights deal is set to increase the cost of sponsorship . 'Part of the reason the Premier League is able to generate so much money for the television rights is precisely because of the whole atmosphere and spectacle. It would be short-sighted to think it is just all about what happens on the pitch,' he said. 'The battle is sometimes you have to convince the clubs that it is in their best interest as well as ours, and stress the importance of what fans contribute to what they are selling. 'The Premier League did a survey of television audiences in Thailand when they were looking at overseas matches, what they found was actually fans did not want to see Manchester United against Liverpool in Bangkok, they would love the chance to go to Anfield or Old Trafford to witness the real thing. 'So there are signs the Premier League are starting to look at these things and recognise the importance of it.' Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has spoken about ticket costs in the wake of the deal .","Football Supporters' Federation calls on Premier League to regulate prices .

"Arsenal are eyeing up a move for Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus to replace Theo Walcott. The England winger risked irking Arsene Wenger by claiming talks over a new deal have not started, despite the Gunners boss repeatedly stating the opposite. Wenger confirmed the club's intention to offer Walcott a new contract in February and when asked about whether talks had started on March 13, the Gunners boss replied: 'The first contacts have been made and we will see how that progresses.' However, Walcott, who currently earns £90,000-per-week, took to Twitter  to contradict his manager. Arsenal are already looking at potential replacements for Theo Walcott, as his contract comes to an end . Walcott has not completed 90 minutes for his club since January 2014, and wants over £100,000 a week . Walcott has only recently returned from injury and is struggling to hold down a regular first-team place . In response to TV reports that he had been involved in a training-ground bust-up with Wenger, Walcott tweeted: 'I don't normally comment on false stories about myself but reports about contract demands and bust-ups with the boss are complete nonsense. 'There have been no contract talks as yet and my current focus is not on contracts but on doing my best for Arsenal FC.' Walcott's tweet made for an intriguing twist in what is already turning out to be another uncomfortable contract extension saga between Arsenal and the England international. The 26-year-old wants north of £100,000-per-week to sign a new contract at the Emirates Stadium. Given he is not a first-team regular, the Arsenal hierarchy are showing a reluctance to meet Walcott's pay demands. Likewise, Walcott is growing increasingly frustrated at his lack of game time since returning from a long-term knee injury. Walcott goes through his paces alongside fellow Arsenal and England star Kieran Gibbs on Thursday . Walcott, who is out of contract at the Emirates stadium next summer, trains alongside Harry Kane . The England winger took to social media to deny the claims that he and Arsene Wenger had fallen out . Walcott enters the final year of his contract at the end of the season and the Gunners will consider cashing in on the speedster in the summer, for a fee of around £15million, to avoid losing him for nothing in 2016. And Sportsmail understands the club have already started identifying targets to replace Walcott if the contract stand-off cannot be resolved. Dortmund forward Reus will lead the list of candidates to fill Walcott's shoes if he leaves north London this summer. Theo Walcott has denied a bust-up with Arsenal over his new contract negotiations . Arsenal could turn their attentions back to Marco Reus if Walcott were to leave in the summer . Reus, who scored for Germany against Australia on Wednesday, has long been a favourite of Wenger . The Gunners failed in an attempt to sign the Germany international last summer, but retain a strong interest. The club's global network of spies have been instructed to pinpoint potential candidates should Walcott leave. Given Walcott's speed, Arsenal scouts are paying particular attention to pacy players as they scour the world for his replacement. Walcott will not be short of offers should he leave ahead of next season. Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United are all monitoring Walcott's talks with a view to making a move.","Theo Walcott wants more than £100,000-a-week to extend his contract .

"Brazil came from behind to see off France in a friendly at the Stade de France, with goals from Chelsea midfielder Oscar, Barcelona forward Neymar, and Wolfsburg defensive midfielder Luis Gustavo. France had taken the lead through a Raphael Varane header, and looked to be in total control before Oscar's well-worked equaliser, but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half, and could have scored more as the game wore on. Neymar who already had 42 goals for his country before this game, made it 43, firing past Steve Mandanda from an angle which will have disappointed the French keeper, before Luis Gustavo was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner. CLICK HERE TO READ THE MATCH REPORT IN FULL . Host commentator . And that's it. Brazil come from behind in style to seal a 3-1 win against France and gain a tiny bit of revenge for their World Cup final defeat 17 years ago. Raphael Varane gave the hosts the lead with a powerful header but strikes from Oscar, Neymar and Luis Gustavo secured a deserved victory for Dunga's men. The Real Madrid man gets up and limps back but it looks like he's OK. Brazil's subs still working hard to close down France every time they get the ball. They've seen this out well. Fernandinho replaces goalscorer Gustavo with just added time remaining. Four minutes extra to be played. And off goes Firmino after a bit of discussion. Almost a debut to remember for Fekir as he picks the ball up on the edge of the box, creates some space and gets a low shot away which flashes just wide. Souza replaces Oscar. Schneiderlin bursts down the left and goes down after being clipped by Danilo. The Southampton man wants a free-kick but the referee isn't having it. Goal kick. Douglas Costa comes on for Willian and Giroud replaces Matuidi. Payet replaces Valbuena with just under 10 minutes to play. Neymar skips away from Schneiderlin, drives towards goal but blasts his shot high and wide from a little over 20 yards. To be fair to him the ball appeared to bobble as he struck it. Kondogbia replaces Sissoko and Fekir comes on for Griezmann. And there's number three! Gustavo gets away from his marker and heads the corner beyond Mandanda and into the corner. Awful defending but Brazil probably deserve a two-goal cushion. The visitors move up the pitch at speed with Willian and Neymar both involved. The Barca man picks out Oscar and his curled shot forces Mandanda into a diving save to his left. Corner for Brazil. Some neat skill and a long-range shot from Griezmann forces Jefferson into a fingertip save - possibly his best of the game. Valbuena delivers another good corner but Brazil deal with it. Within a minute of Varane's miss - with a Jefferson save from Sissoko sandwiched in between - Benzema misses a sitter. A deep cross found the Real Madrid man unmarked at the back post but he leant back and volleyed well over the bar. It really hasn't been his night so far. Another dangerous free-kick from France goes all the way through to Varane but he doesn't connect with his shot properly and the ball rolls harmlessly wide. Told you they were starting to play! Willian is involved again and he drives down the middle before laying in Neymar on the left. The Barcelona man takes a couple of touches before lashing the ball high into the net from an acute angle. Brazil starting to play with some style now. They work the ball around France's half before Willian tries to play a killer ball to Neymar. France clear for a corner which Silva almost converts. Sakho loses his footing and Brazil pick up the ball in a dangerous area. It's played into the centre and Gustavo strikes a low shot from about 20 yards which Mandanda does well to save. This time Valbuena picks up possession on the left side of Brazil's box. He makes himself some space and tries to pick out Benzema but his cross is poor and Jefferson claims again. Sissoko bursts through midfield and is brought down by Elias 45 yards from goal. Valbuena curls the free-kick into the area but it goes all the way through to Jefferson. France get the second period underway. How many substitutions we will see in the second half? I'm going for 10. France are struggling to get hold of the ball as the first half draws to a close. Willian combines with Danilo but the right back's pass inside is poor and France clear the danger. Lovely goal. Oscar picks up the ball on the left, plays it inside to Firmino and drives into the box looking for the return. The Hoffenheim man prods it into his path and Oscar produces a low finish with his first touch. Game on. Willian runs on to a pass down Brazil's right, takes a touch and delivers a cross. Brazil are lacking a physical presence up-front and it's obvious here as Mandanda claims under no pressure whatsoever. Firmino picks up the ball in a central area and drives forward. He makes some progress but is eventually crowded out and loses possession on the edge of France's area. Firmino certainly isn't afraid to have a go from distance. This time he picks the ball up about 25 yards from goal and forces Mandanda into a decent save low to his right. Neymar takes the resulting corner but France clear up. ...but this time Brazil just about deal with it. Sakho got up to meet it but his header looped up and into the hands of Jefferson. Brazil now have a free-kick inside France's half after a foul on Neymar... Elias finds some space 25 yards from goal but his shot is high and wide. Should've got his head up and picked a pass, there. France take the lead! Another inswinging corner from Valbuena is met powerfully by Varane and his header flies into the bottom corner. Nobody on either post for Brazil. First real chance of the game for Brazil. Neymar receives a pass just inside the area, uses a defender as a shield and attempts to pass the ball into the bottom corner. Mandanda is equal to it though, palming the ball away. Another mini spell of possession for Brazil but it ends when Oscar inexplicably fires a long pass across the pitch to absolutely nobody. Poor challenge from Filipe Luis, who scythes down the little midfielder from behind. The Chelsea man escapes a booking, probably because it's a friendly. Neymar closes down France's defence and makes an interception but the ball gets away from him and the hosts survive a scare. The visitors are starting to get on the ball a bit more now. Neymar drops deep to pick up possession but he's eventually crowded out and loses the ball in a dangerous area. Moments later Firmino finds some space on the edge of France's box but his low strike is blocked. Valbuena whips in a corner which falls to Benzema just a few yards from goal. The Real Madrid was completely unmarked but he couldn't direct his header past Jefferson, who palmed his effort away and hurt himself in the process. France should have the lead. Lighting run from Willian down the right. The Chelsea man gets past one opponent but a brilliant sliding tackle from Schneiderlin takes the ball away from him. Willian appeared to catch Blaise Matuidi but it's the Brazilian who is left on the turf. No need for treatment and he's back in the game after being helped to his feet. Brazil haven't had possession since Neymar lost his footing - and the ball - inside the first minute. Bacary Sagna and Raphael Varane both involved early on but no chances yet. Brazil get us underway at the Stade de France. France, Brazil and everyone inside the stadium take part in a minute of silence in respect to those who lost their lives in the Germanwings plane crash this week. Perfectly observed. Both sets of players are out on the pitch and lined up for the national anthems. The stadium appears pretty packed considering it's a friendly - looks like Brazil still have plenty of pulling power despite that defeat to Germany last summer. Four minutes until kick-off. Martha Kelner: The conclusion of a football match, particularly monumental ones like the World Cup final, often brings new debate and inquiry, questions about players, tactics and refereeing decisions. Very rarely do they result in a government investigation. Yet that is exactly what happened after Brazil's capitulation in the 1998 final against hosts France. Quite what transpired in the hours before the match, particularly with star player Ronaldo who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick-off, is one of football's most enduring mysteries.

Kieran Gill: The way the unofficial World Cup final works is not unlike a game of conkers, where winner takes all until your next match in an all-or-nothing scenario. Brazil have held the unofficial title since October 11, when they beat Argentina 2-0 in Beijing, China, and have a chance to chase Scotland at the top of the unofficial World Cup ranking table. They have some way to go, however, as Scotland sit top with 86 points, ahead of England on 73. CLICK HERE to read more. Sam Cunningham: Brazil responded to World Cup humiliation, shipping 10 goals in their final two games, by bringing back one of their grittiest former captains. Dunga was handed the responsibility of rebuilding a fallen team from the ashes of a 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany and 3-0 loss at the hands of Holland. His appointment was a controversial one among Brazil supporters, having guided his country in a lacklustre 2010 World Cup before he was sacked the last time. CLICK HERE to read more.

"On Wednesday Sportsmail published its forensic study to finally settle one of football's great debates - which is the biggest club in England? Our exclusive table ranked the top 50 teams from the 59 who have played in the top flight for six categories: crowds, global fanbase, trophies, league finish, player quality and income. Manchester United came out on top followed by Arsenal and then Liverpool. Former Liverpool captain Phil Thompson and Newcastle legend Bobby Moncur have their say on our findings. INSIDE BY PHIL THOMPSON (EX-LIVERPOOL CAPTAIN) Arsenal bigger than Liverpool? I’m sure my old mates Charlie Nicholas and Paul Merson will be delighted about that one and they will be looking forward to the chance to rub my big nose in it. Needless to say, it is not a view with which I would agree. But this is not me, as former Liverpool captain and dyed-in-the-wool lifelong supporter, being biased. I’m basing my argument on what I have seen from travelling the world over many years. Phil Thompson parades the trophy after their 1-0 victory over Real Madrid to win the 1981 European Cup . Thompson lifts the trophy above his head as his team-mates celebrate beside him after the 1981 final . Thompson says Paul Merson (left) would rub his nose in it after Arsenal were ranked as a bigger club . Frank McLintock, George Graham and Charlie George celebrate as Arsenal complete the Double in 1971 . Liverpool have always been trailblazers. I remember in the early 1980s, our squad went to the Far East and played exhibition games in Bangkok and Hong Kong. The reaction was like nothing we had ever seen. It was a frenzy. It was the same when we went to Israel, Swaziland or some of the states in the Gulf. Liverpool were the dominant team in the game in that era and people were desperate to see us. But, over the course of the next 30 years, as football’s popularity has mushroomed, interest in Liverpool has continued to grow. In the summer of 2011, for instance, I was in Kuala Lumpur doing some ambassadorial work for the club during the pre-season tour. One night, an open training session was staged in Bukit Jalil, Malaysia’s national stadium, and 40,000 fans turned up to watch. Malaysian supporters cheer for Liverpool during the summer tour in 2011 . Thompson attends a press conference during the Liverpool legends tour of South Africa in 2013 . Arsenal ended a ten-year trophy drought by coming back to beat Hull in a memorable FA Cup final last May . The reception was phenomenal — and this was just to watch the squad doing some jogging and shooting practice. A couple of years later, I was part of a legends squad that went to tour South Africa. We played one match in the World Cup stadium in Durban and more 30,000 fans turned up. They hadn’t just come from Durban, however; they had come from all over the country. That is the draw Liverpool’s name has. Now I have great respect for Arsenal. Since moving into the Emirates Stadium in 2006, I can see why they have ticked a lot of the boxes in the survey. Liverpool’s capacity, after all, is 45,000. Arsenal, meanwhile, seem to have 60,000 for each home game, even when you can see gaps in the stands. But, seriously, what I think separates Liverpool — and Manchester United, for that matter — from the rest is history and heritage. You can talk about Facebook ‘likes’ and Twitter followers but what really matters are the trophies you win and the memories you create. Thompson lifts the League Cup trophy onto his head after Liverpool beat West Ham in the 1981 final . Thompson lifts the European Cup in 1981 as Liverpool won the competition three times in five years . It is why when you go to Scandinavia and Ireland, for example, the only clubs people will talk to you about are Liverpool and United; very seldom will you hear Real Madrid and Barcelona — never mind Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea — being mentioned. Liverpool and United dominate these strongholds because, between them, they dominated five decades. Young fans growing up in the 1960s would have seen the United team of Best, Charlton and Law or the side Bill Shankly was building at Anfield. We went on to enjoy incredible success in the 1970s and 1980s, United had a similar spell in the 1990s and 2000s. Those around the world who have grown up with success will have passed their affinities on to their children and that is where the respective huge fan bases have come from. Liverpool came out on top for most trophies won, and Thompson says that is what matters most . Thompson (back row second left) poses with the 1977-87 Liverpool team . Sportsmail's extensive study found that Manchester United are England's biggest club with Arsenal and Liverpool second at third respectively . Of course, there will be changes in the coming years. For starters, fans in south east Asia can follow trends, and teams that are doing well — as City and Chelsea have been — will attract more interest, while Arsenal are certainly up and coming in that region. When all is said and done, though, those clubs cannot yet match the deep-rooted affinities that so many have for Liverpool, which have come from those glorious nights when we won European Cups and countless other trophies. Things have changed in the Sky era and I understand the business side of football and how important it is to make full use of commercial opportunities, such as selling shirts and bringing in extra revenue with big sponsorship deals. Yet the key to it all is having great players and being involved in the games that matter the most. That, more than anything, is what defines how big a club is — and Liverpool’s list of honours speaks for itself. WHY CITY DESERVE TO BE FIFTH . Newcastle United legend Bobby Moncur maintains that teams deserve the ‘big club’ tag by winning trophies. Commenting on the study in Thursday's Sportsmail, Moncur said the rankings of Chelsea (4th) and Manchester City (5th) in the ‘big clubs’ league table were justified despite owners splashing hundreds of millions of pounds in recent years. Newcastle were listed ninth in our findings, one place above rivals Sunderland, who Moncur later joined. Vincent Kompany celebrates with the Manchester City squad as they are crowned Premier League champions . Manchester City are jubilant after winning their second Premier League title in three years in 2014 . But rather than claim the North-East clubs — with their loyal and sizeable fanbase — should reside above the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City, Moncur said: ‘For me, a big club is one that wins trophies.’ Moncur, the last man to lift a trophy for the Magpies when they won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969, added: ‘If you were ranking Newcastle on supporters alone I’d have them in the top three.

"Brazil battled back from a goal down to beat France 3-1 in Thursday's international friendly at the Stade de France. The hosts took an early lead thanks to Raphael Varane's thumping header but were pegged back thanks to goals from Oscar, Neymar and Luiz Gustavo. Here Sportsmail's Luke Augustus provides his player ratings from the clash in Paris. FRANCE (4-3-3) Steve Mandanda - 6.5 . Made good saves from Neymar, Roberto Firmino and Luiz Gustavo - and could do little about the former's brilliant goal, even if he was beaten at his near post. Bacary Sagna - 5.5 .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho insists John Terry's 12-month contract extension is not a sentimental gesture after the club confirmed their captain's new deal on Thursday. The 34-year-old central defender has penned fresh terms, worth in the region of £150,000 per week, which expire at the end of next season after another sterling campaign for the Stamford Bridge club. The new deal does not include an option for a further year, but the Barclays Premier League leaders will provide Terry with another extension next season if he continues to play regularly. Chelsea captain John Terry has signed a new contract keeping him at the club until the end of next season . The Blues centre back has signed a new contract worth £150,000 - the same terms as his previous deal . Terry has made 661 appearances for Chelsea in an illustrious 17-year career at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho said earlier this year that there would be no issues regarding a new deal for Terry, and the Portuguese proved true to his word after Chelsea announced the news on Thursday. Mourinho said: 'This new contract is not to say, ""Thank you very much"". It is because John continues to perform. He is a top defender. I am happy that he completely deserves this new contract after a season where he has already played 40 matches.' Terry, who has made 661 appearances for Chelsea since making his debut in 1998 — scoring a club-record 63 goals for a defender — is on course to secure his fourth Premier League title this season to add to the success in the Capital One Cup earlier this month. He said: 'I'm delighted to have signed an extension to my contract with Chelsea. 'After adding another major trophy to my collection this month I hope myself, the players and manager can continue to bring success to our club. Terry has won 13 major honours at Stamford Bridge since making his debut at the club in 1998 . The 34-year-old will be hoping to add to that tally of silverware with the Premier League title this season . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho celebrates winning the Capital One Cup earlier this month with Terry . 'Playing for this great club makes me so proud. And as always I would like to thank the fans who have continually supported me.' Terry's big-money new deal is a far cry from his days as a trainee. He revealed he used to warm the toilet seat for senior professionals during his time in the academy. 'I'd do anything for them,' Terry said. 'I'd make their teas and coffees, even silly things like sit on the toilet to make the seat warm for them in the cold winter days at the training ground. 'It's bizarre when you think about it but that was part of growing up.' After signing the new deal Terry hopes to stay at Chelsea for some time to come. Terry appeared to be being phased out at Chelsea under Mourinho's predecessor Rafael Benitez . The Blues defender  has since been revitalised since Mourinho returned at the start of last season . Terry told Chelsea TV: 'It's been a great couple of years for me. My form has been good and I've earned the contract, so I'm delighted to stay for another year. And hopefully there could be a few more years after this.' The central defender, who has retired from England duty, lifted the Capital One Cup with Chelsea on March 1 - his 13th major honour with the Blues - and hopes to add the Premier League title. Chelsea entered the international break with a six-point advantage over nearest rivals Manchester City and with a game in hand. As well as three Premier League titles - Terry has won the Champions League with Chelsea . 'Hopefully there's many more (trophies),' Terry added. 'That's a massive part of why I'm staying. I want to win trophies. I want to remain in the side, of course, and for me to get to 14 (trophies), 15, that's my target. 'We're very close at the moment. We still need to get over the line. It's going to be tough. The Hull game (a 3-2 win last weekend) showed how tough it's going to be. 'To get that big one at the end of the season would be fantastic. Then we can regroup and go again next year. I'm delighted to be here and hopefully there's going to be many more.'","John Terry has made 661 appearances for Chelsea in an illustrious career .

"Brazil came from behind to see off France in a friendly at the Stade de France, with goals from Oscar, Neymar, and Luis Gustavo. France had taken the lead through a Raphael Varane header, and looked to be in total control before Chelsea star Oscar's well-worked equaliser, but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half, and could have scored more as the game wore on. Barcelona's Neymar who already had 42 goals for his country before this game, made it 43, firing past Steve Mandanda from an angle which will have disappointed the French keeper, before Wolfsburg defensive midfielder Luis Gustavo was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner.

Goals: Oscar 40, Neymar 57, Luiz Gustavo 69 . Referee: Nicola Rizzoli (Italy) France, on the other hand, threatened most from set pieces, and Karim Benzema, Moussa Sissoko and Varane could easily have added further goals for the hosts, as Brazil looked panicky whenever a decent cross arrived in their box. As tends to be the way with such friendlies, there was no great intensity to the play, but, in flashes there was real quality, and Oscar's equaliser epitomised that. The Chelsea man, operating from the left, played a lovely one-two with Roberto Firmino before arriving fractions ahead of a defender to poke past Mandanda. You might say it was a goal worthy of a World Cup final, but, 17 years after these two sides contested one on the same ground, it had to make do with turning the tide in a friendly. France had actually started the brighter, and should have been ahead after just eight minutes, Karim Benzema denied by a brilliant save from Jefferson, but he really should have scored his header from three yards. Brazil, with Manchester United target Firmino playing up front alongside talismanic captain Neymar, failed to find their best play early on, limited for the most part to long shots. Firmino in particular was keen to get a strike away from range, but while he twice worked Mandanda with powerful drives, neither could seriously have been said to overstretch the Marseille stopper. Indeed, while Mandanda made several flashy saves throughout the game, denying Luis Gustavo, Willian and Oscar in the second half, he was rarely able to stop efforts that came from within his side's eighteen-yard box. Neymar, oscillating between the subtle touches we are used to seeing from him and a clear inability to cope with the slippery surface, should really have been the first to fire past the France keeper, after Oscar had capitalised on a mistake from Morgan Schneiderlin, but having squared up Varane, his shot lacked power and direction. Neymar, of Barcelona, battles with PSG's Blaise Matuidi as Brazil struggled to find their best play in a tight first half . Southampton star Morgan Schneiderlin, operating at the base of the France midfield, holds of Felipe Luis of Chelsea and Elias . Oscar gets a shot away in front of Schneiderlin, but for the most part Brazil were limited to efforts from range, without breaking France down . Mathieu Valbeuna, whose corner led to France's opening goal, takes on Chelsea left back Felipe Luis during the friendly match . Just moments later he was punished for his wastefulness, with Varane powering home a header that sparked comparison's to Zinedine Zidane's goal in the 1998 final. In truth it owed much to Patrice Evra blocking off defenders, and the majority of the Brazilians standing still as Mathieu Valbuena's corner came over, but the Real Madrid centre back still did well to direct his header into the far corner. But France were never able to fully capitalise on Brazilian frailties again, Varane failing to poke home after a free kick, and Benzema blazing over the bar. Debutant Nabil Fekir came closest from open play after coming off the bench, but sent his shot just wide. Jefferson, who had earlier made a good save from Karim Benzema following another set piece, cannot stop Varane's header finding the corner . Despite having plenty of defenders in the box, Brazil were unable to stop Varane getting a clean header on the ball to open the scoring . As the almost obligatory substitutions poured off the bench the game lost momentum, but for Dunga, there were real signs of encouragement. Brazil were always dangerous on the counter attack, with Willian a particular danger, and, set pieces aside, they looked solid defensively. This was not the free flowing football that Brazilian sides are famed for, but, for the second time under Dunga, Brazil look tough to beat.

"Just moments before England’s final training session on Thurday, Theo Walcott’s frustrations with life on the fringes of the game surfaced on social media. In short, he snapped. Walcott responded to a claim by former Arsenal left back Nigel Winterburn that the winger has been involved in a heated argument with his club manager Arsene Wenger. ‘I don’t normally comment on false stories about myself but reports about contract demands and bust-ups with the boss are complete nonsense,’ he tweeted. Theo Walcott has denied a bust-up with Arsenal over his new contract negotiations . The England winger took to social media to deny the claims that he and Arsene Wenger had fallen out . Walcott, who is out of contract at the Emirates stadium next summer, trains alongside Harry Kane . Clearly, this is a delicate issue. Walcott then went on to contradict his manager’s claim that contract negotiations, aimed at extending his £90,000-a-week deal beyond 2016, had started. ‘There have been no talks,’ he insisted. Walcott’s star has fallen for club and country. He has been unable to consistently force his way into Arsenal’s starting line-up since his recovery from a long-term knee- ligament injury. Although Wenger publicly maintains that he wants Walcott, 26, to sign a contract extension, Arsenal will listen to offers in the summer if they cannot agree terms. Walcott goes through his paces alongside fellow Arsenal and England star Kieran Gibbs on Thursday . There is a lingering suspicion at the Emirates that his agent has already been tapped, given the nod that another English team will give Walcott the cash, the contract and the playing time to satisfy him. This time, Arsenal are prepared to listen. Walcott has not played a full 90 minutes for Arsenal this season and he cannot realistically expect to win a place in a congested, fully fit squad ahead of Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain or Danny Welbeck. Despite yesterday’s denial, his frustration with life on the substitutes’ bench is well known. Roy Hodgson, England’s manager, called it a ‘dog eat dog world’ yesterday, admitting that Walcott had little chance of getting into the national team if he is not playing regularly for Arsenal. Walcott has only recently returned from injury and is struggling to hold down a regular first-team place . Walcott has not completed 90 minutes for his club since January 2014, and is spending time on the bench . 1 The number of times Walcott has reached 10 Premier League goals in a season. 2 Walcott’s goal involvement from his 10 appearances this season — two goals and no assists. 2 Walcott has provided just two assists in the Champions League over the past six seasons. 0.14 The forward’s goals-per-game ratio in an England shirt. 4 The number of times Walcott has completed 90 minutes in his 36 England appearances. 38.9 Percentage of Walcott’s 131 Premier League starts in which he has played 90 minutes. 60.2 Average minutes played by Walcott per Premier League appearance. 5.2 Average Premier League goals scored per season. Jan 1, 2014: The last time Walcott completed 90 minutes for Arsenal in any competition — a 2-0 home win against Cardiff. Sep 10, 2013: The last time Walcott played for England — a 0-0 draw with Ukraine. On Friday evening at Wembley he will be named among the substitutes after working with the England squad all week in the build-up to the clash with Lithuania. Walcott has missed out a lot of international football over the years. Cruelly discarded by Fabio Capello on the eve of the 2010 World Cup, he missed last year’s tournament in Brazil through injury. He last played for England in the World Cup qualifier with Ukraine in September 2013 and has only just regained a place in the squad after last season’s knee injury. Hodgson said: ‘He’s been very unlucky with injuries. He’s recovering now, and coming back to the Arsenal team in the last couple of months. ‘He’s been with me in my three years without necessarily playing the main figure. Whenever we thought we could use him, he’s got injured again. Crossroads is probably quite a tough term, but it is an important few months for him. ‘You can see he likes to be with England but he has to satisfy a few critics and make certain: a) he stays fit and b) gets his place back as one of the first names on Arsenal’s team sheet. When he does that, he might be pushing (to be) a first name on England’s team sheet.’ On Friday night Walcott misses out again because an established front line — Raheem Sterling, captain Wayne Rooney and Welbeck — have taken England to the top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group. Walcott has made just 13 appearances for Arsenal this season and was heavily criticised when he failed to take his chances in the 3-0 win over West Ham on March 14. Roy Hodgson has told Walcott he needs to be back as one of the first names on Arsenal's team-sheet . Walcott is likely to start from the bench again on Friday when England take on Lithuania at Wembley . Hodgson said: ‘It’s a dog-eat-dog world. There’s always someone waiting to take your place. ‘Sometimes through no fault of your own, you can be injured. But then your position, which had looked very secure, suddenly six months down the line is not so secure. ‘That is something all footballers learn to live with. If you want to be an England player, you’d like to hope that’s an even bigger thing you’d learn to live with. ‘In an ideal world, we’ll have players like Harry Kane coming through on a regular basis, upsetting the applecart and making sure people don’t think their place is secure for ever.’ This is Walcott’s life for the moment, a substitute for club and country as he waits for Arsenal to show their hand this summer. Either that, or they will show the winger the door.","Arsenal forward denies he has had a bust-up with Arsene Wenger .

"One Sunday morning last summer, John Bieniewicz, a referee in the Michigan United Soccer League, showed a player a yellow card for a bad tackle. The player, Bassel Saad, began to shout abuse at him, so Bieniewicz reached for his pocket and prepared to send him off. Before Bieniewicz could dismiss him, Saad felled him with a punch that knocked him unconscious. Bieniewicz died two days later in hospital. On Friday, as Saad’s trial in a Detroit courtroom came to an end, the referee’s widow was determined to do one last thing to honour her dead husband’s memory. Kris Bieniewicz approached the bench as Saad waited to be sentenced and pulled something from her pocket. She stood there and brandished it at her husband’s killer. ‘I would like to serve Mr Saad with the red card that he was entitled to,’ she said. John Bieniewicz's widow, Kris Bieniewicz, addresses the court and holds up a red card to Bassel Saad . Saad (left) will spend at least eight years in prison after killing Bieniewicz with one punch . It sounds almost like a parody, doesn’t it? But it wasn’t. The judge sentenced Saad to eight to 15 years in prison. ‘You’ve come to personify all that’s wrong with the escalation of violence in sports,’ he told him. It was a human tragedy most of all, of course, a tragedy for young children who lost their father and a wife who lost her husband. But it also told a sad and unpalatable tale of the behaviour that is leaving an ugly, ugly stain on football. Tragedies like the one that happened in Michigan are rare but you only had to watch Manchester United–Arsenal and Chelsea-Paris Saint-Germain last week to know that referees are under siege. Many observers still see them as acceptable victims in football’s great passion play. Threatening officials is just part of the game, they say. Anything to get an edge. I listened to some of the Chelsea-PSG game on the radio and the dismay in the voice of Mark Lawrenson as he commented on what he saw was powerful. ‘This is an angry game being played by angry men,’ he said. Bjorn Kuipers was hounded by nine Chelsea players as Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off for a tackle on Oscar . Paris Saint-Germain players also surrounded the Dutch official as tempers threatened to boil over . Let’s be honest about this: it is getting to the point now where if you want to be a referee, only heroes need apply. You will be threatened and you will be ridiculed — on and off the pitch. If you make a decision that meets with the disapproval of a manager who is trying to shift the blame for a poor performance, you will be hounded and you will be abused. If we carry on like this, we’re going to have to start paying referees danger money. You think I’m joking? I’m not. A few years ago, I watched a Sunday league game between two junior teams at Paddington Rec in west London that ended amid some disagreement about whether the referee had blown the final whistle too early. As the referee was walking off, he was kicked by several of the kids, who were in their mid-teens. Proper kicks, too. A few of the players tried to trip the referee up as he headed for the touchline. I asked the kids’ coach why he was tolerating their behaviour. ‘They’re just disappointed,’ he said. Casual intimidation comes with the territory for referees now. It’s part of the deal. It’s getting worse, not better. How have we sunk this low? How have we got to the point where Angel di Maria thinks it is acceptable to chase after Michael Oliver and yank at his shirt? Angel di Maria puts his hands on referee Michael Oliver following his first yellow card for diving . Oliver received plaudits for his swift and stern reaction to Di Maria's display of disrespect . How have we got to the point where it is deemed merely a pragmatic part of the game for Chelsea’s players to fall upon Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers like hungry beasts when they want a decision to go in their favour? How has it got to the point where some seek to justify that kind of behaviour as shrewd or cute or clever? The gist of the defence appears to rest on the morally bankrupt idea that everybody else is doing it so we have to do it, too. It is a dangerous principle. I am uncomfortable with the notion that players should be role models for kids because that is an abrogation of parental responsibility. But it is easy to see how the sight of Premier League players hounding a referee will influence children on a local park to do the same and possibly worse. If there is any hope that things will change, it lies in the reaction of the majority of fans to the epidemic of cheating and bullying that is infesting the game. This is not just about Chelsea or United, by the way. It is not confined to English clubs. Far from it. They were just last week’s worst offenders. After the United-Arsenal game, there was an immediate and protracted outpouring of support for Michael Oliver. He was, indeed, treated like a hero for refusing to tolerate Di Maria grabbing at his shirt despite the angry protestations of United’s players. Di Maria protests his innocence in vain, but the Manchester United playmaker was admirably dealt with . Di Maria trudges off to leave United depleted and facing an FA Cup exit following his tug at Oliver's shirt . It was as if a great wave of relief was flooding over the wider football community that finally someone was standing up for what was right. People pointed out, quite rightly, that Oliver had done a great service to parks referees everywhere. He had made it plain that grabbing a referee should not be tolerated. Something needs to be done to help Oliver and his colleagues. Enforcing a rule where only the captain can talk to the official would be a start. Punishing all dissent, as they do in rugby, would be better. Allowing referees to review contentious decisions with video technology would take the heat out of the situation, too. Better still, let’s stop making excuses for players’ behaviour. Let’s stop defending the intimidation of referees with bogus arguments about how clever it is. Let’s remember where it can lead. ‘Referees are out there on an island with no one to defend them,’ said the widow of John Bieniewicz yesterday. It’s about time we put that right. Sir Peter, friend of the beaten gambler . I listened to an enchanting radio interview last week with the great racing commentator, Sir Peter O’Sullevan, who recently celebrated his 97th birthday. During his conversation with Garry Richardson, Sir Peter explained that he had always tried to avoid levity in his race commentaries because he was aware that many among his audience would be ‘haemorrhaging fiscally’ as they listened. I thought of Sir Peter when I paid my first ever visit to the Cheltenham Festival on Tuesday. Peter O'Sullevan relaxes in the Newbury commentary box in 1997 during his last day working for the BBC . It was a wonderful day in the beautiful sporting amphitheatre below Cleeve Hill and it was a thrill to watch the horsemanship of Ruby Walsh as Willie Mullins’ horses carried all before them. But when the last race had been run, I contemplated a succession of betting slips showing the names of also-rans like Mischievous Milly, Jezki, Vibrato Valtat and L’Ami Serge that had brought me plenty of fiscal haemorrhaging and thought how welcome it would have been to have the commentaries of Sir Peter soothing my losses. When Peter Moores reacts to defeat against Bangladesh by saying he is going to have to ‘look at the data’ and Eoin Morgan says he has ‘no regrets’ about England’s wretched performances in the World Cup, it is hardly surprising that talk of a Kevin Pietersen comeback should gain credence. The World Cup debacle was the latest chapter of Peter Moores' turbulent time as England coach . Let’s not pretend Pietersen’s return would draw a line under the mayhem that has overrun the ECB, though. It would merely mark a new phase in English cricket’s civil war.","John Bieniewicz, a referee in the Michigan United Soccer League, was felled by a punch from Bassel Saad as he prepared to send him off .

"Daniel Sturridge could be out for up to a month after the extent of his hip problem was revealed by England boss Roy Hodgson. The Liverpool striker was injured during last Sunday's game against Manchester United and was forced to pull out of the England squad for Friday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley and the friendly in Italy on Tuesday.

"Roy Hodgson will hand Harry Kane his England debut at Wembley on Friday evening — but the indications are that it will be off the bench.

"Wayne Rooney realised his boxing-in-the-kitchen video might not be quite so easy to shrug off when Coleen caught five-year-old Kai mimicking his father’s knockout goal celebration. ‘My wife went to pick him up from school and saw him doing that in the classroom,’ said Rooney. ‘I’m sure you won’t be seeing that celebration again.’ There will be no repeat if the England captain hits the target in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday and moves ever closer to Sir Bobby Charlton’s goal record. Wayne Rooney says he won't repeat his knockout celebration if he scores for England against Lithuania . Rooney produced the celebration after scoring in Manchester United's 3-0 win over Tottenham on March 15 . The 29-year-old's celebration was in jest to him being floored by by Stoke defender Phil Bardsley at home . Rooney prepares to fall to the floor in reference to the leaked video of the impromptu bout at his family home . Ashley Young (right) laughs as Rooney falls  as part of his humorous boxing celebration at Old Trafford . How Group E stands ahead of Friday's matches . Rooney celebrated scoring for Manchester United against Tottenham earlier this month by falling flat on to his back, a joke aimed at a film of him being floored by Stoke defender Phil Bardsley during an impromptu bout at his home which has since proved the source of much amusement for team-mates. ‘There has been a bit around the place, at United and England training, but you’d expect that, they’re a group of lads,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve always loved boxing. Unfortunately, sometimes it doesn’t go too well. I was caught on the end of a punch. I wasn’t knocked out. ‘I didn’t see it as a big issue. I spoke to the manager, and he didn’t see it as a big issue. I come from a boxing background. I’d have apologised if I felt it was wrong. But for me, that’s been and gone.’ What if he had fallen badly, someone asked. ‘I never, so…’ shrugged Rooney and flashed a smile. Roy Hodgson, seated beside him, smiled too, not about to chastise his skipper, a player who will win his 102nd England cap on Friday. Only eight players have more. As for his pursuit of the goal record, he is only two behind Gary Lineker, three behind Charlton’s 49 and in splendid form for his country. ‘Bobby’s been a great for Manchester United and England,’ said Rooney. ‘I speak to him regularly at the club, especially after games. He gives me great advice, certainly when I was playing midfield because he was an attacking midfielder and he spoke to me about my role. Rooney (right) will be hoping to close in on Sir Bobby Charlton's England goalscoring record on Friday . Rooney currently has 46 goals in 101 appearances for England - just three shy of Charlton's tally . Expected line-ups for Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier . ‘But I don’t want to bring it up with him and say I’m close to beating him. Hopefully one day it will happen, sooner rather than later.’ Louis van Gaal’s experiment with Rooney in midfield seems to be over, brought to an end when Robin van Persie was injured and the United manager ran out of patience with Radamel Falcao. ‘We’re delighted to see him up front again for Manchester United. We’ve always used him as a front player,’ said Hodgson, and Rooney seemed to agree he was back in his natural position while trying not to say anything that might offend Van Gaal. ‘I’m delighted to be up front, scoring goals and helping us win,’ said the 29-year-old, who has four in five for United since Van Persie’s injury and six in six up front for England this season, including two on his last outing, the friendly in Scotland in November. Since then, Harry Kane has exploded into contention with a blaze of goals. Kane has 29 for the season and Hodgson chatted on Thursday with Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino, who watched England work at the Tottenham training ground, near Enfield. ‘He is in sizzling form,’ said Rooney, who made his England debut at 17 and urged supporters to be gentle with the 21-year-old if he makes his debut in front of tonight’s sell-out crowd. ‘Give him room to breathe, rather than smothering him and demanding a lot off him at an early age when he hasn’t played for England yet. He is still in his first season in the Premier League. Let him continue doing what he’s doing. That’s the way to get the best out of him.’ Rooney believes Harry Kane (left) should be allowed room to develop as a player for England . Kane is in the England squad for the first-time in his career after a dazzling season at Tottenham . Daniel Sturridge pulled out of the squad earlier this week with an injury described by Hodgson on Thursday as a ‘small tear’ in a thigh muscle which he ‘couldn’t play though’. The England manager was keen to stress, however, that he considered Raheem Sterling to be among his options up front. Sterling is expected to start and be released after this game, spared Tuesday’s friendly in Italy because he has been nursing a toe injury. James Milner is carrying a knee problem and is also unlikely to play in both games. Ryan Bertrand could be called in. Hodgson’s priority is the competitive fixture, with England expected to win comfortably and extend their 100 per cent record in qualifying Group E against a team ranked 94th in the world. This will count against Kane’s chances of starting, as will Hodgson’s desire to have a genuine striker on the bench, to introduce and lift spirits if all does not go to plan against Lithuania, who will probably operate with limited ambition at Wembley. If it comes down to a straight fight between Welbeck and Kane for the right to partner Rooney, the England captain could always reach for the boxing gloves and lead them to the kitchen.

"The dream of Danish kids hoping to emulate Michael Laudrup and play for Barcelona moved a step closer on Thursday with the announcement of the Spanish club's plans to set up an academy near Copenhagen. Allan Simonsen, who became the first Dane to represent the Catalan club when he joined in 1979, said the academy would offer young Danish prospects a new kind of footballing education. 'FC Barcelona comes with a new offer to the young people, who will come to learn an entirely different philosophy,' Simonsen told a news conference as plans for the FCBEscola academy, which will be based some 16km north-west of Copenhagen in Ballerup, were unveiled. Young Danish players could follow Lionel Messi (left) into the Barcelona first-team through a new academy . Allan Simonsen believes the new academy will give Danish players the chance to enjoy a new philosophy . 'I sincerely doubt that the philosophy is practised in very many places, so it will be completely new.' But reaction to the news was not all positive and the Danish FA (DBU) poured cold water on the idea. 'The DBU has still not received an official request from FC Barcelona about their desire for the establishment of an academy in Denmark, including specific information on what such a setup would contain,' the DBU said in a statement. 'It is a precondition for the establishment of such an academy in Denmark that it obtains the approval of the DBU.' The DBU's head of grassroots soccer Steen Joergensen expressed concern over the well-being of children and that Danish junior football could become a hotbed of competition between elite academies as youngsters chase the dream of turning professional. Former Denmark international Michael Laudrup played for Barcelona between 1989 and 1994 . 'For us it is important that FC Barcelona, like all others, manage to take care of both the child and the talent, so that there won't be tough competition with focus on the potential economic gain at too early an age,' he said in a statement. 'It is initially about childrens' well-being, happiness and security, which in our opinion are fundamental prerequisites for the development of children.' FCBEscola director Xevi Merce played down suggestions that the world-famous club's network of academies were a way of unearthing players who would then be spirited off to the La Masia academy in Spain, where Lionel Messi learned his trade. 'We are going to give a plus to Denmark, not to steal talents. We will develop and demonstrate our method, and then we will learn from Danish football,' he said.","The FCBEscola academy will be based 16km north-west of Copenhagen .

"Lithuania coach Igoris Pankratjevas knows what his defence should expect if England hand a debut to Harry Kane on Friday night. Pankratjevas' side face England at Wembley as the duo meet in a European Championship Group E qualifier - with in-form Kane likely to be selected for his first England cap by manager Roy Hodgson. Although he is untested at the highest international level, Pankratjevas knows his Premier League record and was also present when Kane scored a late winner for Gareth Southgate's Under-21's in a European Under-21 qualifier. Harry Kane is likely to play a role for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday . Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions for Tottenham so far this season . England manager Roy Hodgson says Kane will make his entry into full international football this week . 'Statistics speak for themselves,' he said. 'I know Harry Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions so that fact speaks for itself. I've seen him play at international level for England Under-21s, he played in Lithuania recently and he is a strong forward.' Lithuania visit Wembley having won two of their opening four Group E qualifying campaign fixtures, with only goal difference keeping them out of the top two. But Pankratjevas knows his players face a unique test in north London and singled out England skipper Wayne Rooney as a danger man. Igoris Pankratjevas says his side are realistic about their chances of causing an upset at Wembley . Pankratjevas says that England captain Wayne Rooney is the anchor of Roy Hodgson's side . 'We are quite realistic about it,' he said when asked about his side's chances at Wembley. 'We are not dreamers, it is always history that Lithuania are playing England for the first time ever. Obviously none of the players have played at such a stage so we are preparing them mentally for this kind of game. 'I like the England team in general recently as they have some new players along with their experienced ones. The new players give them more creativity. He is still the anchor. He has over 100 caps and he is a top player.' With key man Arvydas Novikovas missing through injury, Pankratjevas admits he is yet to finalise his starting XI for the fixture - revealing he has '80 per cent' of his team, with the rest to be decided on Friday. The Lithuania squad trained on the Wembley pitch on Thursday ahead of the qualifier . Meanwhile, Marius Zaliukas will be tasked with keeping the likes of Rooney and Kane quiet if Lithuania are to get a result and the Rangers defender is hoping to prove wrong those in Scotland who expect him to return to Ibrox having been on the receiving end of a heavy loss. 'Everyone in Scotland is laughing because they think it will be a big score,' he said. 'We want to disappoint them. Every weekend I am watching the Premier League. We all understand the kind of players we are going to see tomorrow, that makes it more special. We are not playing these teams every month or every year.' Lithuania are playing England for the first time at senior international level. They have met seven times in UEFA age-group competitions, with England recording five wins and two draws. Most recently, they beat Lithuania 5-0 at home and 1-0 away in 2015 European U21 Championship qualifying. Lithuania have won only twice in 10 competitive away games — against San Marino and Liechtenstein. Experienced centre half Marius Zaliukas (right) plays for Rangers and spent last season at Leeds, making nine appearances. Striker Simonas Stankevicius, 19, is on Leicester’s books, but has yet to make his first-team debut. England are one of only four teams still boasting a 100 per cent record in qualifying. The others are Slovakia, Israel and the Czech Republic. England are unbeaten in 23 Euro and FIFA World Cup qualifying games (W16 D7), stretching back to a 1-0 defeat by Ukraine in Dnipropetrovsk in October 2009.

"Arsenal's fatigued talisman Alexis Sanchez failed to prevent Chile falling to a shock defeat by Iran in St Polten. Former Real Madrid boss and Manchester United assistant coach Carlos Queiroz masterminded a resolute Iran side to prevail 2-0 at the neutral venue of the NV Arena in Austria. In their first ever meeting, goals from Javad Nekounam and Vahid Amiri finished off Chile in the international friendly for a remarkable result. Iranian players celebrate Javad Nekounam's (No 6) goal during the friendly match in St Polten, Austria . Alexis Sanchez, who has already played 3,326 minutes  for the Gunners this season, started on the Chile bench alongside Juventus star Arturo Vidal with Sunday's clash against South American counterparts Brazil in mind. A stuttering Chile failed to utilise their dominance in the opening exchanges and were undone by a simple set piece. Iran captain Nekounam couldn't believe his luck as he strode in unmarked at the back post following an Iran corner on 21 minutes, with Barcelona keeper Claudio Bravo failing to react in time. Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal came on in the second-half but despite his endeavour, Chile still lost 2-0 . Pejman Montazeri of Iran (left) and Chile's Eduardo Vargas (right) fight for possession . Chile had 74 per cent of possession in Austria but we toothless in attack, hence the introduction of Sanchez at the interval. However a swift counter attack on 50 minutes saw Vahid Amiri double Iran's lead as he swept in from 12 yards.

"The Easter bunny was invented in German folklore, where an 'Easter Hare' was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved. Much like Father Christmas, the brown-coloured animals was often depicted carrying a selection of treats to good children's houses. But while the traditional version of the rabbit was a natural-looking creature, the modern character has become an often terrifying white, pink, purple and yellow creation. The Easter bunny is meant to be a joyful character, but often botched costumes mean they are more horrific than happy, as this picture demonstrates . The symbol of the Easter often results in a terrifying sight when produced on a budget. Children who would usually be delighted to be meeting someone who will be gifting them with chocolate eggs end up screaming for their parents.

"FA Cup giant-killers Bradford City finally made it on to live television but viewers were treated to blood-and-thunder rather than a feast of football. Bantams striker Jon Stead rightly described it as a ‘dogfight’ and the lasting image was blood pouring out of the broken nose of Reading centre-half Alex Pearce in injury-time. It was that sort of game. ‘No goals, but a classic cup tie,’ remarked Reading boss Steve Clarke with a smile. League One Bradford were furious their fifth-round tie against Sunderland wasn’t selected by broadcasters despite their remarkable 4-2 win at Chelsea in the previous round.

Subs not used: Gunter, Cox,   Andersen, Cooper . Goals: NONE . Bookings: NONE . Referee: Neil Swarbrick 6 . Attendance: 24,231 . This was their big chance to show the nation what they could do. The atmosphere and commitment were 9/10, but the quality of football, and a bobbly pitch, would have been a turn-off for viewers. The woodwork was struck three times — once by Bradford, twice by Reading — but they were rare moments of penalty-area drama. Championship side Reading were determined not to go the same way as Aston Villa, Arsenal, Chelsea and Sunderland who have all been beaten by 2013 Capital One Cup finalists Bradford in the last few seasons, and Clarke — who won the FA Cup as a Chelsea player in 1997 — was unapologetic for sticking an extra man in midfield and trying to stifle the game as a contest. ‘We were always going to scrap, roll up our sleeves and fight for very second ball,’ he said. History weighed heavily on both teams. Reading hadn’t been to an FA Cup semi-final since 1927. For Bradford, managed by ex-Royals player Phil Parkinson, the wait had stretched back even further to 1911. With every Bradford fan arriving with a claret-and-amber scarf, the atmosphere was colourful and noisy. Crunching tackles by Stephen Darby and Gary Liddle could be heard from the back of the stands while James Hanson and Stead steamed into any defender that moved. Not that Reading were shrinking violets, Chelsea loanee Nathaniel Chalobah winded Liddle with his first strong challenge from behind. Reading took time to come to terms with being in the bearpit but produced a neat bit of football after 18 minutes when Jamie Mackie’s cross reached Pavel Pogrebnyak and the Russian spun and struck the post in one movement. Bradford responded with their own opportunity, Liddle’s cross-shot deceiving Adam Federici and also striking the upright.

Bradford manager Parkinson yells at the linesman during his side's FA Cup quarter-final tie against his former club Reading . Reading manager Steve Clarke (right) gives a glance towards Parkinson during the cup game at Valley Parade on Saturday . Referee Neil Swarbrick got into the FA Cup spirit and let go many challenges that would have been penalised in the Premier League. Remarkably, he showed only one yellow card all afternoon, to Bradford’s Rory McArdle. Bradford dominated the second half and went close through Hanson and Andrew Davies. Reading hit the post again when Pogrebnyak deflected Oliver Norwood’s free-kick with his arm. The officials missed the infringement so it was lucky for them the ball didn’t go in. Even in injury-time, no quarter was given. When Pearce went up in the air with Francois Zoko, he clashed heads with the Bradford man and injured himself in the process. Play was stopped as blood streamed from Pearce’s nose. In keeping with the game, he went off to get patched up but came back on to see out time. ‘Wipe the blood off and back on, he’s a proper centre-half,’ said Clarke, proudly. Fans got an eyeful as Pearce stripped down to his underpants along the touchline so he could change his bloodied shirt and shorts as quickly possible before returning to the fray. ‘It was a dogfight,’ reflected Stead, who has scored in every round in this season’s competition. ‘It was two teams going at it. We feel we can do better. We pinned them in the second half but needed to score. We’ll give it everything in the replay.’ Jon Stead goes for the ball during Bradford's FA Cup tie with Reading as the League One and Championship side went head to head .

That will take place a week tomorrow to avoid Uefa rules on clashing with the Champions League. It means Bradford and Reading will play two matches in three days. ‘Frustrating, it devalues the competition,’ said Clarke. The Reading boss admitted his spoiling tactics were devised after watching Bradford over-run Sunderland at Valley Parade last month. ‘We knew what to expect, no quarter asked or given,’ he said. Parkinson said: ‘They came with an extra man in midfield. It was a different challenge to the Sunderland game but I thought we did well.’ Clarke refuses to see his side as favourites for the replay even though they play a division higher than Bradford and have home advantage at the Madjeski. ‘I said it was a 50-50 game when the draw was made and I still think that now,’ he said.

"A 14-year-old girl in Birmingham, Alabama, had a tense history with a group of girls on Facebook, but when they all decided to meet up and brawl Friday evening, the confrontation turned deadly. The participants, who had agreed to fight and post the video online, came together at a park, but midway through the fight, shots were fired that injured two and killed Kierra'onna Rice. AL.com reports that two shooters opened fire shortly after the girls arrived at the park, though there is no evidence the shooting was planned. Fatally shot: A 14-year-old girl in Birmingham with a tense online history as part of feuding groups of teens was killed by gunshots fired during a planned brawl in a park . 'They took it upon themselves to fire recklessly into a crowd,' Birmingham Police Lt Sean Edwards said of the shooting. CNN reports that police arrived around  arrested two suspected of being the shooters, males aged 17 and 19, who were identified by witnesses. 14-year-old Rice was taken to Baptist Princeton Medical Center with life-threatening injuries, where she later died. The two injured girls were taken to UAB Hospital for treatment. Investigators say they believe one of the suspects was dating a girl that Rice and others were planning on fighting, over a Facebook fight that dated to three weeks before the incident. Birmingham police say that teenagers have been more willing to use guns as a way to settle disputes recently. Caught up: Some photos posted to Facebook show Rice in her high school ROTC uniform .

"Today show host Karl Stefanovic has been forced to eat a spicy curry as punishment after his '7-Eleven' sledge against a group of Indian cricket fans caused viewer backlash. Stefanovic was hit with a barrage of criticism when he asked a group of Indian fans at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday 'who's going to be manning 7-Elevens today?'. The fan hilariously hit back saying 'you might have to look at Centrelink as well I think Karl' in terms of Australians at the World Cup match. The Channel Nine host offered a light-hearted apology on Friday morning before his co-hosts brought out an extremely hot Indian curry that left him sweating and watery-eyed. Scroll down for videos . Today show host Karl Stefanovic has been forced to eat a spicy curry as punishment after his '7-Eleven' sledge against a group of Indian cricket fans caused viewer backlash . 'I love India and I love the contribution Indians make in many different vocations across this great country. Our country is richer for having you and so are our sauces,' Stefanovic said as he gave his apology. 'Firstly to those members of the Indian community - our guest yesterday gave as good as he got and that banter continued in the true spirit of the world cup. 'After the show we had a great conversation. He owned me on air and off air. It was thought to be fun, it was fun, I enjoyed it and he enjoyed it. 'The comments were intended to be taken in the most light-hearted possible way. For anyone of you interpreting the comments in a different way my heartfelt apologies.' The Channel Nine host offered a light-hearted apology on Friday morning before his co hosts brought out an extremely hot Indian curry . The curry left Stefanovic with watery eyes and caused him to sweat on the breakfast television set . It came after an Indian fans (right) told Stefanovic he should be concerned as Centrelink would be empty of Australians as they all watch the cricket ahead of the semi-final match . Stefanovic then also offered an apology to New Zealanders after calling them 'dole bludgers', but continued to sledge fans at various times throughout the morning ahead of the match on Sunday. 'For my Kiwi brothers and sisters... calling you dole bludgers was an awful, cheap stereotype and just not true,' he said. 'As we all know you can't get the dole here in Australia. Again, my sincere, heartfelt apologies to anyone across the ditch or in Bondi who took offence. 'Just because you've got a cool, happening, effective government and a real attractive lot of livestock doesn't meant I should take the sheep out of you.' His remarks were met with sighs from the rest of his Today show host panel who said: 'This isn't going well'. Indian cricket fans were in full force at the Sydney cricket ground on Thursday as they took on Australia in the World Cup semi final . Today show host Karl Stefanovic made a light-hearted apology for his '7-Eleven' sledge to a group of Indian cricket fans saying Australia is 'richer for having you and so are our sauces' Stefanovic said the New Zealand fans had a bit to say on social media in relation to his comments and read out some of the complaints he had received. 'Obviously we were having a bit of banter about the cricket and I made some comments about New Zealand fans and a lot of you just aren't happy,' he said. 'We received thousands of comments about New Zealand and I'm surprised you can actually write.' The breakfast television host then read out some of the complaints sent in saying he was a 'twit' and a 'big mouthed d***head'. The interview that sparked the whole ordeal took place on Thursday morning outside the Sydney Cricket Ground when Stefanovic was sledging a group of Indian fans ahead of the semi-final match. The Indian fan's comeback caused an uproar of laughter in the Today Show studio, as Stefanovic said: 'What are you going to say to Warner?' Australian cricketer Dave Warner was famously fined 50 per cent of his match fee after he told Indian batsman Rohit Sharma to 'speak English' at the MCG in January. 'Look I'm not sure we can repeat that stuff on TV this early in the morning,' the India fan smiled. 'We'll definitely be right into him that's for sure. We'll definitely be speaking in English so he understands,' the India fan said. Viewers quickly reacted to Stefanovic's 7-Eleven question on social media, with some labelling it 'tasteless'. Karl Stefanovic asked a team of India supporters: 'Who’s going to be manning 7-Elevens today?' Andy Cussen asked: 'How does Karl Stefanovic still have a job? Complete muppet.' Megan Maurice said: 'You know, you just start to think that maybe Karl Stefanovic isn't that bad after all and then...' Angus Roberts described his comments as 'bit of a tasteless ""joke""'. And Paul Nolan said: 'I'm usually a fan of Karl Stefanovic but his 7-11 quip today was inappropriate and offensive.' Amber Monahan went as far as to call him 'an embarrassment to thinking Australians'. 'How dare you insult contributing members of Australia's economy. You sir are a fool. And Lisa Wilkinson guffawing in the background is hardly much better,' she said. However, Doovalacky Dave called Stefanovic's comments 'gold'.

"Now that's a bear hug! The adorable moment a mother bear races up to her cub to give it a loving embrace was captured in an incredible series of images, taken by Canadian nature photographer Marc Latremouille. In slow motion the brown bear - which weighs around 400 pounds - is pictured running towards its fearless baby, as it stands ready and waiting to meet its mum. Scroll down for video .

Two bears run through the water at the national park in Alaska, described on its website as a 'land of stunning beauty' 'I was photographing mother bear and two spring cubs digging for razor clams in the mud flats,' he said. 'As we all know, little ones are always curious and playful, and this particular cub decided it was playtime and started chasing gulls for fun.

"A 15-year-old girl who made a heartbreaking video about the abuse she suffered at the hands of bullies died last week. Toni Connell died in hospital after emergency services were called to her home in South Ockendon, Essex, last Wednesday. It came just weeks after the year 11 student was told she would not be allowed to sit the higher paper in her upcoming GCSE maths exam and would therefore be unable to achieve and A or B grade. Tragic: Schoolgirl Toni Connell, pictured, was found dead at her home in South Ockendon, Essex, last week . The circumstances of Toni's death are not yet known but it is not being treated as suspicious by police. Speaking yesterday, her mother, Amanda Connell, 46, said she believed academic pressure had led to her daughter's death. The mother-of three also said the schoolgirl had been the victim of cyber-bullying and had received death threats on Facebook. She said: 'We found out during a parents evening a few weeks ago that Toni would not be allowed to do A and B questions in her maths exam. 'We had been discussing [the exam] just hours before she died. The school puts a lot of pressure on the children - they have to take some responsibility and make changes. 'She was going in at 7.30 in the morning and coming home at 4pm exhausted as she was trying to fit in extra study sessions. 'Once Year 11 hit the pressure increased even more and I think it just became unbearable for her. Heartbreaking: Two of the notes featured in the five-minute video Toni uploaded to the internet last March . In one note she said she was '14, but so small' and in another said 'Loads of stuff gets spread about me' Toni Connell wrote 'loads of people hate me' on one heartbeaking note and held up another message saying 'been bullied since year 7' Bullied: The handwritten notes showed names that Toni had been called, including 'ugly' Desperate plea: Messages included the words 'I don't know what to do' and 'suicidal 5 times' 'We are hurting right now but if Toni's death can prevent another child needlessly dying then she will at least have achieved something.' In March last year, Toni uploaded a heartbreaking video to  in which she shared how she had 'one true friend' and that 'loads of people hate' her. On handwritten notes, she wrote: 'The next three names I have been called... ugly, lesbian tramp.' She also shared: 'to be popular you have to be a s**g long hair pretty, have boobs'. One card read: 'Suicidal 5 times.' The next: 'Don't do suicide. Don't let them win'. Asked about an anti-bullying video online posted by Toni, Mrs Connell added: 'I am very angry with the school as they knew she was being bullied but never did anything about it. 'I know children must have picked on her about her brace as she had been excited about getting it but once she went to school she was immediately begging us to have it taken off. 'I didn't even know about the video though.' Paying tribute to her daughter, she said: 'Toni was bubbly and talkative. She loved animals - we had 13 rabbits but her pride and joy was her hamster, Tibbles. Bright future: Tributes were laid for Toni as her mother spoke of her 'bubbly and talkative' daughter . Remembered: Candles,  flowers and what appears to be a signed school shirt have been left in tribute . 'She was always singing and dancing. Her ambition was to be an actress on Hollyoaks and she had an audition for a drama college that she was looking forward to attending.' Paramedics and the air ambulance were called to Toni's home last Wednesday but were unable to revive her. She later died at Queen's Hospital, Romford, Essex. A police statement said: 'Specially-trained officers have been providing support to Toni's family. Her death is not being treated as suspicious.' A date has not yet been set for the inquest. Commenting on Toni's death, a school spokesman said: 'It is with great sadness that we are coming to terms with the death of Toni. 'The whole school community is deeply affected by this tragedy.' Barbara King, the academy's executive principal said: 'The Ockendon Academy has been working closely with Thurrock Council’s Children’s Services as well as Community Adolescent Mental Health Services to support our young people and staff in the school following the tragic death of Year 11 student Toni Connell. Pupil: Toni Connell was told by staff at The Ockendon Academy, Essex, pictured, that she would have to sit the foundation level GCSE maths paper, which allows pupils to achieve a maximum of a C grade . 'We are aware that this tragic news can lead to speculation in the press and on social media regarding the circumstances around Toni’s death and have advised parents that police are working to establish the circumstances surrounding the tragedy and how it would be inappropriate for the school to comment further while those investigations continue. 'Parents are also being advised if they have any concerns regarding their children they should contact the school directly so we can ensure they get access to support in school and so we can offer further one-to-one advice.' Ockendon Academy chair of governors, Rev Brian Duckworth, said in an online statement: 'It is with great sadness that we have to inform you that we have learned today of the death of a young person, Toni Connell a year 11 student at our school. 'We know that your children may be deeply affected by this sad news and we have offered support to all students in the school and there will be additional counselling available. 'If you have concerns about your child please let the school know so we can make support available for them next week. 'If your child needs to talk to someone over the weekend please be aware that the Childline telephone service is available on 0800 1111. 'Clearly we would like to express our thoughts and deepest sympathy to her family at this time.' Councillor John Kent, leader of Thurrock Council and portfolio holder for education, said: 'I am pleased the council has been able to support the academy in its time of trouble and I would call on the local community to do the same.'","Toni Connell, 15, died at Queen's Hospital, Romford, Essex last Wednesday .

"A Spanish government commission has imposed fines of £2,200 (€3,001) on a Real Madrid member and two others who insulted players and struck Gareth Bale's car after Sunday's La Liga defeat at Barcelona. Wales winger Bale was targeted along with coach Carlo Ancelotti after they arrived back in Madrid following the 2-1 defeat at the Nou Camp. The government's anti-violence in sport commission imposed the fines as well as a six-month ban from sports installations, the commission said on Thursday. Gareth Bale's car was attacked by angry Real Madrid fans following their 2-1 defeat by Barcelona on Sunday . The world's most expensive footballer was confronted by fans as he left the club's Valdebebas training base . The £86million signing's white Bentley is struck by this fan while others jeered Wales international Bale . The fan tries to give the car a kick as Bale pulls away and the abuse continues to be thrown his way in Spain . Real said on Monday one of the three men had been identified as a member and had been suspended and banned from their facilities pending a disciplinary hearing on whether to expel him from the club. Bale was accosted driving away from the club's training ground in the early hours of Monday morning. Two men tried to stop Bale, kicking out at his car as he sped away from them without stopping. The men shouted 'Hijo de puta' ('Son of a bitch') at the player as security guards attempted to calm them down. Bale's team-mates Jese and Sergio Ramos were also targeted. Bale has been singled out by Real supporters since the turn of the year as the team have lost three games in the league. On Monday, Real announced that the offending member's identity has been sent to the club's discipline commission with the request for him to be expelled from the Santiago Bernabeu outfit for the 'very serious offence.' In addition the club say that they will take applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for the incident. Bale and his Madrid team-mates lost 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Sunday night in a fiercely-contested El Clasico . An estimated 400 million people watched Bale struggle on television as Real moved four points behind Barca . On their official club website, Real Madrid's statement read: 'Following the incidents that occurred involving three individuals in the early hours of this morning outside Ciudad Real Madrid, Real Madrid C. F. wishes to outline the following: . 1.- The Club has already identified the individuals responsible, one a Real Madrid member, for these aggressive and violent actions against several of our players. 2.- Details of this member's identity were sent to the Club's Discipline Commission, requesting that it expel the individual from Real Madrid for what is considered a very serious offence. 3.- This afternoon, the Discipline Commission held an emergency meeting and decided to open a disciplinary investigation and provisionally suspend the individual's rights as a member and access to the Santiago Bernabéu or any Real Madrid facilities. 4.- Real Madrid has notified Spain's National Anti-Violence Commission of the incidents that took place, as well as the identities of the individuals responsible, requesting that it apply those sanctions that it considers appropriate. 5.- Furthermore, Real Madrid will take any applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for these incidents.' Spanish newspaper AS refused to give Bale a mark in their ratings for the Barca defeat, while Marca wrote: 'It's obvious [president Florentino] Perez has paid €100m for someone worth €20m.'

Bale was unlucky not to score at the Nou Camp in front of an estimated 400 million watchers on television as his first-half goal was ruled out for Cristiano Ronaldo being offside. The Wales international, despite helping Madrid win the Copa del Rey and Champions League by scoring in both finals last season, has found life difficult in Spain this year. Bale scored both goals in a 2-0 win against Levante  less than two weeks ago, and celebrated ending his 829-minute drought by covering his ears as if to block out the criticism. The corner flag received a kicking from the 25-year-old, too, as he let out his frustration. It came after the former Tottenham Hotspur winger was whistled at his own stadium last month and a fan poll found 40 per cent of supporters wanted Bale to be dropped by manager Carlo Ancelotti. Bale has been linked with moves to Manchester United and Chelsea previously, with the majority of Madrid fans seemingly hoping he decides to return to the Barclays Premier League.

"At least two people were killed and eight injured during a shooting at pub in Sweden last night. Automatic weapons are believed to have been used in the attack yesterday during the screening of a football match in Biskopsgarden, a suburb of Gothenburg with a history of gang violence. Detectives said it was too early to speculate on the motive behind the shooting - which happened at about 10.20pm local time (9.20pm GMT) - but there were indications that it was gang-related. Two dead and eight injured: The shooting took place inside a pub called ‘Var Krog och Bar’ (Our Tavern and Bar) in Biskopsgarden, a suburb of Gothenburg in Sweden, at about 10.20pm local time yesterday . Police spokesman Ulla Brehm said that at least two people were killed at the scene and several others taken to a hospital, adding: ‘There is absolutely nothing that indicates terrorism.’ One witness, who did not wish to be named, told Swedish broadcaster SVT that two men entered the pub and started shooting with automatic weapons. He said: ‘I didn't have a chance to think about what happened. Then I saw that my friend was bleeding. I tried to stop the bleeding as well as I could with my hand.’ Several people are now being questioned by police. Ms Brehm said the area on Hisingen, an island off Gothenburg, had seen a lot of gang violence and that was a likely explanation for the shooting. She added: ‘We have had a targeted police operation in this area because we have gang crime here. There have been shootings in the past.’ Location: Gothenburg  is in south-western Sweden and is the country's second biggest city (file picture) The attack took place inside a restaurant called ‘Var Krog och Bar’ (Our Tavern and Bar). It opened in 1995 and also has a sports bar and a nightclub open on Fridays and Saturdays. Gothenburg (known as 'Goteborg' in Swedish) is located in south-western Sweden and is the country's second biggest city. Police said the death toll from the attack was likely to rise. Ten ambulances were sent to the scene, and the injured are being treated at Sahlgrenska University Hospital - but a spokesman said last night: ‘We cannot say anything.’ Gun violence is not uncommon in Sweden's major cities, but shootings in public places with multiple victims are rare. On January 30 a man was wounded in a shooting on the square outside the restaurant, although it was not clear last night whether the shootings were linked.","Automatic weapons were used in attack in Gothenburg, witness says .

"It is amazing what you can achieve in sport ‘in extremis’ and although England didn’t land the Championship which they craved, they will have learned a great deal about what can be achieved when you really want it — and need it. England were fantastic on Saturday and if they can draw from the experience, this can be a fantastic year for English rugby — and indeed British and Irish rugby, because Wales and champions Ireland were quite exceptional as well on the final day of the tournament. England cut loose in thrilling fashion and they will never be quite the same players again. They know now for certain that there is another level they can perform to and the Twickenham crowd know that as well. England can hold their heads high and go forward with real confidence after near miss . The shackles really came off and it was really great to watch. Wales and Ireland also found a new level — 211 points in total were scored in the three games —to set what looked like a nigh on impossible target. Very few pundits would have predicted that England would kick off needing to beat France by 26 points, which was a huge ask but a very useful exercise in concentrating the mind on a very specific task when you feel free to empty the tanks and leave nothing on the pitch. Ben Youngs jumps for joy after scoring the first try of the match on Saturday evening . Although England started with the encouragement of an early try, they started chasing the big score a little bit too early and got too loose. You want the game too open up a little to create space but you still have to remember defensive discipline and in the first 20 minutes England missed nine tackles, which is always going to spell trouble against any French side. France nipped in for those two tries from Noa Nakitaci — even if he was taking the concept of going in under the posts a little far for the second! And that rocked England back a little but they stayed positive and did really well, firstly to get back in the game and then to chase for the title. George Ford slides on to his right side as he scores England's fourth try of the afternoon . 1 There is a chance England’s World Cup pool will be decided by points difference. Games between England, Australia and Wales are likely to be close which places an onus on big wins over Fiji and Uruguay. 2 The England pack aren’t quite as dominant as we thought. They need to go up a gear and the return of Joe Launchbury and Alex Corbisiero should help. With the England forwards controlling affairs up front — as they did in the last autumn against the Aussies — I would be confident of England beating Australia. 3 England have found their World Cup fly-half in George Ford and pretty much have the back division in place except for the debate over the 12 slot. A fit-again Manu Tuilagi would come into the equation as will Owen Farrell. 4 England’s backrow still lacks pace and can look unbalanced. Lesser teams can be overpowered but is hugely important against the very best. The only readymade solution is bringing Steffon Armitage in but unless the RFU invoke their curious ‘special circumstances’ clause that isn’t going to happen. 5 Look out for Wales. They have taken the long view this year and are determined to peak in Autumn which is possibly why the intensity wasn’t there against England in February. They are beginning to get the bit between their teeth. They all stuck with the task superbly well. Ben Youngs was the catalyst for everything good and had a quite stunning game — it was brilliant to watch. His second try summed it up perfectly. If you look at the replay today you will see that it was Youngs who took the quick, surprise line-out throw, right back on his line and it was the Leicester scrum half who finished off England’s sustained attack 110 yards upfield under the French posts. It was inspired play, the stuff of champions and exactly the kind of bold, positive play that will be needed for 80 minutes to win a World Cup. The crowd got right in behind it all with their support and there was an energy at Twickenham I haven’t felt for a while. This must be the norm in terms of intensity and atmosphere at every England game from now on. Ultimately, it wasn’t quite enough, not least because this was the day — and the ‘loose’ occasion — on which France seemed to rediscover their attacking mojo. Some of their handling and attacking play was out of the top drawer. James Haskell’s yellow card in the second half didn’t help and towards the end there when England were pressing hard again two line-outs went AWOL. Small margins but important. These are the things that England must still work on but they can hold their heads high and go forward with real confidence.
