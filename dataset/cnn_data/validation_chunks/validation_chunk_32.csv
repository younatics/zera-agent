"Almost 1,000 migrants have been rescued in a 24 hour period as their boats floundered crossing the Mediterranean on their way to Europe. At least ten people perished when their vessel carrying around 130 people capsized in freezing waters off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard had rushed to the scene after being alerted by a tugboat working for Libyan offshore oil rigs and were able to save around 121 people. Scroll down for videos .

Italian officials carry a coffin containing the body of one of the migrants who perished at sea . The coastguard ship Dattilo brought 439 migrants to Augusta along with the corpses of the 10 drowned migrants . Last month around 300 Sub Saharan Africans were thought to have drowned trying to cross the sea when their boats overturned in 20 foot waves. Pictured is a coffin being unloaded by Italian officials in Augusta . In the first two months of this year, 7,882 migrants arrived in Italy by boat, a figure that has surged by 43 per cent on last year’s record numbers, according to figures from Italy's interior ministry. In the 24 hours between Tuesday and Wednesday Italy's Coast Guard rescued a total of 941 migrants in seven rescue operations in the Sicilian Channel, it said. Two rubber dinghies and five boats carrying Syrians Palestinians, Tunisians, Libyans as well as sub Saharan Africans were rescued in waters about 50 miles north of Libya. Among the rescued were more than 30 children and one pregnant woman, who was taken to hospital for urgent medical attention. The swelling numbers demonstrate the increasing desperation of those attempting to flee the growing chaos and bloodshed in Libya. The rescue vessels saved 941 people in seven separate operations that began on Tuesday. The coast guard said the migrants (pictured) saved in the latest rescues claimed to be Syrians, Palestinians, Libyans, Tunisians or from sub-Saharan Africa .

At the end of the year the Italian government closed their comprehensive search and rescue operation Mare Nostrum, which cost nine million euros a month, saying it was too much responsibility for Italy alone. It was replaced by the scaled-down Triton mission, a border control operation which patrols only the area 30 miles around the European coast. Last month around 300 Sub Saharan Africans were thought to have drowned trying to cross the sea when their boats overturned in 20 foot waves. Mauro Casinghini, Head of Rescue for the Order of Malta in Italy, said that Frontex was ‘no substitute’ for Mare Nostrum. He said that he expects thousands more people to die this year. The summer season for travel no longer exists he said. ‘If sea is calm they go. If sea is rough they don’t go. The problem is, if the bat capsizes and the water is cold, they die quicker. ‘ . Those rescued were taken to Sicily on Tuesday. More than 183 were expected to arrive at Pozzallo on Wednesday with an oil tanker while another 319 was approaching Porto Empedocle. The coastguard ship Dattilo was bringing 439 migrants to Augusta along with the corpses of the 10 drowned migrants. MP Maurizio Gasparri of Berlusconi's centre right Forza Italia said: 'Hundreds of migrants ready to disembark and a new tragedy in the Sicilian Channel. An ongoing disaster which this incompetent government cannot tackle. It continues to tolerate the cynical action of criminals in so doing feeding the rapidly growing phenomenon of trafficking. Terrorists ready to strike our country may be among them.' MP Matteo Salvini leader of the anti-immigration Northern League said: ‘ Another 10 dead and 900 illegal immigrants landing. In Rome and Brussels there are many with full pockets and blood on their hands. Stop the boats setting off, stop the deaths, stop the invasion.’","At least ten people perished when their vessel  capsized in freezing waters .

"The friend of a 15-year-old girl raped, bludgeoned to death and dumped in a wooded valley on her way to high school in 2002 has been charged with murder. Los Angeles County police say it is a major breakthrough in the cold case of Brenda Sierra - who they believe was slaughtered in a brutal act of gang revenge. Just ten days before the killing in October 2002, Brenda's brother had testified in a drive-by shooting case. Now police say her friend Rosemary Chavira, also 15 at the time, 'coordinated' her kidnap by possible street gang members and watched them sexually abuse and kill her. Scroll down for video . Cold case: Brenda Sierra, 15 (left) was kidnapped, raped, bludgeoned to death and dumped in a valley in 2002 in a suspected act of gang revenge. Her former friend Rosemary Chavira (right) is charged with murder . Mourning: File footage of Brenda's funeral. Her family have had to wait 13 agonising years for answers . Officers also have three male 'persons of interest', two of whom are now in custody being questioned. The third, named as George Barazza, is believed to have fled to Mexico. In a previous appeal they said Barazza 'may travel back and forth across the border' and was also wanted on a 'no-bail' arrest warrant for a prior narcotics conviction. Police say they expect charges to be filed against three men in the next month. Chavira, now 27, was arrested on Friday near her home in Lancaster, California, over the murder, which took place when the pair were living among the Hispanic community in East Los Angeles. In Mexico: George Barazza is the only one of three male 'persons of interest' to have been named . The Los Angeles County District Attorney has filed charges of special circumstances of felony murder during the commission of a kidnapping and rape and gang allegations. LA County police lieutenant Dave Coleman told a press conference: 'She actually was a friend of Brenda at the time and coordinated the kidnap itself, and evidence indicates to us that she was present during the rapes and during the murder. 'Her brother had testified in a drive-by shooting approximately ten days before her kidnapping.' Because she was 15 years old at the time of the murders, Chavira faces life in prison without parole if she is convicted. She pleaded not guilty at an initial hearing yesterday. Brenda was walking to a friend's house on her way to Schurr High School when she was abducted in the street at 7.30am on October 18, 2002. Her body was discovered the next day in the Valley of Enchantment area of the City of Crestline, in San Bernardino County. The San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department investigated the brutal murder for six years before it was passed over to the detectives of Los Angeles County. Despite the offer of a $150,000 reward and the release of composite sketches of two male suspects in 2012, an arrest was never made. But detectives persisted with the case, using new DNA technology, surveillance footage, witnesses and clues from gang members who had relinquished their criminal past. For the first time, officers now believe they have a timeline for Brenda's final hours. They say she was kidnapped in the area of Whittier Boulevard and Leonard Avenue in East Los Angeles. Questioning: These composite sketches of two male suspects were released almost three years ago. Now police say they are questioning two men and expect to bring more charges within the next 30 days . Solemn: A floral memorial to the murdered teenager. Just ten days before the killing in October 2002, Brenda's brother had testified in a drive-by shooting case. Now police say Chavela 'coordinated' the kidnap . She was taken to a home in nearby Williamson Avenue, where she was sexually assaulted. She was then moved again to another home in Miller Avenue, where she was bludgeoned to death. Her body was later transported out of the city. Witnesses saw a 'suspicious, dark, SUV' in the area where her body was found, while other witnesses near Brenda's  home saw 'one or two females' talking to her in the street. The case is another agonising twist for Brenda's mother Fabiola, who has waited 13 years for answers over her daughter's senseless murder. An LA County police spokesman claimed the force has 'worked tirelessly to bring her killers to justice'. They are still looking for outstanding witnesses. Lt Coleman said: 'We hope that anyone with knowledge of this horrific incident will overcome any fear of coercion or retaliation and come forward and bring justice to Brenda and her family.'","Brenda Sierra was raped and body dumped in a wooded valley in 2002 .

"The world's oldest person is set to celebrate her 117th birthday, but says that despite her age, her life has seemed rather short. Misao Okawa was born in Osaka, Japan, on March 5, 1898, was recognized as the world's oldest person by Guinness World Records in 2013. Mrs Okawa said she still does not know how she has lived for so long, but has previously credited her longevity to eight hours sleep, eating sushi, and doing squats until the age of 102. Scroll down for video . Long life: The world's oldest person, Japanese Misao Okawa, born on March 5, 1898, says she does not know how she has lived for so long . 'It seemed rather short,' she said after an Osaka government official asked how she felt about living for 117 years, adding that she is 'very happy' to be that age. Asked for the secret of her longevity, the great-grandmother responded nonchalantly, 'I wonder about that too.' During the celebrations of her 116th birthday last year, Mrs Okawa said: 'Eat and sleep and you will live a long time. You have to learn to relax.' The head of Mrs Okawa's retirement home added that she 'eats three large meals a day, sleeps eight hours a night, and insists that her favourite meal is sushi, particularly mackerel on vinegar-steamed rice.' The great-grandmother has slowed in recent months and has trouble hearing but she eats well and is in good health, the  Osaka care home said today. Japan's Misao Okawa, poses with her  son, grand children and great-grandchildren and Ward Mayor Takehiro Ogura, right,  at her nursing home in Osaka, western Japan . Despite saying today that she does now know why she has lived for 117 years, Mrs Okawa has previously credited her longevity to eight hours sleep, eating sushi, and doing squats until the age of 102 . She is also known to have made every attempt to stay active for as long as possible, and revealed in an interview 15 years ago, aged 102, that she does leg squats 'to keep her body in shape'. Mrs Okawa married her husband, Yukio, in 1919, and they had three children — two daughters and a son. The following things took place in 1898: . January 1: The City of Greater New York is created through the annexation of land. April 25: The starts of the Spanish-American War (ended August 12 after 3,5 months of fighting) July 7: The United States annexes the Hawaiian Islands. August 23: The Southern Cross Expedition to Antarctica set sail from London. August 28: An American man named Caleb Bradham registers a soft drink - Pepsi-Cola. December 26: Marie Curie and her husband Pierre discovers radium. Mrs Okawa says that the happiest moments of her life were her wedding and the birth of her children – she still has a surviving son and daughter who are now 94 and 92. She now has four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1931. Mrs Okawa, the daughter of a kimono maker, was recognized as the world's oldest person by Guinness World Records in 2013. Experts say it is no surprise that Mrs Okawa is Japanese. The nation has the most centenarians in the world, with more than 58,000, according to the government. About 87 percent of them are women. They say it is down to an excellent healthcare system, encouragement to stay active in old age and a healthy diet made up of fish, rice and fruit. The life expectancy for a Japanese woman is almost 86 years while the average for a Japanese man is 79.6 years.","Misao Okawa was born in Osaka, western Japan on March 5, 1898 .

"A Ukrainian airforce pilot who has been on hunger strike in a Russian jail for 81 days could starve to death 'within days', a top official has warned as the prison service moved to assure the public her health is 'stable'. Yelena Masyuk gave the stark assessment of helicopter navigator Nadia Savchenko's health after visiting the jailed pilot last week. Savchenko, 33, has been on hunger strike for almost three months, has recently started to decline the glucose injections which have been keeping her alive. Scroll down for video . Starving: Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko is said to be on the brink of death after going on hunger strike . Release: Campaigners are calling on the government to move her out of prison while she awaits trial . But the Russian prison service has since said it is keeping a close watch on the Ukrainian - and has promised she will be moved to hospital as soon as there are 'serious complications'. Savchenko, who is also a member of the Ukraine parliament, has been refusing food since December 13 in protest against her imprisonment. She has been charged with involvement in the deaths of two Russian reporters in a mortar attack in east Ukraine - charges she strongly denies. Instead, she claims the she was kidnapped and brought to Russia. Late last week, Masyuk, a member of the Kremlin's rights council, published an impassioned plea for her release on humanitarian grounds. According to the Moscow Times, Masyuk warned: 'Serious problems with her internal organs are beginning. Nadezhda Savchenko could die within days.' She appealed for Savchenko to be moved to the Ukrainian Embassy, or, failing that, a flat in Moscow. Charges: Russia alleges she was involved in the deaths of two reporters, killed in mortar explosions in fighting in the eastern Ukraine. Pictured: Ukrainian women walk past a wrecked armored personnel carrier . Casualties: But Shavchenko denies all charges and claims she was kidnapped by the Russian government - which is said to back separatists fighting for indepedence in her home country . However, the prison service has apparently taken not of her warning - and has claimed the pilot's condition is not as serious as first claimed. Anatoly Rudy, the first deputy chief of the prison service, insisted her condition was stable - but if that were to change, they were prepared to move her to a civilian hospital. Speaking to Russian reporters on Tuesday, he said: 'As soon as we see that there are serious complications we will request that civilian medical institutions take her and treat her.' Putin is also coming under pressure from the international community to release Savchenko. It is understood Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French leader Francois Hollande urged the pilot's release in a phone call late on Monday. Earlier that same day, Poroshenko bestowed on Savchenko the country's highest honour, Hero of Ukraine, saying she was a 'symbol of the invincibility of the Ukrainian spirit and heroism'. Discussions: Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko (left) - who awarded Savchenko his country's highest honour - has asked Russian president Vladamir Putin (right) to release the army pilot . Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on Savchenko, referring all inquiries to the Investigative Committee. The committee, which reports directly to Putin, has previously said there was no reason to lift Savchenko's detention since it had 'indisputable proof' of her guilt, adding that 'it is for a court... to decide the degree of her guilt and punishment'. It added: 'Unlike some politicians and so-called attorneys, we are guided by facts and not emotions or political tastes.' They claim she was involved in the deaths of two Russian reporters Igor Kornelyuk and Anton . Voloshin, from state television channel Rossiya. The pair were killed on June 18 . after being hit with shrapnel during an attack by Ukrainian forces near . the city of Lugansk.

"A reporter for Fox 5 in Washington D.C. has come under fire for telling very different versions of a home invasion story that she has repeated while advocating gun ownership. Emily Miller, the chief investigative reporter for WTTG-TV, has previously claimed she fell victim to a terrifying home invasion on New Year's Day in 2010 while dog-sitting for friends at their house. In one interview for the National Rifle Association, she said she returned to the home to find it being robbed before trying to take a photo of the suspect - and being chased by a group of 15 men. But a police report has now revealed a very different - and far less harrowing - tale than the one she has shared publicly. Scroll down for video . Changing story: Emily Miller, the chief investigative reporter for Fox 5, has repeatedly told a story in which she was the victim of a home invasion, but now a police report has revealed discrepancies in the accounts . The Washington Post's Erik Wemple unearthed a supplemental police report in which she told police she left the home for 10 minutes to walk the dog and when she returned, she saw a man walking out from behind a fence. She asked him why he was there and he told her he was delivering firewood, the police report noted, and left. Miller, who had forgotten to lock the door behind her when she took out the dog, went into the house and 'felt that something was not right', according to the report, so left to take a photo of his car. Outside, the suspect gave her a business card showing a tree service company before leaving, and Miller saw that he was driving a silver truck showing the name of a landscaping company. But later that evening, her credit card company called her about fraudulent activity on her card and she checked her wallet and saw the card and $50 were missing, according to the report. She had left the wallet out on a table inside the unlocked home while walking the dog. The police report shows that after she told police about the fraudulent activity on her card, they tracked down the purchases to a Wal-Mart and a tattoo shop. Harrowing: In one retelling of the story, for a 2014 video for the National Rifle Association (pictured), Miller said she returned to find the home being robbed and the man took off with her wallet . Terrifying: A reenactment of the crime in the NRA video shows it happened at night, rather than at 3pm . But when police tried to contact her to take the case further, she did not return messages they left on her phone on three separate occasions and the report was suspended. The tale is far more dramatic when she re-tells it. In one example, she recounted the story on a video for the NRA. A reenactment of the robbery in the video shows the robbery unfolding at night, rather than at 3pm as shown in the police report. Tale: In her book, Miller says she attempted to take the man's photo in the street but he stopped her . 'A man - the police believed to be a drug addict - got into the house and started robbing it,' she said on the video. 'So when I came back into the house he was in there robbing. 'He took my wallet but I was able to talk him out of the house without hurting me, thank God.' She claims she then decided to follow him to get a picture - 'which was really stupid' - and came across 15 men standing around two pickup trucks in the street. When they saw her, they started running towards her and she fled back to the house, where she called the police, she said. 'Going to bed that night in this house, it was the first time in my life I thought ""I just wish I had a gun by my night table then I can defend myself if those men come in"",' she said. Miller has also said she was a 'victim of a home invasion' on other occasions, including in speeches. And in a series for the Washington Times, 'Emily Gets Her Gun', she said the man told her he had come to service the swimming pool before leaving. She followed him with her phone. 'I walked down the street, and as I turned the corner, I saw about 15 scruffy young men standing around two pickup trucks,' she wrote. When she held up her phone to take a photo, a man blocked her shot and demanded to know what she was doing. '""Nothing, I'm um, just going now,"" I said as I put my Blackberry down instead of taking the picture around him and went home,' she wrote - not mentioning a chase. She later turned her Washington Times series into a book, 'Emily Gets Her Gun... But Obama Wants to Take Yours', which was published in September 2013. Advocate: She has shared the story while advocating for gun rights in Washington DC. In a recent series on Fox5, she charted her attempts to get a gun in the state . According to Wemple of the Washington Post, the discrepancies in her story are important because she 'has hitched her career' on it. She has cited the incident as a driving force behind her wish to get a gun in Washington D.C., and has charted her attempt in a series on Fox5. In a report on Fox5 last week, she revealed that she had been approved for the gun permit after providing the state two police reports showing threats on her life, she said. In another questionable move, she has been described as a pro-gun advocate while still working as a journalist. Fox identified her as 'a proponent of Second Amendment rights' when it published her recent stories. When reached by DailyMail.com for comment, Miller, 44, directed requests to Fox's public relations team, who have yet to respond. Before working for Fox 5, she worked for The Washington Times, AOL's Politics Daily and ABC News, according to her online bio.","Emily Miller, the chief investigative reporter for Fox 5, has previously recounted a harrowing story of a January 2010 home invasion .

"A man who tied up a cockerel in a trap and used it as live bait to lure foxes has been convicted of animal cruelty. The bird was found dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin after being tied up with nylon bailing twine for days. Nicholas Wells, 37, of Bedworth, had pleaded not guilty, blaming a burglar for the offence - which was discovered by RSPCA inspector Louise Labram last June - but was found guilty after an eight-hour trial. A man who tied a cockerel to a trap and used it as live bait to lure foxes has been convicted of cruelty. The bird was found dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin from being tied up . He appeared in court in Birmingham to face charges against the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 and the Animal Cruelty Act 2006. Recalling how she found the bird and came to its rescue, Ms Labram said: 'I found the cockerel in such a critical state that it wasn't able to stand. 'The bird was horrifyingly dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin from being tied up with nylon bailing twine for some days. 'I was just sickened to see the cockerel stuck desperately in a barbaric situation like this - completely vulnerable, defenceless, and in alien surroundings, just lying there waiting to die either slowly from dehydration or by being eaten by the fox that this trap was clearly set for.' Nicholas Wells, 37, of Bedworth, had pleaded not guilty, blaming a burglar for the offence - which was discovered by an RSPCA inspector last June - but was found guilty after an eight-hour trial in Birmingham . Wells admitted owning the trap but said that normally he would use eggs, cat food and dead chickens to catch foxes roaming around the area. He claimed that a burglar had brought the bantam cockerel and had placed it in the trap - but his argument was thrown out by the district judge. The court was told that the cockerel 'was very lucky to have pulled through from a terrible act of cruelty.' The bird had survived the ordeal and, according to the RSPCA inspector, 'is now living the happy, healthy life that he deserves.' Wells was found guilty of using a live bird as a decoy for the purpose of killing or taking a wild animal and causing unnecessary suffering to ananimal. He was fined £750 for each offence and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £75 and a contribution towards costs of £2,300.","Bird found dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin .

"As a famous soap star in her home country, Mexican First Lady Angelica Rivera must have felt right at home during one highlight of her trip to the UK. Last night the glamorous wife of President Enrique Pena Nieto was feted at Buckingham Palace and today she dropped in on another famous stately home - Downton Abbey - to meet the stars of the costume drama.

"McDonald's says it plans to start using chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health and milk from cows that are not treated with an artificial growth hormone. The company says the chicken change will take place within the next two years. It says suppliers will still be able to use a type of antibiotic called ionophores that keep chickens healthy and aren't used in humans. The milk change will take place later this year. Many cattle, hog and poultry producers give their livestock antibiotics to make them grow faster and ensure they are healthy. The practice has become a public health issue, with officials saying it can lead to germs becoming resistant to drugs so that they're no longer effective in treating a particular illness in humans. Scroll down for video . Changes: An order of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets is seen Wednesday. McDonald's says it plans to start using chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine and milk from cows that are not treated with the artificial growth hormone rbST . Chipotle and Panera already say they serve chicken raised without antibiotics, but the announcement by McDonald's is notable because of its size; the company has more than 14,000 U.S. locations. Chipotle has nearly 1,800 locations, while Panera has almost 1,900 locations. 'This really does move the ball quite a bit,' said Gail Hansen, a senior officer with the antibiotic resistance project with The Pew Charitable Trusts. Hansen noted that ionophores, the antibiotics that will be allowed by McDonald's, are not considered medically important for humans. The announcement comes as McDonald's Corp. struggles to transform its image amid intensifying competition from smaller rivals positioning themselves as more wholesome alternatives. The company has long battled negative perceptions about its food, but that has become a bigger vulnerability as more people shift toward options they feel are made with ingredients that are higher quality or meet standards on social responsibility. After seeing customer visits to U.S. stores decline two years in a row, McDonald's had recently hinted changes could be on the way. Franchisees were told of the chicken and milk changes Tuesday night at a 'Turnaround Summit' in Las Vegas. Scott Taylor, a McDonald's franchisee who was at the conference, said ingredients are 'becoming more and more important' to customers. And he said the company was suggesting it needs to 'be where our consumers want and need us to be.' 'You're going to see more stuff like that in the future,' Taylor said. In a statement, chicken supplier Tyson Inc. said it looks forward to working with McDonald's to meet its new standards. Tyson noted it has reduced the use of antibiotics effective on humans by more than 84 percent since 2011. Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said McDonald's decision to sell milk produced without rBST was a good step because the growth hormone can cause health problems in dairy cows. As McDonald's fights to hold onto customers, the company has also made a number of leadership changes, admissions of shortcomings and declarations that changes are in the works. The pressures reached the top of the company in late January, when the company said CEO Don Thompson would be replaced by Steve Easterbrook, its chief brand officer. The CEO change officially took effect this week, and Easterbrook was at the franchisee summit in Las Vegas. Already, McDonald's had been pushing back at critics. Last year, it launched a campaign inviting people to ask frank, sometimes squeamish questions about its food, such as whether its beef contained worms (the answer was no). McDonald's has also been hammering home the fact that it cracks fresh eggs in stores to make its McMuffins in ad and signs in stores.

"A 27-year-old driver has been arrested after allegedly 'doing donuts' on a frozen river until his pickup truck smashed through the ice - then saving his own life while leaving his pet dog behind to die. Andrew Mayer was traveling through New Jersey with his two-year-old boxer mix, Rolo, in the early hours of Sunday  when he reportedly drove onto the Toms River, which had completely frozen over. He then repeatedly drove his 1989 Mazda B2200  truck around in circles, causing it to plunge through the ice into the frigid water below, police said. Mayer escaped from the vehicle as it was sinking. However, he allegedly left Rolo inside the truck, which was quickly filling up with water. Divers later found the black pup lying dead on the backseat of the sunken vehicle after a passerby called 911. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Andrew Mayer (left), 27, was traveling through New Jersey with his two-year-old boxer mix, Rolo (right), in the early hours of Sunday when he reportedly drove onto the Toms River, which had completely frozen over . Smashed ice: He then repeatedly drove his 1989 Mazda B2200 truck around in circles, causing it to plunge through the ice into the water below, police said. Above, the hole under which the sunken vehicle was found . Now, Mayer, who lives in Toms River, Ocean County, has been charged with criminal mischief and careless driving, police told NJ.com. Animal cruelty charges are also pending against him. Daniel Jolly, 25,  was a passenger in the blue and gray truck on the day of the sinking. He has not been charged because he got out of the vehicle before Mayer drove it onto the ice, officials said. Neither of the pair was injured in the incident. Police and U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue teams were dispatched to the scene at 12.15am on Sunday following a  report of a truck 'doing donuts' on the frozen river near Gladney Avenue. When they arrived at the river, the witness who had dialed 911 told them they had seen Mayer climbing out of the truck and escaping across the iced-over river before the vehicle went down. As daylight swept in, a Coast Guard helicopter located a hole in the ice. Divers were sent into the freezing water, where they discovered the truck and Rolo's body lying on the backseat, it is said. Frozen-over Toms River: Mayer escaped from the vehicle as it was sinking. However, he apparently left Rolo inside the truck, which was quickly filling up with water. Divers later found the black pup  dead on the backseat . Police search: Rolo is pictured in a Facebook photo (left), while emergency crews are seen scouring the river for signs of the truck (right). It was eventually located after Coast Guard helicopter spotted the hole in the ice . Victim: On Tuesday morning, Mayer's relatives insisted he had loved his pet dog (pictured) and had desperately tried to save its life, but the terrified animal had refused to leave the pickup truck as the water had flooded in . The multi-agency search for the pickup truck reportedly cost 'hundreds of thousands of dollars'. Mayer and Jolly both turned themselves into police on Sunday morning, according to ABC 7. A police investigation is ongoing, State Police spokesman Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said. A spokesman for SPCA added that the agency has launched its own inquiry into Rolo's death. On Tuesday morning, Mayer's relatives insisted he had loved his pet dog and had desperately tried to save its life, but the terrified animal had refused to leave the truck as the water had flooded in. Speaking to NJ.com, Mayer's cousin, Donna Jung, said the suspect had even attempted to get back inside the vehicle after climbing out in a bid to rescue Rolo, prompting his friends to pull him away. 'Andy jumped on the roof of the truck to get back in as the truck was going under the ice,' said Miss Jung, who has posted several photos of Rolo online. 'His friends pulled him out a second time.' Emergency crews at the scene: A police investigation is ongoing, State Police spokesman Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said. A spokesman for SPCA added the agency has launched an inquiry into Rolo's death . Relatives: Mayer's cousin, Donna Jung (pictured, left, with her fiancee, Helecia Morris), said the suspect had tried to get back inside the vehicle after climbing out  to rescue Rolo, prompting his friends to pull him away . Hunt: State Police posted this message on their Twitter page on Sunday, saying they were conducting a search . Discovery: They later said they had two suspects in custody. However, they have since said passenger Daniel Jolly, 25 has not been charged because he climbed out of the vehicle before Mayer drove it onto the icy river . Miss Jung's fiancée Helecia Morris added that Mayer was 'completely devastated' and 'infuriated' with himself because of his 'stupid' actions'. 'He did almost kill himself trying to save his dog,' she said. A friend of Mayer's, who wished to remain anonymous, described Rolo as the suspect's 'baby'. Mayer rents the basement of a home in Toms River with Jolly, according to NBC. He does not have a listed phone number nor listed attorney, and could not be immediately reached for comment. During an interview with police, Jolly reportedly claimed he had climbed out of Mayer's pickup truck after learning of his friend's desire to 'do donuts' on the ice and arguing with him about it. A private company is expected to be contracted to remove the vehicle from the water.","Andrew Mayer, 27, allegedly 'did donuts' on the Toms River in New Jersey .

"While giving back to the community both practically and financially is an admirable pursuit, many people may be going about it the wrong way. Peter Baines founded charity Hands Across the Water after spending 22 years with the NSW Police leading teams in response to acts of terrorism and natural disasters,  and says that many Australians approach charity work as a one-day-a-year commitment. 'If people think that they are going to go to a charity and create significant change in one day then they are naive at best, and arrogant at worst,' Mr Baines told Daily Mail Australia. Peter Baines founded charity Hands Across the Water, after responding to the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004 . 'I'm involved with a food van in Sydney that operates seven nights a week to feed the homeless. There is a core group of volunteers but at Christmas time we are swamped with people wanting to help out,' Mr Baines said. 'Homeless people need to be fed all year, so is it about the people you are looking to support or is it about you? I was always a bit mystified and I feel like people want to do it so they can talk about what they've done at the next cocktail party they go to,' he said. As part of the leadership team that responded to the Bali bombings in 2002 and the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004, Mr Baines has had almost 30 years experience responding to people in need. The Australian of the Year finalist and Order of Australia medal recipient has made it his life's goal to bring effective and meaningful change to the lives of those who need it the most, and believes that a different approach to charity work needs to be adopted. In his new book, Doing Good for Doing Good, Mr Baines says that people can be a 'waste of space' when they volunteer if they aren't committed to doing something of value, and are only interested in how their charity work makes them look. Mr Baines is an Australian of the Year finalist and Order of Australia medal recipient . Hands Over the Water was founded in 2005 and has set up several orphanages around Thailand . The charity has raised over $10 million without spending any donor money on administration costs . 'There are many Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs that allow employees to give up one day a year to volunteer, but it's essential to consider how effective that one day is,' he said. 'If you were to turn up to someone else's workplace as an unskilled worker, they would spend the day giving you training, showing you around, getting you familiarised, only to have you leave.' Mr Baines is passionate about creating meaningful experiences for those who volunteer, the workplaces who send them, and the charity, in order that everyone involved gets the 'best value' out of the exchange. While it may seem a clinical approach to giving back to the community, Mr Baines said that it is crucial for businesses and individuals to make decisions about how to contribute with both the heart and head, so that the biggest impact is made on those who need it. 'For companies involved in CSR it would be much more effective to give 50 employees a day off each week or month to volunteer so that they are plugged in and contributing, rather than giving 300 employees one day off a year, where many will not be interested or adding value,' Mr Baines said. 'For many people their intent is pure but it's just unrealistic to be effective in one day,' he said. Mr Baines spent 22 years with the NSW Police leading teams in response to  terrorism acts and disasters . He was involved in leading teams responding to the 2002 Bali bombings and the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004 . Mr Baines is passionate about creating meaningful experiences for those who volunteer for charities . In 2005, Mr Baines founded Hands Across the Water, a charity most recently recognised for raising funds for Baby Gammy, the little boy with Down's Syndrome at the centre of the Thai surrogacy scandal. Today, the charity is one of the fastest growing not-for-profit organisations in the country, and relies on donations from generous Australians to continue it's good work. However, Mr Baines has set up the charity so that people who want to give can be actively involved in seeing where their money goes, and maintains that simply giving money to a worthy cause can be an empty move. 'It's like a warm bath- you feel good when you are in it but half an hour later the water is cold and the feeling is gone,' he said. 'There's no engagement when companies or individuals simply hand over money and walk away. It's important to create opportunities for shared experiences so that people can have their own stories and engage more strongly with what they are giving to.' Mr Baines said that while donations are the backbone of charities and essential for their work, people will be less likely to keep giving if they don't have a relationship with the charity. Mr Baines is passionate about people engaging with where and to whom their money goes to . The Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 resulted in the deaths of 230,000 people in 14 countries . Thailand was one of the worst affected nations- 25,000 people were killed, presumed dead, or displaced . 'Some charities tend to focus on the work they are doing rather than recognising and embracing the donors. The work that Hands Over the Water does in Thailand would be impossible without this,' he said. When the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 hit, it resulted in the deaths of 230,000 people in 14 countries, with Thailand as one of the worst affected nations- 25,000 people were killed, presumed dead, or displaced. When Mr Baines was in Thailand eight months after the tsunami hit, he was struck by the plight of the children in the area who had lost their parents and had no one to care for them. 'After a big crisis people turn up to help, but charities and government authorities and NGO's all leave too quickly. If you want to make long term change you need to make a long term committment, and so we started raising funds for these kids- and a year later built a house for them,' Mr Baines said. 'But it was only when we opened the home that we realised that they needed more funds for operating, and children kept coming in. I was naive, I thought that if we built them a home all their problems would go away,' he said. Mr Baines realised that simply giving money and leaving them was not an option, or an effective way to create change in the lives of the children. Hands Across the Water is passionate about providing engagement with their donors, and operates bike rides around Thailand for those who are keen to both raise money for the charity and see in person the projects that their money goes towards. 'We run a Schoolies ride as an alternative for high school leavers, so instead of heading up to the Gold Coast, which I don't think is all that memorable, they can head on a five-day bike ride and end at one of our orphanages,' Mr Baines said. Mr Baines has released his latest book, Doing Good by Doing Good, which it out now . Mr Baines said that many Australians approach charity work as a one-day-a-year commitment . 'These rides have been hugely successful, and when we launched our rides in January both sold our in 90 minutes and we have return rate of 73% of people,' he said. The charity has raised over $10 million without spending any donor money on administration costs, and has set up a company to sit alongside the charity to provide a sustainable income to employ a full-time worker and continue the maintenance of Hands. With the money the charity has built several orphanages, providing a home to several hundred children each night in Thailand, and has also constructed a medical and community centre in the Khao Lak region of the nation. Mr Baines said that the way people have engaged with the charity after seeing the work it is doing is indication that people need to understand where their money is going, and highlights how important it is to make sure donating isn't an empty experience. 'When people want to give money, it's important that they do their research. The first one they come across may not be the right one,' he said. 'If you give to a charity or want to volunteer, make it the right one so you do it for longer.'

"Jobless: Veteran anchor Vince DeMentri, 50, was fired from WICS-TV in Illinois - his third job in less than seven years - after he got into a brawl with a reporter . Trouble seems to follow news anchor Vince DeMentri wherever he goes. The veteran TV presenter was fired from his third job in less than seven years after he got into a fight with a colleague from the station WICS in Springfield, Illinois. The incident took place at around 12.30am last Wednesday in the parking lot of a Hooters restaurant on Horizon Drive. Police officers were called to the scene after getting reports of an altercation between two people, later identified as DeMentri and WICS reporter Garrett Brngr. One of the pugilists was reportedly observed bleeding from the nose, according to Illinois Times. By the time police arrived, the brawlers had left in their respective vehicles, a black BMW and a black Jeep. Police later pulled over one of the pugnacious newsmen, who claimed that he had fallen from a stool. This is only the latest in a series of unfortunate events involving the 50-year-old DeMentri. The award-winning journalist was fired from NBC10 in Philadelphia in 2008 for allegedly keying a co-anchor's Lexus, stalking her and hiding items from her desk after two-year their extramarital affair ended. Pugilists: DeMentri (left) and Garrett Brngr (right) got into a brawl on the morning of February 24, leaving one of them with a bloody nose. Both have since been terminated . Fisticuffs: Police were called to this Hooters restaurant in Springfield, Illinois, after getting a report of an altercation between two people . Details of the ugly breakup were revealed after DeMentri claimed in court papers that he was unfairly fired over the tryst while his former paramour, then-28-year-old Lori Delgado, was allowed to keep her job. DeMentri then moved on to WPIX in New York, which also let him go in 2010 after he was accused of slapping the driver of the Bahamian ambassador to the United Nations in a spat over a parking spot. The quick-tempered reporter was slapped with an assault charge but was later acquitted. Checkered past: DeMentri was sacked from NBC10 in 2008 over an affair with his married colleague Lori Delgado (pictured) DeMentri, a Temple University graduate, got his start in TV journalism working as a sports producer for WPVI-TV. Over the course of his 20-year career, he’s picked up seven Emmys and a pair of Edward R. Murrow awards. Two days after the September 11 attacks, DeMentri was arrested for impersonating a federal agent in a bid to access Ground Zero, reported the New York Daily News. A charge of trespassing against the intrepid news gatherer was later thrown out. Speaking to the Daily News after his 2010 arrest, DeMentri said that he was being unfairly portrayed in the media as 'one of the bad boys,' even though he's never been convicted of any crime. The station manager of WICS-TV in Illinois told the State Journal Register in 2012 that they had looked into the incidents involving DeMentri, which turned out to be a 'non-issue' for them. ‘I don’t think you can judge anybody’s character by an incident or two in life,’ DeMentri said at the time. Both DeMentri and Brgnr's biographies have been removed from WICS-TV's website since the fisticuffs in the Hooters parking lot last week. ‘Vince DeMentri and Garrett Brnger are no longer with the station,’ WICS General Manager Rick Lipps said in a Facebook post.","WICS-TV in Springfield, Illinois, dismissed anchor Vince DeMentri, 50, and reporter Garrett Brngr over the brawl .

"Nigel Farage was today accused of 'making it up as he goes along' as Ukip ditched the idea of capping immigration. The Ukip leader is setting out his party's policy on immigration, claiming the current system is 'unsustainable, unethical and unfair' and calling for more high-skilled workers and people from the Commonwealth to be allowed into Britain. But during a radio interview it ditched the idea of reducing net migration to below 50,000, which had been backed by Ukip's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe just last week. A split also emerged over the party's policy towards people with serious illnesses coming into the UK, with Mr Woolfe backing them but Mr Farage suggesting they were not welcome. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage jettisoned the idea of reducing net migration to below 50,000, which had been backed by Ukip's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe just last week . Ukip hopes to use its immigration policy as a launchpad for making gains in the election on May 7 . Mr Farage says his party would establish a migration control commission with a remit to reduce net migration into the UK. In a keynote speech, he will call for future immigration to focus on highly-skilled workers and 'our friends from the Commonwealth' as opposed to 'low-skilled, Eastern European migration'. The party has attacked David Cameron for failing to meet his promise to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands. New figures last week showed it hit almost 300,000 in the year to September. In response, Mr Woolfe said: 'We will set a cap on the number of people permitted to work and reside in the UK by introducing a fairer.' At last year's party conference, Mr Woolfe announced: 'Ukip commits to bringing UK net employment migration down to 50,000 people a year.' But Mr Farage today jettisoned the idea, claiming that under an Australian-style system it was 'very unlikely that we would need 50,000 people'. He told BBC Radio 4's programme Ukip would bring immigration levels 'back to normality', with numbers similar to those seen before 2000. But he added: 'I'm not putting caps or targets ... you need to have more flexibility than that. The point is this: we currently have no control over the numbers, we are incapable of debating anything now in politics without caps and targets and I think the British public are bored with it.' Mr Farage was spotted wearing songs featuring pound signs as he addressed the media and party members . Mr Farage used a speech at the Emmanuel Centre in London to call for for future immigration to focus on highly-skilled workers and 'our friends from the Commonwealth' as opposed to 'low-skilled, Eastern European migration' Fresh confusion emerged today over the Ukip policy on migrants with serious illnesses. The party's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe told BBC Radio 2: 'If someone came to our borders and was on there, you know at the border control and they announce that they've got a cancer or tumour we are not going to turn them away. 'What sort of nation are we to do that? That isn't going to happen.' But Mr Farage told the BBC: 'We want people with skills and trades they can bring to Britain. “We want people who haven't got a criminal record. “We want people who haven't got a life threatening illness.' He later told BBC News that he had discussed the policy with Mr Woolfe yesterday. 'Policies evolve, they develop, they move on. I don't want the emphasis from today to be what our cap is; what I want it to be today is the fact that Ukip is putting forward a policy that will take immigration into Britain back to normal. 'Our intention is to bring net immigration into Britain back to 20,000 to 50,000 a year. It's a range, it's a range. Well again, you see, you can't help it you guys, you're obsessed with targets, let's talk about policy.' The u-turn was seized on by the Tories as proof that Ukip's policy was in chaos. Chancellor George Osborne said: 'Nigel Farage seems to be making it up as he goes along, one moment he is proposing a cap and then he is ditching it live on air – a novel approach to policy making. 'We are the people with a sensible plan, whether it's on the economy or immigration.' The Conservatives are to repeat the promise to limit net migration to the 'tens of thousands', despite missing it so spectacularly. 'This is absolutely our ambition,' Mr Osborne said. 'Of course we haven't met it in this parliament, as everyone knows. 'That's partly because the British economy has been so much stronger than other European economies. 'But the way to deal with this is the welfare reforms that David Cameron has set out so you can't just turn up in this country and claim welfare from day one.' Tory Chancellor George Osborne accused the Ukip leader of 'making it up as he goes along', as he stood by the Conservative promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands . Ukip's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe . Ukip's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe has repeatedly promised a cap on immigration. Just last week he said his party would 'set a cap' on the numbers of people able to come to the UK: . September 26: 'Within the points based system Ukip commits to bringing UK net employment migration down to 50,000 people a year' October 23: 'I promised to cap migration to 50,000 a year' February 26: 'We will set a cap on the number of people permitted to work and reside in the UK by introducing a fairer, and more transparent points based system ensuring we get the skilled immigrants we need and in numbers that the economy can manage' Ukip's proposals depend on Britain leaving the European Union, and include an Australian-style points-based visa system which, it says, would ensure the right numbers of highly-skilled workers were able to enter the country while imposing a five-year moratorium on visas for unskilled workers. Rules discriminating between European Union (EU) and non-EU nationals would be abolished, and those workers who qualified under the system would be issued with a visa valid for five years. During that time, they would not be entitled to claim UK benefits and would be expected to take out health insurance. After five years they would be entitled to apply for permanent leave to remain, provided they had not broken the law. Mr Farage said: 'The British public has acknowledged that they can't trust the other parties to be serious on immigration. 'Despite Mr Cameron's pledge, net migration is now up to 300,000 people per year. It is unsustainable, unfair and unethical. 'That's why Ukip has developed a policy focused around an Australian-style points-based system, led by a newly-formed migration control commission, tasked with bringing numbers down and focusing on highly-skilled migrants and our Commonwealth friends - as opposed to the low-skilled, Eastern European migration that the Tories and Labour have expanded.' Mr Farage insisted 'normal was from 1950 until the year 2000'. 'I am not getting caught up with ridiculous arguments about caps,' he added. 'There is no U-turn, there is a change of emphasis.' He went on: 'Our intention is to bring net immigration into Britain back to 20,000-50,000 a year. That's a range... 'You can't help it, you guys - you are obsessed with targets, obsessed with targets. Let's talk about policy.' Mr Farage said a mooted £27,000 lower limit on earnings to gain access to the UK was 'not absolute' and there could be exemptions for some skills, such as nurses.","Ukip leader sets out party policy for a points-based system for migrants .

"These 17 dangerous men wanted abroad for crimes ranging from murder to human trafficking were today revealed to be on the run from British police. The Metropolitan Police has launched a huge manhunt for the foreign nationals who are wanted by authorities across Europe and are now believed to be hiding in the UK. One of the men battered his victim to death with a baseball bat in Romania, while another is being sought in connection with the murder of a woman who had her throat cut in Belgium.

Detective Sergeant Peter Rance, who is heading the manhunt, asked people to get in touch if they recognise any of them. He said: ‘We believe that these people are dangerous, so taking them out of our communities and putting them before the courts is of paramount importance. ‘I urge the public to look closely at these pictures. Do you recognise these men? It may be that they live next door to you, or you see them regularly elsewhere in your community.’ One of the men, Silviu-Bogdan Bruzlea, 27, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in his absence for murdering a man in Romania in September 2007. After the victim and Bruzlea's girlfriend had an argument in the Tiga nightclub in Hunedoara, the killer armed himself with a baseball bat as he and his friends followed the victim home.

"The BBC has boasted of making ‘vast’ cuts to its celebrity wage bill – but still paid stars a total of nearly £188million last year. Its 14 highest-paid presenters, thought to include Graham Norton, Chris Evans and John Humphrys, took home nearly £12million between them, figures show. A further 230 were paid between £100,000 and £500,000. The figures appear in a report commissioned by its governing body, the BBC Trust, which congratulated the corporation on the ‘great’ progress it has made in cutting its celebrity wage bill. Some of the BBC's highest paid presenters, who are thought to include Graham Norton, left, and Chris Evans, right, took home nearly £12million in pay between them . The corporation has reduced the amount it spends on talent by 15 per cent over the past six financial years, and cut its spend on so-called ‘top talent’ – those earning £100,000 a year or more – by 29 per cent. However, it also slashed the number of presenters on screen or radio by around a third over the same period. In the report, seen by the Daily Mail, the BBC congratulated itself on the ‘vast improvements’ it has made since 2008, and the ‘cultural shift’ the BBC has made in allowing itself to lose certain presenters to other channels. It said: ‘There has been a considerable and important internal cultural shift towards greater ownership and scrutiny of talent costs…and a willingness to be more flexible in its approach to talent, including allowing talent to leave where appropriate.’ John Humphrys, left, is thought to another one of the BBC's top earners. The report also highlighted presenters who had left the BBC such as Susanna Reid, right . The report highlighted Jake Humphrey, who moved to BT Vision, and Susanna Reid, the former BBC Breakfast presenter who now co-hosts Good Morning Britain for ITV. But the scale of the salaries the BBC continues to pay out to presenters is unlikely to ease concerns that the BBC is ‘profligate’ with licence fee payers’ money. Last week, the influential Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee slammed the BBC, painting a portrait of an organisation that was inept with public funds, and had blown billions on vanity projects and staff pay-offs. John Whittingdale, chairman of the committee, said last night that the salaries the BBC was awarding talent needed close scrutiny. He explained: ‘The BBC should think long and hard before paying anybody a six-figure-plus salary. It is very hard to justify these sorts of sums. 'If the argument is that [the presenters] would go elsewhere - well, then perhaps the BBC should let them. New BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead is to make a speech in Oxford today, where she is expected to reinforce concerns that the BBC wage bill was too high . 'If somebody becomes so successful that they command a very large salary, the BBC is not there to stop them. It is there as an incubator of talent.' The committee's report, Future of the BBC, also called for the abolition of the BBC Trust, saying that the governing body was too close to the Corporation and needed to be replaced with a more rigorous body. A speech by Rona Fairhead, in Oxford today is likely to reinforce some of their concerns. ‘The Trust recognises that the outstanding people on screen and on air are at the heart of the BBC, at the same time we are clear that the BBC has a responsibility to spend money wisely in its approach to talent pay,’ she will say. Mrs Fairhead is also at the centre of another controversy about pay, after it emerged that she received more than £500,000 last year for just 50 days work in non-executive roles at the embattled bank, HSBC.","The BBC has boasted of making 'vast' cuts to its wage bill during last year .

"Ford may be known for its cars, but at this year’s Mobile World Congress the auto giant also unveiled a pair of electric bikes. Both prototypes are powered by 200-watt motors, fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car, and with pedal assist, help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph (25km/h). The bikes are part of an experiment by Ford called Handle on Mobility, which aims to make journeys safer and more efficient. Ford unveiled two prototype electric bikes at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Both the MoDe:Me (pictured) and MoDe:Pro are powered by 200-watt motors, fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car, and with pedal assist they help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph (25km/h) They are also part of the company's wider Smart Mobility plan, which is designed to make cars and other vehicles more connected. The bikes, called MoDe:Me and MoDe:Pro, are based on designs by Ford employees and take inspiration from technology seen in cars. For example, both bikes are fitted with rear-facing ultrasonic sensors. These sensors link with the handlebars to discreetly alert the rider when a car is about to overtake using subtle vibrations. The MoDe:Me e-bike (pictured) was designed for commuters ‘to keep moving in congested city traffic’. It folds and stows easily, allowing commuters to park outside the city, for example, take the e-bike onto public transport or a car and travel to the centre, then ride the e-bike to their destination . Both bikes have a slot for an iPhone so an app can be used as a sat-van (pictured left) and show when a car is about to overtake (pictured right), thanks to rear-facing ultrasonic sensors in the bike's frame . Earlier this week Ford unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining on an electric car, but bases its predictions on your unique driving style. Called MyFord Mobile, it also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house. The app was announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and currently works with a selection of Ford’s electric and hybrid cars. It specifically suits electric cars because the app can directly link to the battery to see a status level and accurate mileage. But Ford spokesman Abraham Phillip told MailOnline the team is working on developing the software for petrol and diesel range. These handlebars also light up to make the bikes more visible to motorists. The MoDe:Me e-bike – built with the help of bicycle manufacturer Dahon - is designed for commuters ‘to keep moving in congested city traffic’. It folds and stows easily, allowing commuters to park outside the city, for example, take the e-bike onto public transport and travel to the centre, then ride the e-bike to their destination. Meanwhile, the MoDe:Pro e-bike – built by a Ford team – is intended for commercial use by couriers, electricians, and goods and delivery services. It is designed to stow safely into commercial vehicles which can act as carrier and support vehicle, and be combined with more than one e-bike. Both prototypes work with an called MoDe:Link, which is currently only compatible with the iPhone 6. This app acts as a sat-nav and sends vibrations to the handlebars so the rider knows when to change direction. Turn signals are then triggered automatically for safety. The app also finds bike-friendly roads, hazards and alerts, and could ‘communicate’ with other vehicles.

It is designed to stow safely into commercial vehicles which can act as carrier and support vehicle, and be combined with more than one e-bike. Both prototypes work with an called MoDe:Link, which is currently only compatible with the iPhone 6 . Its multimodal navigation and smart routing lets riders filter journeys based on cost, time, and the amount of cycling required, compared to driving. This map also shows the weather, parking costs and charging stations. The electric pedal assist rate can be adjusted based on a cyclist's heart rate and includes a ‘No Sweat’ mode that takes over when requested, meaning the rider can cool down before arriving at their destination. ‘There are so many ways to get around a city, but what is really needed is a way to connect all of these transport options together,’ said Ken Washington, vice president, Ford Research and Advanced Engineering. ‘Being able to seamlessly move between cars, buses, trains and e-bikes and react to changing traffic situations can make a big difference both for commuters and for those delivering goods, services and healthcare.’ There are no immediate plans to release the bikes but Ford said they will help test alternative transportation ideas.

Meet Adolf, the poor Chihuahua puppy who is a canine dopelganger for the Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler . Hairdresser Claire said: 'I put photos of them on Facebook, and some of my colleagues and other people started commenting about him. 'Everyone says he resembles an infamous World War Two leader. 'He looks like he's got a side parting, and there is a little mark on his nose which has gone black.' 'We have called him Adolf - although obviously, it is just tongue in cheek.

"We’ve known for centuries that man’s best friend is the dog - right? Not necessarily, according to a latest YouGov study, which found that lobsters were the preferred animals for men - when compared to the choices by women - followed by alligators, sticklebacks, sharks and eagles. For women, meanwhile, the results were a bit more timid - with miniature pigs, cats, ponies, donkeys and chinchillas making up the top five. Man's new best friend? Dogs may have once ruled the roost, but now according to a YouGov survey of people in the UK, men prefer lobsters as their favourite animal - when compared to female choices - which may be because they associate them with fine dining (picture of red reef lobster shown) The study involved a poll of 190,000 YouGov members in the UK, which the company says is ‘perhaps the largest dataset ever collected of people’s passions and phobias in the animal world’. Overall, when gender is not taken into account, the nation’s favourite animals are dogs, tigers, elephants, cats and dolphins. The least favoured are eels, millipedes and spiders. When male choices were compared to female choices, however, there was a surprising battle of the sexes on what the most popular animals were. The data showed that lobsters were the most popular animal among men when compared to those less liked by women, followed by alligators, sticklebacks and so on. For women, compared to men, it was miniature pigs at the top of the list, followed by cats and ponies. As for the most popular animals, the study found that things like dogs and snails were slightly more popular among women than men. Men were more likely to prefer 'heroic', 'aggressive' or 'creepy' animals, while women preferred 'cute', 'beautiful' and 'exotic' species. In the episode of The Simpsons titled Lisa Gets an 'A' (seventh episode of season 10), Homer Simpsons gets a pet lobster that he names Pinchy, and unfortunately ends up cooking him towards the end of the episode. While his actions seemed bizarre, did Homer actually predict that the animal was favoured by men? For women, when their choices were compared to men, their favourite animals were miniature pigs (shown), followed by cats, ponies, donkeys and chinchillas . ‘Animals with violent defensive abilities - sharks, eagles and piranhas - are particularly favoured by men,’ noted Will Dahlgreen in an article for YouGov. ‘The only mammal in the top 20 most uniquely male animals is the Narwhal, while every animal in the corresponding female list apart from the penguin and butterfly is mammal.’ Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Dahlgreen added that his suspicion as to why men are more likely to have a positive impression of lobsters is because they associate them with fine dining . 'As for why miniature pigs score so highly on female uniqueness, this isn’t because men are particularly likely to dislike them, but because women are more likely to be drawn towards cute animals,' he continued. 'We can’t tell for sure, but I suspect this is because it is easier to anthropomorphise these animals, in other words to ascribe human emotions to their facial expressions.' This chart shows the full scores for the 'uniquely male' animals, which were the ones that scored especially high with men but not high with women . Conversely, this chart shows those animals favoured by women, but not liked so much by men. It should be noted that none of the animals were 'disliked' - the survey asked for positive results only .","YouGov survey asked 190,000 people in the UK which animals they liked .

"Claims: Tory MP  Mark Simmonds has been sponsoring his local hospital radio station and claiming it back on expenses . A Tory MP quitting Westminster because £67,000-a-year is not enough to support his family has been sponsoring his local hospital radio station and claiming it back on expenses, it was revealed today. Former foreign office minister Mark Simmonds also has an advertisement board behind the goal at Boston United's football ground funded by the taxpayer. Mr Simmonds, who represents Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire until May, is leaving Parliament because expenses are not sufficient to allow his young family to live with him in London. In the 2013/14 financial year he claimed 170,841.21 in expenses, which included £10,000 for his sports advertising at Boston United and elsewhere. Within his office costs he claimed for the £100 cost of sponsoring his local hospital radio station. He also employs his wife Lizbeth as office manager on around £25,000-a-year paid for by the taxpayer. For eight years patients and staff at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, have heard that music shows on Fridays are 'kindly sponsored' by Tory Mark Simmonds. Mr Simmonds, a former Foreign Office minister, says all the expense claims were within the rules and the Boston United board was approved by watchdog Ipsa in advance of the claim. Ipsa has also rejected a complaint about sponsorship and refused to investigate because of a lack of 'sufficient evidence'. Local councillor Robin Hunter-Clarke, who is standing for UKIP in Boston and Skegness in May, told the Daily Mirror: 'To pretend he is sponsoring a hospital radio show, boasting of his generosity while in fact charging the taxpayer, is pretty low.' Local support: Mr Simmonds has paid for an ad board at Boston United's York Street stadium to allow the public to see his contact details . But the MP has said he cannot understand why his claims are controversial. He told MailOnline: 'It is a load of nonsense. All the expenses were properly claimed and approved by Ipsa. I even emailed them pictures of the advertising board before I claimed and they approved it. 'It has been a good way to advertise my contact details and a lot of people have got in contact through this'. Regular sponsor: The MP has for eight years 'kindly sponsored' the Friday music show at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston . Last August he quit because of ‘intolerable’ expenses rules but is the owner of a million-pound mansion, bought using profits from the sale of his taxpayer-funded home. The 50-year-old already owns a seven-bedroom grade-II listed house with a heated swimming pool. Mr Simmonds has claimed more than £1.7million in expenses since becoming a Tory MP in 2001. He also made more than £500,000 by selling a house on which the taxpayer paid the mortgage interest. Six months after becoming an MP, he bought a five-bedroom house in Putney, south-west London, for £650,000. From 2001 to 2009, he claimed £2,000 a month for the mortgage interest. When expenses rules were changed to ban such claims, he sold the property in January 2011 for £1,187,500 – £537,000 more than he paid. 17th century splendour: The £1.25million mansion in Mark Simmonds's constituency of Boston and Skegness, which has  a luxury private pool and a tennis court . Couple:Mr Simmonds also pays the salary of his his wife Lizbeth in her role as his office manager, but he says he will leave Parliament at the election because he rarely sees his three children . The same month, he used the massive profit to help buy the 17th-century property in his constituency for £900,000. Set in 15 acres, it has formal gardens, a garage for three cars, a tennis court and a heated outdoor swimming pool. But Mr Simmonds said he will leave Parliament at the election because he rarely sees his three children, who live in his constituency. He said at the time his expenses ‘do not stretch to renting a flat near Westminster large enough for my children, so I stay in a hotel. I hate it’. When asked how a rental allowance of £27,875 a year plus £2,500 for each child was not enough, he said: ‘If MPs want to get into the business of travelling extensively from Westminster to the outer reaches of London to rent a flat then that’s up to them. ‘But that’s not the lifestyle I want and not the lifestyle I have chosen.’","Mark Simmonds also has taxpayer-funded ad board at Boston United FC .

"An 8-year-old boy crawling through a space in an automatic gate died Tuesday after being crushed by the metal arm that opens the entryway to the suburban Las Vegas housing community where he lived. The arm that controls the gate moves back and forth in the space measuring 7 inches tall and nearly 3 feet wide that Matthew Cattlet was known to play in. Cattlet was trying to crawl through the horizontal opening designed to allow the arm of the gate to pass through when the gate swings open, police said in a statement.

No child's play:  Matthew was trying to crawl through this horizontal opening in a gate measuring 7 inches tall and 3 feet wide - something he's been known to do . He was struck after another child on a bicycle approached the gate Tuesday afternoon, inadvertently triggering a motion sensor for it to move, North Las Vegas police spokeswoman Chrissie Coon said. His official cause of death is pending, the Clark County coroner's office said Wednesday. A teenager who saw the bar hit the boy called 911 around 5.30pm, reporting that Matthew was lodged in the gate at the Village at Craig Ranch and suffered a severe injury, Coon said. Other children between the ages of 8 and 14 playing nearby also witnessed the freak accident and have spoken to police. 'Reportedly, this young child frequently crawls through the space in the gate. He was trying to crawl through the arm of the gate but he couldn't get out in time and the arm of the gate crushed him,' Coon said. Community: Tragic struck at the Village at Craig Ranch in North Las Vegas Tuesday . Dangerous: The boy was struck after another child on a bicycle approached the gate Tuesday afternoon, inadvertently triggering a motion sensor . Matthew was taken to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where he died from his injuries. It is protocol to notify child protective services of the incident, but police say they don't suspect criminal negligence. 'It appears just to be a tragic accident,' Coon said.

"Health officials say people should eat less sugar. But that's easier said than done. Anyone who has tried cutting down on sugar knows to avoid cookies, sodas and candy. But sugar can be hidden in lots of other common packaged foods. The World Health Organization finalized guidelines Wednesday saying people should keep intake of added sugars to just five to ten per cent of overall calories, which translates to about 25 to 50 grams of sugar a day for most people. Scroll down for video . Be warned: According to experts, many supermarket soup varieties can contain up to two teaspoons of sugar in just one can . The guidelines don't apply to naturally occurring sugars in fruits, vegetables and milk, since they come with essential nutrients. In the U.S., adults get about 11 to 15 per cent of their calories from sugar; the figure for children tops that at about 16 per cent. By comparison, sugar intakes ranges in Europe from about seven per cent in Hungary to nearly 25 percent in Portugal. But research indicates that many people aren't aware of how much sugar they're eating every day. In fact, that's one reason the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is proposing the first overhaul of nutrition labels in two decades. In addition to highlighting the number of calories per serving in a bigger, bolder font, the new proposed labels would also for the first time list sugars that are added by manufacturers. Healthy? While salad might seem like the healthy option, the dressings used to add flavor to them are often loaded with sugars . In the meantime, though, companies don't currently disclose how much of the sugar listed in the nutrition panels of their products are from added sugars rather than naturally occurring ones. According to health experts, many everyday food products, which some might perceive to be completely healthy, are actually loaded with hidden sugars. Salad dressings, soups, yogurts and cereals have all been named as some of the worst offenders when it comes to sugar content; the popular Deluxe French salad dressing from Wish-Bone, for example, has four grams of sugar per serving - meaning it has around one teaspoon of sugar for every two tablespoons of dressing. Similarly, Progresso's Rich and Hearty Beef Pot Roast contains four grams of sugar per serving which means there are approximately two teaspoons of sugar in every can. 'In reality, we find (these sugars) in the majority of products,' Francesco Branca, who heads the World Health Oganization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, said. SALAD DRESSING: Picking a salad over a ham sandwich seems like a virtuous choice. But the amount of sugar it comes with can vary depending on the dressing you put on top of it. Wish-Bone's Deluxe French salad dressing, for instance, lists four grams (about one teaspoon) of sugar per serving (two tablespoons). SOUP: A cup of soup of soup is comforting thought, but even savory varieties can have sugar. A can of Progresso's Rich and Hearty Beef Pot Roast has four grams (about one teaspoon) of sugar per serving, with a can containing two servings. YOGURT: Another seemingly healthful choice that can come with lots of sugar. Some of the sugar is naturally occurring from the dairy, but companies add sweeteners too. A container of Chobani's 0% Fat Greek yogurt in black cherry flavor lists 17 grams (about four teaspoons) of sugar. BREAD: That toast you're about to smother with jam might've already been a little sweetened. A store brand of enriched white bread at the convenience store chain Duane Reade listed two grams (about half a teaspoon) of sugar for per serving (two slices). PEANUT BUTTER: It depends on the variety you pick, but peanut butter can come with added sugar too. Skippy's Super Chunk variety lists seven grams (almost two teaspoons) of sugar per serving (two tablespoons). CEREAL: Most people know that cereal has sugar, especially the varieties for kids. In some cases, you might be surprised that there isn't much difference between options. Special K with Red Berries, for instance, has nine grams (more than two teaspoons) per serving (one cup), while Frosted Flakes has ten grams (more than two teaspoons) of sugar per serving (3/4 cup). FROZEN MEALS: In case it wasn't clear by now, just because it's not dessert doesn't mean it doesn't have added sugar. California Kitchen's BBQ Chicken microwavable pizza has seven grams (almost two teaspoons) of sugar in a single-serving pie.","The World Health Organization is urging people to cut down on the amount of sugar they consume each day to between 25 and 50 grams .
One can of soup can contain as much as two teaspoons of sugar, while some salad dressing has one teaspoon of sugar in every two tablespoons ."
"Gay actor Russell Tovey has apologised after causing outrage for saying he was glad he didn't go to a drama school because its students are 'effeminate' and 'prance around'. Tovey, who plays a British convict deported to Australia in the upcoming BBC drama Banished, made the comments when discussing how the school his father forced him to attend helped 'toughen' him up. The 33-year-old's remarks outraged many and were criticised as 'disparaging' and helping to 'divide the gay community and propagate hate'. Scroll down for video . Actor Russell Tovey (pictured) has been criticised for saying he was glad he didn't attend drama school where students are 'effeminate' and 'prance around' Tovey (pictured far left) with his co-stars in the 2006 film The History Boys, which was based on a successful Broadway play . Tovey, who has previously said he came out to his parents when he was 18, began his career as a child actor but received fame for his role in the Broadway play and subsequent film The History Boys alongside James Corden. He went on to star in a series of BBC dramas, such as Being Human, Him and Her and most recently Banished, while he is also well known to American audiences for his role as a gay man in the HBO series Looking. During an interview with The Observer at the weekend, he spoke of how disappointed he was as a teenager when his father refused to allow him to attend the famed Sylvia Young Theatre School in Marylebone, London. But he claimed that in retrospect this was a good thing because the school he did attend forced him to 'toughen up'. He said: 'I feel like I could have been really effeminate, if I hadn't gone to the school I went to. 'If I'd have been able to relax, prance around, sing in the street, I might be a different person now. 'I thank my dad for that, for not allowing me to go down that path.' He added that his upbringing gave him unique acting qualities and there were not many actors who audiences were OK with playing straight or gay characters. But the comments were quickly seized upon, with Australian actor Brendan Maclean stating there was 'nothing unique about internalised homophobia' and liberal ThinkProgress editor Zack Ford saying he was 'disappointed' to see Tovey 'disparaging effeminate guys'. Actor Russell Tovey posted a series of tweets yesterday (pictured) in which he apologised and backtracked on the comments, claiming they had been misunderstood . Another wrote that such statements 'divide the gay community and propagate hate towards us by others'. Tovey responded yesterday with a series of tweets in which he claimed to 'raise the white flag'. He wrote: 'If you feel I have personally let you down I'm sorry, that was never my intention. 'I'm proud to be who I am and proud for others. We're in this together, I want you to know whatever you think I meant, I didn't. 'I'm gonna ride this out, and one day we will all look back on this moment with a half smile of fascination and satisfaction.'","Russell Tovey, 33, said 'effeminate' drama school students 'prance around'

"A 23-year-old woman allegedly caught driving with a huge haul of weapons, including an automatic machine gun, has been denied bail after being charged with 27 offences. Police alleged in court they uncovered nine firearms including a sawn-off rifle, non-sawn-off rifle, a pistol, two revolvers, a pump-action shotgun and double and single-barrel shotguns, along with an amount of ammunition, in weapons boxes on the front and back seats of Bianca Micallef's Holden Commodore. Micallef was stopped by Victoria police while driving in Sunbury, north-west Melbourne, on Tuesday night just after 6.30pm. Bianca Micallef has been remanded in custody after police charged her with 27 offences . Six machetes were allegedly discovered by police in the 23-year-old's car . Guns and ammunition were found inside boxes on the seats of Micallef's car, police say . Officers also allegedly seized five machetes, a samurai sword, a crossbow with an arrow, a taser, knuckledusters, a baton and a bag of amphetamine. Detective Sen-Constable Ben Smith told Broadmeadows Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday that a large wooden trunk had the name 'Bianca' written on it, the Herald Sun reports. Sen-Constable Smith also said an iPhone and iPad containing a photo of Micallef holding a rifle and photos of some guns were also found. When stopped by police the accused said she had no knowledge of the weapons in her car and reportedly claimed her boyfriend Rob Cameron might own them as he previously used her car. The court was told Micallef has used the drug ice for around two years . A revolver and a handgun were among the nine firearms seized by Victoria police . A pump-action shotgun and double and single-barrel shotguns were also seized . Her lawyer argued that as DNA or fingerprinting had not yet been carried out on the weapons they could belong to Mr Cameron. The court heard the 23-year-old had used the drug ice for two years. Micallef was charged with 27 offences - including committing an indictable offence on bail - and was remanded in custody. She will appear in court again on March 13.

"Women who suffered horrific acid attacks in Pakistan - often for doing nothing more than spurning a man's advances - have found themselves shunned by society and struggling to find work as result of their facial disfigurement. Now a surgeon from a British clinic hopes he can help them improve their appearance and rebuild their lives by giving them pioneering hair transplants. Surgeon Asim Shahmalak, 53, from Cheadle, Greater Manchester, has spent £50,000 of his own money performing reconstructive surgery on six women who have been disfigured. Kanwal had acid thrown over her by a man who had been stalking her after she had turned down his proposal . Kanwal is pictured left before her treatment with Dr Shahmalak and after, right, where her eyebrows and eyelashes have started to grow back naturally thanks to the surgery he performed . Dr Shahmalak said some of the victims were attacked with sulphuric acid which can be bought for as little as 15p a bottle on the back streets of Karachi where the women live. Shockingly, one six-year-old girl had been doused with acid by her father for refusing to go to school but was still too young for Dr Shahmalak to help. One of the women he was able to treat was Kanwal Ashar, 24, who had acid thrown over her by a man who had been stalking her after she had turned down his proposal. She had been working in a beauty salon and the man became obsessed with her. Dr Shahmalak gave her two new eyebrows and a right eyelash with hair transplanted for the back of her head in a series of intricate operations performed over three days. She had struggled to find work since the attack four years ago and she hopes that the surgery will help rebuild her life. She told Dr Shahmalak: 'I can go to a wedding now and show my face now I have got my eyebrows back. You have changed my life.' Kanwal Qayum, 27, was doused in acid by a jealous former friend. Her eyebrows had to be tattooed on following the attack, pictured . Dr Shahmalak gave Kanwal natural eyebrows, pictured, using hair harvested from the back of her scalp . Kanwal Qayum, 27, was doused in acid after telling a jealous former friend that she was starting a new job as an air hostess. He attacked her in her sleep and she has previously had extensive surgery on her face and neck as she recovers from her wounds. She had previously had eyebrows tattooed on her face with ink, but Dr Shahmalak gave her two permanent new brows and a right eyebrow from hair harvested from the back of her scalp. Surgeon Asim Shahmalak, 53, from Greater Manchester, travelled to Karachi to treat the disfigured women . Asma Fayyaz, 23, was horrifically scarred three years ago after falling into a pan of boiling fat when she slipped in her kitchen. She had a new right eyebrow and a right eyelash transplanted by Dr Shahmalak and his team from Crown Clinic, based in Manchester. Mona Bhatti, 42, has also been given new eyebrows. She was shunned by Pakistani society after having a sex change operation. Born a man, she was splattered with acid while begging on the streets after changing sex to a woman. Asma Fayyaz, 23, was horrifically scarred after falling into a pan of boiling fat when she slipped in her kitchen . Dr Shahmalak examines Asma after performing surgeon to give her an eyebrow transplant . Asma's eyebrow is now growing back thanks to her treatment . Dr Shahmalak is one of only nine surgeons in the world qualified to do the kind of intricate eyelash and eyebrow transplants the women needed. He performed the first eyelash transplant in the UK on a Manchester woman back in 2009. As well as carrying out the transplants in Karachi, he helped train local doctors and technicians in his techniques so that his work could carry on at local hospitals on his return to Britain. Last week, the doctor returned to Karachi to meet the women and review all the surgery he had performed last year. He said: 'It was wonderful to meet the women again and see how their lives had been improved by the surgery. 'I wept when I first heard what had happened to them. Their stories were heartbreaking - scarred for life because you want to better yourself and work as an air hostess. Mona Bhatti has been given new eyebrows, pictured, after she was disfigured by an acid attack . Mona was shunned by Pakistani society after having a sex change operation . 'Doused with acid because you turned down a man's proposal - people were better treated in the Middle Ages. 'It was incredibly moving to see the smiles on their faces after we performed the surgery. They had given up hope of ever getting help because the Government in Pakistan cannot afford to do anything for them. We were their last hope. 'They are not accepted by society because of their disfigurement. They cannot get jobs and, in some case, they have been disowned by their families and left to beg on the streets. 'They are too frightened of reprisals to tell the police who has attacked them and even if they did, they have no faith that the culprits will be brought to justice.' Dr Shahmalak, a former NHS general surgeon, said that he had investigated the availability of sulphuric acid while he was in Karachi and found it could be bought for as little as 15p a bottle near to where he performed surgery on the women. He said: 'It easy to buy with no questions asked. And as long as the authorities turn a blind eye to horrific cases like these, the attacks will continue.' Dr Shahmalak, a father-of-two, worked with the Karachi-based charity Smile Again which had found patients needing surgery. They have identified five new cases who the doctor will return to treat later this year. He said: 'There is so much more work to do. I am just glad that I am able to make a difference to these women's lives.'","Asim Shahmalak, 53, from Manchester, has helped six disfigured women .

"Possible Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham, the senior senator from South Carolina, is apologizing for a jab he made about House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress on Tuesday. At a private meeting with donors Graham alleged that plastic surgery was masking the House Minority leader's 'disgust' at the Israel leader's words. Rep. Xavier Becerra, left, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, center, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, right,  listen to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu address to a joint meeting of Congress in the House chamber at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday. They appeared less than enthused as Netanyahu asked them not to approve the nuclear deal the Obama administration and its allies are negotiating with Iran . Later that afternoon Graham, pictured here on the floor of the House before Netanyahu's speech, made fun of Pelosi during a conversation with a donor, saying, 'Did you see Nancy Pelosi on the floor. Complete disgust. If you can get through all the surgeries, there’s disgust' During the joint address Pelosi and other members of Democratic leadership appeared less than enthused as Netanyahu asked them not to approve the nuclear deal the Obama administration and its allies are negotiating with Iran and to put crippling sanctions on the country. Afterward, Pelosi said in a statement she 'was near tears throughout' Netanyahu's speech because she was 'saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States' and 'by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation.' Later that afternoon Graham made fun of the California Democrat during a conversation with a donor, according to Bloomberg, saying, 'Did you see Nancy Pelosi on the floor. Complete disgust.' 'If you can get through all the surgeries, there’s disgust,' he remarked. Upon learning of Graham's comment, several of his Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate demanded that he retract the statement. If reports are 'accurate,' fellow South Carolinian James Clyburn said on Twitter, 'he owes her an apology.' 'What's disgusting are the horrific comments you made about the first woman Speaker of the House,' Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a close friend of Pelosi's, tweeted at Graham. Graham told NBC on Tuesday evening that while he found Pelosi's claim that she was near tears 'a bit disturbing' he shouldn't have insulted her appearance. 'I made a poor attempt at humor to talk about her reaction and for that I apologize,' he said. '[Netanyahu] is not the problem in the mid-east, it's the Iranians, and anyone who wants to focus on the Prime Minister of Israel I think has got their priorities wrong,' he added. Graham is a fierce opponent of the Obama administration's approach to foreign relations in the Middle East. He has said that he is 'testing the waters' for a presidential run, though he's not formally launched a campaign for the highest elected office in the nation.","Pelosi appeared less than enthused as Netanyahu asked Congress not to approve the nuclear deal the Obama administration is negotiating with Iran .

"Amateur gymnast Rosie Connolly collapsed and died after going for a swim - just one hour after rushing to the aid of a fellow gym user . A talented amateur gymnast collapsed and died after going for a swim - just one hour after rushing to the aid of a fellow gym user. Rosie Connolly, 21, a receptionist at the Laboratory Spa in Mill Hill - used by Olympics stars Anthony Joshua and Mark Foster - fell unconscious at the poolside after a swim. She had told staff she had felt unwell in the water and reportedly struggled to clamber out of the club pool. Two doctors battled to revive her as an ambulance crew arrived and took her to Barnet General Hospital. But the popular worker at the spa died shortly afterwards, following a suspected cardiac arrest. Just 50 minutes before the tragedy, Miss Connolly - a member of Childs Hill gymnastics club -  had rushed to help a club member who became ill in the changing rooms and had cared for them until an ambulance had arrived. The Laboratory Spa has opened a book of condolence. A colleague said: 'Everyone knew her here and loved her. She was a bubbly, smiley person and will be incredibly missed.' A club member added: 'Everyone was shocked to find out what happened to Rosie. She had her whole life in front of her. She was a lovely, hard-working girl who was always able to answer questions with a smile. She made people feel welcome.' Friends paid tribute to Miss Connolly, a member of Childs Hill gymnastics club who had performed in an international competition in Switzerland. Rosie's sister Hayley, 27, said at the family's home near the club that the family were too upset to talk about the death, the Evening Standard reported. She said : 'It's too raw for us.' Alexandra, a nurse, wrote: 'I can't believe it, my fellow dancer, the only one I truly trusted to pick me up without dropping me. You'll be missed, you beautiful girl.' Panayioda Kilikita, a trainer at the club, wrote on Facebook: 'Oh our beautiful Rosie why did you get taken? You are loved dearly and will be forever missed.'

"She's known as the Imelda Marcos of British politics with a shoe obsession that has seen her attend functions wearing everything from sparkling gold wellies to leopard print kitten heels. Yesterday, however, the Home Secretary, 58, put her best foot forward in a  brave choice for a very formal occasion - a pair of black patent leather, leopard-print over-the-knee boots. Joining the Queen, the Prime Minister and other dignitaries at the Horse Guards Parade in central London  to welcome Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto and his wife Angelica Rivera, Mrs May strode forth in the flamboyant footwear, even managing to perform a neat curtsy in said boots to greet Her Majesty. Scroll down for video . Theresa May, 58, plumps for thigh-high patent leather boots, pictured yesterday as she crunched over the gravel at Horse Guards Parade ahead of a ceremony with the Queen to greet the President of Mexico . A creak of leather as the Home Secretary dips her knees to curtsy for the Queen. Mrs May teamed the adventurous boots with a colourful red and gold coat and a warm pair of long red gloves . There was no optical illusion to the bright overcoat that the MP for Maidenhead was wearing either. The colourful red and gold number, which Mrs May has showcased before, more than matched the thigh-high boots for glamour. A 41-gun salute, fired by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery sounded as President Nieto and his wife arrived with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. On a particularly inclement day, perhaps the boots were as much about warmth as they were about fashion. It's also not the first time they've been seen; Mrs May donned the same pair - or something very similar - for another ceremonial greeting back in 2013 when the President of South Korea, Park Geun-Hye arrived for an official visit. Haven't we seen them somewhere before? Mrs May donned the boots - or something very similar - for another ceremonial greeting back in 2013 when the President of South Korea, Park Geun-Hye visited the UK . The MP is famously unapologetic about her fancy footwear, having described her sometimes maverick choices as a conversation starter. She once said: ‘I have no regrets (about being famous for my shoes). The good thing is that they are often an icebreaker.' The Conservative MP famously sported a pair of leopard-print kitten heels at the Conservatives’ annual party conference back in 2002...and the eye-catching footwear has kept coming ever since.

Teaming a leather skirt with roses on her feet (left), Mrs May's footwear choices have certainly earned her plenty of headlines and (right) a confident pose...and a sensible heel at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham in 2014 . Just last month a supporter at the Conservative fundraising Black and White Ball splashed out a cool £17,500 to go on a shoe-shopping mission with Mrs May. And the Home Secretary even suggested once that her shoe-style had encouraged a young supporter to venture into politics: 'I was in the Commons recently and saw a young lady wearing a nice pair of shoes. 'I said I liked them and she said my shoes were the reason she became involved in politics.' Although the Queen appeared unruffled by the Home Secretary's sartorial choices, fashion industry commentators were quick to question the biker chic look. Fashion Writer Simon Glazin questioned the appropriateness of the shoes for such a formal occasion: 'Wearing a pair of boots like this for a night at your friend's house is fine but I'd certainly question the choice when you're heading to a meeting with the Mexican President and shaking hands with the Queen. They looked uncomfortable to curtsy in.' A passion for red after all? Wearing a rather risque outfit at the Dorchester Hotel back in 2010 . 'It's the high-shine patent that is particularly unflattering. It can look, dare I say it, a bit cheap. They don't really go with that coat and gloves either, which are actually very chic.' Although it's unclear where Mrs May might have bought the boots from, shoe retailer Russell and Bromley have a strikingly similar pair of 'glossy black croc print patent leather' costing a not insubstantial £465 a pair. The brand describes the boot as easy to wear 'with black skinnies for understated glamour by day or dress up with tailored dresses for a cool twist on evening dressing.'","The Home Secretary wore the flamboyant over-the-knee boots to greet Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and his wife Angélica Rivera .

"Ever thought about switching your tampons for something a little more...sustainable? Since the menstrual cup - a reusable silicone cup that collects menstrual fluid - is rarely advertised, most women find themselves reluctant to try it. Writing for Healthista.com, I gave the Mooncup (or MCUK, as it is known in the US) a try - to work out what it is, how to use it, and what it actually feels like. WARNING: This is one graphic blog. If you are of the male persuasion, it’s best you move on, because I’m going to be talking about (gasp) menstruation. Specifically, menstrual cups which collect  menstrual fluid, unlike tampons and sanitary pads that absorb it. Scroll down for video . The Mooncup (or MCUK, as it is known in the US) is a reusable silicone cup that collects menstrual fluid . What draws most women to re-usable menstrual cups is that they are economical, eco-friendly and more comfortable as they don’t cause dryness or irritation -  a common bugbear of tampon users. ‘I just feel better about having a Mooncup in my body than I do a tampon,’ one menstrual cup devotee told me. Menstrual cups aren’t new - they were patented in 1932 by a group of U.S. midwives. But not many women use them or even know about them - perhaps due to the fact that menstrual cups aren’t widely promoted – or sold. Conglomerates such as Procter & Gamble are unlikely to throw big money into a product that only sells once every five years, when they can sell multiple products to one woman every month. Mother-of-four Genny Wilkinson-Priest says she was initially sceptical about menstrual cups - but was surprised at how effective hers was . With the global tampon market projected to top $2.6 billion in 2015, according to market research firm Global Industry Analysts, why would they put their money anywhere else? There are many menstrual cup brands on the market - the Femmecup, the Diva Cup, the Intimina and more. I tried the £18 ($27.50) Mooncup, which like most menstrual cups comes in two sizes: one for women who have given birth before, and one for women who haven’t or are under 30 years of age. This struck one friend as slightly odd: ‘I was 29 when I tried the Mooncup, which made me rather concerned as to what the hell was going to happen to my vagina on my 30th birthday? 'Was it going to expand that much?’ When I first opened the package and saw the Mooncup, I thought no freaking way am I putting that up my hoo-ha. And then I remembered I’ve given birth multiple times. If I can push a 7lb baby out four times in a five year period, surely I can handle a squishy piece of latex that's two inches in diameter . When I first opened the package, I thought no freaking way am I putting that up my hoo-ha. Whether or not you’ve had a baby, it’s dead easy - you fold the latex cup in half, then in half again. At that point it’s only slightly bigger than a tampon and a whole lot more malleable. Inserting the Mooncup was a lot easier than I thought. It should sit low in the vagina, with the tip of it sitting just outside your body. This took some getting used to as a tampon is inserted higher up in the vagina toward the cervix. Getting it out however, was another matter. I’ve heard some women reject the menstrual cup on the grounds that it’s the new toy of vintage-shopping, tree-hugging, flat-white drinking, vegan hipster,' says Ginny. 'Please. This isn’t a political statement' The Mooncup has a tendency to migrate upwards - especially if you inserted it too far up to begin with. If this happens, you have to do a fair bit of rooting around to pull the darn thing out. Using what is essentially a suction cup is a much more hands-on experience than using a tampon or pad. A handful of women I spoke to said they found menstrual cups uncomfortable with the edges of the cup digging into their vaginal wall. ‘I spent the day walking like a duck. My friends knew when I was on as I would sit in a slightly odd manner,’ said one. This, however, wasn’t my experience. I barely noticed it. You can leave a menstrual cup in for up to eight hours - that’s handy for overnight use. When it’s time to change, you just tip the fluid into a sink and wash it out before re-inserting. Many women I spoke to said this was one of the most fascinating aspects of a menstrual cup — you can actually see how much you bleed (the Mooncup is marked with measurements!) While some women might be put off from witnessing their period up close and personal like this, I found it connected me closer to my body. I felt as if I was more fully experiencing an aspect of my womanhood that I had in the past treated as a nuisance. For some women, it’s a matter of safeguarding their sense of what makes them a woman. 'What draws most women to re-usable menstrual cups is that they are economical, eco-friendly and more comfortable as they don’t cause dryness or irritation - a common bugbear of tampon users,' says Ginny . As one friend said, ‘After having a baby, something makes me want to protect my vagina more vigilantly, so I don’t want to put anything up there that could be potentially hazardous to my feminine health.’ As a life-long user of tampons I was distrustful of the Mooncup. But there was never a problem. So, does it actually work? I was a bit fearful of leaks at first; as a life-long user of tampons I was distrustful of the Mooncup. But there was never a problem. I went swimming with it, I did dynamic yoga with it (think splits and handstands), and I went to the movies with it. I am a convert, even as the Mooncup took a fair bit of getting used to. I’ll probably supplement the Mooncup with tampons when I’m traveling, or on a night out when I know there will be no private sink to sort out your business. Some women I spoke to said they bring a bottle of water into a public toilet in order to clean out their menstrual cup but this strikes me as more trouble than it’s worth. I’ve heard some women reject the menstrual cup on the grounds that it’s the new toy of vintage-shopping, tree-hugging, flat-white drinking, vegan hipsters. Please. This isn’t a political statement. It’s just a feminine hygiene product. One that works, too.

When the judge ordered her to stay away from her child, she seemed only happy to oblige. 'OK, I need a break anyway,' she said. Monique Miller, 34 (right), told a judge on Tuesday that she needs a break from parenting after her arrest for throwing her baby out of a car . Miller was also ordered on Tuesday to take all of her prescribed medications . Cops allegedly tried to pull Miller over Monday afternoon during a routine traffic stop,when the mother was driving with her baby on her lap. Miller at first refused, but when she eventually complied she started yelling obscenities at officers and then tossed her baby out the window. Luckily an officer was able to catch the baby safely. It's unclear how old the baby is. Miller was arrested in the incident, in which she also kicked the cop's car door, causing the door to slam into his head. The mother faces charges of child neglect, criminal mischief and battery on a law enforcement officer. As of Wednesday, she remained in jail on $7,500 bond. In addition to being ordered to stay away from her child, Miller was also told to take prescribed medications.","Monique Miller, 34, threw her baby out of her car during routine traffic stop in North Miami Beach, Florida on Monday ."
"Mother Nature is nothing if not unpredictable. By this time last year, she had painted the country in an array of spring colours. This year, however, experts reckon she’s running two weeks behind – the evidence of which can be seen in these pictures. The good news is, all that could change this weekend as the sun comes out and temperatures leap into the 60s. Riot of colour: Chloe Palmer and baby Jayden enjoying daffodils in bloom in Bournemouth, Dorset in March 2014 . Waiting game: Jennifer Campbell-Ross and her son Archie are pictured at the same spot yesterday with the daffodils yet to flower . Bloomin' lovely: A cherry tree at Cambridge in March 2014 is pictured left while the same tree was still waiting to shine yesterday (right) Twelve months ago flowers were already in full bloom, blossom was on the trees and wildlife was coming out of hibernation. But last month’s bitter cold snap has slowed things down this year. The contrast was noticed at the Royal Horticultural Society’s garden at Wisley, Surrey. Last year the ground was already clothed in bright yellow and purple crocuses after a mild winter. This year only a few flowers poke their heads above the ground. Colin Crosbie, curator at RHS Wisley, said: ‘We think we are probably about two weeks behind where we were last year. It has been a colder winter, the soil has been cooler and it has slowed everything down. But a few days of sunshine is all it could take for it to catch up.’ Student Tina Ding is pictured enjoying a field of purple and white crocuses on a sunny spring day in Aberdeen, Scotland this time last year . Gian Pierro is pictured in the same spot in Aberdeen yesterday with far fewer crocuses on show than at the same time last year . The Woodland Trust, which monitors the first signs of spring, said wildlife is also emerging slowly this year. Their volunteers have recorded only half the number of ladybirds they saw in March 2014. The average temperature in England for December, January and February this year was 4.4C – well below last year’s 5.8C. But that could all change in the next few days. Thermometers could nudge past 17C (63F) on Saturday as a tropical mass of air arrives from the Caribbean. National Trust wildlife specialist Matthew Oates said the slower spring is positive for many species, which need time to hibernate properly before they emerge. If butterflies, and small mammals awake too early, they tend to suffer later if the weather turns cold again. The spring flowers at the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley in Surrey were already putting on an impressive display by late Februay last year . In late Febraury this year, there were fewer flowers on display on the same patch of land at the Royal Horticultural Society’s garden at Wisley, Surrey . Meanwhile, England is set to be hotter than Athens, Corfu and Istanbul this weekend as temperatures are expected to soar as high as 16C in a bumper start to spring. Temperatures are set to increase as the week goes on and eventually peak on Saturday, where parts of the country are forecast to be warmer than many Mediterranean holiday spots. Much of the country has today seen a bright and sunny day as spring finally arrived, with tomorrow expected to be a dry, but cloudier day, with temperatures rising to 12C. The fine weather will continue in the south on Friday, but Scotland will see rain in the west and gale force gusts of up to 60mph in the north west. The weekend is set to be dry, with bright spells in south and south east England, with temperatures rising to 15C and possibly 16C in sheltered spots, but the rain will continue in western Scotland. Sunday will be slightly cooler, but another dry day with a good amount of sunny spells. There may be light showers in England and Wales later in the afternoon. 'The temperatures will get warmer as the week goes on,' said Dan Williams, of the Met Office. The sun rises across the North Sea this morning at the start of a bright and mild day in South Shields . In a sign of things to come, this stunning spring sunset was last night captured over Poole Harbour in Dorset . A group punt down the River Cam in Cambridge in what is forecast to be the start of a run of spring weather . 'By Saturday we could see temperatures of 14C or 15C and maybe even 16C in a sheltered location in London or the South East.' The warm weather will coincide with breezes of 20 - 30mph but temperatures will significantly exceed the average 10C for this time of year. Meanwhile, the early bursts of spring sunshine and a mild winter have seen this year's first crop of strawberries arrive a week early. The first homegrown strawberries of 2015 will arrive in supermarkets tomorrow - days ahead of schedule. Experts say fine weather with good levels of sunshine this week on top of a generally mild winter have helped growers produce the early fruit. And with temperatures set to reach 16C this weekend, the arrival of the strawberries at Tesco stores is a clear sign that spring is around the corner. Traditionally, the earliest home grown strawberries come from either Kent, Sussex or Hampshire but this year growers in Wales have won the race to produce the first. Tesco berry buyer Harriet Turnbull said: 'This is a real coup for Wales which only began growing strawberries on a commercial scale two years ago. 'These berries, grown in the Rhymney Valley, near Cardiff, will put Wales on the UK's strawberry growing map.' Kayleigh Cottle, 29, picks the first strawberries of the year at Haygrove Nursery in Wales . Thanks to milder winters in recent years, Britain on the whole is enjoying longer fruit growing seasons . The variety of the Welsh-grown strawberries is called Driscoll's Lusa and has been selected because of its consistent, sweet taste. Thanks to milder winters recently, Britain on the whole is enjoying longer fruit growing seasons. The British strawberry season can now last for up to nine months - a whole four months longer than last decade years ago when winters were longer and harsher. Ms Turnbull added: 'The arrival of the first home grown strawberries brings about a real feel good factor - not only does it herald the start of British summer time but it is also the start of the UK produce growing season.'","Parts of Britain expected to be warmer than Athens and Istanbul this weekend with temperatures soaring to 16C .
Today was the start of a stretch of increasingly warm spring weather that is expected to peak on Saturday .

"Don't skimp on proteins, try swapping quinoa for rice and gulp down fermented milk, kefir. These are just some of the foods and drinks you need to be incorporating into your post-exercise diet. And try to eat within an hour of finishing your workout as that's when your body needs it most as it  starts to burn food as well as recover. What you eat after a workout can increase the benefits of exercise . 'What you eat post workout is extremely important. The aim of a healthy post workout snack/meal is to improve recovery, reduce muscle soreness, increase the ability to build muscle and to help with your immune system,' said Shona Wilkinson, head nutritionist at NutriCentre. 'It is best to eat your food within one hour after you finish your exercise. Waiting too long will mean that you don't refill your glycogen stores and wont recover fully,' she continued. According to Ms Wilkinson, the perfect post workout snack or meal consists of both carbs and protein. Good examples include wholewheat muffins with nut butter, scrambled eggs on whole wheat toast and chicken breast with brown rice or quinoa. Try swapping quinoa (left)  for rice when cooking a post-gym meal. Hummus and pita (right) are good snacks as they contain carbohydrates and protein . A good source of protein and fibre, quinoa gets the thumbs of from Ms Wilkinson. 'This is a great food to have after a workout to ensure you are getting a good intake of nutrients,' she explained. The nutrionist also explained what kefir is, and why it's good for you. 'Kefir results when milk is combined with bacteria and allowed to ferment,' she said. 'It is high in protein and will help with the recovery of your muscles.' Wholewheat pitta and hummus can provide much needed carbs and protein whilst pineapple, rich in an enzyme called bromelain, is useful for preventing injuries. You can still indulge in a plate of fish and chips; just make sure that you have oily fish instead of cod or hake . Steak contains zinc which is critical to prostate health and fertility, and iron which is a key component of oxygen delivery within your cells . Starchy vegetables such as sweet potato can be eaten hot or cold green vegetables such as broccoli, kale and beans help alkalise the body. And while fried fish and chips may not necessarily sound healthy, swapping oily fish such as mackerel, salmon, sardines or anchovies for cod and hake, will improve body fat burning. Finally steak, which contains zinc as well as protein, helps deliver oxygen to cells. Here FEMAIL has identified the foods you need to incorporate into your diet to ensure your body recovers well from a workout. Quinoa . Quiona is a great alternative to rice. I often recommend it as it is a good source of protein and fibre. This is a great food to have after a workout to ensure you are getting a good intake of nutrients,' Ms Wilkinson said. Kefir . 'It is becoming increasingly popular due to its probiotic content which can help with digestive health,' said Ms Wilkinson. 'It is also high in protein. You can drink a cup of kefir after a workout for a healthy way to get a good healthy intake of protein to help with the repair and recovery of your muscles.' Pita and hummus . 'Pitta and hummus is a great combination for a post workout snack,' the nutrionist advised. 'Go for wholewheat pita rather than white pita. Hummus is a good source of protein and carbs. The wholewheat pita is a good source of slow releasing carbs to keep your energy levels up. Sweet potato (left) is a nutritionally dense carb whilst green vegetables (right) will help prevent fatigue . Fermented milk kefir is high in protein and will help with muscle recovery . Pineapple . Pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain. Bromelain helps with digesting protein and is a helpful anti-inflammatory which is useful for preventing injuries. Pineapple also contains fibre, vitamin B6, manganese and is a great source of Vitamin C. Steak is high in protein, which is excellent for muscle recovery and also in iron stores which helps reduce fatigue. It's an ideal meat for athletes to consume during their training programme. Sweet potato is an excellent carbohydrate source so it contributes to the recovery of normal muscle function after hard training. The green veg provides vitamins A and C which support the immune system to function normally, which is hampered with hard training. Sweet potato . Try a starchy vegetable such as sweet potato for a nutritionally dense carbohydrate snack after your workout. Sweet potato is just as delicious whether eaten hot or cold. Fish and chips . Opt for a healthy version of fish and chips. Go for an oily fish such as mackerel, salmon, sardines or anchovies. These fish contain plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids to improve body fat burning as well as a good source of protein to help rebuild muscle. Steak . A a great source of protein. It also contains zinc which is critical to prostate health and fertility, iron which is a key component of oxygen delivery within your cells and selenium which gives your immune system a boost. Green vegetables . Green vegetables are anti-inflammatory and also help alkalise the body. This will help towards preventing muscle pain, fatigue and injury. The perfect meal for athletes is an 8oz New York sirloin strip steak served with sweet potato mash, kale, samphire, mangetout and broccoli . Earlier this year London chef and former Olympian Francis Agyepong at Christopher's restaurant in Covent Garden served the perfect meal for athletes to to Olympic gold medallist Christine Ohuruogu and world junior champion Dina Asher-Smith. Comprising an 8oz New York sirloin strip steak served with sweet potato mash, kale, samphire, mange tout and broccoli, the hearty offering has all right balance of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals. Mr Agu said: 'This is the perfect meal for an athlete, with the right balance of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals. 'Steak is high in protein, which is excellent for muscle recovery and also in iron stores which helps reduce fatigue. It's an ideal meat for athletes to consume during their training programme. 'Sweet potato is an excellent carbohydrate source so it contributes to the recovery of normal muscle function after hard training.

"India has banned the broadcast of a controversial documentary in which one of the men who gang-raped and murdered a student is shown blaming the victim - a move the film's maker called 'arbitrary censorship'. Home Minister Rajnath Singh told India's parliament on Wednesday the comments of Mukesh Singh, one of five men convicted over the 2012 attack in New Delhi, were 'highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women'. 'The government condemns it,' he said of the documentary made by award-winning British film-maker Leslee Udwin, who won rare access to New Delhi's Tihar jail to interview the prisoner on death row. Scroll down for video . Indian activists take part in a vigil to mark the second anniversary of the fatal gang-rape of a student in New Delhi . 'It will not allow any organisation to leverage such an incident and use it for commercial purpose,' he said of the film, which charts the aftermath of the fatal gang-rape. Singh's comments in the Rajya Sabha, India's upper house, came after a New Delhi court late Tuesday issued an order banning media from showing the film, 'India's Daughter'. The reasons for the court ban were not immediately clear, but some in India have expressed concern that a convicted rapist was being given a platform for his views. Spokesman Rajan Bhagat said the New Delhi police had petitioned the court for a ban on the grounds that the film's 'objectionable content' could cause public disorder. The physiotherapy student died from her injuries 13 days after she was savagely attacked on a bus while on her way home from the cinema. The incident  triggered violent protests in India. It highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in the world's second most populous country and led to a major reform of India's rape laws, speeding up trials and increasing penalties. India's NDTV network was due to have shown the documentary to mark International Women's Day on Sunday, when it will also be broadcast in six other countries including Britain. Udwin said she was heart-broken by the ban on the documentary, in which Mukesh Singh said the 23-year-old victim was to blame for her own death. He said: 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night .... Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes.' The woman and her friend were returning home from seeing a movie at an upscale mall when they were tricked by the men into getting on the bus, which they'd taken out for a joyride. The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death. Singh, who was driving the bus, added: 'She should just be silent and allow the rape.' Police officers escort Mukesh Singh, one of the men convicted of the gang-rape and murder of an Indian student, outside the High Court in New Delhi, on September 24, 2013 . 'I am sure, positive, that NDTV will fight this arbitrary censorship all the way, because it is an organisation that stands up for values, for public welfare and for the greater good,' she told AFP. 'India is a country that values its rights and one of the most important of them is the freedom of speech, expression and that needs to be upheld.' Udwin said earlier she had permission from both prison authorities and the home ministry to film inside the vast Tihar jail in Delhi for her documentary. But Home Minister Singh said she had violated the terms of the agreement by not showing the complete unedited footage to jail officials. The documentary divided lawmakers on Wednesday, with many applauding the ban but others saying India must confront views such as the rapist's - however abhorrent. 'Banning this movie is not the answer,' said Anu Agha, an independent MP. 'We have to confront the issue that men in India do not respect women and any time there is a rape, blame is put on the woman.' No one at the NDTV network could immediately be reached for comment on the ban. But Udwin said she believed the move would only serve to increase interest in her film. 'The more they try to stop the film, the more they are going to pique people's interest,' she said. 'Now, everyone is going to want to see it.' Four men including Mukesh were sentenced to death for the crime, but their execution was later stayed on appeal by India's Supreme Court. One of the defendants hanged himself in prison, while another, who was under 18 at the time, got three years in juvenile detention.

"MI5 has been condemned over its handling of the case of bloodthirsty Islamist Jihadi John (pictured) No organisation is more important in the fight against terrorism within our society than MI5. The security and intelligence service’s crest rightly reminds its officers of their duty ‘to defend our realm’. Yet in recent days the service has been ferociously attacked over its handling of the case of the bloodthirsty Islamist Jihadi John, now unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi, a computer graduate from the University of Westminster. Much of this condemnation has focused on the revelation that, before he left to join the IS jihad in Syria, Emwazi was known to MI5 as an extremist and may even have had links to the 2005 London bombers. But there have also been noisy complaints, widely relayed across the media, that it was MI5’s supposedly heavy-handed surveillance which drove Emwazi down the path to radicalism. All too predictably, the verbal assault on the security service has been led by the BBC which, with typical self-importance and disdain for our national interests, has set itself up as judge and jury over the saga. Like the left-wing Guardian newspaper, the BBC has been giving copious airtime to the nauseating pressure group Cage, which has a long record of providing support for Islamist terror suspects. Given an undeserved platform by the BBC, Cage’s spokesman Asim Qureshi peddled the revolting propaganda line that Emwazi had been a ‘gentle’ and ‘beautiful’ man until apparently forced to become a sadistic executioner because of MI5’s cruel harassment. According to Qureshi’s grotesque theory, this harassment by MI5 began after Emwazi had attempted to go on ‘safari’ to Africa with a couple of other Muslim extremists – he was arrested on landing in Tanzania en route to Somalia – following his graduation. The complaint of heavy-handedness in dealing with extremist suspects is simply absurd. Spooking people like Emwazi is absolutely necessary. They should feel they are being monitored. To inflict on the British public such special pleading as Qureshi’s and twisting of the evidence in support of a murderous death cult is a betrayal of BBC values. It is the moral equivalent of giving Joseph Goebbels a slot on BBC Radio Four’s Thought for the Day. There have also been noisy complaints that it was MI5’s supposedly heavy-handed surveillance which drove Emwazi down the path to radicalism - an attack which is both 'unfair and counter-productive' The drivel about Jihadi John was then reinforced by senior Tory MP David Davis on yesterday’s Jeremy Vine programme on Radio Two. He rejected the theory that Emwazi had merely gone to Africa on ‘safari’. But he repeated accusations he had already made in the Guardian (a paper which has already done deep damage to our national security by publishing intelligence documents leaked by US National Security Agency traitor Edward Snowden), that MI5 were guilty of ‘confusion of aims and ineffective tactics that leave known terrorists to carry out evil deeds and recruit more conspirators’. In his ill-informed contribution, he further suggested that MI5 should simply arrest jihadis and bring them to trial. Asim Qureshi, spokesman for pressure group Cage, said Emwazi had been ‘gentle’ until he was apparently harassed by MI5 . All this criticism of MI5 is both unfair and counter-productive. The only people who gain from it are the terrorists and their supporters. The attack on their work, delivered from the cosiness of media studios, represents little more than the politics of distraction, putting the blame for extremism on those who are trying to defend us, while letting off the zealots who are the real threat. The problem with MI5 is not that it is too interventionist, as Cage and many of the chattering classes pretend, but that, because of its lack of resources and powers, it is insufficiently interventionist. Too often it wants to act as a ‘fire-fighting unit’, where it really needs to be a fire-prevention one. But it needs the tools and manpower to do so. Contrary to all the nonsense talked this week, we should recognise that MI5 has done a remarkable job in foiling a vast number of Islamist plots. Its successes are the terrorist plots that are disrupted and the planes that don’t get blown out of the sky. We don’t get to hear about these. Of course, there have been disastrous failures, such as the 2005 London bombings, and, before this, a reluctance to recognise that Al Qaeda regarded the entire West as the enemy, not just the Middle East. MI5 have learned that lesson now; some say too late. I would say better late than never. It is now a security service we should and can be proud of. MI5 are still keeping us safe. Most fair-minded British people would say: good on them.

"The execution of the only woman on Georgia's death row , Kelly Gissendaner (pictured), was delayed for a second time on Monday because the lethal injection was 'cloudy' Georgia has taken the decision to temporarily halt executions after the drug used for lethal injections appeared faulty, authorities said. Tuesday's decision came a day after the execution of Kelly Gissendaner was delayed for a second time when the execution team found that the lethal pentobarbital dose appeared cloudy. Gissendaner, who was convicted of murder in the February 1997 slaying of her husband, had originally been set for execution last week on February 25, but it was postponed because of a threat of bad weather. The cloudy drug bolstered death penalty opponents, who have been vocal in their opposition after three botched executions in other parts of the country. Attorneys for Gissendaner said in a filing with the U.S. Supreme Court that a lawyer for the state called them around 10:25 p.m. on Monday to say the execution would be postponed for several days because the state's pharmacist had looked at the drug an hour earlier and determined it was cloudy. The state's lawyer called back about five minutes later to say the prison wasn't sure which drugs they had checked, 'this week's or last week's,' and that they were considering going forward, the filing says. The lawyer called a third time, saying 'this particular batch (of drugs) just didn't come out like it was supposed to' and they weren't going to proceed, according to the court filing. Scroll down for video . 'Kelly is loved': Death penalty opponents gathered on the steps of Georgia's State Capitol in Atlanta on Monday evening. The cloudy drug bolstered death penalty opponents, who have been vocal in their opposition after three botched executions in other parts of the country . About 11 p.m., the state told reporters an independent lab checked its potency and it was acceptable, but it later appeared cloudy and the execution was postponed 'out of an abundance of caution.' The back and forth was detailed in Gissendaner's emergency motion for a stay. Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said 'there was never any confusion within the department about the drugs which were to be used,' but also indicated the department was not part of the conversations between the attorney general's office and defense attorneys. Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said in a statement it is 'essential that executions are carried out in a constitutional manner' and that he approved of the decision to temporarily suspend executions. The cloudiness could be contamination by bacteria or some impurity, said Michael Jay, a professor at the University of North Carolina's Eshelman School of Pharmacy. If the particles were big enough, they could clog blood vessels when injected or could lodge in the lungs, Jay said. It could also make the drug less potent, making an inmate very sleepy but not kill them, he said. Locked away: Gissendaner (pictured  in 2004) would have become the 16th female prisoner to be executed in the United States since the death penalty was reinstated nationwide in 1976 . 'If it's a solution that's supposed to be clear and it's not clear, it should never be injected,' Jay said. 'So they did the right thing by not injecting it.' Compounded drugs have a shelf life of 30 days, Jay said. Corrections officials declined to say when the department obtained the drug or when it was set to expire. Georgia and other death penalty states have bought execution drugs from compounding pharmacies in recent years after pharmaceutical companies stopped selling to U.S. prisons. And many of them have adopted laws to hide the identity of their drug providers, saying those laws are necessary to protect their suppliers and maintain a source of the drugs. Critics say executions should be as transparent as possible. The cloudy drug 'raises significant concerns about Georgia's ability to carry out executions in compliance with the Constitution, but we don't know what really happened,' said Megan McCracken of the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law's Death Penalty Clinic. 'Because of the secrecy surrounding Georgia's procedures, it is impossible to say if this is indicative of a larger problem,' she said. Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks data on executions, said he's never heard of an execution being halted at the last minute because of a problem with the drug itself. Murder: Gissendaner (pictured, left, in her arrest mugshot from 1997) had been due to be executed for plotting the murder of her husband, Douglas. However, it was her boyfriend Gregory Owen (right) who carried out the deed. He will be eligible for parole in eight years after accepting a life sentence and testifying against Gissendaner . Missouri and Texas are also actively using compounded pentobarbital in a one-drug formula for executions, and South Dakota has also used this method, McCracken said. Other states have been using a three-drug combination starting with the sedative midazolam. But executions in those states are mostly on hold pending a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in an Oklahoma case sparked by a botched execution there. Prosecutors said Gissendaner repeatedly pushed her on-again, off-again lover Gregory Owen to kill her husband, Douglas Gissendaner. Owen ambushed her husband while she went out with friends, forced him to drive to a remote area and stabbed him multiple times. Owen and Gissendaner then met up and set fire to the dead man's car. Both initially denied involvement, but Owen eventually confessed and testified against his former girlfriend. Owen is serving a life prison sentence and is eligible for parole in eight years. Monster meal: Gissendaner (pictured, above, eating a regular prison meal) had just finished eating the enormous spread she had requested for her last meal - including two cheeseburger meals, two large orders of fries, cornbread, popcorn and ice cream - when it was announced that the execution wasn't going ahead . Georgia houses one of the country's biggest prison systems, supervising nearly 55,000 state prisoners and more than 160,000 people on probation. Gissandaner would have become the 16th female prisoner to be executed in the United States since the death penalty was reinstated nationwide in 1976, compared with 1,387 men who have been put to death during that period, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Georgia has executed 57 prisoners since 1976, including two so far this year. Prisoner complaints from the southern state had led to the 1972 moratorium on the death penalty, before it was re-established four years later.","Executions have been temporarily halted in the state after the drug used for lethal injections appeared faulty on Monday night .

"Astronomers are counting down the days before a total solar eclipse appears over Earth. But the highly-anticipated show on March 20th can only be witnessed in full by those in northern Scandinavia and the Faroe Islands. Now scientists have come up with a plan for anyone to see a 360 degree view of the eclipse using GoPro cameras high above Earth's stratosphere. Scroll down for video . The highly-anticipated show on March 20th can only be witnessed in full by those in northern Scandinavia and the Faroe Islands. But now scientists have come up with a plan for anyone to see a 360 degree view of the eclipse using GoPro cameras high above Earth's stratosphere . 'Eclipses happen quite often. But this one’s different,' said project coordinater Annelie Schoenmaker. 'The moon’s shadow will sweep over the North Pole.' Ms Schoenmaker explained that seen from the North Pole, the moon's diameter will appear larger than the sun itself, blocking all direct sunlight and turning day into night. This means that the solar eclipse will take place just as the sun comes into view after six months of polar night. Her 'zero2infinity' group recently launched an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for the project. Their plan is to launch a balloon carrying GoPro cameras to record a 360 degree video of the eclipse from at least 31 miles (50km) above Earth. The Spanish group recently launched an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for the project. Their plan is to launch a balloon carrying GoPro cameras to record a 360 degree video of the eclipse from at least 31 miles (50km) above Earth . The path of totality for next month's eclipse will travel from just beneath the Greenland peninsula, heading north into the Arctic Circle. The left-hand animation shows the totality of the 1999 eclipse. The right-hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 March will travel over Europe . Projection: Place a pinhole or small opening in a card, and hold it between the sun and a screen – giant sheet of white paper works – a few feet away. Filters: The sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose. Such filters have a thin layer of aluminum, chromium or silver on the surfaces. Telescopes with solar filters: There are sun-specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse. On a mobile device: If the Indiegogo project is successful, you could stream a 360 degree, HD view of the eclipse onto a mobile device. On the ground, participants will get a live stream into their tablet or smart phone showing the stunning event. So far the Barcelona-based team have raised $3,000 dollars towards their goal to raise $28,000 with just 26 days left. The eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in London - and around 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Dr Steve Bell, head of the HM Nautical Almanac Office told MailOnline that Torshavn in the Faroe Islands will see two minutes and two seconds of totality. And the maximum duration of totality will be two minutes 47 seconds at a point 186 miles (300km) to the east of Iceland in the Norwegian Sea. In London, the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun's edge - will start at 8.45am GMT. The maximum eclipse will hit at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. By 10.41am the moon will leave the sun's edge and the partial eclipse will end. The solar eclipse is set to block out nearly 90 per cent of sunlight across parts of Europe next month. On the morning of the 20 March the moon's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun casting a shadow over Earth - and the eclipse will be the biggest event of its kind since 11 August 1999 (pictured over Germany) This animation is designed to appear from the 'point of view' of the eclipse as it will occur on March 20. It shows the shadow being cast over the UK, Greenland, Europe and into Russia . The path of totality of next month's eclipse travels from just beneath the Greenland peninsula, heading north into the Arctic Circle. Totality is the path the full shadow travels across the surface of the Earth, while a partial solar eclipse will be visible over a region thousands of miles wide. Dr Bell added: 'The path of totality lies well to the northwest of the UK making landfall over the Faroe Islands and Svalbard as totality moves towards the North Pole. 'The UK will see this eclipse as a deep partial eclipse. The eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in London and around 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. A partial eclipse will be visible across Europe, North Africa and Russia for about 90 minutes. Northern Scandinavia and the Faroe Islands will experience a full eclipse for two-and-a-half minutes . 'The place that sees the deepest partial eclipse of the sun in the UK is the west coast of the Isle of Lewis close to Aird Uig. 'Here 98 per cent of the sun will be obscured at mid-eclipse at around 9:36am GMT. 'Skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent which includes north-western Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetland Islands. The last solar eclipse of a similar size took place on 11 August 1999 and had an eclipse magnitude of 1.029. An eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the sun’s diameter obscured by the moon. It is based on a ratio of diameters and differs from an eclipse obscuration, which is a measure of the sun’s surface area covered by the Moon. The value given is taken at the moment when the eclipse is at its maximum. The path of the moon's shadow in August 1999 began in the Atlantic Ocean before covering the south of the UK, northern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, southern Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary. It was said to have been the first total eclipse visible in Europe since 22 July 1990, and the first visible in the UK since 29 June 1927. The solar eclipse  will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered over London and around 94 per cent in the main cities in Scotland (pictured is a full eclipse over Australia in 2012). Northern Scandinavia and the Faroe Islands will experience a full eclipse for two minutes and nine seconds . Dr Bell continued: 'In a global context, the maximum duration of totality for next month’s eclipse will exceed the maximum of two minutes and 23 seconds of totality for the 1999 eclipse, which occurred close to Ramnicu Valcea in Romania. 'This is still quite a long way short of the theoretical maximum duration of totality which can reach seven minutes 31 seconds.' There will not be another total eclipse until 2026. Tom Kerss, astronomer at The Royal Observatory Greenwich told MailOnline: 'Since the moon is smaller than the Earth, and very far away, the properly dark shadow it casts will only be about 100 miles wide, and will spend most of its time darkening the chilly waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. 'However, if the weather is clear, observers on Svalbard and the Faroes should experience almost three minutes of extraordinary day-time darkness. 'What’s more, lunar perigee - the time in the Lunar month when the Earth and Moon are closest together - will occur the evening before the eclipse. This makes our 2015 Spring Equinox eclipse a ‘supermoon’ eclipse - perhaps we should call that a supereclipse. 'Since the shadow of the moon will be ever so slightly larger in this scenario, it might appear slightly darker during totality, but in practise I think this would be difficult to detect, even by an experienced eclipse chaser. 'Nevertheless, it’s nice to have a supermoon, equinox and eclipse all falling on the same day.' A total solar eclipse is only visible from a certain region on Earth and those who can see it are in the centre of the moon's shadow when it hits Earth. For a total eclipse to take place, the sun, moon and Earth must be in a direct line. The totality of the 11 August 1999 eclipse is shown . An eclipse occurs when one heavenly body, such as a moon or planet, moves into the shadow of another. On Earth there are two types - lunar eclipses and solar eclipses. Lunar eclipse: For a lunar eclipse, the Earth moves between the sun and the moon and blocks sunlight normally reflected by the moon. Instead of light hitting the moon’s surface, Earth's shadow falls on it and a lunar eclipse can only happen when the moon is full. Solar eclipse: By comparison, a solar eclipse occurs when the orbit of the moon moves it between the sun and Earth. A solar eclipse occurs when the orbit of the moon moves it between the sun and Earth. When this happens, the moon blocks the light of the sun . When this happens, the moon blocks the light of the sun reaching Earth and the moon casts a shadow on Earth. Types of shadow: During a solar eclipse, the moon casts two shadows on Earth. The first shadow is called the umbra, and this gets smaller as it reaches Earth. The second shadow is known as the penumbra, and this gets larger as it reaches Earth. There are additionally three types of solar eclipses: . Total: A total solar eclipse is only visible from a certain region on Earth and those who can see it are in the centre of the moon's shadow when it hits Earth. For a total eclipse to take place, the sun, moon and Earth must be in a direct line. People standing in the umbra will see a total eclipse and this will occur over the Faroe Islands on 20 March. Partial solar eclipse: This occurs when the sun, moon and Earth don't line up exactly. People standing in the penumbra will see a partial eclipse. Annular: An annular eclipse happens when the moon is farthest from Earth. Because the moon is further from Earth, it appears smaller. As a result, it doesn't block the entire view of the sun. The moon in front of the sun resembles a dark disk on top of a larger sun-colored disk and creates what looks like a ring around the moon.

"A school bus driver forced a 6-year-old boy to exit at the wrong stop, an Indianapolis mother claimed this week. The woman, Kelly Beers, has said her son Cameron had to walk home through knee-deep snow on the side of a heavily-trafficked road. Beers told a local television station that Cameron was distraught when he raced back to the family's apartment. 'I just saw him run around the corner with snow up to his knees,' Beers recalled in an interview with WXIN-TV. 'His face was red and he was crying. I’m like ""What happened?"" Scroll down for video . Student: Kelly Beers has claimed that a school bus driver forced her 6-year-old son Cameron, seen here, to get off at the wrong stop . The way back: The stop was approximately a half-mile from where Cameron lives, and his trek involved knee-high snow . 'He said, ""The bus driver dropped me off at the wrong stop and he wouldn't listen to me when I told him I don't live there.""' The incident happened Monday on the city's southwest side, WXIN-TV reported. According to Beers, the substitute driver would not listen to Cameron after he said he didn't exit at the final stop on the route. 'I said, ""Well did you tell him that you don't live over there?""' Beers told WXIN-TV. 'He said, ""Yes but he wouldn't listen to me."" And I wish I could see the video, but ironically, it wasn't working.' The stop was approximately a half-mile from where Cameron lives and his trek involved knee-high snow, WXIN-TV reported. The boy's adoptive father was killed by a car last year while walking next to a road when deep snow covered the sidewalks. Mother: Kelly Beers, pictured, has said that her son Cameron was upset when he raced back to the family's apartment after the incident . School: Cameron is a student at Blue Academy, part of the Metropolitan School District of Decatur Township . Beers also told WXIN-TV of her son 'He could have gotten hit. It could have took one slip on Lynhurst [the road where he got off].' According to the Fox affiliate, Cameron's normal bus was being worked on so he took an alternate bus to school - and he  took the alternate bus when school was out since he didn't know the normal bus was operating again. Officials with the school district told WXIN-TV they continue to look into the matter and will consider how to keep it from happening again.","Kelly Beers has said that a school bus driver forced her 6-year-old son get off at the wrong stop .

"The lead guitarist of Black Sabbath has tried to appeal to the Indonesian president's love of heavy metal to spare the lives of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Tony Iommi wrote a letter to President Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair. This comes as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop used parliament to directly plead with the Indonesian president. However the Indonesian ambassador has defended his government in a letter responding to a Senate attempt to save the Bali Nine duo.

Tony Iommi (left) wrote a letter to President Joko Widodo (right) to ask for clemency for the Australian pair . Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) were transferred to Nusakambangan island on Wednesday to await their execution . 'I appeal to you, as a forgiving man, to take note of their transformation,' Tony Iommi wrote in a letter to President Joko Widodo about the two Australian drug smugglers on death row. 'They are now reformed men who are making a positive difference to the lives of their fellow prisoners. 'For this reason, I would ask that you stop the execution of Andrew and Myuran. 'Please allow them to serve out life sentences where they contribute to the well-being of Indonesia and make good for the error of their previous ways.' On Wednesday, Ms Bishop told parliament that Indonesian authorities were preparing for the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. 'On behalf of the parliament, I respectfully ask of the Indonesian president that he spare the lives of these two Australian citizens,' Ms Bishop said. She said she had spoken with the two families on Wednesday morning. 'As you can imagine they are devastated but they are just living day by day,' she said. A plea for clemency was rejected in January but since then the government has been seeking a permanent stay of execution. Indonesia's ambassador Nadjib Riphat Kesoema has written to federal parliament defending his government's decision not to save two Australian drug smugglers on death row . Ms Bishop said there were grounds for clemency and the government believed there were still legal avenues open to the pair. 'The grounds are that both men have shown immense remorse for their grave crimes and... have undergone an extraordinary rehabilitation'. Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek supported the minister's remarks. 'We are united in opposing the death penalty in this case as we are in every case,' she said. 'We would plead with the Indonesian government and the people of Indonesia ... for the lives of two young men who have made enormous transformations in their lives and who are making enormous transformations in the lives of other people as well.' In the Senate, Attorney-General George Brandis said the government had made at least 22 representations to Indonesian officials since January in a bid to save the two men. That included letters and phone calls from Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Ms Bishop and the Australian Federal Police. ASIO chief Duncan Lewis and Attorney-General Department secretary Chris Moraitis had also been sent to Indonesia to plead for the pair. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has used parliament to directly plead with the Indonesian president to spare the lives of two Australian drug smugglers . Indonesia's ambassador Nadjib Riphat Kesoema has written to federal parliament defending his government's decision not to save two Australian drug smugglers on death row. The Senate last month urged the Indonesian government to spare the lives of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are expected to face the firing squad in the next few days. In response, Mr Kesoema said the decision not to pardon the pair was very difficult for President Joko Widodo on both a personal and humanitarian level. However, the drug problem had 'blossomed into a national emergency' and required strong law enforcement. 'Most tragically, drugs and their traffickers and producers have denied too many people including children of their right to life,' he wrote. Mr Kesoema said both cases had been granted due process of law and all legal avenues had been pursued. He defended the court's decision to impose the death penalty and said separation of powers meant the government could not meddle in judicial processes. The upper house had argued the sentences should be commuted to a prison term due to the pair's genuine remorse and rehabilitation. Chan and Sukumaran were transferred to Nusakambangan island on Wednesday to await their execution.","Black Sabbath lead guitarist Tony Iommi has written a letter to the Indonesian president .

"Wayne Elphick, 43, peddled cocaine using his disabled mother's taxpayer-funded Motability car . A drug dealer who peddled cocaine using his disabled mother's taxpayer-funded Motability car has been jailed. Wayne Elphick, 43, cruised the streets looking for clients in the specially adapted Seat Leon – which was bought with a government grant to help his 64-year-old mother Patricia get around. Police stopped him near his home in Moston, Manchester, in October last year and discovered £550 worth of cocaine hidden in his underpants. They also found £272 in cash. Officers subsequently raided the house Elphick shared with his mother and found £900 worth of cocaine, scales, a drug debtors list and £290 in cash. Elphick admitted cocaine possession with intent to supply and was jailed for two-and-a-half years. He had initially claimed the drug was for personal use, Manchester Crown Court heard. Detective Sergeant Andrew Buckthorpe, of Greater Manchester Police, said Elphick: 'This conviction shows that GMP will absolutely not tolerate drug dealing in our communities. 'Elphick used a car purchased with a government grant to deal cocaine around the Greater Manchester area, thumbing his nose at both the law and the good faith in which that car was provided to help his ailing mother. 'This case falls part of Operation Challenger Cairo, which is a proactive investigation aimed at tackling organised crime groups, specifically those involved in the sale and supply of drugs. 'Drugs can have a devastating impact on people's lives, not just the users but their families.

"A bankrupt solicitor who owes more than £52million to a bank was ‘barricaded in’ at his mansion, a court heard. Brian O’Donnell and his doctor wife Mary Pat – who once controlled a vast global property empire – have fought attempts by Bank of Ireland to recover the millions for the past four years. At midday on Monday, bank-appointed receiver Tom Kavanagh was due to take possession of Gorse Hill in Killiney, south Dublin, by order of the Supreme Court. Property tycoon Brian O'Donnell and his wife Mary Pat, who have fought attempts by the Bank of Ireland to recover the £52million they owe . John Marton, a member of the anti-repossession group Land League stand at the gates to Mr O'Donnell's Dublin mansion, where he has barricaded himself in . A bank-appointed receiver was due to take possession of Gorse Hill in Killiney, south Dublin, pictured, by order of the Supreme Court . And members of anti-repossession group, the Land League, congregated at the O’Donnells’ south Dublin fortress. But now O'Donnell has been accused of trespassing on the property as he refused to leave the mansion. It came after a trespass notice was nailed to the front gate of the mansion by representatives of the receivers and O'Donnell was asked to leave the house immediately. But in a fresh case by O'Donnell's children, they claim the bank ‘fraudulently’ secured the €70million (£52million) judgment against their parents and therefore the house cannot be seized on foot of that court order, made in December 2011. Cian Ferriter SC, for the bank, said the O’Donnells’ claims were ‘utterly wild’. He described the notion of any conspiracy by the bank and its advisers against the family as ‘deluded’. The court heard that the four offspring had in fact surrendered their rights over their home yesterday morning – but that their father was now occupying the property. Representatives thought to be from the receiver's office nail a trespass notice to the front gate of O'Donnell's home in Dublin . The notice means that Mr O'Donnell now stands accused of trespassing after refusing to leave the property immediately under orders by the court . Rossa Fanning, for the receiver, told the court: ‘The property has been barricaded in this afternoon.’ The court heard that in a written statement, Brian O’Donnell had threatened to call gardaí (police) if the bank’s receiver ‘should harass us’. His statement, read to the court by Mr Ferriter, said: ‘My wife and I have a right of residence in Gorse Hill... Should Tom Kavanagh harass us at the property on March 2, we will call the police.’ Mr Ferriter told the court he understood that protesters from the Land League organisation had ‘erected some sort of barricade at the property’. He added: ‘We understand a member of the family is in the house, Brian O’Donnell. ‘This is the type of behaviour orchestrated by the O’Donnell family is in the face of what the Supreme Court determined. We are most troubled by that.’ John Martin from the Land League pictured at the front door to Gorse Hill, where Mr O'Donnell has barricaded himself in . Mr Ferriter pointed out that the couple had previously stated they were permanent residents of London, but were ‘now moving back in’ to the Dublin home. Blake O’Donnell, 31, told the court the bank was ‘attempting to remove us from the property and seize it’. He said Bank of Ireland had ‘run our family into the courts to try and get judgments and seize our assets from us.’ Blake added his parents ‘are in occupation of the property at the moment’ and they have a ‘right of residence’. He added: ‘Myself and my siblings, we have left. It was in the media we were going to be thrown out of the house and I understand a group of protesters have turned up to protest peacefully. 'This idea people are barricaded in, I don’t know anything about that. I think it’s sensationalism by the media.’ Mr Justice Brian McGovern said he will give his ruling on the fresh lawsuit today. Meanwhile, at the gates of Brian O’Donnell’s lavish Vico Road home last night, the situation escalated after an intense stand-off between the receivers and campaigners. Shortly after 6.15pm, a blacked-out eight-seater van pulled up outside Gorse Hill. Speaking through a small crack in the thick wooden gates and high walls, Tom Kavanagh, a receiver from Kavanagh Fennell, asked Land League campaigners who they were. Mr Kavanagh asked the campaigners who owned the red car that blocked the front gate outside Mr O’Donnell’s property. The receiver was told sharply by one campaigner that the car belonged to the ‘car’s owners’. The campaigner said he was not prepared to give his name or the names of his associates. But Jerry Beades of the Land League told the Mail yesterday: ‘We are just helping the [O’Donnell] family as we do any family facing eviction.’ After several minutes, Mr Kavanagh and three other people left the front gate. The campaigners said it ‘seems likely’ they will stay for the night behind the heavy gates, however, they refused to identify themselves or how many were there when asked by the Mail. A red car has been parked at the gates to Gorse Hill to block the property, where anti-eviction campaigners are camped outside . As the snow began to fall and temperatures plummeted, the campaigners made their way out on to the quiet south Dublin road. One campaigner said they were going to get food before settling in for the night as he told others behind the wall that they would change shifts every four or five hours. The O’Donnell couple built up a global property empire worth close to €1billion (£732million) and at the height of the boom, it seemed the world was theirs for the taking. But when the recession hit and the flow of bank credit stopped, Mr O’Donnell and his wife Mary Pat found themselves being pursued for millions that they simply didn’t have. Their Dublin home – referred to by some locals as ‘Dallas’ – is set on 3.5 acres with stunning views of Killiney Bay, it comes with its own tennis court and swimming pool. The six-bedroom house also boasts a gym and sauna, snooker room and wine store. Reportedly worth €30million (£22million) during the boom, its value has plummeted to about €7million (£5.1million). The Gorse Hill mansion, which boast six bedrooms, a gym, a sauna, a snooker room, a wine store and views over the Bay of Killiney . February 2011: Bank of Ireland sues solicitor Brian O’Donnell and his doctor wife Mary Patricia – who invested in high-end property worldwide during the boom – for the return of loans of almost €70million in the High Court’s commercial wing. March 2011: The couple settle the case on the basis they will pay back the millions by November 2011. December 12, 2011: High Court hears the couple have not paid up. Bank of Ireland wins an ‘enforcement’ order giving it the power to take control of any of the couple’s assets anywhere in Europe. December 29, 2011: Mr and Mrs O’Donnell board a ferry to the UK and set up home in London, before applying to the High Court there for bankruptcy protection. April 2012: Bank sends lawyers to the family home, Gorse Hill, to catalogue its contents – including artwork, antiques and rugs – with a view to taking possession of the property. May 2012: Bank of Ireland launches a court action against the O’Donnell children, Alexandra, Blaise, Blake and Bruce, as part of its efforts to secure return of the money. October 2012: The four offspring launch a rearguard action against the bank in an effort to hang onto the home they grew up in. September 2013: Mr and Mrs O’Donnell declared bankrupt by the High Court in Dublin, despite their claim to have moved their ‘centre of main interest’ for business purposes to London. They appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. December 19, 2014: Supreme Court rules the four siblings can no longer lay any claim to Gorse Hill. February 2, 2015: Blaise, Alexandra, Blake and Bruce are told to vacate the property by midday on Monday, March 2. February 25, 2015: Mr and Mrs O’Donnell are confirmed as bankrupts in the Republic after the Supreme Court rejects their appeal. March 2, 2015: Gorse Hill is surrendered by the four children. But a court hears that Brian O’Donnell is asserting a ‘right of residence’ and is ‘in occupation’, while anti-eviction protesters gather outside the property. Meanwhile, his four children launch a new lawsuit against Bank of Ireland seeking to hang on to the house and cancel their parents’ debt.","Irish tycoon Brian O'Donnell once controlled a vast global property empire .

"US Paralympic hopeful Ranjit Steiner says he could have never imagined that someone would stoop so low as to steal his prosthetic leg. Steiner, from San Francisco, woke up Tuesday morning - his birthday - to discover that thieves had smashed the rear right window on his brand-new car and taken his laptop along with his $25,000 blade-style running leg. Steiner, a track-and-field champion who aspires to go to the 2016 Paralympics in Brazil, uses it for competitive running at City College of San Francisco. Heartless: Ranjit Steiner (left), a track-and-field champion and aspiring Paralympian, says someone broke into his brand-new car (right) in San Francisco and got away with his custom-fitted running blade . Survivor: Steiner had his right leg amputated four years ago after contracting bone cancer . In a message posted on his Facebook page, Steiner wrote that the break-in took place sometime between 8pm Monday and 9am Tuesday along Cesar Chavez Street between Mission and Valencia streets. As of noon Wednesday, Steiner’s artificial leg - a black model with a yellow stripe on either side - has not been found. The thieves also took the athlete’s backup running blade. Champ: Steiner won the bronze medal in the nationals last year . ‘It's just so low,’ Steiner told NBC Bay Area. ‘You never think anybody would take something like that.’ Steiner, a graduate of University of Oregon with a degree in journalism, lost his right leg above the knee to bone cancer four years ago. But the amputation did not stop him from competing or pursuing his Olympic dreams. On Tuesday Morning, Steiner got behind the wheel of his brand-new Subaru Imperza and hit the road, only to feel the breeze on his back coming from the shattered back window, according to Palo Alto Online. Steiner was hoping that the perpetrators had not found his prosthetic under the seat, but the expensive running blade was nowhere to be found. Steiner says the artificial leg will not do the thieves any good because it was custom-fitted for his height and leg length, and can only be used for running. The cancer survivor says he seldom leaves anything of value in the car, but on Monday night he went out with his family to celebrate his birthday and forgot the blade and his other possessions in the backseat. Steiner, who won the bronze medal in the national championship last year, says he cannot do any high-level training without his blade. Futile crime: Steiner says his artificial leg will not do the thieves any good because it was custom-fitted for his height and leg length . Luckily for Steiner, he works for a company that manufactures prosthetic sockets and his employer is sponsoring him, but fitting him with a replacement could take up to a month. The athlete is asking for the public's help in locating and returning the artificial leg to him so he could continue with his 100- and 200-meter sprint workouts. ‘I've got four months until National Championships and this... you know, every day counts at this point,’ Steiner told ABC 7 News. An online fundraiser has now been launched on Life Indiegogo hoping to raise $30,000 to help Steiner get a new artificial leg.","Ranjit Steiner woke up Tuesday morning to discover thieves had smashed window on his new car and taken his laptop and blade-style running leg .

Scandal: However, the former US first lady (pictured in 2011) shunned questions about her 'extensive' use of a personal email address during her four-year tenure as Secretary of State from January 2009 to February 2013 . Speaking on the cusp of a second presidential campaign, the 67-year-old, who is married to former president Bill Clinton, noted that during one's life, 'you get a chance to make millions of decisions'. 'Some of them are big, like `Do you run for office?',' she told attendees, including Orange Is The New Black actress Uzo Aduba, Ugly Betty star America Ferrera and acclaimed chef Padma Lakshmi . Addressing the female Democrats, Mrs Clinton asked if they were hopeful of seeing more females running for local offices such as school board member, governor, mayor and member of Congress. 'I suppose it's only fair to say, `Don't you someday want to see a woman president?'', the supposed front-runner for next year's Democratic presidential nomination asked, causing the crowd to erupt. Mrs Clinton also previewed several economic themes that could animate an upcoming race, pointing to an economy that too often fails to address the challenges faced by families and working mothers. 'We have to get our economy to reflect the realities of 21st century America, and we're not doing that,' she told listeners, also including actress Anna Gun, who plays Skyler White in Breaking Bad. Taking to the stage: Mrs Clinton also avoided claims that she violated the US Federal Records Act by failing to preserve her correspondence via hdr22@clintonemail.com on State Department servers until two months ago .

'We're not doing that when the hard work of men and women across our country is not rewarded with rising wages, but CEO pay goes up and up no matter what.' Mrs Clinton's avoidance of questions about her sole use of a personal email account instead of a government-issued address during her time as secretary of state drew criticism Tuesday evening. The New York Times article which revealed her sole use of a personal address also described how Mrs Clinton's aides decided which personal emails to eventually disclose to the State Department. They ultimately chose to release 55,000 pages of correspondence - out of an unspecified number - as Mrs Clinton stepped down from the role in 2013, according to the widely-read article.

Republicans seized on the disclosures, accusing Mrs Clinton of violating a law intended to archive official government documents. GOP officials have also amplified reports that the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from foreign governments ahead of an expected Clinton campaign. 'It speaks volumes that Hillary Clinton will gladly attend fancy galas yet continue to hide from the American people,' said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore on Tuesday. She said voters deserved to know 'why she only used private email while serving as secretary of state at the same time the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from foreign governments who were lobbying her State Department.' Joyful: Ms Lakshmi is pictured speaking at EMILY's List 30th Anniversary Gala at Washington Hilton Tuesday . Another speaker: The event brought to the stage Sen.

Al Franken (pictured speaking to the audience) Applause: Mrs Clinton's (pictured)avoidance of questions about her sole use of a personal email account instead of a government-issued address during her time as secretary of state drew criticism on Tuesday . In her speech, Mrs Clinton accused Republicans of fostering policies promoting 'trickle-down economics' but noted both parties have spoken of ways to boost wages for middle-class workers. 'We welcome them to come with their ideas and we will match them,' she said of the Republicans, adding: 'That's what elections should be about. Elections should be a contest of ideas.' The prospect of a Clinton campaign was invoked repeatedly by political leaders who have worked with the fundraising powerhouse, whose name is an acronym for 'Early money is like yeast.' The organization has a strong track record in Democratic politics, electing more than 100 women to the U.S. House, 19 to the Senate, 10 governors and more than 500 state and local officials. Celebrity speakers: Ms Aduba and Ms Ferrera are pictured posing ahead of the star-studded EMILY's List gala . Sophisticated: Ms Gunn and Ms Lakshmi both wore glamorous black dresses for the event in Washington DC . 'She's more than an idol,' said Stephanie Schriock, EMILY's List's president, describing Clinton. 'She's an inspiration - and a leader whose talents we desperately need.' The event brought to the stage Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, the group's first endorsed candidate who recently announced her retirement, and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was gravely wounded in a deadly 2011 shooting during a political event at a Tucson, Arizona, shopping mall, also addressed the audience. Ms Giffords said female leaders deliver results, in places like city hall, state houses, governor's mansions and Congress, 'and maybe soon, in the White House.' Ms Aduba, Ms Gunn and Ms Lakshmi also took to the stage during Tuesday's gala. Friends: Ms Gunn and Ms Lakshmi pose together ahead of the anniversary  gala for EMILY's List, a group which was founded by Ellen Malcolm in 1985 and works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights . EMILY's LIst has helped lay the groundwork for a potential Clinton campaign, holding events to promote the possibility of electing the nation's first female president and commissioning polling. Ellen Malcolm, the founder of the organization, pointed to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign as the first step, bringing the audience to their feet when she identified 2016 as the 'time to shatter that glass ceiling and put a woman in the White House.' Mrs Clinton, seated in the audience, laughed and clapped along with the crowd. 'Hillary, you heard us,' Ms Malcolm said. 'Just give us the word and we'll be right at your side.' Mrs Clinton accepted the  group's 'We are Emily' award during the Washington DC-based event.","Hillary Clinton hinted at a 2016 presidential run during EMILY'S List event .

"A teenage school girl has been placed in 'isolation' by her secondary school which has a ban on 'unnatural' hair colours after she dyed her hair red. Alana Harrison, 13, has been told by management at King James's school in Huddersfield, west Yorkshire that she will not be allowed into classes until she changes the colour of her hair. Her family said that the Year 8 pupil from Kikheaton, west Yorkshire faces a long period away from her classmates because the colour in her hair was permanent. Alana Harrison, 13, pictured, has been told she cannot attend classes until the red hair colour is removed . Alana's mother Mandy said any attempt to change the colour now would cause damage to her daughter's hair. She said the hairdresser even contacted the school to confirm this fact. The schools said that the rules are very clear. They are in every student’s planner, tutors regularly remind pupils and a letter was sent home with every pupil in February reminding parents about the rules. In January pupil Oscar Ward, 16, spent many days in isolation at King James’s when he turned up with a bleach blond Mohican haircut. He has since changed his hairstyle to comply. Mrs Harrison said: 'Alana had some red put in her hair, it is not bright red. It won’t wash out; it’s permanent - the more she washes it, the brighter it will get. 'Alana is Type 1 diabetic and needs daily injections. I have told the school her blood sugar levels need checking every hour as she is just sitting down all day in isolation and not moving around, which causes her blood sugar levels to go up. 'It’s stressful for both of us as she is not allowed her mobile and I can’t ring her to check her sugars. 'She won’t learn much in isolation, but I have to send her to school or I will be fined. We are at a stalemate as we can’t change the colour of the hair. 'On Monday there was a girl there with purple hair, but she is not in isolation - and the head of year I spoke to on the phone has bleach blond hair.' Head teacher Robert Lamb said the school rules are very clear about the need for 'a conventional hair colour' Headteacher Robert Lamb said: 'Our rules on this are very clear and have not changed in the time I have been the headteacher, which is over 12 years. The girl had two older sisters at the school and the rules haven’t changed. 'The section about hair states: ""Hair and Make-up: Conventional colour and style. Unnatural colours are not allowed."" 'The Student Planner goes on to say: ""If any student is not in full school uniform or meeting the expectations of appearance, they will have to rectify the situation before they are given permission to go into lessons."" 'All schools have similar rules. The hair rule, like the other school rules, are there to ensure that nothing detracts children from what they are there for, which is to achieve their potential. 'If you break the school rules, you are punished, I don’t know what the story is.' Joe Head (right) went to school with his hair in a ponytail in the style of Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) but the school wrote to his parents saying it was banned because it was associated with drug taking . Mandy Head didn't think there would be a problem when her son Joe said he wanted to go to school at  Pope Paul Catholic Primary School in Potters Bar wearing his hair in a pony tail in the style of Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But the next day she received a letter telling her that her son's hairstyle was 'unsuitable' and headteacher Helen Lines told her it was 'associated with drug taking.' Tom Mosely, left, from Eccles, wanted to have the same haircut as the Manchester City star Aguero, right . Ten-year-old Tom Moseley was told his short back and sides hairstyle, modelled on the Manchester City striker's look, was too extreme by staff St Gilbert's Primary School in Winton, Eccles, and he was removed from school on his birthday. His family say they were told he could either return to classes when his hair had grown, restyle it or wear a hat at all times. Meanwhile 14-year-old Jordan Ford was suspended from school after he arrived with a dyed red mohican hairstyle. He was sent home from Bridge Learning Campus in Whitchurch, Bristol by staff. So the youngster decided to post an old photograph of head teacher Keziah Featherstone he found on Facebook featuring the teacher sporting a bright purple hair cut and pink Dr Martens boots. Jordan Ford found an embarrassing photograph of head teacher Keziah Featherstone and posted it to his Facebook page which led to him receiving a further suspension from his school in Bristol .

"Timothy Royle is alleged to have stole almost £7,000 of cash as well as expensive equipment from the school where he was headteacher . A headteacher who advised Gordon Brown and David Cameron's governments on education pocketed almost £7,000 of school cash and stole expensive equipment, a court heard today. Timothy Royle is alleged to have falsely reported how bursary funds were spent over the three years leading up to his retirement from Highdown School and Sixth Form Centre in 2012. All the while, he was keeping the cash and taking home cameras, a MacBook Pro laptop, an iMac computer and a set of speakers and headphones, a court heard. The 64-year-old was appointed as one of the first national leaders in education, awarded to headteachers of outstanding schools who advise the Government on policy and help other struggling schools. He joined the Reading-based school, Berkshire, in 1998 and is accused of pocketing £2,000 in 2008, £2,246 the following year and £2,550 in 2010. Prosecuting, John Law told the jury at Reading Crown Court: 'This defendant is accused of offences of fraud and of theft. 'He was the headteacher of a school and we say he abused the status he had and the school had, by keeping public monies for his own benefit. 'He also took when retiring from the school items with him that he was not entitled to.' The court heard alarm bells were sounded by the school business manager after Royle retired and an investigation was launched. Mr Law told the jury: 'You will hear in this case about something called the National College for Teaching and Leadership. This case is about payments that the public body paid to Highdown School. 'Mr Royle was recognised for his work and selected as a national leader of education. The school was given national support school status. High performing schools assist others, so monies are available in association with that.' The court was told that the school was entitled to bursary grants between 2008 and 2010, which helped cover the costs of sending staff to other schools and to training days. Nicholas Syfret QC, defending, said that Royle had been 'instrumental' in improving the previously failing school, so much so the arts building was named in his honour. Mr Law said: 'The payments were applied for and made directly into a business account in Mr Royle's name. After that, he had to file a report at the end of the year to say where the money had been spent. Mr Royle joined Highdown School and Sixth Form Centre in Reading, Berkshire (pictured) in 1998 and is accused of pocketing £2,000 in 2008, £2,246 the following year and £2,550 in 2010 . 'If any funds are left over at the end of the year, they are repaid to the National College or knocked off the following year. 'What we say Mr Royle did was to falsely report - lie - that the money was spent on attending conferences when he knew the school paid for attendance of conferences, both directly and by paying him back for invoices he sent to the school. 'The real question is whether Mr Royle was acting dishonestly.' The court heard after Royle retired, staff noticed a number of items missing. Police went to his house in Woolton Hill, near Newbury, Berkshire and found items matching the description of the ones reported missing. Mr Law said: 'We understand that the defendant accepts that the computers had come from the school but the Nikon camera, Sony video camera and headphones did not. The former headteacher (pictured meeting then Education and Employemnt secretary David Blunkett in 2001) has now been arrested for fraud . 'What he was saying is that he was entitled to take the computers for reasons including that there would be work on there he might need to access.' Witness Neil Dimbleby, who was deputy headteacher at the school at the time, said he knew Royle had taken two computers when he left and wasn't aware of any agreement to allow the headteacher to take them. But he was challenged by the defence lawyer Mr Syfret who said the deputy had never seen any documents pertaining to how the bursary was run at the time of the alleged offence. 'There may have been a policy for recovering items from the school,' Mr Syfret added. 'That would certainly be delegated to the headteacher. 'If these decisions involved what was done with old laptops, that would not necessarily involve you.' Royle denies three counts of fraud and five counts of theft. The trial continues.

"White children will be outnumbered by minority kids in the United States in just five years, new Census Bureau projections reveal. This is the result of an ongoing trend of declining birth among white Americans and a baby boom among immigrant groups, as well as a surge in immigration. By the year 2020, 50.2percent of all children in the US are expected to be non-white, according to the Census. By 2044, whites will be outnumbered by minorities. The Census study, released this week, predicts that by year 2060, nearly 20percent of the population will be foreign born - thanks to an influx of 64million new immigrants. Deadline: In less than five years, minority children will outnumber white ones. In 14 years after that, more than half of all Americans will be minorities . The US will add nearly 100million people to its population in the next 40 years. 64million will come from immgration and another 40million will be born to foreign-born mothers . The populations of Hispanics in the US will rise 114percent - from 55million in 2014 to 63.6million in 2060 - making up about 29percent of the population. And the number of non-Hispanic whites will actually likely to decline over the next 40 years - from 200million and 62percent of the population now to 182million and 44percent of the population in 2060. The number of people who identified themselves as only black will also decline about 8percent to about 59million. The number of Asian-Americans will also increase dramatically - even more than the Hispanic population - rising 128percent to 22million. The Census reporty also projects a massive surge in the portion of the population that's over age 65. By 2030, 20percent of that population will qualify for a senior discount. In 2033, there will be more Americans over age 65 than children - thanks to the aging Baby Boom generation. By year 2060, there will be 76 'dependents' - those over age 65 and drawing government benefits  or under 18 - for every 100 working-age Americans. Demographers estimate that by 2060, the population of the United States will increase by 98million - from 319million to 417million people. Even so, the overall population growth of the nation will slow considerably over the next 40 years - as immigrants and the children of immigrants reach higher incomes, their fertility rates will drop - like native-born whites have. Big change: This chart shows how the portion of whites in America will fall from 62percent to 44percent in the next 40 years . The portion of foreign-born residents will increase from 13percent now to nearly 20percent by year 2060 . A new Census Bureau study, paints a demographic portrait of America in the year 2060 than it looks today. Here are a few takeaways: . Race and ethnicity . Age . Immigrant population .","By year 2020, 50.2percent of children will be minorities .

"A bungling U.S. military officer mistakenly disclosed 'military secrets' during a media briefing last month when he accidentally blurted out the expected timing for an Iraqi-led ground offensive in the city of Mosul. The briefer, whose presentation for reporters at the Pentagon on February 19 was authorized by U.S. Central Command, said the U.S. wanted the Iraqis to launch the offensive in April or May, although he also said it might go later. 'That clearly was neither accurate information nor, had it been accurate, would have been information that should be blurted out to the press,' Defense Secretary Ash Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'So it's wrong on both scores.' Scroll down for video . Defense Secretary Ash Carter has confirmed that a U.S. military officer disclosed 'military secrets' last month when he blurted out the expected timing for an Iraqi-led ground offensive in Mosul . It now appears likely that the offensive will not begin this spring, with Iraq's security forces requiring more time for U.S.-organized training. It has been widely known for months that the offensive is in the planning stages and that it would likely mark a decisive moment in the campaign to dislodge the Islamic State from Iraq. Islamic State fighters overran Mosul last June. Iraqi government forces folded quickly, leading to the start of a U.S.-led bombing campaign in Iraq in August. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was testifying alongside Carter, said he had discussed the Mosul briefing with Gen. Lloyd Austin, head of Central Command. 'He's conducting an internal inquiry,' Dempsey said, adding that he is confident Austin will 'take the appropriate action.' He did not say what that might be. The briefing was done by an officer at Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida. He spoke by phone to a group of reporters in the Pentagon on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by Central Command. Fighters from the Islamic State group parade in a commandeered Iraqi security forces armored vehicle down a main road at the northern city of Mosul: An offensive is now expected to begin later this year with Iraq's security forces requiring more time for U.S.-organized training . The episode is remarkable in at least two respects. It was unusual for the U.S. military to disclose in advance the expected timing of an offensive as well as details about the makeup of the Iraqi force that would undertake it. And it was curious that a secretary of defense would wait nearly two weeks after such a briefing to denounce it publicly for having spilled military secrets. Asked about it by reporters twice last weekend, Carter was more circumspect. 'The important thing is that it will get done when it can be done successfully,' he said last Friday, referring to the Mosul offensive. 'And even if I knew exactly when that was going to be, I wouldn't tell you.' Asked to comment again the following day, Carter said it's important to keep the public informed, 'consistent with security and other considerations.' On Tuesday he was more pointed and expansive in directly criticizing Central Command. 'It is important that we be open as a department — not with military secrets and not with war plans, which was the mistake made in this case — but we do try to keep the country informed of what we're doing,' he said. 'It's about protecting them. It is a democracy. And so, openness is important but it has to have limits when it comes to security matters, and those limits obviously weren't respected in this case.'","Official said that U.S. wanted the Iraqis to launch the offensive in the city of Mosul in April or May .

"Teacher Jennifer Thompson, 52, failed to report a student who allegedly took moonshine to class . A longtime science teacher in Ohio has been reprimanded for failing to report a student who allegedly took a bottle of illegal liquor he had produced to class. Jennifer Thompson, 52, who has taught at Riverside middle school in De Graff for more than 20 years, reportedly tipped the moonshine down the drain when she was shown it but did not alert authorities. According to Dayton Daily News, she was issued with a formal warning letter as a result, while the pupil in question was suspended from school. Thompson apparently knew the 13-year-old boy and another 14-year-old had created a still and were starting to produce alcohol. While she warned the duo it could be 'dangerous', investigators claim the tutor took no strict action to stop the operation. In January, a report from the Logan County Sheriff says the student brought some of the liquor to show in science class. Thompson disposed of it instead of alerting the principle. Under Ohio law, the illegal manufacture of moonshine is considered a first-degree misdemeanor - carrying the same charges as crimes including petty theft or assault. It is unclear whether the boy who took the moonshine to class will face juvenile delinquency charges in the case. Wrong move: The science teacher reportedly tipped the alcohol down the drain when she was shown it but did not alert authorities . Scene of the incident: An aerial shot of Riverside Local Schools School in Ohio . In the meantime he is said to be awaiting an expulsion hearing led by Riverside Schools. It is unclear how the news of the incident emerged. Riverside Local Schools Superintendent Scott Mann said he doesn't believe the student realized the seriousness of his actions. 'I think he wanted to show his science teacher and I don’t think there was malicious intent at all,' he noted.","Jennifer Thompson, 52, who has taught at Riverside middle school in De Graff for more than 20 years, reportedly tipped the moonshine down the drain when she was shown it but did not alert authorities .

"Flip-flops? Check. Sunglasses? Check. Twenty-four degree heat? Check. Now all I need is a fruity cocktail and I could be in Mauritius. Except I’m not on holiday. I’m in a basement in central London, moments from the frenzy of Oxford Street. Outside, it’s a typical day — cold and damp, with a sky as grey and heavy as old army boots. It’s estimated that two million Britons suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which is caused by a lack of sunlight - and up to three times more women than men appear to be affected . Down here, amid the lemon trees and pink, plastic bougainvillea, it’s so tropical that I half expect Barry Manilow to cha-cha-cha past singing the Copacabana. Welcome to the cheapest winter sunspot in Britain. This is a ‘Real Sunlight’ clinic, where anyone can drop in for a burst of cheering warmth. But you don’t have to face the airport, and it won’t cost you thousands of pounds. At the flick of a switch, you can flit between Mauritius, Miami and Bali — or, at least, their sunshine equivalents. Dr Daya (pictured) originally bought the equipment for her own use, having grown sick of British winter . As holidays go, it’s pretty convenient: no passport, no packing and the weather is guaranteed. It’s estimated that 2 million Britons suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), caused by a lack of sunlight, with up to three times more women than men affected. Symptoms include low-level depression, lack of energy and a loss of enthusiasm for life. The syndrome is so widespread, the NHS has set up a web page giving advice on how to tackle it — which includes artificial sun. In the past, if you were down in the dumps during winter, the advice would be to buck up or buy a ticket somewhere hot. But what if you can’t afford to? What if you’re trapped on this cold, damp isle until the spring, whenever that may be? It was only when a colleague cheerfully announced that he was off to Goa, in India, for a fortnight that I thought, hang on, I need some sunshine, too! Which is how I found myself slipping on my flip-flops at Dr Daya’s Wholistic Medical Centre on that Monday afternoon. Dr Daya is the sort of GP you find a lot of around Harley Street. A private practitioner, she’s open to alternative medicine, ‘taking a holistic approach, looking at the whole body and lifestyle, not just one part of it’. Prince Charles would approve. Hers is the only clinic in Britain to offer a ‘real sunshine’ room to the public. It opened in 2009, though she has just moved premises and spruced it up. It’s a normal-sized sitting room, done up to feel like a tropical holiday. The walls are papered with verdant scenes and artificial grass, jaunty pot plants hang off wooden screens, soothing music plays in the background. In a corner, above your head, beams the ‘artificial sun’. It looks like a row of wall-mounted security lights — three square boxes, the sort you might get at a football stadium. Dr Daya's Wholistic Medical Centre (pictured) in central London where you can experience the Miami sun . The equipment comes from Sweden and cost Dr Daya £25,000 to install, which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box — which beams out an assimilation of natural light — for £50. ‘Light boxes do work,’ says Dr Daya, ‘but this is out of this world. This is the full spectrum — infra-red, UVA, UVB and you get the heat, whereas with SAD boxes, you just get visible light.’ The inventor of the equipment, Ingemar Nilsson, stumbled upon his creation by mistake in 1997. Commissioned to create a sunlight tunnel for Swedish car manufacturer Saab to test the effects of the sun’s rays on different paints, he noticed that the factory workers liked to congregate under the sun lamps during their breaks. He realised people could get benefits from sitting under the artificial sunlight he’d created. So he spent some years adapting his equipment to make it 100 per cent safe for human use, and ten years later had created the technology he sells now. Initially, the biggest demand for sunlight rooms came from the elderly and nursing homes. The first private sunlight room was created in Sweden, and there have now been 150 installations worldwide. In Britain, 11 have been installed in care homes and there are three belonging to private individuals. ‘Some people really go to town with replicating a holiday feel for their sunlight rooms,’ says Karl Emanuelsson, the UK company representative. ‘People put sand on the floor, surround sound systems to replicate the sea, the smell of coconut wafting through to create a truly multi-sensory experience.’ Dr Daya originally bought the equipment for her own use, having grown sick of British winters. ‘I was born in Africa and I really need the sun,’ she says. ‘I don’t think you need to have been born in Africa to feel you’re missing the sun here, but that was my excuse. ‘When I was 13, I was sent from Tanzania to boarding school here, and I still can’t get over how long the winters are.’ A woman looks at a ' light lounge' - a treatment aimed at Seasonal Affective Disorder sufferers (SAD) Back in Tanzania, which lies on the Equator, there is an average of 2,836 hours of sun per year, out of a possible 4,383. In Britain, the average is typically less than half that, ranging from 1,364 per year in Birmingham to 1,888 in Eastbourne. Dr Daya had heard of sunlight simulators in spas and health clinics, and decided to buy one for herself. ‘I thought it was a bit extravagant, and that I should really share it with other people, so I opened the sun room,’ she says. She charges £50 for a one-hour session, which seems a lot to spend on an hour under a hot lamp — but, on the other hand, it’s less than the cost of a holiday and, as soon as you flick the switch, you’re hit in the face with that lovely, warm feeling, as if you’ve just stepped off a plane in the Caribbean. There are three settings: an hour of ‘Bali’ is the mildest, equivalent to a long sunset, while ‘Miami’, Dr Daya’s favourite, is 45 minutes of full whack, then 15 minutes of winding down. She finds ‘Mauritius’ is the most popular, as it’s the strongest, so that’s what I plump for. And, boy, do those lamps give off light. Not just light, but heat. In seconds, the room is toasty warm, and I’m breaking into a sweat. You can wear what you like — Dr Daya likes to spend an hour here after work, in her underwear, catching up with reading. Some visit as couples, while others pop in for a solitary hour in their lunch break. But what are the actual health benefits? We know we get a large part of our vitamin D intake — important for the promotion of calcium and healthy bones — from the sun. Some of our intake also comes from food such as oily fish. But from October to April, 90 per cent of the UK lies too far north to have enough UVB rays in sunlight necessary to make vitamin D in the skin. So, if they’re not eating enough oily fish and are spending too much time indoors, many are at risk of being vitamin D deficient. Which is where a burst in a sunny room could be just the ticket. But just a burst — and no more. There’s a risk of getting skin cancer if you spend too much time in the room. ‘The recommended dose is no more than one hour a day, which is completely safe,’ says Dr Daya. ‘But if you did three hours every day, we couldn’t vouch for the effects. 'It’s like anything — it’s important not to overdo it.’ Dr Daya claims her time in the sun room makes her sleep better and feel more energetic during the day. And one elderly user of a nursing home sunlight room says it helps alleviate aches and pains, especially joints, and has a positive effect on his brain power — it helps him tackle the crossword much quicker. After leaving Dr Daya’s clinic, I do feel more cheerful and friends say I have a rosy complexion, compared with my normal pasty, winter face. I ask Dr Daya if she still feels the need to go on holiday. ‘Who wants to go on holiday when you can have one every day in your office?’ she replies. Good point. Even so, I could still do with a week in Mauritius. The equipment comes from Sweden and cost Dr Daya £25,000 to install, which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box, which beams out an assimilation of natural light, like this one, the Lumie Zip for £150 .","An estimated 2 million Britons suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder .

"A boy suffered multiple seizures after overdosing on liquorice sweets. The 10-year-old boy was admitted to hospital in Bologna, Italy, after suffering a seizure. Hours later, doctors reported he suffered another three seizures. He also complained of a bad headache and had high blood pressure. He appeared to be suffering from posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), a condition characterized by headache, confusion, seizures and visual loss. A 10-year-old boy suffered four seizures which doctors found was due to his habit of eating 20 liquorice sweets a day for four months . But doctors were baffled as CT and MRI scans ruled out all the major condition that lead to PRES. During a medical examination a week later doctors noticed that the boy’s teeth were black. It transpired that he had been eating at least 20 liquorice sweets each day for the past four months. This mean he was consuming of 2.88 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhizic acid, one of the active ingredients of liquorice. That volume is well above the World Health OrganiSation’s recommended maximum of 2 mg/kg. This excessive consumption had resulted in his development of high blood pressure, and in turn PRES. After the boy stopped eating the sweets, his treatment was gradually reduced and his blood pressure returned to normal. In light of the case, doctors are now calling for a recommended daily amount to be printed clearly on sweets packets as a safety measures. Last year, MailOnline reported on the story of Keith Ballantine, 68, who was struck down with a rare nerve condition which left him unable to move after eating too many liquorice allsorts . The risk of PRES risk is particularly high for children with a low body weight, Dr Davide Tassinari and colleagues from the University of Bologna, Italy, said. The case was published in Pediatric Neurology. In the past, the US' Food and Drug Administration has warned  black liquorice can lead to irregular heartbeats, and other health problems when consumed by adults in large quantities. The glycyrrhizin causes the kidneys to excrete potassium, and low levels of the compound can make the heart beat dangerously fast or irregularly. Glycyrrhizin also leads to salt and water retention which can be a problem for people with heart failure or high blood pressure, it said. Other studies have shown glycyrrhizinc can increase blood pressure or cause muscle weakness and chronic fatigue. Research has also suggested it can lower testosterone levels in men, affecting their mood and libido. The news comes after MailOnline reported on the story of a grandfather who developed a rare nerve condition which left him unable to move, after eating too many liquorice allsorts. Keith Ballantine, 68, was struck down with Guillain-Barre Syndrome after consuming too many of the sweets. They gave him an upset stomach and doctors believe the antibodies he produced to fight the bug caused his body to react badly - and Mr Ballantine then developed the deadly nerve disease. Within weeks, he was completely paralysed – and he only managed to relearn to walk again a year later.","Boy was admitted to hospital in Italy and suffered four seizures .

"Target announced it will be making $2billion in cuts and slashing 'several thousand' jobs over the next two years. The announcement came during an investors meeting today in New York City. The US retail chain, which is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said the cost-cutting measures 'will fuel Target's growth and drive profitability'. Target, which is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, announced it will cut $2billion over the next two years . The discount chain's cost-cutting measures will result in 'several thousand' jobs being eliminated . Board chairman and chief executive Brian Cornell, who joined the company last August, detailed how the restructuring program will 'transform the retailer's business'. He said: 'Following a thorough, strategic review of our business, coupled with a careful evaluation of the changing retail landscape, we have identified the key initiatives that will put Target on a clear path to growth. 'We're focused on our future and building the capabilities that will take us further, faster. 'Redefining Target will require a renewed emphasis on prioritization and innovation, and above all else, putting our guests first in everything we do.'

About 13,500 employees work at its headquarters operations in the Twin Cities. Board chairman and CEO Brian Cornell detailed how the restructuring will 'transform the retailer's business' The chain has been struggling after millions of customers had their data stolen in a 2013 hacking attack and the company made an unsuccessful foray into Canada. Cornell's plan has $500million in cuts targeted for this year. It also includes a $1billion investment in technology and the supply chain. Part of the plan also involves exiting Canada.

"A Philadelphia man has been charged with stabbing a member of Nikki Minaj's tour crew to death during an argument over a barmaid. Pierce Boykin was charged with the murder of 29-year-old De'Von Pickett on Tuesday, Homicide Captain James Clark confirmed. Pickett - who was Minaj's tour manager - was stabbed to death in the early hours of Wednesday, February 18, outside a bar in Philadelphia. Charged: Pierce Boykin, 31, (left) was charged with the murder and attempted member of members of Nicki Minaj's (right) tour crew - who had arrived in Philadelphia for rehearsals for the singer's upcoming tour . He and the rest of the crew had just arrived in the city to rehearse for Minaj's tour, which is supposed to begin in Europe this month. Fellow crew member Eric Parker, 27, was also stabbed in the attack, but was expected to survive his injuries. Boykin, 31, was originally charged with attempted murder of Parker, but Clark says the murder charge was tacked on after additional evidence pointed to Boykin for both stabbings. According to NBC 10, the argument began inside Che Bar & Grill in Philadelphia’s West Oak Lane neighborhood. 'We believe that both of the victims, as well as the perpetrator, were all inside of this bar and that’s when an argument started,' said Chief inspector Scott Small. Boykin is in custody, and an attorney for him could not be reached to comment on the charges.

"A father-of-three who was told not to go to A&E after paramedics dismissed his chest pains as a panic attack, has died from a cardiac arrest. Former factory worker Jeffrey Corbin was persuaded not to go to hospital despite suffering symptoms of a heart attack by an ambulance crew who told him he would have to wait up to seven hours in A&E for treatment. But he collapsed and died in his bedroom the next day after a shocking 70-minute wait for a first responder to turn up because he was classed as low priority. Scroll down for video . Jeffrey Corbin (pictured) died after his agonising chest pains were misdiagnosed by paramedics as a panic attack . National government targets require an ambulance to attend an address within 30 minutes of a 999 call. Because of extra demand over the Easter weekend it then took a further 14 minutes before an ambulance finally arrived at his home in Sneyd Green, Stoke-on-Trent on April 20 last year. When the 59-year-old was finally taken to University Hospital of North Staffordshire it was too late and he was pronounced dead. Yesterday a coroner criticised the West Midlands Ambulance Service and said if paramedics had done their job properly Mr Corbin would still be alive. Mr Corbin's  family, including widow Kathryn, 53 (centre), daughter Sinead (left) and son Drew (right) have been left devastated by the loss . Mrs Corbin is now suing the NHS and West Midlands Ambulance Service for negligence after paramedics persuaded the father-of-three not to go to hospital . An ambulance was called after his collapsed but it took more than 70 minutes to arrive- national government targets require an ambulance to attend an address within 30 minutes of a 999 call . Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, North Staffordshire Coroner Ian Smith said: 'Clearly a wrong decision was made. 'There's no doubt Jeffrey Corbin should have been in hospital and I'm quite satisfied that had he been in hospital, tests would have been done, and the likelihood is he would have still been alive. 'In the paramedic's medical reports, there's no mention of anything other than panic attacks and anxiety, but his post-mortem examination results showed he had recently suffered an acute heart attack. 'But did they tell him he needed to get into an ambulance or did they give him an option? The next day he collapsed on the bedroom floor. 'An ambulance was called for at 2.27am, but due to increased demand a single paramedic did not arrive until 3.42am.' Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, North Staffordshire Coroner Ian Smith said it was clear a wrong decision had been made in Mr Corbin's (pictured with grandson Oliver Howden) treatment . The coroner said there was 'no doubt' Mr Corbin (pictured at his wedding to wife Kathryn Corbin) should have been in hospital . Mr Corbin's devastated widow Kathryn, 53, is now suing the NHS and West Midlands Ambulance Service for negligence. She told the inquest: 'When the paramedics arrived, I didn't feel there was any urgency. 'The paramedic said Jeff could be at the hospital for about six or seven hours waiting for a doctor. 'At the time I didn't think Jeff was so poorly. 'The paramedics gave him the option, but if we had been told on that morning that he really needed to go to hospital then we would have gone. 'But there was just no urgency to get him there. 'Jeff was an absolute diamond. He loved everything and everybody.' Paramedic Richard Harris denied he tried to dissuade Mr Corbin from attending hospital. When an ambulance crew arrived at his home in Stoke-on-Trent (pictured)  they told him he would have to wait up to seven hours in A&E for treatment . When the 59-year-old was finally taken to University Hospital of North Staffordshire (pictured) after collapsing the next day it was too late and he was pronounced dead . He told the hearing: 'I thought he would be better having further examinations at the hospital, which is what I recommended. 'I would never make recommendations to a patient travelling to the hospital based on waiting times.' The post-mortem examination found Mr Corbin died from a heart attack. Speaking today Kathryn, who had been married to Mr Corbin for 25 years, said: 'I feel very strongly that if Jeff had gone to hospital the first time he would still be with us. 'It was 6am on the Saturday (April 19) when he woke up with shortness of breath, chest pains and a shooting pain going up and down his left arm. 'I'm not medically trained but that says heart attack to me. I dialled 111 and told them his symptoms and they passed it through to the ambulance service. 'When the paramedics turned up they just said to me and Jeff 'it's a panic attack'. They also said he'd pulled his chest in the panic attack which is why he had pain there. The coroner said that in all likelihood, Mr Corbin would have survived if he had been taken to hospital in proper time . Mr Corbin's family described him as 'an absolute diamond' and said that he loved everything and everybody . 'Looking back now I wish I'd pushed for them to take him to A&E but they didn't seem to bothered and we trusted them. 'They put the frighteners on us basically. They said they could take Jeff to hospital but said he'd probably be in A&E for up to seven hours waiting for treatment. 'He'd only just come out of hospital after having a knee operation and was understandably not keen to go back but he would have done if the paramedics had advised him to.' April 19, 2014 . 6am: Jeffrey Corbin complains of shortness of breath and shooting chest pains. Wife Kathryn dials 111 who call ambulance. 6.25am: Paramedics Rita Davies and Richard Harris attend house and dismiss his symptoms as panic attack and leave. April 20, 2014 . 2.27am: Mr Corbin suffers chest pains and collapses in bed. Kathryn dials 999 who say paramedic is on his way. 3.42am: First responder Robert Baker attends and calls ambulance. 3.56am: Ambulance attends house and takes Mr Corbin to hospital. 4.30am: Mr Corbin pronounced dead at North Staffordshire Hospital. Throughout the day Mr Corbin, suffered shortness of breath and chest pains until he finally collapsed in the early hours of the following day. Mrs Corbin, a check-out assistant at Asda, added: 'When Jeff collapsed on the Sunday (April 20) I dialled 999 and they said someone would be with us soon. 'I didn't know it then but his case was classed as category C which is low priority. When no one turned up after 40 minutes I called again and they said a First Responder was on their way. 'He didn't turn up until over an hour later and as soon as he saw Jeff his face dropped and he turned to me and said, 'What on earth is he doing here? He needs to be in hospital.' 'He got on the radio and an ambulance was called but it was too late. 'Jeff and I were planning to renew our wedding vows in July which would have been our 25th anniversary and I feel robbed of losing him. 'He had never had heart problems before and I believe he was let down.' The family are being represented by law firm Irwin Mitchell. Mr Corbin leaves behind  wife Kathryn and their children Sinead, 24, and Drew 23, who live together in the semi-detached family home, currently worth an estimated £52,946. He also has another daughter, Kathryn, 34, from a previous marriage. Lawyer Rebecca Risby said: 'This has been an extremely difficult time for Jeff's family who lost a loving father under very tragic circumstances.'","Jeffrey Corbin called 999 with a suspected heart attack on April 19 last year .

"A bride was stranded beside a motorway in China after clambering out of her white limo for a quick pre-wedding toilet break. Named in a report as 26-year-old Zhang Han, the wife-to-be's big day turned into a nightmare when the incident unfolded during a toll booth traffic jam in Henan province. Unable to wait any longer, the woman reportedly climbed out of her elaborate chauffeur-driven limousine for a pit stop and told her driver she could catch a lift with the groom. Stranded: A bride's call-of-nature pit stop led her to be stuck by the side of a Chinese motorway (file photo) But when she returned, both her limo and the groom's car had made it through the toll booths an vanished. She had told the groom to wait for her, but he was busy paying the toll and didn't know what was happening, according to China's People's Daily. Having left everything on the seat - bridal dresses seldom come with pockets - she wandered along the side of the motorway until she could track down a traffic officer. She then had to phone the groom, who realised his mistake and fetched her - leaving hundreds of guests waiting for her big moment. Queues: The bridal couple were waiting in separate cars for a congested set of toll booths (file photo) According to the Central European News agency, the bride told an unidentified TV channel: 'I was nervous and wanted to go to the bathroom, so when we turned up at the toll station I told the driver I was going to use the toilet, and told him to wait for me. 'He told me that he was not allowed to wait as he had to go through the toll now that he was in the queue, and so I told him not to wait and I would travel along with other guests.' The agency claimed the toilet break took longer than the bride had expected - because of all the folds in her gown.","Bride's white limo had got stuck at toll booths in China's Henan province .

"From a sawn-off shotgun to a catapult and crossbow, these are the previously unseen weapons of the infamous gangsters Ronnie and Reggie Kray. The remarkable collection, which also includes memorabilia belonging to the pair including reading glasses, a comb and a pen-set, has been revealed in full for the first time. It is owned by Andy Jones - who runs a museum in a converted jail in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire – and gives a fascinating insight into the lives of the East End mobsters. Mr Jones, 53, was left all of the items by Reggie after he struck up a friendship with him when visiting him in prison. Scroll down for video . The remarkable collection of memorabilia, including a shotgun (pictured), of Ronnie and Reggie Kray, which is kept in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, by owner Andy Jones, has been revealed in full for the first time . The collection, including Ronnie's crossbow (pictured) gives a fascinating insight into the lives of the Krays . Ronnie Kray's knuckleduster also features in the collection which has been photographed by Peter Dazeley . Reggie Kray's penknife is also part of the collection which has been released ahead of a film about the twins . One interesting piece of memorabilia in the collection is a letter from Violet Kray to a friend (pictured) in which she describes her sons Ronnie and Reggie as 'the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet' As well as the weapons, the collection also features a letter sent from Ronnie and Reggie's mother Violet to a friend, in which describes her sons as 'the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet.' The items have been photographed comprehensively for the first time by renowned photographer Peter Dazeley, ahead of the release of a film about the Kray twins which will star actor Tom Hardy and is due to be released later this year. Mr Dazeley, from London, said: 'The brothers were among the last prisoners to be held in the Tower of London in 1952, for failing to report for National Service. 'They were involved in armed robberies, arson, protection rackets, assaults and the murders of George Cornell in the Blind Beggar Pub in Whitechapel and Jack 'the Hat' McVitie. 'They were arrested on May 9, 1968, and convicted of the murders at the Old Bailey in 1969, by the efforts of a squad of detectives led by detective superintendent Leonard 'Nipper' Read of the Yard. 'About 60 plain-clothed policemen kept a 24-hour watch on the jury throughout the trial, following them home from court and even into public houses. 'The brothers were sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 30 years for the murders, the longest sentences ever passed at the Old Bailey. 'Their memorabilia is from the private collection of Andy Jones, of the Littledean Jail, and shows objects from their life of crime and their time at Her Majesty's pleasure.' Ronnie and Reggie Kray (pictured) were practically born into a life of crime and grew up in Bethnal Green, east London. The mobsters quickly certified themselves as the most 'notorious' brothers in the East End gangland . The private collection has been photographed in full for the first time. Pictured: Ronnie's sawn-off shotgun . One of the Krays owned a catapult (pictured) which presumably he used during altercations in the East End . Mr Dazeley said: 'Their memorabilia is from the private collection of Andy Jones, of the Littledean Jail, and shows objects from their life of crime and their time at Her Majesty's pleasure.' Pictured: Ronnie's pen-set . Experts said the collection of weaponry and personal items shows the two different sides of the Kray twins. Pictured: Ronnie's draughts set is one of the items which has been photographed by Londoner Peter Dazeley . A hair comb belonging to one of the brothers, who have both since died, is also part of the private collection . Mr Dazeley said the memorabilia showed the different sides to the Kray twins, who have now both died. He said: 'The low level of weaponry is extraordinary by today's standards. There's a pellet gun, crossbow and what looks like a child's catapult. 'Some of the items are somewhat more serious like Reggie's bayonet and knife, but then there is also his artist's paint set. 'These really are the personal effects of the twins. Amongst Ronnie's objects there is his cigarette case, comb and draught set as well as a sawn-off shotgun. 'And then again showing another side there's his pen and his infamous glasses. 'Also in a letter from their mother to a friend discussing her sons, she mentions that they 'are the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet and they have never hurt anyone only their own kind.' The twins were practically born into a life of crime and grew up in Bethnal Green, east London. During adulthood, the pair quickly certified themselves as the most 'notorious' brothers in the East End gangland. Ronnie was eventually certified insane and lived the remainder of his life in Broadmoor Hospital, where he died on March 17, 1995, of a heart attack at the age of 61. Reggie was freed on compassionate grounds with inoperable cancer on August 26, 2000, when he was almost 67, and died in his sleep on October 1, 2000. Reggie's paint set (left) and a cosh beloging to Ronnie (right) have also been revealed in the photograph project .

Pictured: Reggie's bayonet . Ronnie died in March 1995, while Reggie passed away in October 2000. Pictured: Ronnie's cigarette case . Mr Jones, curator of Littledean museum in the Forest of Dean, said he was given the items by Reggie and his family. He told MailOnline: 'I used to visit Reggie in prison before he died and I’ve had them for a number of years. They were gifted to me after a visit to see him at Maidstone Prison. 'I became friendly with him and he basically donated quite a number of items for display at what we call the ""Crime Through Time"" collection at Littledean.' Mr Jones said the pair became friendly after Kray contacted him with a view to donating some of his items. He said: 'He contacted me with a view to introducing himself and a number of other notorious gangland figures who have since donated a number of items for display at the museum. 'I visited him several times in prison in the 1990s. He was very, very quiet, a gentleman. 'He was able to provide me with a lot of other contacts who have been able to donate to the prison including Charles Bronson, Charlie Richardson, Freddie Foreman and many notorious villains.' Mr Jones said the items will go on display for the first time when the museum reopens for the season on March 28. He added: 'These items will all be on display along with many other personal artifacts from the Krays and their many acquaintances, both from the criminal underworld and friends from their celebrity circles. 'It’s the biggest private collection of Kray memorabilia on display to the public.' He added that the museum is a 'very controversial and politically incorrect museum' and said it's 'not everyone’s cup of tea'. The Krays were almost born into a life of crime. Their father, Charlie senior, was hardly the ideal role model. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was called up to join the Army, but deserted. Frequently away from home and up to no good, the twins probably saw more of the police, who kept visiting their house at 178 Vallance Road in Bethnal Green, than they did their father. It was up to their mother, Violet, to keep the family together, which was a struggle. From left to right: Reggie, Charlie and Ronnie Kray outside their home in Bethnal Green, east London . For a while, her three sons stayed out of trouble, and spent much of their spare time in the boxing ring, where the twins would win many a competition. However, by their late teens, Ronnie and Reggie were also fighting on the streets, and they soon started their own gang. When they turned 18 in 1951, they decided that military service was not for them. They spent most of their National Service in the guardroom. Matters came to a head when they were arrested for assaulting a policemen, and were imprisoned in Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Upon their return to the East End, it was clear they would never settle into regular lives. Their first business venture was a club called the Regal, off the Mile End Road, which looked like a dive from the outside but which the Krays turned into a glamorous, fashionable nightspot. Ronnie and Reggie Kray pictured in the 1960s . In their sharp suits, they did their best to maintain, publicly at least, a veneer of respectability, but they were involved in just about every form of criminality imaginable, from straightforward theft to gang violence and - ultimately - murder. Of the two siblings, Ronnie was considered the more dangerous. He was imprisoned in 1957 for GBH. While locked up, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, which partly explained his violent tendencies. Unusually for that time, Ronnie was also publicly bisexual, which Reggie found difficult to accept. Despite Reggie also being jailed in 1959, the Krays' 'business' activities went from strength to strength, and by the Sixties they were hobnobbing with stars such as Barbara Windsor, and eminent politicians such as Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie is likely to have had an affair. Ronnie remained unmarried, and Reggie's marriage to Frances Shea in 1965 only lasted for eight months. She died in 1967. It is thought that she committed suicide, although according to one account, Frances was murdered by Ronnie, for reasons that are unclear. In the middle of 1968, the twins’ older brother Charlie were arrested for murder. Ronnie had shot a rival gang member called George Cornell in the face when he was drinking in a pub, and Reggie, normally the 'gentle' one, had repeatedly stabbed gang member Jack 'The Hat' McVitie in the face and neck for not following orders. Both men were given life sentences, with a recommendation that they should serve at least 30 years. Charlie was sent down for ten years, for being an accessory to the murder of McVitie. Ronnie died in prison in 1995 aged 61 and Reggie died in 2000 aged 66. By Guy Adams .","Remarkable collection of weapons and memorabilia of Kray twins revealed .

"Tammy Gregory, 36 (pictured outside Reading Crown Court today) is accused of having sex with the underage boy at her home in in August 2013 . A mother-of-three had sex with a 14-year-old friend of her daughter when he went to her house after spending an evening drinking vodka, a court heard. Tammy Gregory, 36, appeared at Reading Crown Court today accused of having sex with the underage boy at her home in Reading, Berkshire, in August 2013. The court heard how the schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, arrived at Gregory's three-bedroomed house in the early hours following an evening out with her daughter and friends. Christopher Hewertson, prosecuting, told the jury that at about 2am or 3am the boy went to bed in Gregory's room, while his friends went into her young sons' room. The jury was shown the footage of a police interview with the schoolboy, who said that while Gregory's daughter went to bed in her own room, he went to sleep in the master bedroom. The court heard that the group had been drinking until about 2am and when the boy awoke in the double bed later that morning, Gregory, then aged 33, was in the bed next to him, wearing her pyjamas. The jury was told they then started kissing before having full sex. In the police video, the boy said: 'It was like 3am in the morning and she [Gregory's daughter] went to her room. 'So then I just went into her [Gregory's] bed. She was not there. 'I woke up, I don't know what time, it was light and she [Gregory] was there. 'We just started kissing and it happened. I pulled down her pyjama bottoms. We wasn't (sic) speaking. 'I stopped kissing her and pulled my shorts down and we had sex. I didn't say anything.' When questioned by Mr Hewertson, the boy admitted he had been drinking vodka on the night in question, mixed with fizzy drinks. Mr Hewertson told the jury of five men and seven women: 'The sexual activity takes place at the defendant's home address. 'There is no dispute that the victim was 14-years-old at the time. He had had his 14th birthday exactly a week before. 'Clearly alcohol was consumed. 'He wakes up close to dawn at which stage he is aware the defendant has got into bed with him. 'They roll over and face one another. There is a period of kissing. He, in effect, rolled on top of her. [It] led to full sex. 'It was full sexual activity, consensual and deliberate between the victim, aged 14, and defendant, clearly an adult.' Mr Hewertson told the jury that the question they had to answer was whether the pair actually had sex or not. 'He says squarely that they did and she says squarely that they did not,' he said. 'The prosecution says this is not some kind of figment of imagination, made up by him. There is no motive. It is simply his frank position. 'She deliberately, and we say significantly, had sex with him underage.' The court heard how Gregory allegedly engaged in 'full sexual activity' with the schoolboy, who is a friend of her daughter. The pair are said to have had sex after he went to her house after drinking vodka with friends . The schoolboy denied in cross-examination that he was lying about sleeping with Gregory and insisted she had joined him in bed and had sex with him. However, John Barker, defending, suggested that the boy had arrived at Gregory's three-storey home very drunk. He claimed that the boy had vomited in the back garden before being put to bed in the bedroom of Gregory's two young sons after she and her daughter cleaned up the mess. Mr Barker said that at some point during the night, the boy went into Gregory's bedroom and told her he felt unwell so she got him a glass of water and allowed him to sleep there. 'You were drunk and sick,' he suggested. 'You went to bed and were shown to the boys' room. Shortly after that you got up and went into Tammy's room. 'You complained that you were feeling sick and she brought you some water and you stayed there and fell asleep on top of the bed covers.' The boy denied that version of events, claiming he had gone to bed and had awoken to find Gregory beside him. Mr Barker accused the boy of lying about having sex with Gregory to his friends. 'Did you say to them ""I slept with Tammy"",' he asked. 'Is that how all this started? You lied to your friends?' However, the boy denied that he had lied and said: 'Why would I lie to them?' Gregory, 36, denies one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and insists the teenage boy was drunk and went to her bed and fell asleep. The trial at Reading Crown Court (pictured) continues . Mr Barker said Gregory's daughter had persuaded her mother to let the boy stay because he was so unwell. 'You were puking and she took pity on you,' he said. 'She persuaded Tammy to let you stay. She [Gregory] put you to bed soon after you arrived. She looked after you, got you a drink, talked to you for hours.' The boy denied that was the case and added: 'If I was lying, how would me telling two of my friends end up with me sitting here two years later?' The court heard that the boy's mother found out about the alleged incident through friends and confronted Gregory at her home before reporting it to police. Mr Hewertson said the boy did not feel like a victim. 'He, in many ways, despite being a child, doesn't consider himself really a victim in the archetypal sense,' he said. 'It is because he was fairly participating in the act.' Gregory denies one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. She insists that she was in bed on the night in question and that the boy came to her room drunk where she comforted him before he fell asleep. The trial continues.

"Game show viewers were left outraged by a buzzer's failure to ring out on Wednesday night's Family Feud, which saw a family miss out on winning a brand-new car. Team captains Matt Molloy and Mary Ryan were facing off at sudden death when the controversial moment happened. If the Ryans won they would have become the brand-new champions of the show, while the Molloys would have walked away with a Mitsubishi Outlander four-wheel-drive. Viewers were outraged when the Molloy family were beaten out by the Ryan family on Family Feud when a buzzer appeared to malfunction . Host Grant Denyer asked the pair to 'name something you might eat with egg'. In footage of the show, Mr Molloy is seen pushing down on the buzzer first to answer but no sound comes from it. A split second later, Ms Ryan reacts but her buzzer rings out much to the surprise of herself, Denyer, her opponent and the audience - who let out a big collective groan. The female contestant had to check the light below her button had been illuminated before she ventured to answer. Mary Ryan (left) and Matt Molloy (right) faced off at sudden death on Wednesday night . Denyer pauses for a few moments but in the end he allows Ms Ryan to answer the question with 'bacon', winning her family their title. Mr Molloy who is visibly disappointed walks back to his team with a confused look on his face. It appears he was not alone in his reaction. Angry viewers took to social media to vent their frustration at the oversight. Host Grant Denyer asked the pair to name 'something you might eat with egg' 'Matt hit it first... no doubt... I think family feud owe it to the molloy family to return to the show,' one woman wrote. 'For family feud to post this statement you obviously have recieved an outcry from your viewers. #Bringbackthemolloys.' While another accused network of rigging the outcome: 'Clearly @channelten don't have the budget to give away a car. He [Mr Molloy] clearly hit the button first.' The show was slammed with so much criticism that they released a statement in relation to the incident later on Wednesday. 'The Molloy family missed out on the car tonight in a very close Sudden Death segment,' the statement said. 'Mary hit the buzzer with a greater velocity and held it down, activating the buzzer’s electronic trigger.' Family Feud's technical experts also added: 'The buzzers are wired to identical electronic relays - as soon as one buzzer is ""closed"" (triggered), the other one is disabled. 'Mary’s relay has definitely been triggered first.'","Contestants Matt Molloy and Mary Ryan were facing off at sudden death .

"Amy Pascal's office move has been delayed because of a stench of marijuana permeating the building, sources close to the disgraced Sony executive say. They told The Hollywood Reporter that the odor was left behind by funnymen Seth Rogen and his frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg, as they occupied the space for a short time. Pascal, 56, whose controversial emails were leaked during the hacking scandal, is set to head up her own production company as part of her leaving package. Up in smoke: Amy Pascal's office move has been delayed because of a stench of marijuana permeating the building, sources close to the disgraced Sony executive say . The new job role - with a four-year contract - is said to be worth between $30 million and $40 million. The exact location of her new base is not known but it is set to be somewhere in the heart of Hollywood. She will reportedly move into temporary offices until the odor of marijuana sufficiently eliminated. The scent has apparently soaked into flooring and brickwork but nothing a lick of paint won't solve. Source of the problem? The odor was reportedly left behind by funnymen Seth Rogen and his frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg, as they occupied the space for a short time . In an interview last month, Amy Pascal opened up about her departure and acknowledged it wasn't voluntary. Speaking to journalist Tina Brown at the Women in the World conference in San Francisco, Pascal joked, 'All the women here are doing incredible things in this world. All I did was get fired."" After a long reign as the head of Sony Pictures, the studio announced Pascal was stepping down and would start a new production venture at Sony.

"A woman has swapped playing combat computer games for fighting for real after shedding 19 stone. Amy Graham, 48, from Salt Lake City, Utah, weighed 470lb (33st) at her heaviest and because she was a dress size 32, she could only find men's clothes to fit her. Speaking of her weight gain, Amy told MailOnline: 'I have always been a big girl. I was a fat child, I was a fat teenager, I was a fat twentysomething. Scroll down for video . Amy was 470lb (33st) at her heaviest and a dress size 32 but is now 204lb (14st) having lost 266lb (19st), right . 'There is a huge misconception about the amount of food someone eats at that size. It's surprisingly a much smaller amount than a normal-sized person. It's more about poor choices really. Eating something filled with fat and sugar instead of eating whole, natural foods. 'I was an avid online gamer and that contributed to my sedentary lifestyle. I played various games for many years. 'I stopped weighing myself at 450lbs because I couldn't find a scale big enough to weigh me over that. I know that I probably got up to around 470lbs at one point, and that scared me. 'I knew I never wanted to hit 500lbs in my lifetime. My dress size was probably a 32 at that point. I wore mostly men's clothes at that time because they were easier to find.' Amy used to struggle to find clothes to fit her when she was overweight, left, but now she's fighting fit, right, and competes in medieval combat fighting using real swords . When she turned 40, Amy realised she had to do something to change her lifestyle as her size meant she was suffering from a number of health problems. She and her husband, Greg, had tried for a baby but she believes her weight meant she was never able to conceive. She said of her health at the time: 'I developed sleep apnoea to the point I could not be regulated. 'I have PCOS (polycycstic ovaries syndrome), I had type 2 diabetes, I started to develop edema in my lower legs. 'I carried all my weight in my middle region and because of that I was also getting lower back pain. 'Once I hit 40, I knew things were only going to get worse for me.' Amy decided to have gastric bypass surgery but to qualify, she would first have to lose weight. These images chart Amy's progress following her gastric band bypass, left, to today, right . The side on view shows how Amy's stomach, bottom and arms have all shrunk thanks to her weightloss . Amy now has a defined waist, right, after losing 19st, pictured left when she was heavier . She explains: 'I saw my doctor who told me I would have to get down to 387lb (27st) so he would actually do my surgery. He needed room to work inside my abdomen, so I had to drop weight to even qualify for surgery. 'I crash dieted to get the weight off to the point he was ok moving forward. It took me two months.' Amy was than able to have the gastric bypass - and the operation was life-saving. 'Turns out having gastric bypass actually saved my life in ways I had no idea,' she said. 'When the doctor went in they found out that my liver was three times the size it should have been. 'My surgery took more than nine hours instead of the two it normally takes, because they had to work around my enlarged liver. 'My doctor came to me in recovery and told me that I needed to realise this surgery saved my life. Amy pictured with her husband Greg before her weightloss, left, and after, right . 'If I hadn't had it when I did, I would have been dead in two years because I would have needed a liver transplant and I would have never qualified to even be considered to be put on the list, much less be in any situation to get a new liver. 'I could never have lost the weight by diet and exercise to have saved my life in time. That is a sobering thought. 'So no matter what I crave, what I want to eat or drink now, I will always remember that my life would have been much shorter than even I expected had I not chosen this path.' Following the surgery, Amy lost 100lbs (7st) in the first 100 days and continued to lose weight over the following years so she now weighs 204lbs (14st) and is a dress size 12-14. Her lifestyle is now completely different to how it used to be and she had discovered a love of exercise after becoming involved in an unusual sport - medieval combat fighting. 'I went from being an online Valkyrie to a real live Valkyrie and I much prefer sword fighting for real,' Amy said. Amy now competes for the USA in medieval combat fighting . Amy, centre, seen in full armour brandishing an axe as she takes part in the combat sport . Amy has trained hard to complete in the sport that requires strength, power and agilty . The hard work paid off as Amy won a gold medal at the Medieval World Championship - who allowed women from around the globe to compete for the first time last year . She now competes for the USA in international competitions where she fights in full battle armour with swords and axes. The sport is billed as 'Game of Thrones meets Ultimate Fighting Championship' as the weapons are real and the fighters don't hold back. Explaining why she was attracted to the sport, Amy explains: 'When I first saw a fight, something awoke inside of me and I knew I had to do this. 'But I got told that because I was a girl, I was not allowed. But I was told in January 2012 that the USA team was going to start a league and that they would eventually allow women once we had enough interest. 'I kept hoping and supporting the team and on May 31, 2013 it was announced that for the first time women were going to be allowed to fight.' Amy started training so she could represent her country in the Medieval World Championship in Castillio de Belmonte, Spain, after they allowed women to take part for the first time in 2014. She said: 'I train five to six nights a week for more than two hours a night. My body craves that. I run, I lift weights, I swim, I sword fight. I am a medieval martial artist who loves what her body has become.' Amy said she's delighted to have gone from being an 'online Valkyrie to a real live Valkyrie' The combat fighter is proud of what she has achieved after losing weight and taking up the tough sport . The training paid off and Amy and team USA came home from the Medieval World Championship with gold medals. Now Amy is keen to carry on her training and keep winning battles. She said of taking part in the contact sport: 'What's it like to compete in the tournaments? It is quite possibly the most adrenaline filled, satisfying, challenging yet amazing thing in the world for me. It is my bliss. 'I am proud to be a female fighter. But I am also proud to be treated with the respect and comradely just like any male fighter is. 'I no longer look for excuses to NOT work out. I have a much harder time fitting everything into my world with my training schedule but I wouldn't trade my life for anything. 'I love how my body works. I love being 48-years-old and fighting women and men half my age.' Amy, right, competing in the sport which is described as 'Game of Thrones meets Ultimate Fighting' Amy wants to share her journey in a documentary, Iron Maidens, which is seeking funding . Amy has shared her story of medieval combat fighting with British TV company Total Wallop who are trying to secure funding to create a full documentary called 'Iron Maidens' focusing on the female fighters who compete in the brutal sport. Producer and director Matt Ralph said the sport is full of inspirational women like Amy whose stories they want to share with the world. He has set up a crowdfunding campaign with Indiegogo to raise funds to make his documentary. He said: 'For Amy, competing in the Medieval World Championship it marked the moment she had achieved her ultimate goal after losing weight. Full contact fighting had given her a purpose to get mentally and physically fit. 'I need funding to finish this documentary to show the world the jaw-dropping phenomena of medieval fighting is not just a realm for men, but that women are as tough, brutal, and as competitive as their male counterparts.'

"Downing Street has given a 'final offer' over the proposed election TV debates, involving seven party leaders, including David Cameron . A ‘final offer’ has been given to broadcasters for David Cameron to take part in one, seven-way TV election debate. Downing Street has accused the BBC and other networks of causing ‘chaos’ by attempting to dictate the terms of debates and repeatedly altering their proposals. It said broadcasters had ignored Mr Cameron’s long-held position that televised clashes between leaders were over-dominant in the 2010 election campaign and should start earlier. Number Ten is proposing a debate involving Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage, Green leader Natalie Bennett, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru’s Leanne Wood at the end of this month. ‘This is our final offer, and to be clear, given the fact this has been a deeply unsatisfactory process and we are within a month of the short campaign, the Prime Minister will not be participating in more than one debate,’ the Prime Minister’s director of communications Craig Oliver wrote to the BBC. The Tories’ ultimatum is unlikely to be agreed by other parties, or broadcasters who each want to hold one debate, prompting doubts about whether any will now take place. Mr Miliband has accused Mr Cameron of deliberately sabotaging negotiations over the debates and ‘running scared’. He said last night he would ‘do it anytime, any place, anywhere’, adding: ‘David Cameron must now name the day.’ Labour is suggesting a proposed head-to-head clash between Mr Miliband and the Prime Minister also goes ahead featuring just the Labour leader, leaving him debating a studio audience. However, sources at the main broadcasters concede it would be difficult to proceed if Mr Cameron does not agree to participate. Scroll down for video . The 2010 election was the first to feature American-style TV debates between political leaders. In that campaign, there were three debates between the three main party leaders over three weeks. X Factor-style push-button polling of viewers was used to declare a ‘winner’ in each case, with Mr Clegg’s initial success prompting so-called ‘Cleggmania’. Tory strategists believe that if the debates had not taken place, the Lib Dems would have fared worse and Mr Cameron would have won a majority. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon (left) and Plaid Cymru’s Leanne Wood (right) would be two of the seven candidates in the televised debate, if broadcasters agree with Number Ten's suggestion . They would be joined by the Green Party's Natalie Bennett, who the Tories always argued should be included . Under plans unveiled by the BBC, ITV, Sky News and Channel 4 last year, for this election, Ukip’s Mr Farage would have been invited to take part in one debate also featuring Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg. The Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem leaders were then to take part in a three-way discussion, before Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband went head-to-head in a final televised clash. The Tories complained that the Green Party, which has been ahead of the Lib Dems in several polls, should be included. Earlier this year, the broadcasters suggested an alternative format, which would have seen two clashes involving seven parties, including the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the Scottish Nationalists but excluding the DUP, followed by one head-to-head between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband on April 30. The latest proposals have angered senior Lib Dems, who complained that as a party of government they should not be reduced to minority party status. The 2010 election was the first to feature the debates, leading to so-called 'Cleggmania' following the success of the Lib Dem leader (right). If they are to go ahead, it will be the first televised debate for Ed Miliband (left) Under plans unveiled by the BBC, ITV, Sky News and Channel 4 last year, Ukip’s Nigel Farage (pictured) would have been invited to take part in one debate alongside Miliband, Clegg and Cameron . Ukip, meanwhile, was angry that its position was diluted, while some Labour figures doubted the wisdom of taking part in two debates with the Greens and the SNP, both eating into their party’s vote. In a letter to the BBC’s Sue Inglish, chair of the broadcasters’ leaders’ debates committee, Mr Oliver said he had ‘serious concerns about the way in which this has been handled from the start’. ‘Despite the Prime Minister having been clear about his concern around holding debates in the short campaign, you did not consult us before issuing a press release last October outlining your plans for three debates during that period,’ he said. ‘Had you consulted us, we could have also told you that we also did not think it was appropriate to exclude the Green Party from the process. Tory strategists believe that if the debates had not taken place in 2010, the Lib Dems would have fared worse and Mr Cameron would have won a majority . ‘Despite all of this, we then entered into negotiations in good faith, during which I made the case for a more representative debates structure, including the Greens. It is fair to say that the desire to exclude the Greens was clear from all other parties present. ‘Three months later – and again without consultation – you surprised us again by proposing a new seven-party structure, this time not only inviting the Greens, but Plaid Cymru and the SNP as well. Again, this was a flawed proposal that has resulted in the DUP initiating what appears to be legitimate legal action. ‘Since this proposal has been suggested, there has been chaos. In recent weeks, you have avoided letting the parties sit in a room to hammer out proposals, making progress impossible.’ To ‘cut through this chaotic situation’, he said the Prime Minister would take part in one, 90-minute debate with the leaders of the Green Party, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, SNP and UKIP, to take place in the week of March 23. A Labour source said: ‘Behind the scenes, Cameron’s team are doing everything they can to scupper the negotiations and sink the debates.’","Downing Street said broadcasters caused 'chaos' with debate proposals .

"The Secret Service has announced plans to fly its own drones in restricted airspace over Washington D.C. The agency, which has been hit by a number of recent high profile security breaches into the White House grounds, has declined to say what the flights are for, nor specifically when they will occur.

In January, the agency was embarrassed when a small drone piloted by a drunk government employee crash landed onto the White House lawn and recently Paris has been unnerved by a spate of drones seen buzzing the Eiffel Tower, the US Embassy and other key city landmarks. The January episode highlighted a serious security gap that the Secret Service has so far been unable to plug - how to combat the threat of drones flown over the nation's capital and specifically against the White House. The United States Secret Service, in conjunction with other inter-agency partners, will conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems, in the coming days and weeks. Because these exercises will be conducted within the normally flight restricted areas in the Washington D.C. area, they have been carefully planned and will be tightly controlled. In preparation for these exercises the Secret Service has coordinated with all appropriate federal, state and local agencies. However, some aviation and security experts have expressed concern about the scope of the Secret Service's use of drones. Michael Drobac, executive director of the Small UAV Coalition told the Washington Times he thinks that the flights are firstly a public relations exercise designed to restore confidence but he is worried about what the agency will do with all the surveillance material it collects. 'The beauty of their exercise is they get to do real-world outdoor operations that will promote safety for the White House, for monuments and for the general public,' said Drobac. '(But) If the Secret Service uses it inappropriately, I’d be the first to say they have to stop that,” he said. “They’re going to have to disclose what they intend to do at some point, because that’s exactly what it says in the executive order. Agencies have to be transparent.' The executive order was issued by President Obama in February and governs how any federal agencies using drones keep information gathered. All agencies wishing to use drones must publish their own guidelines on keeping and gathering the information so that people's privacy is not violated. Found: The recreational drone that landed on the White House South Lawn is seen in this U.S. Secret Service handout . Prevalent: The Secret Service has become increasingly worried about the threat of armed drones and the safety of the president . 'Beyond using it for ways that are invasive to consumer privacy, which they should not do, if they are using it to protect grounds in Washington D.C. that are restricted, I’m for it,' said Drobac. Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainar issued a 76-word statement to announce the flights, which leads some to believe they are ready to deploy operational drones to combat any threats to the president and his family. 'They’re testing it in the field, as opposed to just testing it at a research station,' said Brendan Schulman, head of the unmanned aircraft systems practice at the New York law firm of Kramer Levin. 'That might suggest that they are closer to an actual functional defense mechanism than the public might think.'","Secret Service released 76-word statement signaling the test flights .

"Hillary Clinton, pictured in 2012. The presumptive presidential candidate for the Democrats, used a personal email account when Secretary of State, rather than a government-issued email address . The computer server that transmitted and received Hillary Clinton's emails - on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was Secretary of State - traced back to an Internet service-registered to her family's home in Chappaqua, New York, according to records reviewed. The highly unusual practice of a Cabinet-level official physically running her own email would have given Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, impressive control over limiting access to her message archives. It also would distinguish Clinton's secretive email practices as far more sophisticated than some politicians, including Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, who were caught conducting official business using free email services operated by Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. Most Internet users rely on professional outside companies, such as Google Inc. or their own employers, for the behind-the-scenes complexities of managing their email communications. Government employees generally use servers run by federal agencies where they work. In most cases, individuals who operate their own email servers are technical experts or users so concerned about issues of privacy and surveillance they take matters into their own hands. Clinton has not described her motivation for using a private email account - hdr22@clintonemail.com - which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym - for official State Department business. Operating her own server would have afforded Clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails. And since the Secret Service was guarding Clinton's home, an email server there would have been well protected from theft or a physical hacking. But homebrew email servers are generally not as reliable, secure from hackers or protected from fires or floods as those in commercial data centers. Those professional facilities provide monitoring for viruses or hacking attempts, regulated temperatures, off-site backups, generators in case of power outages, fire-suppression systems and redundant communications lines. Scroll down for video . The Clintons' home in Chappaqua, upstate New York.  Hillary Clinton's emails - on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was Secretary of State - traced back to an Internet service-registered to the family's home . A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to requests seeking comment on Tuesday. Clinton ignored the issue during a speech on Tuesday night at the 30th anniversary gala of EMILY's List, which works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights. It was unclear whom Clinton hired to set up or maintain her private email server, which the AP traced to a mysterious identity, Eric Hoteham. That name does not appear in public records databases, campaign contribution records or Internet background searches. Hoteham was listed as the customer at Clinton's $1.7 million home on Old House Lane in Chappaqua in records registering the Internet address for her email server since August 2010. The Hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Clinton's email server. The former president's full name is William Jefferson Clinton. In November 2012, without explanation, Clinton's private email account was reconfigured to use Google's servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed, according to Internet records. That is significant because Clinton publicly supported Google's accusations in June 2011 that China's government had tried to break into the Google mail accounts of senior U.S. government officials. It was one of the first instances of a major American corporation openly accusing a foreign government of hacking. Then, in July 2013, five months after she resigned as Secretary of State, Clinton's private email server was reconfigured again to use a Denver-based commercial email provider, MX Logic, which is now owned by McAfee Inc., a top Internet security company. The New York Times reported on Monday that Clinton exclusively used a personal email account it did not specify to conduct State Department business. The disclosure raised questions about whether she took actions to preserve copies of her old work-related emails, as required by the Federal Records Act. A Clinton spokesman, Nick Merrill, told the newspaper that Clinton complied with the letter and spirit of the law because her advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails to decide which ones to turn over to the State Department after the agency asked for them. In theory but not in practice, Clinton's official emails would be accessible to anyone who requested copies under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Under the law, citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Since Clinton effectively retained control over emails in her private account even after she resigned in 2013, the government would have to negotiate with Clinton to turn over messages it can't already retrieve from the inboxes of federal employees she emailed. The AP has waited more than a year under the open records law for the State Department to turn over some emails covering Clinton's tenure as the nation's top diplomat, although the agency has never suggested that it didn't possess all her emails. Clinton's private email account surfaced publicly in March 2013 after a convicted Romanian hacker known as Guccifer published emails stolen from former White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal. The Internet domain was registered around the time of her secretary of state nomination. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the special House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, said the committee learned last summer - when agency documents were turned over to the committee - that Clinton had used a private email account while secretary of state. More recently the committee learned that she used private email accounts exclusively and had more than one, Gowdy said. President Obama signed a bill last year that bans the use of private email accounts by government officials unless they retain copies of messages in their official account or forward copies to their government accounts within 20 days. The bill did not become law until more than one year after Clinton left the State Department.","The  unusual practice of a Cabinet-level official physically running her own email would have given Clinton control over limiting access to her archives .

"Gipsies have been banned from setting up illegal campsites across an entire town after a landmark High Court ruling. Harlow Council and Essex County Council were granted the interim injunction after Harlow, Essex, was besieged by travellers illegally camping on cycle paths, highway verges and car parks. The ban protects 454 'parcels' of land across the town - including parks, playgrounds and schools - and is believed to be 'unprecedented' in its scale. Besieged: Travellers camped along the side of a road in Harlow, Essex, last year. Gipsies have been banned from setting up illegal campsites across the entire town after a landmark ruling at the High Court yesterday . Ban: The injunction protects 454 'parcels' of land across the town - including parks, playgrounds and schools - and is believed to be 'unprecedented' in its scale. Above, one travellers' camp in the town last year . In total, the areas covered by the ban account for a third of the land in Harlow, according to a spokesman for the council. Gipsies have been moved from illegal encampments in the town - which is just 25 miles from Dale Farm, formerly the site Europe's largest traveller camp - on 109 occasions since October 2013. The temporary injunction will mean anyone illegally camping in Harlow could be fined or imprisoned for contempt of court. It will remain in place until a full hearing later this year. The order was served to travellers who were part of an unauthorised camp at Horsecroft Place this morning. The group has since moved on from the site, a spokesman at Harlow Council said. Injunction papers will also be  displayed on the 454 parcels of land over the coming days. The ban applies to 35 named travellers, all of whom have now left the town, and will also protect land from encampments by 'persons unknown'. Two legal traveller sites in the town, with a total of 44 plots, which will be unaffected by the ruling. Harlow Council said although injunctions had been granted in other areas of the country, it believed no ban covering an entire town had ever been applied for and granted. 'Blighted': Gipsies have been moved from illegal campsites in the town on 109 separate occasions since October 2013. Above, police attend one illegal site that was set up on a cycle path in the town last year . 'Unprecedented': Harlow Council said although injunctions had been granted in other areas of the country, it believed no ban on this scale had ever been applied for and granted. Above, an illegal site pictured last year . Last year, Leeds City Council successfully applied for an injunction protecting six 'environmentally sensitive' areas of land in the city. And it was reported in September that Coventry City Council was seeking a 'blanket' injunction covering the whole city. The ruling by Mrs Justice Patterson at the High Court yesterday was welcomed by Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow, who described it as a 'major step forward in ridding the town of this blight.' Harlow Council leader, Jon Clempner, said: 'The town has had enough and we needed to resolve this situation with a long term solution to protect land now and in the future. 'An injunction, which covers a piece of land here and there was never going to work, so we had to look at a something which has never been done before and is town-wide. 'Months and months of detailed preparation backed up with a catalogue of community concerns meant we had a very strong case that could be put forward to the judge. 'It is not - and never has been - about persecuting any particular group of people or their way of life. 'This situation has really tested the patience of the whole community and we need to end this cat-and-mouse game which is being played. 'Seeking a High Court injunction of this size and scale takes time and requires a huge amount of preparation to get it right especially when it has never been done anywhere before.' Nearby: Harlow is just 25 miles from Dale Farm, pictured, formerly Europe's largest traveller camp . Evicted: Violence erupted when gipsies were removed from the illegal site in Basildon, Essex in October 2011 . But the decision has been slammed by traveller leaders. A spokesman for the Gypsy Council said: 'Unauthorised encampments are a reaction to lack of provision by local authorities. 'What's to stop the government from applying for an injunction for the whole country and managing to totally wipe out a way of life?' Harlow stands less than 25 miles from Europe's former largest illegal traveller site, Dale Farm, in Basildon, Essex. Basildon Borough Council spent more than £7 million of taxpayers' money on a controversial eviction of the site in October 2011 following a 10-year legal battle.","Travellers banned from setting up illegal campsites in Harlow, Essex .

"An old school friend has revealed Andrew Chan never thought his impending execution would actually happen as it emerges Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop made a final bid to have the Bali Nine duo spared by offering to handover three Indonesian prisoners being held in Australia. Sami, who did not wish to give his last name, had been exchanging text messages with the convicted drug smuggler up until late Tuesday night before the Australian was transferred to Nusakambangan in Central Java from Bali's Kerobokan prison. The friend, who has known Chan since they met in Year 7 at Homebush Boys High in Sydney's west, told 9News the Bali Nine ringleader was calm when they spoke through text messaging application, Whatsapp. Scroll down for video . Fellow Bali Nine member Andrew Chan was also onboard the chartered flight to Cilacap . Myuran Sukuraman arrives in Cilacap - the closest port to Nusakambangan - on Wednesday morning local time . A school friend of Chan's (left), who went to Homebush Boys High with him (Chan pictured right as a student), told 9News the Australian had been calm and stayed positive up until yesterday about his impending execution . Sami and Chan had been exchanging text messages on Whatsapp (pictured) up until Tuesday night . 'Even he thought it was never going to happen because he thought we're in the limelight - it'll cool down, it'll be alright,' Sami said. 'So I always said, ""yeah mate, definitely - you're in good hands"".' At least once during their exchange, Chan text him 'all good bro'. Sami added Chan kept positive throughout the ordeal and said: 'I think he [Chan] was really expecting the Australian government to do a lot more.' It comes as it is revealed Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop made a desperate plea to Jakarta officials to swap Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukuraman for three Indonesian drug offenders being held in Australia. Ms Bishop proposed the deal in a 'very tense' phone call with Indonesian foreign affairs minister Retno Marsudi, The Australian reported. Earlier this week, Indonesia's human rights commissioner Natalius Pigai (centre) with Sukuraman (left) and Chan (right) It has been revealed Foreign Affair Minister Julie Bishop bargained to have the duo's lives spared in exchange for three Indonesian drug smugglers who were caught with 252 kilograms of heroin in Australia . The pair were taken onto a ship from Cilacap port to Nusakambangan port in armoured car . The port was heavily guarded as Chan and Sukuraman made their way from Cilacap airport on Wednesday morning in Central Java . This is their final journey to Nusakambangan before they will be executed by firing squad . It is tipped they will be killed this weekend and will be given 72 hours notice before it happens . Indonesia has allocated around $20,000 for each prisoner in its 'execution budget' to kill the Australians . The call became so intense that it was feared Ms Marsudi would put a sudden end to the conversation. The prisoners up for negotiation were three Indonesians caught smuggling 252 kilograms of heroin into Australia by sea in 2000. Kristito Mandagiand - who masterminded the plan - was handed the most severe sentence of 25 years without parole for drug smuggling. While the two people who helped him, Saud Siregar and Ismunandar, will spend up to 20 years in prison and can apply for parole in 2017. In exchange for the trio, Ms Bishop wanted Chan and Sukuraman's death sentences reduced to life in prison. Chan's brother, Michael (right), and girlfriend Febyanti Herewila (left) tried to visit the inmate before he was put into an armoured car but were rebuffed by prison officers . Earlier this week, it was thought they would be transferred at midday but officials jumped the gun and bailed the pair out early on Wednesday morning just after 5am local time . Heavily armoured police lined the gates of Kerobokan prison as they prepared for the duo's transfer . Coming through the main entrance, the duo were taken to Denpasar airport where they were flown to Central Java . But the suggestion, which was made during a 30-minute conversation, was not accepted by the government, according to sources. This exchange was offered up after Chan and Sukuraman were transferred from Kerobokan prison - which had been their home for 10 years - after 5am local time on Wednesday. Chan's brother, Michael, and girlfriend, Febyanti Herewila, tried to visit the inmate before he was put into an armoured car but were rebuffed by prison officers. Later that day, Michael Chan told News Corp he was 'devastated' and in shock that his brother's execution was going ahead. Mother of Andrew Chan, Helen (centre), looked downcast as she escorted through Sydney International Airport en route to Indonesia following the pair's transfer . 'I am still trying to register it all. I still can't believe it has happened. I don't even know what to say to be quite frank,' he said. It is not known when Chan and Sukuraman will be executed but Fairfax Media is reporting they will be shot dead this weekend. Indonesia's attorney general H.M. Prasetyo is tipped to make an announcement about the time of their deaths on Friday. The pair will be given 72 hours' notice before they are killed by a firing squad at Nusakambangan. Indonesia has allocated about $20,000 for each prisoner in its 'execution budget' to kill the duo. Nusakambangan was chosen as the venue for their deaths because it was cheaper than other locations. Leading up to this month's execution, firing squads have been practising their aim, according to locals . Up to 10 drug traffickers will join Chan (right) and Sukumaran (left) on Nusakambangan .

"Jailed: Craig O'Neill, 26, was caught at his home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, with his victim after her parents tracked him down through Facebook . A paedophile who groomed a 14-year-old schoolgirl with money and presents has been jailed for four years. Craig O'Neill, 26, was caught at his home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, with his victim after her parents  tracked him down through Facebook. Police also discovered a vile collection of indecent images of children and extreme pornography on his home computer. O'Neill was jailed for four years after he pleaded guilty to a series of charges including child abduction at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, yesterday. There was no evidence that there was any sexual contact between the pair, but Judge Potter said that O'Neill was 'very close to getting what he desired... sexual gratification'. He said: 'I have no doubt that what you were doing that night were acts that were designed by you to encourage her.' O'Neill, a former chimney sweep, first connected with the girl on Facebook and the pair met twice in June 2013. He gave her £400 in cash on the first occasion then bought her clothing, pyjamas and £100 Ugg boots in Manchester. The girl, who cannot be named, had told her mother that she was meeting a friend at McDonald's but went to O'Neill's house that night where they drank vodka and he smoked cannabis. Andy Smith, prosecuting, said her mother became anxious after she said she wanted to stay out and then turned her phone off. Her mother alerted her friends and a message she had sent to one of them on Facebook revealed her location to be on O'Neill's street. Police officers attended with her mother, but they didn't know his exact address. The girl's parents returned shortly after 6am the next morning and knocked on doors until a neighbour pointed them in the right direction. Found: The schoolgirl's parents used Facebook to track her to O'Neill's home on this Manchester street . Mr Smith said O'Neill answered the door in shorts and a T-shirt and that the girl's parents recognised him from their daughter's Facebook account. He said: 'O'Neill said he had not touched her. Her dad ran upstairs and pushed the bedroom door open. She was there. She was wearing the pyjamas he had bought her.' The police were alerted and O'Neill was arrested. The court heard that in interviews, he accepted that he knew she was 14. Analysis of his computer revealed a collection of indecent images of children and extreme pornography had been downloaded. Following the conviction yesterday, the girl's mother spoke of her terror and issued a chilling warning to parents over the dangers of Facebook. She said: 'She knows now how dangerous the situation was. You never know who people really are on Facebook. Parents should never take their eyes off their children's computer use. 'My daughter is quiet and sensible but not very streetwise. I just cannot understand how this happened under my nose. I cannot forgive myself really. 'I now have control over my daughter's Facebook password. 'I can honestly say I had some sort of guardian angel because I had never seen the guy and I didn't know where he lived but we managed to find him. 'She is a good girl and feels a bit silly by what has happened. She has learned her lesson. She now knows how dangerous it can be to meet people through Facebook. 'She is now going to college and to work in healthcare. The one thing I would say to any parent is to install the GPS software on your children's phone and to make sure they know about the dangers.' Lewis Bretts, defending O'Neill, said: 'He has shown his remorse. He understands how serious these offences are.' O'Neill was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life and subjected to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order to monitor his activity on release.","Craig O'Neill connected with 14-year-old victim on social networking site .

"Carer Lisa Weare, 32, (pictured) from Blackpool, Lancashire, stole her victim's bank card and used it to spend a total of £6,254 over an eight-month period . A carer who stole £6,000 from a vulnerable woman and spent some of the money on Girls Aloud concert tickets has been jailed. Lisa Weare, from Blackpool, Lancashire, used the victim's bank card to withdraw money from her account and spent the money on gig tickets, mobile phone bills and textiles for a business she was setting up. The 32-year-old, who spent £500 on four Girls Aloud tickets, has now been jailed for 16 months after a judge told her she had 'let her employers and victim down'. The court heard how Weare was a carer for Fylde Community Link when the crimes took place over an eight-month period between July 2012 and March 2013. Kevin Slack, prosecuting, said the victim was unable to read or write, had no concept of the value of money and needed extensive help for day-to-day living. Part of her care was provided by Weare. He told the court that the victim, who has not been named, had two bank accounts and a locked tin that money would be placed into. There was supposed to be a clear audit trail where any movement of money in or out of the accounts or the tin would be recorded in a cash book and dated. However, one of the victim's three sisters noted small inconsistencies with the movement of the money, which she raised with the company and also at a safeguarding meeting towards the end of 2012. Mr Slack said that in February of the following year a community manager at the company noticed a number of discrepancies regarding the bank accounts. He said money withdrawn had not been recorded in the cash book, or on occasions a lower sum had been entered in the book, compared to the amount actually withdrawn. He said it became clear Weare had been responsible for the bank withdrawals and she was  suspended. Further transactions were later discovered. Mr Slack said: 'The defendant bid £500 to buy four Girls Aloud concert tickets. This was in October of 2012. She paid for them in March, three days after she had been suspended. 'Again, the victim's bank card had been used.' Mr Slack added that a textile firm had been paid £175, using the victim's bank card, for 50 metres of organza cloth and there were also payments for mobile phone bills of £929. In total, £6,254 was withdrawn from the bank accounts over the eight-month period, the court heard. Weare admitted theft and three counts of fraud at the hearing today. The judge was told that the victim had been having nightmares about 'horrible things' since the incident and no longer felt safe when she went to sleep. Weare, 32, used some of the money she stole to bid on four concert tickets for pop band Girls Aloud (pictured) Weare was jailed at Preston Crown Court (pictured) for 16 months after admitting theft and three counts of fraud.  The court heard she had saved up £3,700 in the hope of compensating the victim for every penny . Daniel Harman, defending, said Weare had lost her good character in the most catastrophic way. He said: 'She accrued a large amount of personal debt, run up following difficulties in the marriage and getting in the pocket of pay day lenders. 'Secondly, there was a significant increase in her alcohol intake and catastrophic errors of judgment, where she took from somebody she had worked for over many years.' He added the defendant was remorseful and apologised wholeheartedly. The court heard she had saved up £3,700 in the hope of compensating the victim for every penny. Jailing her at Preston Crown Court, Judge Simon Newell told her: 'This case isn't just about £6,000. 'It isn't just about a substantial breach of trust by a young woman who has no previous convictions, but has used this money for her own purposes. 'This is about the distress and devastation of a very vulnerable person. That can't be measured in monetary terms because feelings, emotions and life difficulties are something which are immeasurable.' He told Weare: 'Your employers trusted you, her family trusted you and the woman trusted you. You let all of them down.' Referring to the three examples of where the money went, he said: 'None of honest payments are for basic materials you might need in your life, that someone under stress or financial difficulty might require. 'The victim has had to wait the best part of two years for justice to be done because in that very long period of time there has been avoidance, evasion and denial.'","Lisa Weare, 32, took her victim's bank card and withdrew sums of money .

"Pebble's new Time smartwatch has become the most funded project ever on crowd-funding site Kickstarter, raising more than £9.7 million ($14.9 million) in one week. The smartwatch, which is Pebble's third product but the first to feature a colour screen, had already broken one record by raising over (£5.8 million) ($9 million) in its first day on the site. So far, more than 60,000 people have backed the Pebble Time project, which is set to be launched in May this year. California company Pebble has broken the all-time Kickstarter record. They raised more than £9.7 million in just a week - with 23 days still to go. So far more than 60,000 people have backed the new smartwatch (shown). But Pebble has been criticised for still using Kickstarter to raise funds . Pebble Time beat the previous overall funding record of £8.7 million ($13.3 million) set by the Coolest Cooler, a drinks cooler that comes with a built-in blender, wireless speaker and USB charging points - and there are still 23 days of funding to go in Pebble's Kickstarter. Pebble's original smartwatch is third on the all-time list, having raised more than £6.5 million ($10 million) after having an initial funding goal of £65,000 ($100,000). The new Time smartwatch comes with a colour e-paper screen similar to the technology used on e-readers such as the Amazon Kindle, with Pebble promising up to seven days battery life as a result. The watch is also water resistant. The Time will have a retail price of £129 ($199) once the Kickstarter campaign ends on March 28, but those who choose to fund the Time have been able to pre-order the wearable device for less. 1. Pebble Time - £10 million ($15.3 million) raised so far . 2. Coolest Cooler - £8.6 million ($13.2 million) 3. Pebble 1st generation smartwatch - £6.6 million ($10.2 million) 4. Exploding Kittens card game - £5.7 million ($8.7 million) 5. OUYA games console - £5.5 million ($8.5 million) 6. Pono Music player - £4 million ($6.2 million) 7. Veronica Mars movie - £3.7 million ($5.7 million) 8. Bring Back Reading Rainbow - £3.5 million ($5.4 million) 9. Torment: Tides of Numenera game - £2.7 million ($4.1 million) 10. Project Eternity game - £2.5 million ($3.9 million) There are still units available for £116 ($179) on Pebble's Kickstarter page. A movie of TV show Veronica Mars and Scrubs actor Zach Braff's most recent movie Wish I Was Here have both been funded on the site previously, as has a music player by Neil Young. Some experts, however, have criticised the use of Kickstarter by established companies like Pebble - and say it should be the reserve of startups only. More than a million units of the original Pebble Watch have been sold since it was funded in 2012, making it one of the most successful wearables on the market. ‘I'm not saying that successful people can't use Kickstarter but, to me, their cap-in-hand use of the platform has always felt fraudulent,’ said Daniel Cooper for Engadget. Pebble Time beat the previous overall funding record of £8.7 million ($13.3 million) set by the Coolest Cooler (pictured), a drinks cooler that comes with a built-in blender, wireless speaker and USB charging points - and there are still 23 days of funding to go in Pebble's Kickstarter .

The watch is also water resistant . ‘It'd be like watching Bill Gates, Mark Cuban and Warren Buffett panhandling on the streets of Seattle.’ He added: ‘It's a romantic notion, but I always saw Kickstarter as a way to empower inventors (and creatives) who couldn't get backing any other way.’ At the Mobile World Congress technology show in Barcelona this week, Pebble announced they would also be selling a high-end Steel version of the Time that would cost around £160 ($245), and look similar to the premium version of the Apple Watch. Some experts have suggested this week that the premium Apple Watch Edition could cost as much as £425 ($650), meaning Pebble may be able to draw attention and possibly some sales away from the technology giant by undercutting them in price. Apple is set to announce the final details of its own wearable at a press event in San Francisco next week, including a launch date and full price options of the three versions of the device. Last month, Apple chief Tim Cook confirmed the wearable would go on sale in April.","California company Pebble has broken the all-time Kickstarter record .

"Nick Clegg will pledge that his party will bring forward plans to decriminalise possession of drugs . Nick Clegg will today press ahead with plans to decriminalise possession of all drugs – despite charities warning the move will wreck thousands of lives. The Lib Dem leader is to pledge that his party will bring forward plans to ensure those caught with drugs for ‘personal use’ will no longer face criminal prosecution. Instead, the maximum penalty would be a fine. The move covers the powerful ‘skunk’ strain of cannabis and hard drugs such as crack cocaine and heroin, as well as ‘soft’ drugs including marijuana and amphetamines. Mr Clegg will use a joint event with Virgin boss and long-time pro-drugs campaigner Sir Richard Branson today to claim that the move will spare thousands of young people a criminal record. But experts last night condemned the move, saying it will push thousands of youngsters into addiction and mental health problems. A poll of 100 charities by the Centre for Social Justice found that 69 per cent of charities in the field would be concerned if the Government decriminalised cannabis. More than half – 56 per cent – said cannabis use would increase if its use was decriminalised. Christian Guy, the think tank’s director, said: ‘Drug addiction is ripping Britain’s poorest communities apart. Our network of 300 front-line charities sees this on a daily basis. Many are right to be worried that liberalising cannabis laws will lead to more people taking drugs and developing harder use. ‘Politicians need to listen to these experts. They are the people who witness the devastating impact of drugs in our poorest neighbourhoods day in, day out.’ Mary Brett, a trustee of the charity Cannabis Skunk Sense, said there was a ‘severe contradiction’ between the policy and Mr Clegg’s concern for mental health. She said: ‘Nick Clegg demonstrates complete ignorance of the facts on drugs like cannabis and skunk. There is overwhelming evidence of a link between skunk and mental health problems like psychosis and schizophrenia. ‘If you decriminalise or legalise drugs then children will think it is okay to do, that it is safe. It is deeply irresponsible.’ Mr Clegg will use a joint event with Virgin boss and long-time pro-drugs campaigner Sir Richard Branson to claim that the move will spare thousands of young people a criminal record . Mr Clegg’s intervention comes weeks after a major academic study found that use of powerful skunk cannabis trebled the risk of having a psychotic episode. Under the Lib Dem proposals – which have been vetoed by David Cameron in government – drug users would no longer face prosecution if caught carrying drugs deemed to be for personal use. The maximum penalty would be a fine, with no criminal record. Persistent drug users would be referred for treatment or put on education programmes. A spokesman for Mr Clegg said the Deputy Prime Minister believed drugs should be treated as a ‘health issue, rather than a criminal justice issue’. ‘Nick is anti-drugs,’ he said. ‘But just throwing people into the criminal justice system isn’t working – skunk use is going up.’ Mr Clegg speaks during a visit to church in 2010 after revealing he is no longer an atheist . He had seemed happy to be considered an atheist. But it appears Nick Clegg has had a change of heart – and admitted he is warming to God. The Liberal Democrat leader yesterday spoke of the ‘great joy’ he experiences when attending Mass with his Catholic wife Miriam. He told Premier Christian Radio he was now uncomfortable being labelled as an atheist. ‘I now accompany Miriam and the children, and do so with great joy, to Mass pretty much every weekend,’ he said. ‘I sometimes think it must be the most wonderful thing to be infused with faith. It’s not something that’s happened to me, it’s not happened to me yet. I would embrace it.’ In 2007, Mr Clegg was asked if he believed in God and replied simply: ‘No.’ He later said he had ‘enormous respect’ for people of religious faith but was not an ‘active believer’. Mr Clegg has always said he is happy for his children to be brought up as Catholics. His eldest son Antonio now attends the London Oratory, one of the country’s leading Catholic state schools.","Nick Clegg will  bring forward plans at event with Richard Branson today .

"The Supreme Court of Alabama has ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples in the latest development in a fierce battle over the power of federal law. In its ruling on Tuesday evening, the all-Republican court said a previous federal ruling stating that banning same-sex marriage violates the US Constitution does not prevent it from following state law. In Alabama, marriage has been legally defined as the union of only one man and one woman for two centuries, it said, siding with an argument recently offered by a pair of conservative organizations. 'Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to this law. Nothing in the United States Constitution alters or overrides this duty', the court added. Ruling: The Supreme Court of Alabama (pictured) has ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples in the latest development in a fierce battle over the power of federal law . The state's probate judges now have five days to file a letter stating why they should not have to adhere to the court's decision, according to ABC. Six justices concurred in Tuesday's 134-page opinion, which was not signed. However, the court's most outspoken opponent of gay marriage, Chief Justice Roy Moore, recused himself. Last month, two conservative groups appealed a decision by District Judge Callie Granade of Mobile, who ruled that Alabama's constitutional and statutory bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional. Immediately after Granade's ruling, Moore told probate judges across the state they were not obliged to issue same-sex marriage licenses. His stance created widespread confusion among judges. Awaiting a license: In its ruling on Tuesday evening, the  court said a previous federal ruling stating that banning gay marriage violates the US Constitution does not prevent it from following state law. Above, Shante Wolfe, left, and Tori Sisson, right, wait for their marriage license to be processed  in Montgomery, Ala., last month . Protesters: In Alabama, marriage has been legally defined as the union of only one man and one woman for two centuries, the court said. Above, people rally against same-sex marriage in Montgomery on February 21 . Some refused to issue the licenses to engaged same-sex couples, while others shut down their operations for all couples, gay and straight, until they could get a clear answer. Justice Jim Main agreed with the result but said he has concerns about procedural aspects 'of this highly unusual case'. In a dissent, Justice Greg Shaw said it was 'unfortunate' that federal courts refused to delay gay marriage in the state until the US Supreme Court could settle the issue nationally. But, Shaw said, the state Supreme Court does not have the power to consider the issue. The court released the decision while Gov. Robert Bentley and most state leaders were assembled in Montgomery for the state of the state address. Differing opinions: Six justices concurred in Tuesday's  opinion, which was not signed. However, the court's most outspoken opponent of gay marriage, Chief Justice Roy Moore (left), recused himself. Right, Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the court's position was 'unfortunate' Bentley's spokesman said the administration was reviewing the decision and had no comment. Joe Godfrey, executive director of the Alabama Citizens Action Program, said he was 'very excited' about the decision blocking judges from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. 'We are concerned about the family and the danger that same-sex marriage will have. It will be a devastating blow to the family, which is already struggling,' Godfrey said. He added the ruling will give 'some stability' in Alabama until the Supreme Court rules later this year. However, lawyers representing same-sex couples seeking the right to marry in Alabama said the court showed 'callous disregard' in its decision. It added that the court overstepped its bounds by declaring that Alabama's ban on same-sex marriages is constitutional, something the justices had not been asked to consider. 'It is deeply unfortunate that even as nationwide marriage equality is on the horizon, the Alabama Supreme Court is determined to be on the wrong side of history,' said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The court's decision Tuesday came in response to a request from the Alabama Policy Institute and the Baptist-run Alabama Citizens Action Program to halt same-sex unions after Granade's ruling. Gay marriage has been legalized in at least 36 US states, as well as the District of Columbia.","Court has told probate judges to stop issuing same-sex marriage licenses .

"There are many things believed to make a woman more attractive in a man’s eyes – but a curved spine isn’t usually thought to be one of them. However, researchers claim men are particularly attracted to a women with a back that curves exactly 45 degrees above the top of her bottom. The findings provide a new explanation as to why voluptuous celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez are considered to be so attractive, with extra mass around the buttocks enhancing the curvature of the spine. Such an angle would have given a woman an advantage while pregnant in early hunter-gatherer societies and so has evolved as being seen as attractive around the world, they claim. Perfect angle: Jennier Lopez has an attractive curve as scientists discover that extra mass around the buttocks can often enhance the curvature of a woman's spine . J-Lo, pictured above, may have the ideal spine curvature that evolved to be attractive in early hunter-gatherer societies because it gave women an advantage to forage for food while bearing children . Kim Kardashian, shown above, has become famous for her curvy figure and buttocks, but her appeal to men may be tapping into something rooted in our evolutionary past when they gave an evolutionary advantage . The scientists found that extra mass around the buttocks could often enhance the curvature of a woman's spine. However, the researchers also found that a physical curvature of the spine - known as vertebral wedging - was seen as more attractive than extra buttock mass. Curvy hips and buttocks may provide vital 'fat banks' that help to fuel the development of newborn babies' brains, claim scientists. Researchers say the fat stored around the buttocks provides extra energy for babies when they are breast feeding. The scientists at Pittsburgh University say the fat there is rich in DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), which is a particularly important component in the human brain. Over the past five million years, the average human brain has trebled in volume from 400ml to 1,200ml. It could therefore follow that women have had to become fatter to keep up with the growing demands of babies’ brains. The researchers argue that mothers who breast-feed typically lose one pound of fat (half a kilo) a month. Dr David Lewis, a psychologist at Bilkent University in Turkey, said: 'It's an independent and previously undiscovered standard of attractiveness. '(The curve) would have enabled ancestral women to shift their centre of mass back over their hips during pregnancy, a time during which there is a dramatic forward shift of their centre of mass. 'This benefit is critical: without being able to do this, women would experience a dramatic increase in hip torque (pressure) subjecting them to risk of muscular fatigue and injury. 'Consequently, ancestral women who possessed this degree of lumbar curvature would have been able to forage longer into pregnancy and would have been able to carry out multiple pregnancies with a reduced risk of spinal injury.' Dr Lewis said that this trait would have become sexually attractive to men due to the evolutionary advantage it gave. Without such a curve, the pressure on a woman's hips during pregnancy increases by nearly 800 per cent, rendering her largely immobile and increasing the risk of health problems. An example of the silhouettes shown to men during the study with different curvature of the spine. A curved angle of around 45 degrees was rated the most attractive and is also an optimum angle during pregnancy . Dr Lewis said: 'One can think of vertebrae that aren't wedged like (ice) hockey pucks - they are the same height in the front and the back,' he said. 'A dorsally wedged vertebra, on the other hand, is taller in the front of the body than it is in the back. 'When you stack hockey pucks on top of and underneath a vertebra that is taller in the front than it is in the back, you end up with a curved stack.' A 45-degree angle was optimal because it would have aided movement, yet would not have been so great so as to expose women to the back pain and risk of slipped discs that can come with excessive spinal curvature. These silhouettes all exhibit identical buttock protrusion but it is due to different reasons such as excess muscle (a), fat (b) and vertebral wedging( c). The participants found the vertebral wedging was most attractive . For the study, which was published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, the psychologists showed 300 men silhouettes of women with different angles of curvature. They were then asked to rate the images according to how attractive they found the silhouette. Most of the men were significantly more attracted to those with a spine curve of 45.5 degrees, the researchers found. Analysis of the results also found that the preference for this level of spine curve was 'unequivocally not a by-product of a preference for buttock mass', they added. Men who think they like big bottoms may actually be more into spines, Dr Lewis said. He said: 'Men may be directing their attention to the butt and obtaining information about women's spines, even if they are unaware that that is what their minds are doing. 'Alternatively, men may have preferences for both lumbar curvature and buttock size. 'Future research is needed to better understand the latter.'","Curved spines would have allowed women to forage longer into pregnancy .

"It isn't just the clothes designers who create the new trends at fashion week. Behind the scenes, the most talented hair and make-up artists in the world work like a well-oiled machine to set the next season's beauty trends - and if they have anything to do with it, we'll be wearing face tattoos, panda-esque eyeshadow and monobrows come autumn. Behind the scenes in New York, London, Milan and Paris, the hotbed of talent have been busy conjuring up AW15's beauty looks and it's time to get your glitter at the ready and throw out your tweezers. Models in Paris at the Atsuro Tayama show rocked monobrows, so will Cara Delevingne - and the rest of the world - be growing theirs out for next season? Cara Delevingne set the trend for bushy brows and it seems the look is bigger than ever (quite literally). Models in Paris at the Atsuro Tayama show rocked monobrows, which were created using brown eyeshadow blended through their brows and eyelids. The trend for overdoing the eyeshadow was also present in Milan at Antonio Marras' show where Tom Pecheux shunned the go-to wide winged shape for eyes. Instead of creating a subtle sheen on the lids, he buffed layers and layers of rusty red shadow into a circle shape around the upper and lower eye, making models look panda-like.

In Milan at Antonio Marras' show, Tom Pecheux buffed layers and layers of rusty red shadow into a circle around the upper and lower eyelids . At MSGM, lids were glossy and make-up artist Lisa Butler shunned shadow for eye gloss to give models a fresher look. Elsewhere, legendary beauty guru Val Garland used tattoos as an extension of her make-up at the Giamba show. Inspired by Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss, who both have fun little tattoos, Val and her team painted intricate designs, such as hearts, moons and stars, onto the girls' faces, hands and fingers. Young French designer Jacquemus also got creative and sketched a Picasso face onto the side of his models' faces. Val Garland used tattoos as an extension of her make-up at Giamba's show in Milan .

As for hair, Atsuro Tayama was setting trends with his kinked quiffs, which were created by Wella's Eugene Souleiman. Gel was used to slick down sides, then Eugene  coiled models' hair into a tight spiralled twist, which he removed just before they hit the runway leaving them full of texture.

"A fraud gang duped investors into buying diamonds for twenty times their value before using the £1.5m profit to fund lavish shopping sprees in Selfridges, Louis Vuitton and Harrods, a court has heard. Victims were allegedly lured into the 'boiler room' scam by 'persistent and persuasive' salesmen who told them the limited coloured stones would pay handsome returns because they were from mines which were closed or closing. But those involved had allegedly valued the yellow diamonds at more than 2000 per cent their worth, Southwark Crown Court heard. Rommell Brown, 31, (left) and Anna Foord, 20, (right) are among the two defendants accused of orchestrating a 'boiler room' scam by allegedly persuading investors to buy coloured diamonds at twenty times their value . The bank accounts for the two companies through which the sales were made were also haemorrhaging cash on luxury goods, the court heard. More than £2,000 was splurged in Hugo Boss, while £2,100 was spent in Louis Vuitton. It also showed that £7,685 was spent in Selfridges and £1,240 in exclusive department store Harrods. Nearly £3,000 was blown in a New York department store in a single day, the court heard. Rommell Brown, 31, Billy Cosma, 23, Anna Foord, 30, Anton Howell, 28, and Farouq Eshpari, 55, all from London or the south east, are standing trial but deny conspiracy to defraud. Farouq’s sons Omar Eshpari, 34, and Hider Esphari, 28, have admitted conspiracy to defraud while wife Safia Eshpari, 52, admitted concealing, disguising and removing criminal property. Prosecutor Esther Schutzer-Weissman said investors racked up £1.5m losses after paying for precious gems through Evolution Commodities Limited and Stonehouse Global Markets Limited. She told the jury: ‘It was a stone to be used as an asset for investment. The caller was persuasive, the caller was persistent and always suggesting to the investor that purchasing coloured diamonds was an investment that would get good and reliable returns. ‘They were told often that diamonds would be scarcer and rarer and therefore more valuable because a mine, or mines, were closing or had closed. Billy Cosma, 23 (left) is also accused of conspiracy to defraud. Hider Esphari, 28 (right) admitted the charge at Southwark Crown Court . ‘They were told this was a limited time opportunity and they were told that the investment was guaranteed to provide a good return, depending of course on how long the diamond was kept before selling on. ‘Calls would be followed by letters that provided more concrete information about the investment prospect of the stones.’ She told the court how a certificate was sent for each purchased diamond, giving details of clarity and cut.  But, crucially, the certificate did not include the value, the court heard. Many clients also took up the offer of free storage from the company, said Ms Schutzer-Weissman. The bank accounts for the companies showed more than £1,240 was spent in exclusive London department store Harrods (pictured) The court was told how one investor allegedly duped the by scam was telephoned by Hider Eshpari. Using an alias, he told him it was an ‘exciting market for coloured diamonds’ and offered to send him a brochure. A short time later, he received more phone calls from Evolution telling him there was fantastic potential for investment and that a mine was closing in Australia, it is alleged. The client visited the company offices in August 2011 and agreed to buy a round brilliant orange brown diamond weighing 0.28 carats. He paid £5,550 for the stone after finding out it was one of the last they had in stock, jurors heard. Later that month he visited again and purchased an orange yellow diamond weighing 0.31 carats for £14,450. Hider Eshpari told him its worth would rocket at Chinese New Year when demand for the diamonds increased. More than £2,000 was splurged in Hugo Boss, while £7,685 was spent in Selfridges (pictured) But the first gem was worth only £270 and the second just £440. Ms Schutzer-Weissman said: ‘Those figures are not disputed - when I said there was a big mark up, those are the types of mark up we are thinking about. ‘It is agreed the diamonds sold by Evolution are worth far less than they were sold for.’ She added: ‘You may think that the business was being run as a cash cow for these defendants. ‘These defendants were aware that the benefits they receives were not as a result of business acumen but as a result of intentional and persistent fraud.' Brown, 39, from Edmonton, north London and Howell, 26, from Chigwell, Essex, both deny two charges of conspiracy to defraud. Cosma, from Buckhurst Hill, Essex denies a single charge of conspiracy to defraud. Foord, from Elstree, Hertfordshire, denies two charges of conspiracy to defraud and a further charge of money laundering. Farouq Eshpari, from  Enfield, Middlesex, also denies a charge of money laundering. Omar and Hider Eshpari, of the same address, have admitted two counts of conspiracy to defraud while Safia, also at the address, admitted money laundering. The trial, which is expected to run for six weeks, continues.

The images emerged as U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said that an American military official who briefed news media about Iraq's upcoming offensive to retake Mosul provided inaccurate information but should never have publicly discussed war plans. Carter's criticism of the February news briefing by an official from the U.S. military's Central Command was accompanied by an assurance from the top U.S. military officer to Congress that the matter was subject to an internal inquiry. 'That clearly was neither accurate information, nor had it been accurate, would have it been information that should have been blurted out to the press. So it's wrong on both scores,' Carter, who took over as defense secretary in February, told a hearing by the Senate Armed Services Committee. Two influential Republican senators on the committee, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, sent a letter to the White House on Feb. 20, complaining about the briefing, which predicted a Mosul offensive likely to start in April or May, involving 20,000 to 25,000 Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Mosul, which had a population of more than 1 million people, was captured by Islamic State fighters in June and is the largest city in the group's self-declared caliphate, a stretch of territory that straddles the border between northern Iraq and eastern Syria.","Photographs were taken in the terror group's northern Iraqi stronghold .

"Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama will make a rare appearance together on Saturday in Selma, Alabama, as they commemorate the the 50th anniversary of historic civil rights protests that sounded the death knell for voter discrimination. The former and current U.S. leaders and their families will join the largest-ever congressional delegation in the Alabama town a day before an annual march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge that salutes the 600 demonstrators who were violently assaulted by Alabama state troopers on March 7, 1965 on what is now known as Bloody Sunday. The clash resulted in the speedy introduction of the Voter's Rights Act, which was signed into law in August of that year by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson. President Barack Obama, right, and former President George W. Bush are pictured here arriving at a 2013 wreath-laying ceremony for the victims of the 1998 US Embassy bombing at the Bombing Memorial in Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania. They will make a rare appearance together on Saturday in Selma, Alabama, as they commemorate the the 50th anniversary of historic civil rights protests that sounded the death knell for voter discrimination . The march itself will take place on Sunday, March 8, but thousands are expected to flock to Selma on Saturday to listen to President Obama give remarks at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The event is open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis. The yearly sojourn to Selma, held since 1998 and organized by the Faith and Politics Institute, will be made by 95 members of Congress. That includes 23 Republicans, the largest group of lawmakers from the political party to attend since the first pilgrimage, according to USA Today. Alabama Reps. Terri Sewell, a Democrat, and Martha Roby, a Republican, will lead the delegation, along with Georgia Rep. John Lewis, a participant in the original 1965 march. 'We are very pleased that the Faith and Politics Institute is gathering an unprecedented amount of senators and members of Congress in bipartisan fashion to honor and reflect upon the history of the civil rights movement and the work that still needs to be done,' Rob Liberatore, the Faith and Politics Institute's chairman of the board, told the news publication. All living U.S. presidents were invited to participate in the event but just Bush and his wife Laura and Obama and his wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia will be in Selma on Saturday, USA Today reports. 'President and Mrs. Bush believe it’s important to honor such a seminal date in the history of human dignity and human rights,' Freddy Ford, a spokesman for Bush, told the New York Times.

Bush and Obama also spoke at a Texas event in 2014 celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act but they were not on the dais at the same time, as they will be this weekend. Bush and Obama will be joined on Saturday by their wives, Laura Bush and Michelle Obama, pictured here at the White House in 2013 with their husbands, and the largest-ever congressional delegation . At a White House event last week Obama said he would bring his daughters with him to Selma because he wants to 'remind them of their own obligations.' 'There are going to be marches for them to march and struggles for them to fight,' he said. 'And if we’ve done our job, then that next generation is going to be picking up the torch as well.' The Senate and the House recently approved legislation that would award the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor aside from the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to 1965 marchers. It now awaits the president's signature. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a lead sponsor of the bill in the Senate said Friday after the bill's passage in the upper chamber that the 'award is a small token of our collective national gratitude to the courageous men and women who sacrificed so much to move our country forward.' 'As we confront the myriad of challenges our country continues to face, we do so with the knowledge that we drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not ourselves dig,' he said in a statement.","Obama will speak a day before an annual march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge saluting the 600 demonstrators  violently assaulted in 1965 .

"An Illinois man has been found guilty of beating to death his girlfriend’s 3-year-old son after the toddler uttered a swear word while playing video game Mortal Kombat. A judge Tuesday convicted Thomas Albea, of Waukegan, of first-degree murder in the 2011 killing of X’Zavion Charleston. During Albea's two-day bench trial, the prosecution presented in court the defendant’s videotaped confession, in which the 22-year-old admitted to striking the little boy 'four of five times,’ although a coroner has concluded that the child likely suffered no fewer than seven blows. Justice for X'Zavion: Thomas Albea (left), 22, of Illinois, has been convicted of first-degree murder in the 2011 beating death of 3-year-old X’Zavion Charleston (right) Cruel punishment: Prosecutors said Albea repeatedly struck the toddler in the abdomen after X'Zavion uttered a swear word while playing the video game Mortal Kombat . The incident took place at around 11pm on September 14, 2011, while Albea, then 18 years old, was looking after his girlfriend’s son in the 1700 block of McAree Road. Prosecutors said little X'Zavion was playing the violent fighting game Mortal Kombat while waiting for his dinner when he used an unspecified expletive, followed by the words, 'he got me,' reported Chicago Tribune. Albea responded to the child's outburst by striking him in the abdomen. The teen suspect initially told police that he hit X'Zavion only once, but he later admitted that he struck the toddler multiple times. The boy was rushed to Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago, where he died the next day from what the Cook County Medical Examiner described in the autopsy report as 'catastrophic' injuries to his internal organs and abdomen. Albea's then-girlfriend, Qa’Chelle Charleston, was upstairs at the time of her son's killing. Cover-up: Albea initially told his then-girlfriend, Qa’Chelle Charleston (left), that her son had fallen. A medical examiner later determined that X'Zavion (right) suffered 'catastrophic' injuries to his internal organs . When she came down to feed her son and noticed that something was wrong with him, Albea lied to her that X'Zavion had fallen. Albea's attorney, Gillian Gosch, argued during the trial that her client did not intend to kill or seriously hurt X'Zavion. But Judge Mark Levitt rejected Gosch's argument and subsequent plea for a not guilty verdict, stating that the extent of the 3-year-old's injuries shows that the brutal attack was more than an act of recklessness, or an attempt to discipline the boy for his transgression. Albea could face 20 to 60 years in prison when he is sentenced April 22.","Thomas Albea, 22, convicted of first-degree murder in 2011 beating death of 3-year-old X’Zavion Charleston .

"Three retired carers are accused of running a child sex ring for 30 years at a school for vulnerable children where 'abuse was almost the norm', a court has heard. Colwyn Baker, David Hennessy and Nigel Putman are said to have preyed on youngsters at the now defunct Swaylands School in Penshurst, Kent, between 1963 and 1993. As well as the abuse allegedly committed by the trio, jurors were also told Baker allegedly encouraged the boys to commit sex acts on other children. David Hennessey (pictured left) and Nigel Putman (right) are accused alongside Colwyn Baker of sexually abusing youngsters at the now-defunct Swaylands School in Penshurst, Kent, between 1963 and 1993 . The three men face a total of 49 charges against 24 victims, who were aged between 10 to 15 at the time. Baker, 71, of Morningside, Edinburgh, faces 24 counts of indecent assault and three charges of rape. Hennessy, 74, of  King's Lynn, Norfolk, has been charged with 17 counts of indecent assault, one of gross indecency with a child and one of rape. Putman, 62, of  Slough, Berkshire, faces three charges of indecent assault. They deny all of the charges against them. The men were residential child care officers at Swaylands School, which catered for boys with emotional and behavioural difficulties and which closed in 1993. They are accused of making nightly rounds and encouraging the pupils to abuse each other in a number of cruel and sometimes painful sexual 'games' - keeping them quiet with blackmail and presents. The men were residential child care officers at Swaylands School (pictured) which catered for boys with emotional and behavioural difficulties. The school closed in 1993 and has since been converted in to flats . The court heard detailed descriptions of multiple counts of alleged sexual abuse, including a sex 'game' called 'toothpaste testicles'. Opening the 12-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court today, prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC told the jury: 'The atmosphere at the school at the time that you are considering was one where abuse was almost the norm. 'Children who were abused were positively encouraged to abuse other pupils. 'Abuse and the age of pupils abused led some pupils to consider that there was nothing wrong with abusing other pupils.' One of Baker's alleged victims became so scared that he often stayed awake at night, sleeping in stairwells to avoid Baker, Mr Bennetts said. As a result, the boy would often fall asleep in class, causing a dramatic decline in his learning. He would end up being caned by the headmaster as punishment for dozing off. The court heard another boy said Baker would wake him in the middle of the night and abuse him almost nightly for three years. Another told investigators that Baker was in charge of the Scouts, karate and swimming, adding: 'Anything good that you wanted to do as a boy, Baker was in charge of it.' Baker allegedly told the boy that he had a small penis because he did not 'exercise it' enough with other boys. Mr Bennett said the boy resisted for a long time but Baker made sure no one spoke to him, until he eventually 'caved in' and allowed others to 'do it'. Hennessy allegedly abused one boy on his first or second night at Swaylands, and told his victim: 'It's not worth crying, it won't help you,' jurors heard. The 12-week trial into historic child sex abuse at the school is being held at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) The boy told police that Hennessy abused him from the age of 10 until he was 13 or 14, when he stopped as new boys came in and he was 'getting too old'. Victims said they were targeted when they were at their 'weakest', while going to sleep, jurors heard. Mr Bennetts said one boy revealed that Baker's most effective 'blackmail' tool was not allowing him to go home at the weekend. Mr Bennetts said one boy was abused for three years on a nightly basis by Hennessy while he was at the junior school. When the boy moved to the senior school, his care worker was Baker who allegedly continued sexually abused him until he was 16. Putman was said to have tried to molest one boy while he was in the shower. When the boy told Putman to back off, he put his arms round the boy 'like a lover', Mr Bennetts said. Mr Bennetts told the court that one victim, aged around seven or eight, remembers Hennessy buying him presents to keep quiet, including an orange Donald Duck hat and ski goggles. One victim said after Baker sexually abused him for the first time he felt 'confused and upset'. Mr Bennetts said: 'The victim quickly realised he would only be allowed to watch TV and do nice things that boys wanted to do, in return for sexual acts. Mr Bennetts told the jury that Baker was convicted in 1994 of four counts of indecent assault on a boy aged under 16 and one count of gross indecency. He also disclosed that Hennessy was convicted in December 1993 of four counts of indecent assault on a boy and two sex offences against a pupil. The trial was adjourned by Judge Philip Statman to 10.30am tomorrow morning.

"A creepy video shows how a black spider, believed to be a Huntsman, refusing to let the force of the powerful flush button get the better of the courageous critter. The extraordinary fight in the creature would be admirable if it was not so scary as it doesn't matter how many times it gets dumped into the toilet bowl the spider won't give up.

Just when you think you can let your guard down - the spider fights extremely hard for its life by desperately trying to cling onto the side of the porcelain with its legs as it lands in the water numerous times. When the flushing stops the spider curls into a ball and leads you to believe that it has surrendered to the violent loo but then suddenly bounces back to life and climbs back up the bowl. The critter kept going into a ball which misled you to believe that all was lost but then miraculously stretch its long legs all the way to the top of the bowel . But the remaining running water knocks it back down again and the spider goes back into a ball for long enough to think that it has to be all over for creepy critter by now. After being washed back down a few more times it manages to miraculously stretch its gangly legs and stride up the bowl yet again. When the spider realises that it's free of the dreaded giant flush - the exhausted creature takes a few seconds to catch it's breath before going back up under the bowl - the opposite side to where it appeared at the beginning of the traumatic experience.

"Mexican police and soldiers apprehended Wednesday the notorious Zetas drug cartel leader Omar Trevino Morales, alias 'Z-42,' a federal official said. The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name due to government policy, said Trevino Morales, 41, was arrested in a pre-dawn raid in San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy suburb of the northern city of Monterrey. The Mexican government had offered a $2million reward for his capture on weapons and organized crime charges. Scroll down for video .

The US Drug Enforcement Administration, which had Morales on its 'Most Wanted' list, had offered a $5million reward for his capture on cocaine-trafficking charges. Trevino may also face charges for several abductions and murders. Trevino's give name is Alejandro, but he has had multiple aliases and nicknames, including 'Omar,' '42' and 'Commandante 42.' The arrest of Morales comes just days after the capture of Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug gang, who was the the most wanted capo still at large in Mexico.

Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano 'El Lazca.' ‘Omar Trevino was the heir to all the Zetas who were going down,’ said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The Zetas carved a path of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during their turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel, claiming upwards of 100,000 lives since 2007.

Once the flashpoint for the worst of the violence, security in northern Mexico has improved considerably, except for the lawless northeastern border state of Tamaulipas, said Raul Benitez. Founded in the late 1990s by deserters from an elite Mexican army unit, the Zetas initially acted as enforcers for the powerful Gulf cartel, based along the border with Texas and one of the oldest criminal syndicates in Mexico. But the group struck out on its own in early 2010, setting off the most violent phase in Mexico's drug war.

"Less than an hour's drive from one of Earth's great fresh water sources, some people in Flint are searching for a drop worth drinking. Since the financially struggling city broke away from the Detroit water system last year, residents have been unhappy with the smell, taste and appearance of water from the city's river as they await the completion of a pipe to Lake Huron. They also have raised health concerns, reporting rashes, hair loss and other problems. A General Motors plant stopped using the water, saying it was rusting its parts. Officials say recent state tests show the water meets federal safety guidelines, and the city will be better off free of the leviathan Detroit system once the pipeline is complete by 2016. And while many Detroit suburbs have long dreamed of breaking their dependence on the city's water, further-away Flint is the first to risk it — and test whether the potential savings are worth going it alone. Scroll down for video . Fresh and clean? In this January 21, 2015 image, LeeAnne Walters shows water samples from her Flint home that were collected that month . Giveway: In this Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2015 photo, Genetha Campbell carries free water being distributed at the Lincoln Park United Methodist Church in Flint . 'Unfortunately, some of our problems aren't quickly or easily solved,' said Jerry Ambrose, Flint's state-appointed emergency manager, adding that the 'challenges' resulting from the temporary reliance on the river 'were greater than we expected.' 'The potential to leave (Detroit) was well-supported by a business case, and in the long-term will benefit this region as well as the city of Flint,' Ambrose said. While there won't be 'magical reductions' in rates, he said, cost increases should be much less. Flint had long chafed at the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department's rising prices. Flint officials estimated the cost of buying water from Detroit this year at $16 million, and the overall annual cost of switching to the new Karegnondi Water Authority would be $12.5 million. Still, the long-discussed divorce has brought real and figurative headaches. Tests released last week show the water is safe, but complaints from residents persist. They say the water looks brown or rusty, and tastes and smells of chlorine. People have protested at council meetings, held community hearings, hosted water giveaways and marched through downtown. Facebook pages have been forums for complaints and concerns. Last month, the county started distributing bottled water to about 1,300 preschool students and a children's museum recently blocked access to water fountains, citing Safe Drinking Water Act violations because of high levels of a disinfectant byproduct. High bacteria levels forced boil-water advisories last year. Resident Tony Palladeno Jr., 53, said he gets bottled water from a grocery store or spring water from his cabin further north, but uses city water for showers. 'No matter what, if I go in, one time it's going to be my eyes, or I'll get headaches or my lungs,' he said, adding that he's lost hair and produces a bottle of it to illustrate. 'People say, ""Oh, it's paranoia."" No. ... I'm living this.'

(February 3 file photo) Protest:  Flint resident Jessica Owens carries a sign in the shape of a wide-eyed skull on February 4 to signify Flint's water and its health issues during a protest of the city's water quality . Palladeno, who considers his city 'a guinea pig,' and others are angered by the decision to let the GM Engine Plant stop using Flint water and link with a township that gets water from Detroit. The move could cost the city about $400,000 per year in lost revenue. Rick Holtstander boiled his tap water at first, but says he rubbed his finger around the inside of the pan and picked up 'something that looked just like cigarette ash.' 'I don't even let my dogs drink this water,' he said as he collected four gallons at a recent water giveaway. Activists have urged Flint to return to Detroit's system, which has offered to reconnect the city at last year's rates. Other Detroit water customers are watching how the situation unfolds. Between Flint and Detroit sits Oakland County, where County Executive L. Brooks Patterson has often spoken about mismanagement in Detroit's system. He has in the past has explored building a separate water and sewer structure, and has celebrated efforts to create a regional Great Lakes Water Authority to take over operations of Detroit's water system. Before a judge mediating the negotiations imposed a gag order, Patterson expressed concerns about raising enough revenue. Patterson also has said he didn't see a sound business case for Flint's solo plans, and cited an analysis that losing Flint-area customers would leave those remaining in Detroit's system with higher bills. Flint's troubles underscore the challenges any major water customer with similar designs could encounter, said Nick Schroeck, executive director of the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center at Wayne State University. The main obstacle is the cost, he said, and water and sewer projects aren't attractive to investors. 'Maybe, economically and long-term, this will make sense for Flint and Genesee County, but that remains to be seen,' he said. 'As a region, I think we're better when we're working together and sharing resources. ... We're tied together for better or worse through our natural resources.'

"Women struggling to lose weight after childbirth should be given special government help, a Tory minister has said. Claire Perry said many women found it a real struggle to shift the pounds while raising small children and needed incentives to ‘motivate’ them. But she rejected calls for sanctions on people who are overweight. Her remarks come just weeks after the Prime Minister called for people who are too fat to work to be stripped of their benefits if they refuse to go on weight-loss regimes. Scroll down for video . Tory minister Claire Perry said many women found it a real struggle to shift the pounds while raising small children . However, Mrs Perry said she ‘preferred to see incentives’ rather than taking people’s benefits away. She said: ‘If it was all about willpower I would weigh eight stone. We live in a world where dietary advice is incredibly confusing, every week we read it’s carbs, it’s not carbs, it’s fat, it’s starvation – whatever it is. ‘People are busy, running around looking after their children. Everybody would like to be slimmer and healthier. What our welfare system could do is encourage people to make those choices.’ Mrs Perry added: ‘I’d prefer to see real incentives for people to get healthy, get more active. We know that increased exercise is associated with increased mental health. ‘I think for many women who are struggling having to lose weight after children it is a real problem and anything we can do to motivate people and give incentives to do. I prefer to focus on carrots for healthy choice rather than sticks.’ The transport minister’s intervention comes after Mr Cameron said people who cannot work because they are too fat – or addicted to drugs or alcohol – should have their benefits cut if they refuse to get treatment. Mrs Perry, appearing on the Daily Politics show today, said she ‘preferred to see incentives’ to encourage people to lose weight rather than taking people’s benefits away . Almost 2,000 people are registered as long-term sick because of obesity. Ministers are considering forcing them to go on a diet or lose their benefits . The proposed overhaul of the benefits system could save Britain £500million a year in sickness payments. The Prime Minister has asked a government health adviser to ‘rapidly’ review the Conservatives’ plans. Speaking last month, he said: ‘Too many people are stuck on sickness benefits because of issues that could be addressed but instead are not.’ Under one plan being looked at, almost 2,000 people registered as long-term sick because of obesity would face having their benefits docked unless they agreed to lose weight. Around 56,000 people on the register say their primary condition is alcoholism. Almost 34,000 cite drug dependency. On average these 90,000 people get about £100 a week in sickness benefits and are entitled to other payments, such as housing and council tax benefits. They are already offered treatment, such as courses and medication, to kick their habit and get back to work. But there is no legal requirement to accept the help. Mr Cameron’s plan has been attacked by senior Tories. Sarah Wollaston, the chair of the influential Commons Health Committee, said she was 'infuriated' by the 'illegal and unworkable' proposal, announced last month.","Claire Perry said many women found it a real struggle to shift the pounds .

"Children aged 11 were given a homework sheet on terrorism which asked them to describe 'Palestinian terrorist activities' and posed questions about al-Qaeda and Hamas. The document was given to pupils at New Stevenston Primary, Motherwell, North Lanarkshire and also included a cartoon image of an explosion. Parents spoke of their shock after images of the question sheet were circulated online after it was discovered. Pupils in Larnarkshire, aged seven, were given this homework sheet which asks them about terrorism, poses questions about the IRA and Hamas and included a cartoon bomb. The council said it is obsolete . The council claimed the homework sheet is obsolete and was given to pupils by accident. It is understood the authority realised it had been distributed in error before children completed any answers on the form. Youngsters who received the homework sheet were asked: 'Palestinians feel that they have the RIGHT to use terrorism against the Israelis. 'Give TWO reasons why they feel this. Use the information to help you. 'Describe two examples of Palestinian terrorist activities.' Beneath the text was a cartoon-like drawing of an explosion. It asks: 'Which of the following are TWO of the main terrorist groups in Northern Ireland? Al-Qaeda, IRA, HAMAS, UDA.' It then asks pupils: 'Match the name of LOYALIST or REPUBLICAN to the correct description of the group's aim. 'This group want N.Ireland to remain a part of the UK. Children receiving the homework sheet were asked to talk about terrorist groups in Northern Ireland . 'This group wants N. Ireland to be united with the rest of Ireland.' The UDA entered a ceasefire - officially ending its armed campaign in Northern Ireland - in November 2007. The IRA - a name given to numerous separate republican groups - similarly has been on ceasefire since 1997.

Images of the homework - titled 'Terrorism and Terror - Case Study: Separatists' have appeared online. New Stevenston Primary School in Motherwell gave out the homework sheet to its young pupils at the school . The person who posted the image on social media - known as Sher-Locked3 - wrote: 'These are actual homework questions given to children in New Stevenston Primary School as part of their curriculum. 'It's definitely not good, it's factually incorrect and divisive. Anyone with an ounce of intellect knows that.' Sher-Locked3 added: 'I did not take the picture nor do I have a child at the school. Which of the following are TWO of the main terrorist groups in Northern Ireland? Al-Qaeda, IRA, HAMAS, UDA . Match the name of LOYALIST or REPUBLICAN to the correct description of the group's aim. 'This group want N.Ireland to remain a part of the UK. 'This group wants N. Ireland to be united with the rest of Ireland.' 'Palestinians feel that they have the RIGHT to use terrorism against the Israelis. Give TWO reasons why they feel this. Use the information to help you. Describe two examples of Palestinian terrorist activities. 'This was taken by a person who had a seven year old sibling to whom these questions were given. I verified the picture before posting.' Ahmed Kadry said it was a 'shocking homework question' and North West Friends of Peace also branded the sheet and nature of the questions 'shocking.' A spokesman for North Lanarkshire Council's Learning and Leisure Services said: 'The homework material used was taken from a teaching pack which is now obsolete. We are contacting all schools to ensure this particular material is no longer used. 'The topic is explored by pupils as part of the social studies programme ""People, past events and societies"" and this includes conflict situations around the world. 'This topic aims to gives pupils a greater understanding of the nature of different conflicts and their regional, global and historical significance and does not pass any judgement on the subject.'","Children, 11, given a homework sheet asking about Palestinian terrorism .

"A new winter storm - the second in a week - promises to dump up to five inches of snow on New York tonight (Wednesday) and tomorrow. And Washington, DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia will get hit even harder - with up to 10 inches. The snow will begin tonight in New York City and continue through tomorrow afternoon - marking the 13th day this winter that the city has seen at least an inch of snow, Accuweather.com meteorologist Alyson Hoegg told Daily Mail Online. There is light at the end of this snowy tunnel, however. Forecasters predict this will likely be the last snow storm of the season - or at least the last until mid-March. Boston is a little more than 2 inches shy of its all-time snowfall record, and meteorologists are predicting 1 to 2 inches to fall. Not again! The newest winter storm will dump up to 10 inches of snow in some parts of West Virginia and Kentucky - though New York will see between two and five inches . Homeowner Steve Showalter, of Benscreek, Pa., in Somerset County, uses an ice pick to clear ice jams along his driveway as the Benscreek River flows over it, Wednesday . On Wednesday, schools from Texas to West Virginia were closing early and Penn State canceled classes due to weather for the first time in eight years. About 1,200 flights were canceled, including 600 in and out of Dallas-Fort Worth. Residents of Kentucky and West Virginia dealt with flooded roadways and mudslides. In Arkansas, high school basketball playoff games were postponed until Thursday. Mike Halpert, deputy director of the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center, said the storm 'might be winter's last hurrah.' After the storm and maybe a couple of cold days into the weekend, the next couple weeks are forecast to be considerably warmer than normal for a large chunk of the country, Halpert said. But Halpert's office, which does longer term forecasts, does predict colder than normal for snow-struck New England and only normal temperatures — which would be warmer than recent weeks — for the rest of the Northeast. Likewise, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski says the storm could be winter's 'caboose.' Some Bostonians are clamoring for a little more snow so they can break a record. 88 million and counting: The winter storm stretches from New Mexico through the Midwest, up to New England . The weather will clear on Friday - though the northeast will continue to experience below-average cold . Clearing Saturday: As the storm passes, the weekend will be clear and warmer for much of the country . So far this winter, the city has received 105.5 inches of snow — more than 8 1/2 feet, the National Weather Service says. The record is 107.6 inches recorded during the 1995-96 season. Records date to 1872. Having endured weeks of misery, residents like Erin O'Brien insist they deserve bragging rights. Otherwise what was the point of repeatedly digging out? 'I want the record. We earned the record,' said O'Brien, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. Others don't care about the record. Amy Ouellette, a marketing associate in Salem, north of Boston, just wants spring and sun to come and melt it all away. Officials are blaming heavy, wet snow for a partial barn roof collapse that killed at least five cows Wednesday morning in central New York. The collapse at the Whey Street Dairy in Cuyler, 25 miles southeast of Syracuse, was one of hundreds of roof collapses blamed on heavy snow in the Northeast this winter. Massachusetts officials say they've received reports of nearly 200 roof collapses since Feb. 9. No one was injured Wednesday morning when a 100-foot by 100-foot section of the roof of Boston's vacant Bayside Expo Center collapsed. The building was previously slated for demolition. No injuries were reported in a four tractor-trailer crash that closed an icy road in rural western New York. The Daily News of Batavia reports the trucks either collided or went off the road in drizzle and snow around 5 a.m. on Route 63 in the Genesee County town of Bethany, 32 miles southwest of Rochester. Bad weather Tuesday night turned an Ohio State men's basketball team trip to Penn State from an easy one-hour plane ride into an 8½-hour ordeal. Icy runways in State College, Pennsylvania, forced the team's plane to land in Latrobe, about 110 miles away. After landing, the team's student managers tweeted: 'weather conditions have the team stranded in the Pennsylvania wilderness. managers have been sent to find and salvage anything edible.' The managers joked they ordered pizzas — 25 large and scalding hot — to avoid being eaten by hungry players. The team took a bus the rest of the way to Penn State, traveling at times through dense fog and rain, for the Wednesday night game.

"Outraged Australian unionists have slammed an American economist who claimed that workers should be easier to fire and need to take a pay cut in order to save the nation's economy. Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors, argued that Australia's domestic labour market needs to change if the country's economy is going to prosper in the wake of the recent mining boom. Dr. Baur claimed that it is too hard to conduct business in Australia as the dollar is still too high and the labour market is too restrictive. Bob Baur, chief economist at Principal Global Investors, argued that Australia's labour market needs reform . 'The best thing for Australia would be ... maybe loosening up the labour market and making it easier for businesses to take on workers or let workers go in difficult times,' he said. 'You've got tonnes of wonderful natural resources here but don't export the resources - export them as a car, or a computer or a television set, or furniture,' he told Yahoo. 'You need to put some labour into it and make something of it here, rather than let somebody make something of it across the world.'

"David Walliams has reportedly 'split' from his model wife Lara Stone. According to The Sun newspaper, the 43-year-old comedian and his 31-year-old model spouse - the mother of his son Alfred, two, have agreed on a trial separation. The publication reports that Lara left their London home on Tuesday night, leaving David 'devastated' - adding that he is determined to win her back. A representative for David Walliams declined to comment and MailOnline has also contacted a spokesperson for Lara Stone. Lara, who is 12 years David's junior, took Alfred and the couple's dog Bert with her when she left their North London home. Scroll down for video . Split? The Sun newspaper reports that David Walliams and his wife Lara Stone (pictured in what is believed to be their second last public appearance together at Elton John's December 2014 wedding) have split after less than five years of marriage . Is this the end? David's wife reportedly left their North London home on Tuesday night leaving him 'devastated' A source close to the comedian said: 'David has been putting on a brave face. But people close to him are very worried because they know he's devastated. In fact, David tweeted that it was business as usual for him on Wednesday. He wrote: 'The #WalliamsWhirlwind helicopter tour of schools for @WorldBookDayUK tomorrow will go ahead as planned so not to disappoint my young fans.' Lara and David have a reported wealth of almost £19million - David has a  net worth of £16.3million and Lara £2.6million. News of their split has come as a huge surprise to friends despite the fact they have barely been seen together over the past six months. David and Lara attended Elton John's wedding to David Furnish together on December  21 and two days later watched the London production of Edwards Scissorhands together, which was the last time they were seen out in public together. The insider told the newspaper that his friends are shocked by the split as they thought the marriage was strong - but friends are hoping they will get back together. The source said: 'David hopes it is a blip and that they can get the marriage back on track somehow, especially seeing as there is a child involved.' The way they were: The couple, who wed in May 2010, have a two-year-old son, Alfred together . Putting on a brave face: David tweeted that it was business as usual for him on Wednesday, in spite of the sudden split . Lara's last tweet was on Monday, when she posted something about work. She wrote: '#BTS for lorealparisofficial #Elvive #fibralogy #shampoo #XLhair #worthit #LorealParis.' The alleged split has happened almost five years after they tied the knot. David and Lara began dating in September 2009 after David took her to a Chelsea football match - with the funnyman later filling her home with flowers. Their relationship began after Lara's now-beaten battle with alcoholism following a stint in rehab in 2009. Serious: It has been claimed Lara took Alfred and the couple's dog Bert (who they jokingly refer to as their other child ) with her when she left their North London home . High hopes: The couple (pictured in May 2013) may have reportedly split but David is said to be already plotting to get Lara back . She's gone! According to The Sun, Lara took Alfred and the couple's dog Bert with them when she left their North London home . Lara told Dutch Vogue she was 'very nervous' on their first date but soon knew they shared a 'very mean sense of humour'. She told the publication: 'I’d forgotten to thank him for dinner so I sent him a text. You know what he wrote back? ""Who’s this?"" 'I was shocked. I really thought he’d forgotten already. I only realised later he was joking. We have so much fun. I’m quite lucky.' David proposed in Los Angeles in 2010, before marrying at London's exclusive Claridges Hotel in May 2010 - with Lara wearing a £30,000 lace and satin dress. Lara told the Daily Star shortly after the wedding: 'I am madly in love. I’ve never been happier. Happier times: David and Lara began dating in September 2009 before marrying at London's exclusive Claridge's Hotel in May 2010 . 'We met at a party and then went on a few dates. He’s wonderful. He’s amazing. He makes me laugh. He’s a proper gentleman. He’s a bit mean but in a good way. I’m happy.' David also seemed blissfully happy, telling The Sun: 'It’s a lovely thing to fall in love, to come back and feel like you’ve got a home. 'I would be at work filming and my wife would be saying, ""What time are you home because I want to know what time to put the shepherd’s pie on?"" I never thought I’d have that. An international supermodel who can make a great shepherd’s pie.' He also said: 'If you are with someone you adore, you’re happy to just spend time together. You don’t have to be doing something really exciting all the time. We love watching X Factor. 'If she’s away I have to wait until she’s back before I can watch it, which is a shame because I already know who has been kicked out. But we love it.'

'I'm really looking forward to being a dad, the whole experience,' he told the Daily Mirror. 'I'm looking forward to seeing the baby for the first time, seeing this little person who's a mixture of you and the person you really love.' The couple welcomed baby Alfred in May 2013 with David announcing Lara's pregnancy on his Twitter page. He wrote: 'Some wonderful news. My beautiful wife Lara is pregnant. We are having a baby! It is due next year and we both couldn't be happier. Dx.' Lara told Dutch Vogue last year that she was rather content, saying: 'I’m blessed; I have a fantastic husband, a beautiful baby, a wonderful dog and super job. Life’s pretty good and normal.' In August 2013, David admitted he could easily fall for either a man or a woman, as he's of the opinion that 'things can change for people over the years' when it comes to their sexual preferences. The comedian opened up about his sexuality in a revealing  interview with Radio Times magazine, explaining that to him, love is about falling for someone's 'soul, heart and brain', rather than whether they're male or female. The news of the split comes after it was recently claimed that the blonde beauty had declined Justin Bieber's request to go on a date while shooting their most recent ad campaign for Calvin Klein. A source previously said: 'While they were doing the whole Calvin Klein ad, Justin was very forward and asked Lara on a date. He made it look like a joke at first, but then tried to put in the charm. 'It didn't work though as she respectfully declined since she is married. Surprisingly, it didn't get awkward and the shoot went on with out incident.'

"Phuoc Wagner, three, from Canada who received a life-saving liver transplant from her father, has had her long-awaited homecoming postponed after contracting norovirus. The toddler, who was possibly going to be released this week,  remains in hospital as she recovers from the stomach flu. Phuoc and her twin sister Binh, adopted from Vietnam, were both in need of liver transplants because they suffer from Alagille syndrome, a genetic condition. Last month, their father Michael Wagner was able to give a portion of his liver to Phuoc - leaving him with an impossible decision after being a match for both girls, but only able to give the donation to one daughter. Following doctors' suggestions that he  give the transplant to Phuoc since she needed it the soonest, they underwent surgery in February. The pair were reunited  in a heart-warming moment shared by the family after the successful surgery. Scroll down for video . Phuoc Wagner (pictured above 17 days after her liver transplant surgery), three, who received a life-saving liver transplant from her father, has had her long-awaited homecoming postponed after contracting norovirus . Last month, her father Michael Wagner was able to give a portion of his liver to her, which left him to make an impossible decision after realizing he would only be able to give the donation to just one of his daughters (above Phuoc post surgery last month) The toddler remains in hospital while she recovers from the stomach flu (above a post about the delayed homecoming written by her mother, Johanne) Phuoc and Binh (the girls pictured above), adopted from Vietnam, were both in need of liver transplants because they suffer from Alagille syndrome, a genetic condition . The girls mother, Johanne, said that they are still waiting on a living donor for Binh as they continue to be patient for Phuoc's return home, according to ABC News. However in good news, reports last month said the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto had received 400 submissions from people offering to be a living donor for Binh. Mrs Wagner wrote on Facebook: 'No homecoming yet - norovirus is keeping Phuoc in hospital. And norovirus in my house as well. Home front needs to be clear before they can come home.' Only a few days ago, she had written of the reunion between the girls, and also her nervous feelings about welcoming Phuoc back after her surgery. Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and five days after the operation, the family posted a video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room. Mrs Wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well, and updated supporters on her husband and daughter's recovery . In the run-up to the surgery, Mr Wagner said it has been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls (above, Phuoc pictured right, with her mother, left, holding Binh) 'Binh and Phuoc will soon be reunited. Talks of Phuoc's release from hospital this week. Some time spent together before Binh's transplant will be beneficial. Both girls keep asking for each other and the family needs to be reunited,' she wrote. 'It is scary though to welcome her back so soon after transplant. A lot of new stuff to assimilate. Daily nursing visits for weeks to come to administer IV meds and perform bloodwork. 'But most of all, the fear of something going wrong, and quickly. No germs allowed in our household. A lot of quiet time needed to allow for full recovery for both Daddy and Phu-Phu.' Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and five days after the operation, the family posted a  video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room. Mrs Wagner (above with Binh at their family home) wrote on Facebook that the girls keep asking to see each other while Phuoc is still in hospital. She confirmed that their search continues for a living donor for Binh . The mother shared her concerns about welcoming Phuoc back after her surgery and having nervous feelings about something going wrong (above her post on Facebook) 'Hey mon belle!' Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. He then moves to side of Phuoc's bed and kisses her on the head and asks how she fells in French, as the two share a tender father-daughter moment. Mrs Wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well, and updated supporters on her husband and daughter's recovery, as well as their continued search to find a donor for Binh. 'So hard to believe we are hitting the one week mark: it seems like a blur,' Mrs Wagner wrote on Facebook. 'Michael still in hospital, Phuoc still on morphine, and mommy holding on on coffee. Still a fair amount of discomfort for Michael but he managed to visit his little girl two days in a row.' In the run-up to the surgery, Mr Wagner said it has been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls. The Wagners said the girls’ doctor was the one who ultimately decided that Phuoc would get her father’s liver based on medical necessity. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has received 400 submissions from people wanting to be donors for Binh . 'The cruel part of the liver is that you can only do it once,' he told the site Yahoo Canada. The Wagners said the girls’ doctor was the one who ultimately decided that Phuoc would get her father’s liver based on medical necessity. Gary Levy, who runs the liver donor program at the Toronto General Hospital, told The Canadian Press vial Global News that donors can give up to 70 per cent of their liver, which will regrow to its full size, but it can only be done once. The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phuoc in. Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. 'They were nine pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.' Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision. She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.' Mr Wagner and his wife Johanne adopted Phuoc and Binh when they were 18 months old after seeing they were in poor health at a Vietnamese orphanage .","Phuoc Wagner, three, will have homecoming delayed while she recovers from stomach flu .

"The last ever professional photos of Marilyn Monroe taken just weeks before her untimely death have emerged for sale for a staggering $36,000. The six poignant pictures of the screen siren were taken by close friend George Barris on July 13, 1962, destined for a book about Monroe. Just three weeks later Monroe was found dead - making Barris's pictures of the world's biggest star hugely valuable. Yet New York native Barris was devastated by the loss of his friend, and scrapped plans for the book. He also refused to allow the images, the last professional shots ever to be taken of Monroe, to be published for several years afterwards. The last kiss: This appears to be the final picture taken by a professional photographer of Marilyn Monroe, shot by close friend George Barris on a beach in Santa Monica on July 13, 1962 . Collectibles: This collection of six pictures by Barris are going up for auction next week . Comfortable: The two had become good friends - which shows clearly in the relaxed shots taken by Barris . The set of six original prints have now come up for sale, and experts are predicting they could fetch as much as $6,000 each - around £4,000. The intimate shots appear to show just how comfortable Monroe was with her friend of seven years. Barris had first met Monroe on the set of her film The Seven Year Itch in 1954. 'When I first saw her I thought she was the most beautiful, fantastic person I'd ever met,' Barris told the Los Angeles Daily News in 2012, ahead of an exhibition to mark what would have been the film star's 86th birthday. 'She completely knocked me off my feet.' The two remained firm friend. Barris told the Huffington Post: 'What I particularly liked about Marilyn was that she didn't act like a movie star. 'I was most impressed that Marilyn was always polite and friendly to everyone on the set. She was no phony or snob.' Barris revealed to the Daily News that the final shot he ever took of Monroe was on the beach, wrapped in a blanket. 'She puckered up and said, `This is just for you, George,' and blew a kiss to me. That's the last picture I took of her,' he said. A print of that picture among the six on sale, along with a two more from the beach in Santa Monica, while two are taken inside a house in Hollywood. Compilation: Barris had planned to include the pictures in a book about Monroe he was putting together . Grief: But Barris scrapped plans for the book, and refused to publish the pictures for years after her death . Devastated: After her death, Barris moved to Paris, where he lived for the next 20 years . Memories: Barris finally published the book, which he started working on in 1962, in 2012 . Also on sale are six signed shots from the iconic photoshoot of Monroe taken by fellow photographer Bert Stern in late June 1962 for Vogue magazine. Stern's images would become known as 'The Last Sitting' - despite Barris's pictures being taken later on. The black and white Stern shots, which include one of a sultry Monroe naked on a bed, are also expected to make anything between $3,500 and $8,000 each (about £2,300 to £5,200). Both collections are being sold by Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on behalf of two private collectors. Iconic: Six pictures for Bert Stern's Last Sitting collection for Vogue are also on sale at auction . Stunning: This particular print - signed by photographer Stern - is expected to fetch $8,000 . Ironic: Stern's pictures became known as The Last Sitting, despite Monroe posing for Barris later . Rachel Peart, director of photographs at Heritage New York, said: 'Bert Stern did a shoot with Marilyn Monroe for Vogue magazine in June 1962 which everyone refers to as 'The Last Sitting' - her last ever studio photos. 'The images he took became very iconic. Marilyn was the biggest star in the world at the time and Stern's photos were very glamorous. 'What is less well known is that another photographer, George Barris, took a series of intimate pictures of Marilyn a few weeks after Bert Stern's shoot - so those are technically the last ever studio shots of her.' Glamorous: This photograph - titled Feeling Good - is expected to make as much as $3,500 . Legendary: The Stern shots form an important part of the Monroe tale and are likely to be highly sought after . Sale: The auction of prints like this one, signed by Stern, takes place between March 10 and March 15 . Pearl added: 'All the pictures we are selling are authentic, genuine prints made by and signed by the photographers, many within five years of the originals being taken. 'Marilyn Monroe transcends generations and appeals to a wide range of collectors. She is timeless and market for Marilyn memorabilia is very strong. 'Because Marilyn was so iconic a lot of people took photos of her, however these photos are among the best and most rare out there.' The online auction will be spread over six days, from March 10 and March 15.","Taken by friend and celebrity photographer George Barris in July 1962 .

"Clint Eastwood showed off his new girlfriend Christina Sandera on the red carpet at the Academy Awards, and now her ex-husband is opening up about their past together - and her criminal history. Paul Wainscoat, who was married to Sandera for 11 months before filing for divorce, says her 'drinking' led to frequent fights between the pair, and a few that even turned physical. In fact, prior to their marriage, police were called to the house and she was arrested for domestic battery after an incident between her and Wainscoat. Scroll down for video . The ex-husband of Clint Eastwood's new girlfriend Christina Sandera (above) revealed she has been  arrested for domestic battery after he claims she physically assaulted him while they were dating . Ex-husband Paul Wainscoat,  claims that on July 17, 2002,  she became enraged when he refused to move in with her, and when he tried to leave 'grabbed onto his shirt and scratched his neck to prevent him. He called police, arrested her for domestic battery . Wainscoat tells The National Enquirer that on July 17, 2002, just two months after he began dating Sandera, she became enraged when he refused to move in with her, and when he tried to leave 'grabbed onto his shirt and scratched his neck to prevent him.' He managed to call the police, who in their report, noted a 'strong odor' of alcohol on Sandera's breath as they arrested her for domestic battery. The couple still married eight months later though, after, according to Wainscoat, he spent $80,000  on the couple's honeymoon and jewelry and 'dental work' for his bride. A few months after they married another physical fight broke out between the pair, with Wainscoat claiming that this time Sandera went into a rage as she was 'distraught due to the recent death of one of her cats.' He claims she began screaming at him 'Where are my kittens?' and then began hitting him with a closed fist before throwing 'a full bottle of Gatorade, which hit him in the back of the head.' He says he did not file charges on account of her 'drinking.' Wainscoat also describes other instances of 'bizarre behavior,' including a time that Sandera threatened to 'axe' their furniture if he left her. Sandera now lives in the $20million mansion (above) Eastwood recently completed building in Carmel, California . Eastwood and his ex-wife Dina (above) split in 2013 . The marriage finally blew up in June 2003, when police responded to another domestic disturbance with Wainscoat claiming he was 'being battered by his wife.' In court papers Sandera said she was not an alcoholic but had quit booze and attended AA meetings. This could possibly explain why Margot Robbie claims Eastwood gave her a glare when she popped a bottle of champagne in front of the two during the Academy Awards ceremony. In addition, Sandera said she attended '15 anger management classes.' 'It was hell,' says Wainscoat of the relationship. 'I wish Clint all the luck in the world with that woman.' Sandera, 51, and Eastwood, 84, have been dating since last summer after the two met while she was working as a restaurant hostess at Eastwood's Mission Ranch Hotel.

"Three women have come forward to say that a Catholic priest already facing child sexual abuse accusations molested them in the 1990s and he allegedly forced one to perform oral sex while in the confessional. Two of the three cases occurred when Reverand Mark Haynes was assigned to St. Ann's parish in Phoenixville and all women were minors at the time, say police. One of those three women said that Haynes attacked her when she confessed that she performed oral sex on a teenage boy. He then made her repeat the sex act on him. Three women have come forward to say that Reverand Mark Haynes (pictured) molested them in the 1990s and he allegedly forced one to perform oral sex while in the confessional . Philly.com reports that Haynes, formerly assigned to SS. Simon and Jude Parish in Westtown, hasn't yet been charged with sexual abuse and has denied all allegations. Spokesman Ken Gavin of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia is asking anyone with more information about Hayes to come forward. Recent search terms on Haynes' computer are 'nude teen girls' and '8th grade girls tumblr.' Haynes was charged with multiple counts of sexual abuse of children for possessing and disseminating child pornography last year and last month was arrested by FBI agents after federal prosecutors took over the child-pornography case. MyFoxPhilly.com reports that while posing as his 16-year-old alias he was sending lewd emails to a 14-year-old girl. Police say that Haynes posed as a fictional teenage girl named Katie Caponetti online and that he reached out to 25 teenage girls asking them to send nude photos of themselves. Decades ago: Reverand Mark Haynes allegedly abused three teenage girls while working at St. Ann's parish in Phoenixville in the 1990s . He also swapped hundreds of pornographic images of children online with other online users. Federal prosecutors say that Haynes' arrest last year didn't stop him from soliciting minors. While out on bail and local charges last year, he still used his Katie Caponetti name online while using a personal laptop he kept in the rectory at SS. Simon and Jude's. Despite the new allegations against Haynes he was released on Tuesday and was ordered to pay $5,000 bail at the end of the week. U.S. District Judge Lawrence F. Stengel has scheduled a new detention hearing for Wednesday after prosecutors appealed the decision to let him go. Haynes has served at eight parishes in the Pennsylvania suburbs and also worked as a chaplain at Archbishop Wood High School in Warminster, and at the Office for Youth and Young adults.","Reverand Mark Haynes, 55,  allegedly forced a female into oral sex  in a confessional booth after she confessed to the act on a teenage boy .

"'What Do Women Want' is such a common question that it inspired a Hollywood movie starring Mel Gibson. And the feminist writer Julie Burchill reckons that female sexuality has been suppressed and controlled for so long that they no longer have any idea what they want. In an article for the new issue of Loaded magazine, the columnist details the hypocrisies and strict demands that modern women demand of their boyfriends and husbands. Scroll down for video . Julie Burchill (pictured) believes that many women are unsure of what they want from a man because they have been controlled for so long . Julie told the publication: 'What [men] generally fear is women will want them for the wrong things. 'It’s women who are thought to be the soppy sex, but they are capable of great hard-headedness in matters of what is laughably known as The Heart.' She continued: 'Most women want a man who makes them laugh, sadly, they often don’t see this goes two ways and men need to have fun as much as they do. 'Some women want a man to tick all the boxes – handsome, rich, great job – but would be outraged if men subjected them to a similar shopping list.' Julie Burchill points out that some women claim to be too tired to have sex, but have enough energy to go out drinking with their friends (Picture posed by models) Ms Burchill, who is an ardent supporter of the female sex, revealed to the publication that one thing some women most definitely do not want is sex. She said: 'I know from personal experience that women tend to become sexually impervious to their husbands far more often and earlier than husbands do to their wives, . 'You’d think if a woman wanted to relax, or have a nice bit of Me Time, she could easily opt for a good old roll-around. 'But a lot of women aren’t interested in sex without making it into a huge performance number – they want romance.' In many relationships, women lose interest in sex much quicker than the man (Picture posed by models) She continued: 'We’ve all heard about those broads in relationships who mysteriously stop shagging their Significant Other, claiming they “haven’t got time for sex” and, “I’m too tired”. 'How come they’re never too tired to get trashed on rosé wine with their mates on a Friday night, go to the garden centre early on a Saturday morning and spend every weekday on Mumsnet?' She continued: 'Maybe sex wouldn’t take so long and be so tiring if they didn’t demand the Ring Cycle equivalent of romance first? ' The new issue of Loaded magazine . But the writer isn't taking a pop at women, in fact, far from it. She believes that the reason they are so conflicted in their desires is that they have been controlled as a sex for so long that their needs have desires have become muddled. She said: 'The way female sexuality has been corralled and controlled over the centuries would leave any poor s*d confused. 'Because of the disparity of opportunity and pay in the workplace for so long, women found the easiest way to advance themselves was through a man, and so the trapping and keeping of a husband become something most women put above all else. 'It takes a long time to heal from such strange and prolonged distortion of the self – hence the phenomenon of broads insisting they are “strong women” while buying books in which the sole point is the heroine being dominated by the hero. 'This historical injury explains why it’s still so hard, often, for men to understand what women want. 'I don’t even know.'

"Three in four households are paying up to £250 a year more on gas and electricity than they have to, official figures reveal. Most families are still on their energy firm's standard variable tariff – two years after David Cameron promised to force suppliers to put all customers on the best deal. The standard packages are £180 a year more expensive than the cheapest tariff, with some customers paying nearly £250 a year more. Three in four households are paying up to £250 a year more on gas and electricity than they have to, because they are on a standard variable tariff rather than the cheapest deal . Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said Mr Cameron had promised 17 times in the House of Commons to make energy suppliers automatically put all customers on their supplier's lowest tariff. She said: 'More than two years after David Cameron promised to make energy companies put all customers on the lowest tariff, millions of households are still being routinely overcharged by hundreds of pounds every single year. 'That's why the next Labour government will freeze energy prices until 2017, so that bills can fall but not rise, give the regulator the power to force energy suppliers to cut their prices and end overcharging once and for all.' Last month the Competition and Markets Authority released early findings of an inquiry into the sector that the Big Six were overcharging millions of loyal customers by up to £234 a year. During Prime Minster's Question's Time, David Cameron pledged to force energy firms to put customers on the cheapest tariff . Its findings showed 95% of the UK's 19 million dual fuel customers - those who take gas and electricity from the same company - could have saved between £158 and £234 by switching tariff or supplier. The CMA found the Big Six had consistently charged higher prices for standard variable tariffs than for other deals such as fixed tariffs. Energy UK chief executive Lawrence Slade said: 'Standard variable tariffs are just that, the standard price a company is offering energy to customers. Labour's Caroline Flint said Mr Cameron had promised 17 times  to make energy suppliers put all customers on the lowest tariff . 'Part of the cost of energy is an assurance that the gas and electricity has been bought months in advance, making sure energy will be available to customers when it is needed. 'New fixed-price deals are able to take advantage of short-term changes in costs and usually offer lower prices than the standard deals, often for a year or two. 'However, the important thing for customers to remember is there are a wide range of deals available in the market. 'If a customer thinks they might be able to save some money by switching tariff or company, they should log on to a comparison site or call their supplier.' Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: 'While recent price cuts are a step in the right direction, many customers could be better off to the tune of up to £250 by moving from a variable rate to a fixed rate deal. 'If you're not sure where to start, then I'd strongly recommend the Be An Energy Shopper website for an independent and impartial guide.' A Decc spokeswoman said: 'Our reforms to drive down household bills are working and the best energy tariffs are cheaper than they were a year ago. But people want to see more savings - now - and the power is in their hands to do something about it. By shopping around for a better deal and switching energy suppliers households can save around £200 and some even more. 'Consumers deserve a fair deal - and this is exactly why we're backing the CMA's investigation.' Despite wholesale energy prices falling sharply, household energy bills are not dropping at the same rate – nor at the same level across providers. Anyone on a standard tariff with a Big Six provider – British Gas, E.On, npower, SSE, EDF Energy and ScottishPower – who has not switched for several years can almost certainly save money by jumping ship. Households should really review deals every year to ensure they aren't overpaying, but even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs. Prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live. You can check how prices compare using the tool on the right.","Families paying up to £250 a year more on energy than they have to .

"Eating too much salt may be bad for your heart – but it can protect against skin infections, research has found. A high-salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin, boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections, say scientists. In an experiment, German researchers discovered that mice which were fed a high-salt diet healed infections in their feet more quickly. Too much salt may be bad for your heart but it can protect against skin infections, new research found . This is because the salt had raised the activity of immune cells called macrophages, making their immune systems more responsive. The findings, published in the journal Cell Metabolism, may also highlight how salt was once effectively used to ward off infections before antibiotics were invented. Professor Jonathan Jantsch, of the University of Regensburg, said: 'Up to now, salt has been regarded as a detrimental dietary factor; it is clearly known to be detrimental for cardiovascular diseases, and recent studies have implicated a role in worsening autoimmune diseases. 'Our current study challenges this one-sided view and suggests that increasing salt accumulation at the site of infections might be an ancient strategy to ward off infections, long before antibiotics were invented.' High levels of sodium stored in the skin, especially in the elderly, can lead to high blood pressure and increase the risk for heart disease and stroke, worsen autoimmune disease and even increase the risk of stomach cancer. Professor Jens Titze from Vanderbilt University added: 'Despite the overwhelming evidence linking dietary salt to disease in humans, the potential evolutionary advantage of storing so much salt in the body has not been clear.' A high-salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin, boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections, say scientists . The researchers found that infected areas in patients with bacterial skin infections also showed remarkably high salt accumulation. But in experiments high salt diet mice had increased immunity against microbial infections by boosting the activity of immune cells called macrophages. This meant that mice who had infections in their feet caused by a parasite called Leishmania major were able to heal more quickly. Future studies will examine how salt accumulates in the skin and triggers immune responses, and why salt accumulates in the skin of ageing adults. Professor Jantsch went on: 'A further understanding of the regulatory cascades might not only help to design drugs that specifically enhance local salt deposition and help to combat infectious diseases, but also may lead to novel strategies to mobilise sodium stores in the ageing population and prevent cardiovascular disease. 'We also think that local application of high-salt-containing wound dressings and the development of other salt-boosting antimicrobial therapies might bear therapeutic potential.' But he warned everyone should not rush off and start a high salt diet. He added: 'Due to the overwhelming clinical studies demonstrating that high dietary salt is detrimental to hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, we feel that at present our data does not justify recommendations on high dietary salt in the general population. 'Nevertheless, in situations where endogenous accumulation of salt to sites of infection is insufficient, supplementation of salt might be a therapeutic option. 'But this needs to be addressed in further studies.'","Research has found eating salt can protect against skin infections .

"The one thing you can count on at Poundland – according to its bosses – is that everything costs £1. Except it doesn’t. And now the budget retailer has been told it must drop that claim after selling DVDs and CDs for £2. Today’s ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority is a major blow for the company, which has built its empire on the boast that just £1 can buy anything in its stores. Poundland has been told it must drop the claim 'everything costs £1' after selling DVDs and CDs for £2 . The decision even calls into question whether the budget chain can legitimately continue to call itself ‘Poundland’. Before the advertising watchdog’s ruling, Poundland's website boasted: ‘Everything for £1 was the idea of our founders in 1990 and we’re still true to that vision today.’ Under a heading ‘Our Values’, it added: ‘We’ve grown to be the largest single price value retailer in the UK...We are very proud to offer you a single £1 price, that hasn’t changed since we opened our first store.’ However, people complained to the ASA that these claims were no longer accurate because it was stocking DVDs of blockbuster films in a concession partnership with another firm for £2 each. Poundland defended the breaking of its normal £1 price barrier saying the £2 items were part of a special promotion run at the tills and sold to customers providing they met a minimum spending threshold. The ASA said: ‘They stated that an average Poundland store stocked approximately 4,000 products and that the ‘conditional spend’ promotion was created in response to consumer demand. Poundland has become hugely popular with wealthier shoppers after stocking baking products under the name of actress Jane Asher . ‘In October 2014, Poundland obtained feedback from consumers regarding the promotion and found that a significant proportion agreed that they would buy items from Poundland that cost more than £1, provided they were clearly marked and located in a special place in the shop.’ The company said the stock of £2 DVDs and CDs were on a specific display that was separated from the normal £1 products and there was no chance of shoppers being confused or misled. But that did not satisfy the ASA, which said the claims on the Poundland website suggested that all its products were no more than £1 ‘regardless of whether or not they were sold via a concession arrangement or as promotional goods’. It added: ‘Because that was not the case, we concluded that the ad was misleading.’ Significantly, the ASA said: ‘We told Poundland Ltd that their future advertising must not state or suggest that every item they sold cost £1.’ If this ruling sticks, it will be a heavy blow to one of Britain’s fastest growing retailers. The company recently announced a plan to spend £55million to take over its deadly rival the 99p Stores chain, which will add some 251 outlets to an existing empire of 534 stores. The company, which floated on the Stock Exchange last year, is worth almost £1billion and has become a fixture on many high streets, taking over outlets once occupied by the failed giant Woolworths. It was shunned by the middle classes, at one time, but it is now hugely popular after making a concerted effort to attract wealthier shoppers with baking products under the name of cake maker and actress Jane Asher, a range of well received beauty products as well as gardening and DIY items. Poundland is not the first discount store to fall foul of the ASA. Last October, the watchdog issued a similar ban on claims made by the Poundworld chain. The company was told to stop claiming everything costs £1 after it was found selling more expensive products under the heading ‘manager specials’. These included packs of 100 Finish All-In-One dishwasher tablets for £8.99, £3 for 10 cans of cola and £5.99 for a Sex & the City gift set. Poundland confirmed some ‘special promotion’ items cost more than £1. Currently, it is selling an Easter Bunny toy and a Nivea Skin Set for £3 to customers who spend £3. The firm said it has changed its website claims following the ASA ruling. A spokesman said: ‘Following advice from the ASA on the communication of our special promotions on the Poundland website, we have amended the site and made the special promotions clearer. ‘Poundland sells over 4,000 products at £1, including over 1,000 well-known brands and we are proud of the amazing value we offer, to over 5.5 million customers every week. ‘Our special promotions have been bought by nearly one million customers, and are an additional offer separate to our usual product lines for customers who qualify, by spending £3 or more in-store. 'These items cannot be bought separately. Customer feedback has been outstanding.’","Advertising watchdog ruled Poundland must drop claim everything is £1 .

"In May of this year the LHC will be turned on at full power after a wait of more than two years, as scientists prepare to probe the secrets of the universe closer than ever before. And if one scientists gets his way, one of these searches could involve looking for dark matter - one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the cosmos. He proposes that the Higgs boson itself - which gives particles their mass - could disintegrate into dark matter, and he’s hoping the team at Cern can prove his theory. Scroll down for video . Previously a Higgs particle has been created in an LHC detector and has then disintegrated into four muons (the four red lines). According to Dr Christoffer Petersson’s model the Higgs particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter . Dr Christoffer Petersson from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden and two colleagues came up with the new particle model to predict the existence of dark matter. The current ‘Standard Model’ of particle physics is quite good at describing physics on a subatomic level, but it can’t account for dark matter in the universe. Dr Petersson’s model, though, contains more ‘elementary particles’ - the smallest known to exist - than the Standard Model. This includes dark matter particles. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. And his model also gives the Higgs particle different properties, suggesting that it can disintegrate into a photon (a particle of light) and particles of dark matter. To prove his theory, though, he needs a particle accelerator - and it seems that Cern is willing to conduct such an experiment. Two independent experimental stations - Atlas and CMS - at the Large Hadron Collider are looking for the very properties of the Higgs particle his model predicts. If the properties are there, it is a clear indication that the model fits. ‘It's a dream for a theorist in particle physics,’ said Dr Petersson. ‘[The] LHC is the only place where the model can be tested. It's even nicer that two independent experiments are going to do it.' The current ‘Standard Model’ of particle physics is quite good at describing physics on a subatomic level, but it can’t account for dark matter in the universe (illustrated). Dr Petersson’s model, though, contains more ‘elementary particles’ than the Standard Model - and crucially it includes dark matter particles . In May of this year the LHC will be turned on at full power after a wait of more than two years, as scientists prepare to probe the secrets of the universe closer than ever before. Pictured is the Atlas experiment at the LHC, one of two instruments trying to prove - or disprove - Dr Petersson's model . In the first studies the volume of data was unfortunately too small for it to be possible to either confirm or reject Petersson's model. ‘But we are already in full swing with new analyses in which we are testing his model in other ways and with more data,’ said Dr Zeynap Demiragli at the CMS experiment at Cern. ‘We congratulate Christoffer Petersson for having done an important job.’ After being closed down for a time for an upgrade, LHC will start up again in the spring of 2015. With higher energies in the accelerator, the experiments will finally gather sufficient data to evaluate Dr Petersson's model properly. ‘If the model is found to fit, it would completely change our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of nature,' he said. 'If not, just the fact that they are willing to test my model at Cern is great.'","Dr Christoffer Petersson from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden has proposed a new model for particle physics .

"A woman who lost half her leg to bone cancer had her foot reattached backwards - and it wasn't a mistake. Shanna Decker, 24, was seven when she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma after complaining about a pain in her leg. Doctors said they would have to remove her left knee to save her life. But instead of an amputation, Decker opted for a 'rotationplasty': when the foot is attached to the thigh and rotated backwards. It means Decker, from Minnesota, has more control over her prosthetic calf. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Choice: Shanna Decker, 24, opted to have her left foot reattached to her thigh backwards after doctors removed her left knee. The operation, which removed a cancerous tumor, saved her life . The forward-facing heel acts as a new knee and the foot can move like a shin. If she needs to, Decker can even apply weight to the foot - which has retained its feeling - and walk on it. The then-novel procedure was one of three options available to Decker, while she endured a grueling chemotherapy program. Doctors could have amputated her leg below the thigh or created a 'stiff leg'. More control: The decision Decker and her parents made when she was seven (left) means that she now has more control over her prosthetic leg and can manoeuvre it better than if she had undergone an amputation . Delighted: Seven-year-old Decker was amazed at how quickly she learned to walk again after surgery . Due to her age, Decker was not eligible for 'limb salvage', where the missing tissue is replaced with transplanted or artificial tissue, as her legs were not fully developed. Instead, she opted for rotationplasty, which removes the tumor and the knee and rotates the foot 180 degrees. Writing on Rotationplasty.com, her mother said: 'I remember this being the hardest decision our family has ever faced. When we initially learned of rotationplasty, I have to admit, it took time to absorb. We had many questions and desperately wanted to connect with others who had already chosen this procedure, but found that to be difficult.' No regrets: Decker has now set up a foundation to help children who are considering rotationplasty too . Aside from the difficulty overcoming the appearance of her new leg, Decker said she never thought twice about it. And learning to walk was simple - unlike the months-long process most amputees endure. 'As soon as my leg healed, I was walking with a prosthetic and it took me about three seconds to learn how to rewalk,' Decker told Everyday Health. Hoping to inspire children who are facing the same predicament she tackled 17 years ago, Decker has founded a charity called Brighter Tomorrows that supports young cancer sufferers.","Shanna Decker, 24, was diagnose with osteosarcoma at the age of 7 .

"Mary-Ann Wood, 53, has one leg which weighs two stone more than the other after cancer treatment . A grandmother has spoken of the agony of living with a medical condition that means she has one leg two stone heavier than another. Mary-Ann Wood's left leg began to swell after treatment for cervical cancer 17 years ago, but it is now so huge that her calf has a circumference of almost 3ft. The 53-year-old suffers from lymphoedema, a condition where the body's plumbing goes haywire. This means fluid doesn't drain properly, leaving her with a painfully swollen leg. Mrs Wood is now unable to bend her leg, is barely able to walk, and doctors have said she will be completely immobile in less than a decade. Despite this, she has been denied NHS funding for a liposuction operation to drain the fluid from her leg. She made the bid through her doctor, who agreed she would benefit from the treatment , which would cost the NHS £11,000. But after her case was assessed by a panel at her local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), her application was denied as the CCG said the evidence for the procedure's effectiveness was 'poor'. She claims she has been given several reasons as to why she can't have the treatment, including it being a 'cosmetic procedure'. Mrs Wood, of Midhurst, West Sussex, has been forced to give up her job working with special needs children while she continues to battle the NHS for the treatment. Last month, she was rejected by the Independent Complaint Advocacy on the grounds that her case is not 'exceptional enough', she said. Mrs Wood said: 'My leg is huge and the surgeon told me the only option is to have the operation. 'I've had loads of different excuses for being rejected - they once even said it would be ""cosmetic"". 'I was also told that I wasn't ""exceptional enough"" to get the op. It's ridiculous. She added: 'I was told that my best bet of getting the operation is to move to an area where the NHS provides it - it's a postcode lottery. 'But I've got two small grandchildren down the road I don't want to up sticks.' Mrs Wood's condition developed because she had lymph nodes removed along with her cervix as part of a hysterectomy. Her lymphatic system is no longer strong enough to drain her leg of the fluid causing the build-up. The lymphatic system is a filter network of tiny vessels which runs alongside the circulation and drains waste products from the blood . Normally, fluid drains from the lymph channels into the lymph nodes. These nodes act like filter stations that process the waste - the fluid itself goes back through the body into the circulation. However, if the lymphatic system is faulty - such as after cancer treatment - the fluid it would normally drain away accumulates in the tissue and the area swells up. The skin becomes like a soggy mattress, because there's too much fluid in the tissue. Mrs Wood Doctors calculated that her left leg was two stone heavier than her right leg using computer modelling. She said: 'The doctor knows how much the lymph fluid weighs so she measures my legs at 2cm intervals, works out the difference in size and puts it all into the computer and it calculates the difference in weight.' She must now wear a compression garment, which puts pressure on tissues to stop fluid build-up and encourage fluid to drain. The liposuction would not cure the condition but it would drain the excess fluid from her leg allowing her to walk normally again. Mrs Wood's left leg has swollen so much her calf now has a circumference of almost three feet. She is unable to bend it, leaving her barely able to walk. Doctors have said she will be immobile within a decade . She suffers from lymphoedema, a condition in which the body's lymphatic system doesn't drain fluid properly from the leg, causing fluid to accumulate in the tissue and the leg to swell up . It would cost the NHS £11, 000, with a continuing cost of around £300 a year to remeasure her leg and create a new compression garment if there is a change in size. The liposuction would not cure the condition but it would drain the excess fluid from her leg allowing her to walk normally again. Without the operation, Mrs Wood must continue her daily struggle. She said: 'I get up in the morning and have a massage and put on compression garment - all that takes an hour. 'Then it's very difficult to walk. It weighs nearly three stone more than it should because it's filled with lymph fluid. Lymphoedema is a condition where the lymphatic system — a filter network of tiny vessels which runs alongside the circulation and drains waste products from the blood — isn’t working properly. Normally, fluid drains from the lymph channels into the lymph nodes. These nodes act like filter stations that process the waste — the fluid itself goes back through the body into the circulation. However, if the lymphatic system is faulty, the fluid it would normally drain away accumulates in the tissue and the area swells up. The skin becomes like a soggy mattress, because there’s too much fluid in the tissue. Limbs can swell to double their normal size and can be extremely painful. The condition is  common in middle-aged women. 'I can't walk any distance and when I do I use a stick. Doctors said that by the time I'm 60 I will be immobile. Already I can't move that knee at all. 'I don't want to go down that road, that's not what I want out of life, the only option for me is to fight.' Her battle started in 2013 when massages began failing her and was told she needed the liposuction. Her husband of 26 years Alan Wood, a 48-year-old removal man, must assist her in her daily chores. A spokesperson at NHS Coastal West Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group, said: 'We are very sorry to hear Mrs Wood's concerns, and we do understand the difficult situation that patients are in when they come to us for individual funding. 'There are treatments and drugs that we do not routinely fund, but which we know, and understand, that patients and their families want to look into and explore as a possible solution to their medical needs. 'To enable this, people are able to apply for individual funding through their clinicians. 'Decisions are not taken lightly, and cases are thoroughly considered by a panel of hospital consultants, GPs and lay people.' The panel sought an independent review from specialist at Guys and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, and their report was considered alongside the submission from Mrs Wood's doctor. The CCG spokesperson continued: 'The CCG's panel fully considered Mrs Wood's case, but found that the evidence of clinical effectiveness of the proposed treatment was poor.' We understand this is disappointing for Mrs Wood but without evidence that the treatment would be clinically effective, the panel could not approve the treatment.' Now, Mrs Wood is trying to raise £2,500 to get a machine to massage her leg but has so far raised just £220.

"Killed: Charley Saturmin Robinet (seen here in his mugshot from 2000) was killed in a scuffle with LA police on Skid Row on Sunday, prompting protests . A homeless man shot dead by the LAPD stole a Frenchman's identity more than 15 years ago and was wanted for violating terms of a bank robbery conviction, officials said last night. Charley Saturmin Robinet, 39, was killed on Los Angeles' impoverished Skid Row when he allegedly tried to grab the holstered pistol of an officer while police arrested him on Sunday. The shooting was caught by an onlooker on a video that went viral, leading to protests and calls by civil rights activists for a special police commission hearing on the use of force. Originally thought to be French, officials now say Robinet stole the identity of a Frenchman with the same name and birth date to apply for a French passport in the 1990s, when he came to the U.S. to pursue an acting career. His true identity remains unknown, said Axel Cruau, the consul general for France in Los Angeles. According to the consulate's account, Robinet was identified as a French national in 2000 when robbed a Wells Fargo branch in Thousand Oaks, some 40 miles west of downtown Los Angeles, and pistol-whipped an employee. He served around 13 years in prison for the crime, in which he, an accomplice and getaway driver stole $33,500 in a bid to pay for acting classes at the Beverly Hills Playhouse. But when the French consulate tried to support him ahead of his 2013 release, officials discovered the original Robinet and realised the prisoner was an imposter. Mr Cruau said: 'The real Charley Robinet is in France apparently living a totally normal life and totally unaware his identity had been stolen years and years ago.' Scroll down for video . WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Shot dead: Charley Saturmin Robinet, circled in red, was gunned down by the Los Angeles Police Department on Sunday. Above is the moment directly after the fatal scuffle, after police had backed away . Proof? Police say this frame shows Charley Saturmin Robinet, circled center, reaching up for a police officer's gun during the fatal encounter on Sunday in Los Angeles . While in federal prison in Rochester, Minnesota, the bank robber known as Robinet was assigned to the mental health unit. Medical staff there determined he was suffering from 'a mental disease or defect' that required treatment in a psychiatric hospital, documents show. After his release from federal prison Robinet spent six months in a halfway house before being fully released in May 2014, said Ed Ross, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons. Foreign nationals are usually deported after serving their sentences, but France would not take him because he could not prove was French. Because of a 2001 Supreme Court ruling on the rights of 'stateless' people, Robinet was set free. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Virginia Kice said she couldn't immediately comment on his immigration history. Under the terms of the man's release, he was required to provide reports to his probation officer at the beginning of each month, . Deputy U.S. Marshal Matthew Cordova said he failed to do so in November, December and January, leading to the issue of a federal warrant - which triggered the fatal clash with police. The head of the Union Rescue Mission, outside which Robinet was shot, told Reuters that Robinet had been living in a tent outside the mission for weeks and had a history of violent, erratic behavior. He went by the street name of Africa and lived among one of the largest homeless communities in the United States, with more than 3,000 people. On Monday LAPD Chief Charlie Beck confirmed the footage from body cameras worn by an officer and a sergeant provided a 'unique perspective' of the incident. However, he said that the force would not be releasing the video yet. According to the LA Times he also would not be drawn on what the footage actually revealed. 'At the end of the investigation into this officer-involved shooting ... we will release the complete investigation through the inspector general's office,' Beck said. 'If there is a criminal proceeding in this or if there's a civil proceeding in this, we will make all evidence available through those proceedings.' Killing: This is the moment police fired shots at Charley Saturmin Robinet, who is obscured from view in the above frame by an officer. The LAPD have claimed he was trying to take an officer's gun . Before the fatal shooting: He was being confronted over reports of a robbery before five shots were fired . The three officers who fired their weapons at Robinet were veterans of the Skid Row beat who had special training to deal with mentally ill and other people in the downtrodden area, said Beck. But a rookie officer who cried out that the man had his gun, leading to the shooting, had considerably less experience. The LAPD didn't immediately say how much training he had received in dealing with mentally ill people. All officers must go through at least an 11-hour course. Police Chief Charlie Beck said some of the veteran officers had 'completed our most extensive mental illness training over a 36-hour course.' Initial signs showed the officers used what they had learned during the confrontation, despite the outcome, he said. Shooting: The attack took place in the Skid Row district of Los Angeles, which is known for its large homeless population . 'Damaged gun': The LAPD said this image shows the officer's pistol after the encounter. LA police chief Charlie Beck said damaged magazine and a partially-discharged bullet prove there was a struggle over it . 'The way you have conversations, the way you offer options, the way that you give some space, the body language that you portray, the way that you escalate, all of that is part of the training,' Beck said on Monday. 'I will make judgment on that when I review the totality of the investigation, but on the face of it, it appears they did try all of that.' The shooting was captured on video but exactly what happened remained unclear. The footage has been viewed by millions of people online. Several dozen people rallied Tuesday in protest of the shooting. There was a moment of silence, and participant Patrisse Cullors declared the shooting site to be 'sacred ground.' A memorial at the site of the shooting features white roses placed over a tent, blankets and clothing belonging to the man known as 'Africa.' Angry protests: People walk through skid row in protest against the killing of a homeless man by police in Los Angeles on Tuesday . The specialized training came under the nationwide Safer Cities Initiative, designed to tone down encounters between police and people on the streets. Footage showed the homeless man reaching toward the rookie officer's waistband, Beck said. The officer's gun was later found partly cocked and jammed with a round of ammunition in the chamber and another in the ejection port, indicating a struggle for the weapon, Beck said. 'You can hear the young officer who was primarily engaged in the confrontation saying that ""He has my gun. He has my gun,'' Beck said. 'He says it several times, with conviction.' The three other officers then opened fire. The man who was shot was black, as is the rookie officer who was just short of completing his probationary year on the force, police said. Senseless: People protest against the killing in Los Angeles in the Skid Row area of the city . The violence had echoes of the August police shooting of 25-year-old Ezell Ford, whose death in a struggle with Los Angeles officers brought demonstrations in the city. Ford was unarmed. Police said he was shot after reaching for an officer's gun. Video was taken came from multiple perspectives, including two witnesses recording from their phones and cameras worn by two of the officers who fired their weapons. Beck said officers had arrived to investigate a robbery report and the homeless man refused to obey their commands and became combative. A security camera outside a homeless shelter about 75 feet away showed the man pushed over a neighbor's tent and the two people had a dispute. When officers arrived, they tried to speak to the suspect. He turned and jumped into his tent, and officers appeared to pull it up and over him to roust him from inside. The man jumped out flailing and kicking before ending up on the ground. In memoriam: This carboard plaque pays tribute to Charley Saturmin Robinet, who was known as Cameroon or Africa by locals . Beck said officers didn't know if the suspect was arming himself. Stun guns 'appeared to have little effect, and he continued to violently resist,' Beck said. One witness began filming from a closer perspective. As the man took swings, four officers wrestled him to the ground. The struggle became blurry and distant, but shouting could be heard, followed by five apparent gunshots. The Los Angeles Police Department's inspector general and the city's district attorney are investigating the shooting. Two of the officers suffered minor injuries, including the rookie officer, who is on crutches. All four officers are on paid leave.","Charley Saturmin Robinet, 39, killed in struggle which was caught on film .

"A teenager who sexually assaulted a woman near a Perth train station on his 15th birthday has avoided immediate detention and been warned by a magistrate to 'get off the porn'. The boy, who cannot be named, was sentenced in the West Australian Children's Court on Thursday to a 10-month conditional release order, which includes 80 hours of community service and counselling. The court heard the 22-year-old victim was attacked after getting off a train at Warwick station in October. The boy grabbed the woman from behind, touched her breast and put his hand under her skirt before she broke free and said: 'What the f*** are you doing?' A teenager sexually assaulted a woman on a cycle path (pictured) near a Perth train station in October . The court heard the 22-year-old victim was grabbed from behind and the boy was still wearing his school uniform . Defence lawyer Hylton Quail said the boy had developed an addiction to pornography and, as he went through puberty, his Christian family did not discuss sexuality. He said the boy was trying to act out what he had become obsessed with from watching pornography, which was to grab her bottom, but as he started acting out his fantasy it escalated. Mr Quail described the teenager as a 'silly young boy' whose parents had since stopped him from accessing the internet on his own at night. Prosecutor Genevieve Cleary said the attack was premeditated but unsophisticated because the teenager was wearing his school uniform and could be easily identified. 'This was a random, frightening attack on a young woman who was simply going about her business,' she said. The boy, who cannot be named, was sentenced in the West Australian Children's Court on Thursday . Magistrate Andree Horrigan noted letters from the boy's coach, principal and family friends who said they were stunned, deeply shocked and surprised by the offending. But she said they did not know about the boy's 'nocturnal activities'. She added that the crime was degrading and invasive. 'I could not imagine a more serious set of circumstances,' she said. 'It's just disgusting.' Magistrate Horrigan said the boy's behaviour was 'entirely and grossly unacceptable' and warned him to be more respectful. 'You do not know what you take from people when you behave like this,' she said. 'You take people's confidence ... It's going to have a lasting impact on her.'

"Is it possible to get a group of 15 three to five-year-olds, who have never played the piano before, together on a concert stage to perform a piece of classical music in just five weeks? Swedish insurance company Folksam attempted just that for a recent commercial project entitled ‘Mini Maestros’ and the results – although containing a couple of expected errors – are outstanding. In the clip the conductor is shown at work leading an orchestra, before entering the room full of children from a preschool in Klara, Stockholm and uttering: ‘Oh dear’ at the sight of the youngsters running around. The conductor is featured taking the children to the piano in turn and teaching them how to play a few notes . The 15 pianos, each featuring a photograph of a child, are assembled in a circle on the concert stage . Settling them down, he takes them one-by-one to the piano and begins the difficult task of teaching them how to play a few notes. Teasing out a piece of the final performance, the development of the children is briefly showcased alongside the conductor stating: ‘Sometimes you don’t know what makes the penny drop.’ The stage is set, the conductor gets dressed and the pianos are fitted with photographs of the children who will momentarily play them. Climbing up onto their stools, the children are silenced by the conductor’s baton and the performance gets under way. The children stop talking and wait in anticipation to begin playing after the conductor raps his baton off of a music stand . Concentrating, the children hunch over their pianos and each play their individual bits with their index fingers . The young children begin playing Erik Satie’s Gymnopédie No. 1 as the conductor leads them from the front . Each concentrating on their own individual part, the children – hunched over their pianos in anticipation – use their index fingers to press the keys and together play the beginning of Erik Satie’s Gymnopédie No. 1. A few bum notes feature in the piece, but they fit wonderfully alongside the imagery of teddy bears accompanying the children at the pianos and feet swinging from stools miles from the ground. As the performance ends, the conductor and the children congratulate each other and the credits begin to roll. Despite hitting a few bum notes the children, who have only played the piano for 15 weeks, perform outstandingly well .

"Baby girls from well-off districts can expect to enjoy good health for nearly 20 years longer than those in the poorest towns and suburbs, according to an official analysis. It found that a newborn girl in one of the top 10 per cent of wealthy areas will live 71.3 years before her life is limited by chronic illness or disability. But a girl born in one of the bottom 10 per cent of the most deprived areas can expect only 52.4 years of life in good health. Lottery: Babies born living in the top 10 per cent of wealthy areas can expect to live up to 20 years longer without disability or chronic illness, than those in poorer areas. Baby girls in wealthy areas can expect to live healthy lives the longest . The difference means the well-off girl is likely to have a healthy life more than a third longer than that of a girl from a poor district. The figures for boys are highly similar, according to the findings charted by the Office for National Statistics. They provoked protests from poverty pressure groups, which compared health inequality in Britain with health levels in Third World countries, and complained that the wealth gap is now dragging down the health of the entire British population. World Health Organisation figures on healthy life expectancy appear to show that men and women in Rwanda can expect to live healthily to 55 and 56 respectively. The same figures, from the Global Health Observatory Data Repository, show men and women in Romania will enjoy good health to 63 and 69, while those in Russia can expect to live to 57 and 66 without serious health issues. Poor health: Baby boys born in the most deprived areas of Britain have the worst prospects having just 52.2 years of healthy living . The ONS findings for the UK say that healthy life expectancy is at its worst in the very poorest areas of the country – usually those with high levels of worklessness, benefit dependency and alcohol, tobacco and drug consumption – and that for four fifths of the population the health gap between the best off and the rest is much less marked. The figures were calculated from the ONS Annual Population Survey which checks on the lives of 320,000 people a year. For men, it said that boys born in the most deprived suburbs can expect 52.2 years of good health, compared to 70.5 years for those born in the best-off areas. It said that if the figures were adjusted by measures designed to take into account income across the population rather than just in extremely poor or rich districts, the gaps were wider – 19.5 years for women as opposed to 18.9, and 19.1 years for men as opposed to 18.3. The ONS figures showed that, above the poorest fifth of areas, newborn girls can all expect almost 60 years of healthy life or more, and boys more than 58 years. Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: ‘The statistics lay bare what poverty and deprivation does to children here in the UK – it damages their health and shortens lives. Politicians of all parties need to act.’ Comparisons with Third World countries were made by the Equality Trust campaign group. Its director Duncan Exley said: ‘The UK is one of the most unequal countries in the developed world. This is damaging our health, our social bonds and our economy.’ The ONS figures are based on an analysis of nearly 33,000 neighbourhoods across England, but no individual district is named.","Girls born in wealthiest areas will live over 70 years before chronic illness .

"The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will phase out the show's iconic elephants from its performances by 2018, telling The Associated Press exclusively that growing public concern about how the animals are treated led to the decision. Executives from Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, said the decision to end the circus's century-old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length as elephants have often been featured on Ringling's posters over the decades. 'There's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers,' said Alana Feld, the company's executive vice president. 'A lot of people aren't comfortable with us touring with our elephants.' Scroll down for video . The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus has announced they are phasing out their elephant acts, and will eliminate them in 2018 . The decision was largely based on the fact that many cities have anti-circus and anti-elephant ordinances in addition to public outcry . 13 animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the company's 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida . Feld owns 43 elephants, and 29 of the giant animals live at the company's 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida. 13 animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018 while one elephant is on a breeding loan to the Fort Worth Zoo. Another reason for the decision, company President Kenneth Feld said, was that certain cities and counties have passed 'anti-circus' and 'anti-elephant' ordinances. The company's three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year, and Feld said it's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction. It's also difficult to plan tours amid constantly changing regulations, he said. 'All of the resources used to fight these things can be put towards the elephants,' Feld said during an interview at the Center for Elephant Conservation. 'We're not reacting to our critics; we're creating the greatest resource for the preservation of the Asian elephant.' The circus will continue to use other animals - this year it added a Mongolian troupe of camel stunt riders to its Circus Xtreme show and it will likely showcase more motorsports, daredevils and feats of humans' physical capabilities. Ringling's popular Canada-based competitor, Cirque du Soleil, features human acts and doesn't use wild animals. 'There are endless possibilities,' said Juliette Feld, another executive vice president of the company and a producer of Feld's Marvel Universe Live, Disney on Ice and Monster Jam shows, among others. Feld owns the largest herd of Asian elephants in North America. It costs about $65,000 yearly to care for each elephant, and Kenneth Feld said the company would have to build new structures to house the retiring elephants at the center, located in between Orlando and Tampa on a rural, ranchlike property. Kenneth Feld said initially the center will be open only to researchers, scientists and others studying the Asian elephant. Eventually, he 'hopes it expands to something the public will be able to see.' 'I want everybody's grandkids to be able to see Asian elephants,' he said. The center's youngest elephant is Mike, who will be 2 in August, and the oldest is Mysore, who is 69. One elephant, 6-year-old Barack, was conceived by artificial insemination. Since the center opened in 1995, 26 elephants have been born there. A male elephant scratches on the bars of his pen at the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida . Kenneth Feld, CEO of Feld Entertainment, feeds Alana and Icky at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida . There will be a new structure built to house the retiring elephants, and the company hopes to open the conservation to the public eventually . Ringling's elephants have been at the center of lawsuits and ongoing complaints from animal rights activists. In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from a number of animal-rights groups, including the Humane Society of the United States, ending a 14-year legal battle over unproven allegations that Ringling circus employees mistreated elephants. The initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 by a former Ringling barn helper who was later found to have been paid at least $190,000 by the animal-rights groups that helped bring the lawsuit. The judge called him 'essentially a paid plaintiff' who lacked credibility and standing to sue. The judge rejected the abuse claims following a 2009 trial. Kenneth Feld testified during that trial about elephants' importance to the show. 'The symbol of the Greatest Show on Earth is the elephant, and that's what we've been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years.' When asked by a lawyer whether the show would be the same without the elephants, Feld replied, 'No, it wouldn't.' This week, Feld said, 'Things have changed.' 'How does a business be successful? By adapting,' he said. Feld noted that when his father bought the circus in 1967, there was still a human sideshow featuring acts such as the bearded lady and other human oddities. His father did away with that, he said. 'We're always changing and we're always learning,' he said. In 2008, Feld acquired a variety of motor sports properties, including monster truck shows, motocross and the International Hot Rod Association, which promotes drag races and other events. In 2010, it created a theatrical motorcycle stunt show called Nuclear Cowboyz. Roughly 30 million people attend one of Feld's 5,000 live entertainment shows every year.","The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus has announced they are phasing out their elephant acts, and will eliminate them in 2018 .

"Just 19 months ago, Nathan Matthews posed happily with his teenage stepsister Becky Watts as their parents married. His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, also smiled as she stood alongside the teenager and the delighted newlyweds. Yesterday, Matthews and Hoare stood emotionless in the dock to face charges after 16-year-old Becky’s dismembered body was discovered 80 yards from their home earlier this week. Delivery driver Matthews, 28, is accused of murdering his stepsister. Hoare, 21, is accused of ‘consistently lying to police’ in an attempt to protect her boyfriend. Scroll down for videos . A photograph from Darren and Anjie Galsworthy's 2013 wedding has emerged showing Matthews (far left) next to the couple, with Hoare (next to Mrs Galsworthy) and Becky (right) as bridesmaids . Nathan Matthews, the stepbrother of Becky Watts, was remanded in custody this morning after he appeared in court charged with the 16-year-old's murder. He is pictured in a court sketch of the short hearing . Matthews's girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, also pictured in a sketch by a court artist, appeared in a separate hearing in the same packed courtroom charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice . Their separate court appearances were a stark contrast to the wedding photograph which was taken by a family friend in August 2013, after Becky’s father Darren Galsworthy, 51, married Matthews’ mother Anjie, 49, at a church ceremony in St George, Bristol. Nearly 100 guests attended a reception at the nearby Bendix Club, Kingswood, where Becky and her stepbrother were seen laughing and joking together. Matthews, who held his and Hoare’s young daughter in the picture, was dressed in the same grey suit and cream waistcoat as his stepfather. Hoare and Becky wore matching blue bridesmaid dresses. At Bristol Magistrates’ Court yesterday, the accused were both dressed in baggy blue t-shirts as they were led into the dock handcuffed to a guard. Matthews spoke only to give his name and address during his short appearance, before being remanded to appear via video link in the city’s crown court today. Nathan Matthews (left) was remanded in custody and will appear via video link before Bristol Crown Court tomorrow. Hoare (right) was remanded in custody and will appear at the same court on April 2 . Becky, 16, was last seen at her home in the St George's area of Bristol on February 19. Body parts thought to belong to the teenager were found on Monday night after police were called to an address in Barton Hill . Minutes later, his girlfriend appeared in court, holding her arm across her stomach as she listened to the charge against her. It read: ‘Between February 18 and March 1 you did a series of acts which had the tendency to pervert the course of public justice, in that you hindered the police investigation to assist Nathan Matthews and intended for him to avoid detection for the murder of Rebecca Watts.’ District Judge Lynne Matthews remanded her to appear in court next month. A small group gathered outside screamed abuse and hit the side of the custody van as the defendants were driven away. Matthews, seen in another court sketch, was handcuffed to a female dock officer as he appeared in court . Hoare, also seen in a court sketch, wore a dark coloured short-sleeved T shirt and had shoulder-length brown hair, which appeared unwashed .

Hoare, who lives in the Barton Hill area of Bristol, was remanded in custody to appear at Bristol Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on April 2 . Mr and Mrs Galsworthy, who made televised TV appeals together after Becky went missing, were not at the hearing yesterday. Becky vanished from her home in Bristol on the morning of February 19. Police launched a huge search operation after she was reported missing the following afternoon. But on Monday night, detectives discovered her ‘cut up’ body at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol. A further four men and a woman are still being quizzed by police after being arrested on suspicion of assisting Becky’s killer following the discovery of her body. Police were yesterday granted a further 24 hours to interview them. The van believed to be carrying Nathan Matthews leaves Bristol Magistrates' Court after the short hearing . As a white custody van left the court shortly before 11am, members of the public who had been waiting outside the court banged on the sides of the vehicle and yelled abuse as it drove away .

"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker tops likely Republican voters' 2016 lists for second week in row. A handful of flubs and a flip-flop that were heavily covered by the media don't seem to have slowed down the second-term governor's momentum in the invisible presidential primary, and in a national Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday Walker came in first with 18 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, previously considered the GOP front-runner, was right behind him at 16 percent. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker addresses the American Conservative Union's 42nd Annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, last week. Walker didn't win the CPAC straw poll, but he has topped national 2016 polls for the last two weeks . Just two weeks ago it was Bush who was leading Walker by an average of two points in early primary states. But by the time the right-wing of the party made its annual pilgrimage to the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area for the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend, it was Walker who was carrying the GOP's torch. A Public Policy Polling survey released a day before the soft start of the convention found that 25 percent of the Republican party had coalesced around The Badger State's chief executive. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who earlier this week became the first Republican to launch a presidential exploratory committee, made a surprise second showing in that poll, taking 18 percent of the vote, as Bush slipped to third place. This week Bush was back on Walker's heels, though, as the Wisconsin governor took flak over comments he made about President Barack Obama's patriotism and religion, protesters in his state and illegal immigration. As pollsters for Quinnipiac began their survey, Walker was asked by the Associated Press if believes that Obama loves his country. The question was related to remarks former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani made at a New York dinner honoring Walker during which the failed presidential candidate suggested the Commander in Chief doesn't have the same level of deference to America as the rest of his countrymen. 'You should ask the president what he thinks about America,' Walker told The Associated Press when he was approached about Giuliani's comments during a Washington, D.C. meeting of the nation's governors. 'I've never asked him so I don't know.' That same weekend Walker told The Washington Post he couldn't possibly know whether Obama is a Christian or not. 'I've never asked him that,' Walker said. 'You've asked me to make statements about people that I haven't had a conversation with about that. How [could] I say if I know either of you are a Christian?' Jeb Bush shakes CPAC attendees' hands at last weekend's convention. Bush, previously considered the GOP front-runner, was right behind Walker in this week's presidential survey , taking 16 percent to Walker's 18 percent . From there, his week didn't get much better. Asked at CPAC what qualifies him to take on terrorists, Walker brought up his 2012 fight with public sector unions. Democrats in Wisconsin tried to recall him over measures, however Walker won statewide election again, with an even wider margin of victory that he did the first time. 'If I can do that with 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,' he said. The comments were interpreted by some reporters as a comparison between his home state critics an savages in the Middle East - something his political action committee told Daily Mail Online in an email that was neither fair nor true. Then, on Sunday, he walked back his position on immigration, saying he no longer believes in a pathway to citizenship for illegal residents. 'I don't believe in amnesty,' Walker told Fox News Sunday. 'My view has changed. I'm flat out saying it. Candidates can say that.' Still, other Republicans whose names were tested by Quinnipiac attracted less than half as much support as Walker did in the recent poll. Tied for third were New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with eight percent each. Carson took 7 percent of the mock vote, and a trio of senators who are expected to run - Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida - received between five and six percent of Republicans' support. Paul's showings in surveys throughout the last month haven't been as strong as some of his likely competitors', Walker and Bush included, but at CPAC it was the freshman lawmaker who claimed victory as his team showed off its organizing prowess and secured him his third straw poll win in three years. Straw poll winners rarely go on to wrap up the nomination. Paul's unique ability to turn out his supporters will prove beneficial in caucus states like Iowa, however.","A handful of flubs and a flip-flop don't seem to have slowed down the second-term governor's momentum in the invisible presidential primary .

"Autism is mainly caused by a child’s genes, a major study of British twins has found. Scientists said that, in the average boy or girl with autism, genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness. The research, by King’s College London, found the condition is highly inheritable. Controversial research linking autism with the MMR jab has been widely discredited, but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution. The team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins, who share all their DNA, and non-identical twins, who have only half their genes in common (file picture) With cases of autism much more common today than in the past, many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles. Estimates suggest that as many as one in 100 people in the UK now has autism. But the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics. The team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins, who share all their DNA, and non-identical twins, who have only half their genes in common. They found the condition was far more common in identical twins than in non-identical ones. The study, in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, concluded that rogue DNA explains between 74 and 98 per cent of the cause of the average case of autism. If genes are key, the recent rise in cases could be explained by more people being correctly diagnosed with the condition. Controversial research which linked autism with the MMR jab has now been widely discredited (file picture) Dr Francesca Happe told the BBC: ‘Our findings suggest environmental factors are smaller, which is important because some parents are concerned whether things like high pollution might be causing autism. The main consensus now is that the rise in diagnosis has more to do with increased awareness of the condition.’ Dr Judith Brown, of the National Autistic Society, said: ‘Autism is a highly complex story of genes not only interacting with other genes, but with non-genetic factors too. ‘This large population-based twin sample is significant because it helps us to understand much more about the role genetics play in autism and opens up the possibility of whole families gaining a better understanding of a condition they may share.’ But she added: ‘We are still a long way from knowing what leads to autism. ‘What people with the condition, their families and carers need most of all is access now to the right kind of support to be able to lead full lives.’ The study looked at 128 pairs of twins in which at least one sibling had an autism diagnosis, between the ages of 12 and 14. Lead researcher Beata Tick said: ‘This study shows that the genes are very important and the increased rate of autism is more down to awareness than environmental factors.’ Latest figures suggest more than one in 100 people in Britain has autism, including related conditions such as Asperger’s syndrome. This is a ten-fold increase on 30 years ago. Symptoms vary, but usually revolve around difficulty with social interaction, communication problems and a need for a strict routine. Many patients are treated with speech and behavioural therapy. Although drugs can be prescribed to control symptoms such as aggression or hyperactivity, there is no cure.","Controversial research has linked autism with MMR jab and environment .

"It is a renovator's delight. The sign, that is. Not the house. A helpful citizen has taken issue with a real estate sign riddled with errors outside a property for sale in Melbourne, Victoria. The 'For Sale' sign was first spotted by Felicity Humann in Balwyn, east of Melbourne's CBD, but the identity of the well-meaning vandal is unknown. 'My grandfather saw it during a walk around the neighbourhood and came home to tell us all we had to go and see it,' Humann told Daily Mail Australia. Armed with a red marker, the anonymous grammar fanatic clearly couldn't help themselves, adding their own corrections to the poorly-worded copy. 'A renovator's delight': An anonymous grammar fanatic took to a poorly worded 'For Sale' sign with lavish, using red pen to amend errors and leave an honest appraisal . Despite the helpful corrections, the original copy is still on the realestate.com.au website . Real estate agent Lucy Ren has her face, name and number on the sign but insists she didn't write it, nor did she see the sign before it was 'edited'. She says the buyer and seller were both 'very, very happy' 'Perfect located one of the famous street in Balwyn, school zone of Balwyn high second colloge,' the first line of the poster read jarringly. 'It is only walking minutes to shopping mall, 109 tram and the Eastern Freeway,” the listing reads. 'The house features with classical style, stable construction; offers 3 generous size bed rooms with built in wardrobes, plus study space. Two townhouse permit!' Red pen was used to remove unnecessary letters and add in crucial words to try and form a more legible sentence. The wannabe teacher gave a harsh appraisal of the real estate agents' effort, giving them a dismal grade of D+.

The house is 'perfect located one of the famous street in Balwyn, school zone of Balwyn high second colloge' The agents were also implored to take more care with their proof-reading. 'Well presented work, girls,' the wordsmith wrote, admitting that they were impressed by the use of photos and glossy finish. 'Next time, a little more care with proof-reading please.' Agent Lucy Ren has her name and face on the sign but she insists she did not write the copy. 'The buyer and the seller were both very, very happy with the sale,' Ms Ren told Daily Mail Australia. 'The red pen was only on the sign for a couple of hours. I came by at 6pm and cleaned it off. But somebody must have already taken a photo.' 'The house features with classical style, stable construction; offers 3 generous size bed rooms with built in wardrobes, plus study space. Two townhouse permit!' 'I have many, many years of experience and I am the best seller in the company. I did not write that sign. I did not see it.' The property was sold on January 20 but the house description remains on the website, without the helpful corrections provided on the sign. Felicity Humann, a 29-year-old student, says she and her grandfather were both in stitches when they saw the sign. She has a knack for grammar as she is an aspiring English teacher herself. She points out that the owner of the red pen was less thorough than she would have liked. 'It was a bit harsh because the person correcting it missed out on a whole lot of errors anyway,' she laughed. 'It's a case of pot, kettle, black!'

"She survived Graham Norton’s notorious red chair after sharing her hilarious story about going home with an Irishman who got up in the middle of the night to urinate in her shoes. But what Brittany North, from Invercargill in New Zealand, forgot to mention on The Graham Norton Show was the happy ending to her sleepover horror - she’s still dating the man three years later. ‘I absolutely regret not telling the show that we’re still together,’ Ms North told Daily Mail Australia. ‘It dawn on me when I was going home and I’m gutted – it’s definitely the first thing I’d like to clear up. I was building up the story so I could make that point but then I got all flustered.’ Scroll down for video . Appearing on The Graham Norton Show, Brittany North shared a story about the night she met her boyfriend . But her story was enough to keep the British comedian and celebrity guests Sir David Attenborough, Jessica Chastain, Gary Lineker, Harry Hill and McBusted  from pulling the chair flipping-lever. Mr Norton was already left in stitches when the 27-year-old, who is currently working as a nanny in London, opened up her story about having a few drinks with a friend at a bar called The Kiln in Invercargill. ‘I was out one night for a friend’s birthday when we ran into a couple of very cute Irish brothers,’ Ms North told the show. ‘So a few drinks later, one thing lead to another, and I actually went home with one of the brothers – the younger brother. ‘But I was rudely awoken in the middle of the night and he was standing in the corner peeing. Pictured together on the night Brittany and her boyfriend Danny Dowling met for the first time in New Zealand . ‘So I sort of woke up and went: “what are you doing, what are you doing?” He got a fright and sort of think [sic] he was half asleep – went to the toilet. All was well. 'Woke up in the morning and went OK this is where it gets awkward. Do I tell him – what do I do? Thought I'm never gonna see this guy again. So I went “do you remember peeing in the corner last night?” And he went “no, no I didn't” and was all embarrassed. ‘So went over and checked the corner and there was nothing there. It was dry. Went “oh I've dreamt it, what actually happened?” ‘Anyway he was dropping me off home, thought I'd get dressed. Went to put on my shoes and realised he'd peed in my shoes. I didn't actually tell him. I carried on home and threw the shoes out when I got home.’ The 27-year-old said she was flustered and forgot to tell Graham Norton that the man is still her boyfriend . Her boyfriend Danny gave Ms North the thumbs up to share his hilarious antic on the UK national show . Mr Norton was seen covering his mouth in disgust as he says: ‘I’m saying she should walk. That’s a good one’ as he asks his guests what Ms North should do before saying: ‘Brittany, you can walk!’ ‘I was very excited because not many people get to walk away from the chair,’ Ms North told Daily Mail Australia. ‘One of the biggest highlights was speaking in front of David Attenborough – he’s one of my heroes. ‘It’s a great story to tell about the night we met and it’s all for a laugh. I pre-warned everyone, including my family and friends that the story will appear on TV and everyone loved it. ‘My family in New Zealand are getting together for a reunion on Friday – they’ve been looking at all the stories and interviews online so they’re very excited.’ Her boyfriend Danny Dowling, who is currently living in Ireland, gave Ms North the thumbs up to go ahead and share his hilarious antics on the night of their first encounter. ‘He sees the funny side of it and we didn’t realise it was going to get this big,’ Ms North said. 'I didn't tell Danny about the incident until six months into our relationship. ‘Danny’s family owns a pub in Ireland and on Friday night, they had a band playing but when my story was screened, they got the band to stop so they could watch my two minutes of fame on all three TVs at the pub.’ Ms North didn't bring up the incident until six months into their relationship . Brittany North will appear on the Graham Norton Show on Friday in New Zealand at 8.30pm on TV3 . Despite her boyfriend's hilarious antic taking off on a light note, Ms North added that some were disappointed with Mr Norton’s comment when he suggested that she was ‘not paying any tax’. ‘I couldn’t hear what he was saying at the time because I was focussing on talking to the celebrities but I did wonder what they were laughing at,’ Ms North told Daily Mail Australia. ‘It wasn’t until I watched the segment with my boss that I'd realised what he'd said. She loved my story and she was disappointed by his comment. ‘I definitely pay my taxes.’ The red chair segment sees an audience member sit in the iconic chair and tell a humorous anecdote - only to be flipped backwards if they fail to tell a compelling story on the show.

"A two-year-old boy has left his mother in a bind after getting his toy cordless drill stuck in her hair when he attempted to 'blow dry' it. Fiona Pantazis, from Baulkham Hills in Sydney's north-west, was getting ready to head out with her two-year-old son Eli when he began to use his toy tools to help brush her hair. 'He began using his plastic saw to comb my hair and it was almost like a massage, and then I felt something move against my head and I just felt this heavy weight attached to my hair and pulling it down,' Mrs Pantazis told Daily Mail Australia.

Mrs Pantazis, 28, is heavily pregnant with identical twin girls, and said that she couldn't even run after Eli to tell him off. 'He's just turned two and keeps me on my toes. Handful is not even the word for it. He sees my blow-dry my hair every day and must have wanted to give it a go,' she said.

"A Kenyan man who was sentenced to death after he confessed to helping kidnap a British tourist is challenging Scotland Yard over their use of his personal information. Judith Tebbutt was taken from her luxury Kenyan lodge in 2011 and held hostage for six months by armed pirates who also killed her husband. Ali Babitu Kololo was found guilty of robbery with violence in August 2013. He is the only person to be convicted so far. But due to data laws judges could soon compel Scotland Yard to disclose key documents that could lead to his conviction being overturned. Ali Babitu Kololo (left) was sentenced to death after he confessed to helping kidnap British tourist Judith Tebbutt (right). He is now challenging Scotland Yard over their use of his information . The decision will be made amid allegations British authorities 'acted unlawfully'. Under the Overseas Justice and Security Act the UK, which helped the public prosecution in the case, is required to seek assurance that the death penalty will not be sought. The 35-year-old also claims he was tortured by local police and forced to confess, which similarly goes against UK laws. The father-of-two now wants to know what information Scotland Yard held on him, which Kenyan authorities it shared the information with and what it plans on doing with it in the future. Scotland Yard has so far refused to allow Kololo to see any of the information, which he believes will help him in his appeal. Human rights charity Reprieve, which is supporting Kololo, said: 'The Metropolitan Police helped secure the conviction of a man who was tortured in a mandatory death penalty case, in clear violation of UK policy. Kololo (centre) was found guilty of robbery with violence in 2013 - but the 35-year-old claims he was tortured by local police and forced to confess . The father-of-two, pictured in a Kenyan court, is hoping the personal information they hold on him will help with his appeal. Human rights charity Reprieve said he did not have a fair trial . 'Mr Kololo has a right to know what information the Met has on him and how they plan to use it. 'He has already suffered grave injustices thanks in large part to the actions of the Met. 'Scotland Yard must comply with British law and come clean about the information they hold on Mr Kololo.' Kololo was arrested hours after the attack on Ms Tebbutt and her husband in September 2011. Kenyan police believed that he deliberately led five Somali gunmen to the property although he said he was ordered at gunpoint to show the way to the hotel. Ms Tebbutt (second from left) was dramatically released after a ransom payment, reportedly around £600,000, ended her six-month ordeal . But Ms Tebbutt told the court that her captors had told her the sixth gang member had been arrested. The 60-year-old tourist, from Bishop's Stortford, was dramatically released after a ransom payment, reportedly around £600,000, ended her six-month ordeal. She said at the time of her release: 'I am of course hugely relieved to at last be free, and overjoyed to be reunited with my son Ollie. 'This however is a time when my joy at being safe again is overwhelmed by my immense grief, shared by Ollie and the wider family, following David's passing in September last year.' Kenyan police believed that Kololo deliberately led five Somali gunmen to the property (above) - but he said he was ordered at gunpoint to show the way to the hotel . Reprieve argued that Kololo, who had no lawyer or interpreter, did not receive a fair trial. They also said he was also forced to cross-examine witnesses on his own. London law firm Leigh Day is representing Kololo. It said: 'The Metropolitan Police has refused to provide our client with access to the data it holds about him, which may well contain material that shows his conviction is not safe and that his death sentence should be overturned.' Metropolitan Police said they do not comment on ongoing cases. The High Court is expected to rule in the case tomorrow.","Judith Tebbutt was kidnapped and her husband David murdered in 2011 .

"Jordan Wills works as a paintball target, with colleagues firing paintballs at him at close range . When student Jordan Wills goes to work he must prepared to pelted by bullets, fired at him at close range and at speeds of almost 40mph. The 19-year-old from London works as a human bullet impact tester, or more simply a paintball target, and every week faces the pellets being fired at his torso to test how hard they are on impact or how large a welt they leave. He beat more than 10,000 other applicants from around the world to land the £16,000 a year job as a tester and fits in being used for target practice around his university studies. 'I guess I have a high pain tolerance - but it's really not as painful as people think,' said the Kingston University Computer Graphics student. 'The hardest part is the anticipation when you know it's coming. 'The most times I'd be shot at during a shift is ten over a course of an hour or two.' And while most people playing paintball will wear some form of protective clothing, Mr Wills does his job in just a t-shirt. He is a fan of the game anyway, and has previously played a lot in his spare time. He works 16 hours a week at different UK Paintball sites across the country on a pro-rata salary of £40,000, which works out at a wage of around £16,000 a year. Mr Wills, who stays in shape as a rower, said despite the welts and the occasional pain he loves his job. He added: 'When people find out what I do they think I'm crazy - but I love my job. 'The initial pain lasts for about five seconds, then it stings for maybe ten seconds - and then it's gone. I don't even remember I've been shot.' The teenager wears protective goggles to cover his eyes - but trusts his well-trained colleagues to steer clear of other vulnerable body parts and stop when he tells them to. The paintballs are fired at Jordan's torso at close range - between 25 and 30 feet by a professional shooter at a speed of almost 40mph. Rather than take the usual approach of fleeing the oncoming paintballs, Mr Wills must stand still while players take aim at him. He reports back on the impact of the paintballs so that manufacturers can ensure new batches are not too hard.  Anything that draws blood, leaves too serious a mark or does not explode on impact is unacceptable. Mr Wills was selected for the role out of 10,000 other applicants because of his knowledge of paintball . The 19-year-old often suffers welts on his body from the impact which take three or four days to disappear . The practice leaves him with welts over his body, but the student said he barely notices. 'Sometimes I take a hot bath after a shift, but mostly I just forget they're even there,' he added. 'At first my girlfriend didn't like it, but now she's cool with it. The marks take about four days to fade. 'I think I got the job because I knew about paintballing already. I worked for three years marshalling games - so I was well aware of what it felt like to be hit. 'I love paintballing and knew about the different types of paints and the ins and outs of the guns. 'People tell me I must be an idiot but it's only people who don't know enough about paintball. When you're in the middle of a game you're running around and having so much fun you hardly notice when you're hit. The teenager does his job wearing just a t-shirt, and endures balls being fired at him at very close range . As part of the role Mr Wills must stand still and resist the urge, as happens in actual games, to run away . 'I work two days a week and my hours are flexible. 'I have great colleagues and get to work outside and have a bit of fun. What's not to like?' Justin Toohig, UK Paintball owner and the student's boss, said: 'Jordan's a great guy. He's up for a laugh, has a fantastic attitude and fits in well with the crew - that's mainly what we were looking for. 'He can take the bullets like a man and doesn't whinge at all. He's athletic and knew about paintball. 'We still can't believe how many applicants we got. Emails were coming in from all over the world - new ones were popping up faster than we could file them. 'Maybe it's a sign of the economy, or simply because people love paintball. Mr Wells insists he doesn't really feel pain from the impact of paintballs being fired at him at close range . Mr Wills said he does not mind being hit or the resulting welts and thinks he has a high threshold for pain . 'In the end we interviewed 18 guys and Jordan got the job. 'We're very careful and would never put Jordan at risk. 'Safety is extremely important to us - that's why we needed a tester in the first place. What Jordan is doing is the extreme. It's done in a controlled environment and we're testing for worst-case scenario. 'We'd never recommend for anyone to emulate it on the playing field or at home.' When the job was advertised last year Mr Toohig was quoted as saying: 'We want to hear from people with a high pain threshold and those to whom fear is a foreign concept.'","Jordan Wills, 19, is a student and works as a paintball target every week .

"Gemma Leung was told to cover up if she insisted breastfeeding her eight month old daughter on an easyJet flight to avoid offending other passengers . A mother was ordered to cover herself up when she tried to breastfeed her daughter on an easyJet flight because  it might 'upset' other passengers. Mother-of-two Gemma Leung was preparing to feed eight-month-old Ruby-Bow as she flew from Spain to Gatwick to return home to Fareham in Hampshire, when she was told it was best she did not continue. The 27-year-old was then told if she insisted on breastfeeding she should put a blanket over herself so she didn't offend anyone. Mrs Leung, who was flying back to the UK from Spain after a business trip with her mother, said another member of staff later apologised to her. But she felt too embarrassed and upset to continue breastfeeding her daughter and was forced to leave her agitated and unhappy during the hourney. I couldn't believe what I was hearing,' said Mrs Leung. 'It ruined the whole trip for me and my mum. It's just not right.' Mrs Leung and her mother, Sasha Mueller, were on a flight from Valencia to Gatwick on Wednesday morning when she was asked by a male member of cabin crew to cover up if she fed her daughter. Mrs Leung said: 'We were just about to take off so I thought to calm her down I would feed her. 'Then he approached me and said he would rather I didn't do that on the flight as it might offend other passengers. 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Then he said that if I did breastfeed could I put a blanket over my baby. 'The air hostess came over afterwards and asked if I was okay. When I told her what happened her face dropped and she went and confronted him.' Mrs Leung said the male employee returned to speak to her again, but instead of apologising made the situation worse. Mrs Leung tried to feed her eight-month-old daughter Ruby-Bow when she became distressed on a flight . 'He came back and said 'it's a bit of a tricky situation and we need to consider other passengers and how they feel',' said Mrs Leung. 'No-one had complained about me feeding and there were quite a few babies on board. I was wearing a shirt, you couldn't see anything. 'It was so embarrassing for me. I didn't carry on breastfeeding after that so she was an unhappy baby for the flight and I got a few people looking at me because of that.' Mrs Leung's mother said  she was angered by the comments. 'I was so shocked because we have used easyJet for years and never had a problem,' she said. 'I couldn't speak I was so angry. I was just shell-shocked that this had happened in the 21st century.' Mrs Leung, who is currently on maternity leave, submitted a complaint to easyJet when she returned from holiday and was told she would have to wait 28 days for a response. Gemma Leung flew with her eight month old daughter (pictured right and left) and her three-year-old (left) An easyJet spokesman said the incident was being investigated. The spokesman said: 'easyJet is a family friendly airline and our policy is that that passengers can breastfeed at any time during the flight including during take-off and landing and we do not require mothers to cover themselves. 'We are sorry that Mrs Leung was advised to cover up when breastfeeding onboard by one of our crew members on her flight from Valencia to London Gatwick on March 4. 'The crew member was immediately corrected by another member of crew who apologised to Mrs Leung. 'This does not reflect easyJet's policy on breastfeeding. We try to ensure we always consider the needs of families travelling onboard easyJet. 'We are now investigating with the staff involved and ensure that cabin crew are clear on our policy in relation to breastfeeding.' In February Ellie Hiscox went to Dough Pizza Kitchen, in Manchester's Northern Quarter, to celebrate her birthday. She deliberately booked a table there because she had had no problem breastfeeding there before, only to be told she must cover up if she wanted to continue feeding her three-month-old daughter. Last year Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told she would not be allowed to breastfeed her daughter at Middleton Pool because of the site's food and drink regulations. In January new mothers invited to a summit on breast feeding at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium were told it was not appropriate to bring their children because the venue was 'not designed to accommodate breastfeeding.' Louise Burns was asked to place a large napkin over her baby's head while she breastfed in Claridge's in London in December last year. The incident led to a protest outside the exclusive hotel, with 40 mothers holding a mass nursing protest. In 2014 Rhea Holley was branded a 'slut' by a couple in their 60s when she tried to breastfeed her baby at a Costa coffee in Purley in London. Heather Vaughan, 29, said she was left in tears after a male staff member at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth ordered her to stop breastfeeding in its creche, saying: ‘We don’t do that here' last March. The same month, Emily Slough was branded a ‘tramp’ by internet trolls after somebody took a photograph of her breastfeeding in public in Rugeley, Staffordshire. Elsewhere, nurses stopped Gemma Murphy, 37, from feeding her infant daughter in a waiting room at St Cross Hospital in Rugby.

"Gwyneth Paltrow and Victoria Beckham swear by them: apparently, an Epsom salts bath before a night out is a great way to ease bloating. And they’ve also been shown to improve blood circulation, reduce blood clots and lower blood pressure. Clearly, there’s more to these fizzy little tablets of magnesium sulfate — traditionally used to aid digestion — than we thought. Here, we reveal some other uses. ADD BOUNCE TO YOUR HAIR . Add Epsom salts to your regular conditioner and heat over warm water and then rub into your hair and leave for 15 minutes (picture posed by model) If you want more volume in your hair, mix equal amounts of Epsom salts with your regular conditioner in a bowl and place over a saucepan of water to warm. Stir with a wooden spoon until the salt dissolves, rub into your hair and leave on for 15 minutes, then wash out. The alkaline salts will break down grease and product build-up, leaving you with extra bounce and shine. TOP UP YOUR TAN . Rub Epsom salts all over your body before applying self-tan cream to exfoliate your skin (picture posed by model) This is ideal if you are about to apply self-tan cream. When you step out of the shower or bath, take a few handfuls of Epsom salts and rub all over your body with a plastic loofah. The granules are bigger than those in sugar or table salt and perfect for exfoliation. Make sure you scrub behind your knees, ankles and elbows. Wash off with warm water before applying your tanning lotion — it should be flawless. FIRST AID HELP . Mixing Epsom salts with warm water and soaking a splinter in the solution can help draw the splinter towards the surface of the skin, making it easier to remove . If you have a splinter in your finger, mix two teaspoons of Epsom salts into a warm cup of water until it dissolves and place your hand in the water for five minutes. The minerals in the salt will draw the splinter to the surface of the skin, making it possible to pull out painlessly with tweezers. BANISH BRUISES . Need to get rid of an unsightly and painful bruise? Add two cups of Epsom salts to warm water in your bath and soak in it for at least 15 minutes (picture posed by model) Add two cups of Epsom salts to running warm water in your bath and swish it around until it has dissolved fully. Stay in the bath for at least 15 minutes to allow the magnesium in the salt to soak into your pores. This will help relax your muscles, banishing any aches and pains and reducing any bruising or swelling. TREAT SPOTS . Mix Epsom salts with your regular facial cleanser to help draw out impurities like blackheads and spots (picture posed by model) Mix a good slug of Epsom salts with your regular cleanser in a small bowl until it looks like a paste. Smooth the mixture over your face, rubbing in a little more deeply than you normally would. The minerals in the salts will help draw out impurities such as blackheads or spots, while the exfoliation will buff up your skin beautifully. Remove with cotton wool or water before applying your usual moisturiser. For deeper spots, add a few drops of water to a good dose of salts and dab directly on to any blemishes. Leave on overnight and rinse off in the morning. CURE HEADACHES . Mix Epsom salts with a glass of warm water and drink to ease headaches and migraines (picture posed by model) Headaches and migraines can be caused by a lack of magnesium in your system. At the first sign of a headache, take a big pinch of Epsom salts in the palm of one hand and have a glass of warm water in the other hand. Toss the salts into the glass of water and mix thoroughly. Drink as quickly as possible (it doesn’t taste great) and close your eyes for a few minutes to give the salts time to work. SLEEP BETTER . Take long, warm bath with three cups of Epsom salts dissolved in the water for a good night's sleep (picture posed by model) If you’ve been struggling to get a good night’s sleep, pour three cups of Epsom salts into a warm bath and soak for as long as you can. The magnesium will help reduce stress and anxiety and act as a sedative. Repeat every night until you settle yourself into a new sleeping pattern.","Gwyneth Paltrow and Victoria Beckham swear by them .

But how should you be using Epsom salt to get the best results?"
"A new international study has revealed that intelligent girls 'choke' because of the pressure they put themselves under in employment leading to them ending up in lower paid jobs. The Organisation for the Economic Co-operation Development (OECD) report on gender equality in education has said that girls do not aim for high-paying jobs in maths and science, because they lack confidence. Young girls 'may be choking under pressure' the report said. A new study revealed girls do not aim for high-paying jobs in maths and science, because they lack confidence . Reviewing the report The Australian reported that high-achieving girls are more likely to suffer from high levels of anxiety than high-achieving boys. 'Given girls' keen desire to succeed in school and to please others, their fear of negative evaluations, and their lower self confidence in mathematics and science, it is hardly surprising high-achieving girls choke under often self-imposed pressure,' the OECD report said. The OECD report said that just three per cent of Australian teenage girls contemplate a career in engineer or computing, compared to 17 per cent of boys. Intelligent girls 'choke' because of the pressure they put themselves under, says the report . The report is based on the OECD Program for International Student Assessment, which tests 400,000 students from more than 65 education systems worldwide. 'Women are predominantly employed in fields where they have fewer opportunities to express their potential, and develop and maintain their skills - at the price of lower wages and slower career paths,' the report said. High-achieving girls are more likely to suffer from high levels of anxiety than high-achieving boys . The report said that girls tend to hold particularly ambitious, but unrealistic, expectations. 'They may thus be particularly disappointed when they fail to achieve their career goals,' the report said.","OECD report highlights girls lack of confidence in employment field .

"ABC Family drama The Fosters has made history after featuring the youngest ever same-sex kiss on U.S. television. Characters Jude and Connor, both 13, locked lips after some awkward flirting and playful wrestling during Monday night's episode. The Fosters, which has a reputation as a progressive show, follows the lives of an interracial lesbian couple and their blended family of biological, adopted and foster children. Scroll down for video . ABC Family drama The Fosters has made history after featuring the youngest ever same-sex kiss on U.S. television . Characters Jude and Connor, both 13, locked lips after some awkward flirting and playful wrestling during Monday night's episode . 'Anyone else remember the exquisite torture of falling for someone and not knowing how they felt? My life in jr. high.,' tweeted the show's creator, Peter Paige, who previously starred in Queer as Folk. Jude and Connor's friendship has been building over the past two seasons and in a previous episode the boys had held hands at the movies and even kissed, although not on screen. The boy's big moment isn't the first same-sex kiss between teenagers on TV, but it is the youngest as shows including Glee and Teen Wolf featured older teens, reports The Daily Beast. The show, which premiered in 2013, is known for pushing the envelope and has been heavily criticized for it by right leaning organizations such as One Million Moms which had called for the show to be boycotted even before it aired. The group, which has routinely advocated against the depiction of same-sex couples in the media, stated: 'While foster care and adoption is a wonderful thing and the Bible does teach us to help orphans, this program is attempting to redefine marriage and family by having two moms raise these children together.

The show's creator, Peter Paige, who previously starred in Queer as Folk, tweeted his excitement at the scene immediately after it was broadcast . In response, ABC Family President Michael Riley had responded that The Fosters merged perfectly with the network's 'groundbreaking storytelling and iconic characters' and will feature 'the same depth, heart, close relationships and authenticity that our viewers have come to expect'. Co-executive producer Jennifer Lopez has previously described the show as portraying 'a new kind of family' and believes it is reflective of the world today. 'Family has tuned into something else,' said Lopez. 'Family equals love.' The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation group has also praised the show and it received an award for Outstanding Drama Series at the 2014 GLAAD Awards.","The show made history on Monday night with the youngest ever same-sex kiss on U.S. television .

"Her older sister Kendall Jenner is now one of the biggest models in the world, but it looks like younger sibling Kylie is keen to follow in her footsteps. The 17-year-old has now landed herself a shoot in the highly acclaimed fashion bible Carine Roitfeld's Fashion Book. And it has been seen as the the latest move by the youngest of the Kardashian clan to stake her claim in in the world of high fashion. Scroll down for video . Kylie Jenner has been featured in Carine Roitfeld's Fashion Book, this is her latest foray into the fashion world after she starred in Kanye West's Adidas show in February . In the shoot, the caption below the image of Kylie says: 'She's a free spirit and her beauty vibrates with the energy of LA. I'm excited to see where she takes it.' But this isn't the teenager's first foray into the style scene. When Kanye West, who is married to her older sister Kim, recently debuted his first collection with sports brand Adidas, it was Kylie who he asked to star in his show in New York. And standing among his gaggle of models she looked every bit the part. Her normally made up look gone, she wore little make-up showing off her striking features. When Kanye West showed his collection with Adidas in New York in February it was Kylie he picked to model for him and not her older sister Kendall . Indeed, much was made of the fact that Kanye had choosen Kylie to model rather than the more successful Kendall who instead sitting front row with their mother Kris Jenner. Kylie also recently landed the cover of Fault magazine, she posed in an Alexander Wang crop top with her hair pulled to the side in a fishtail plait. More experimental than her sisters in Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kylie regularly posts pictures of herself trying out different make-up and hairstyles on her Instagram account. Kylie landed the cover of Fault magazines 20th Issue, she rocked a series of different looks for the brand . In this image which was used for Fault magazine Kylie is seen wearing a crop top designed by Alexander Wang . Alexander Wang x H&M bralet . Sold out but click to check out the T by Alexander Wang collection . Visit site . Her older sister Kim may have 'broken the internet' posing nude for Paper Magazine, but Kylie Jenner has made sure her front cover is all about style. Rocking a cool lace beanie, a shed load of Cartier bracelets (that ring in at a cool £5000 each) and a statement chunky necklace, she looks incredibly fashion-forward. But it's the bralet that steals the show! It's from the Alexander Wang x H&M collaboration and we love its sporty aesthetic which was a running theme throughout the whole line. Predictably it sold out within hours, so unfortunately you'll need to head to eBay if you want to bag any of it now. Instead why not take a look at the T by Alexander Wang collection (right)? It's cheaper than his main line but still has the sporty, urban vibe.

Of course, it is Kendall though who has been the darling of the fashion world for well over a year now. She's walked in high-profile shows such as Chanel, Oscar De La Renta and Balmain. She counts fellow models Cara Delevingne and Gigi Hadid among her best friends and has landed campaigns for Givenchy and Marc Jacobs. In January she landed some of her highest praise yet when Chanel and Fendi head honcho and all round fashion impresario Karl Lagerfeld called her, 'the girl of the moment'. Kendall has often been used in Chanel shows, here she wore its Haute Couture fashion collection in Paris . 19-year-old Kendall is a regular on the runway, in February she modelled for Oscar De La Renta in New York (left) and in September she walked for Givenchy in Paris . So it is undoubted that Kylie has a long way to go before she can reach the dizzying heights of her sister's career. But if she's anything like her siblings, then she'll almost certainly have the determination to succeed. And there is nothing to stop the two of them working together. Indeed, the pair have already collaborated on several lines for PacSun and in February it was confirmed they will be following in Kate Moss's footsteps and creating a capsule collection for Topshop. It is also rumoured that the youngest two of the Kardashian family are in talks to do a spin-off show - just like Kourtney And Kim Take New York.

"Charged: Ryan Quinton, 27 (pictured) pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide in the death of his new bride on December 30, 2013 . A drunk driver who killed his new bride as they left their wedding reception has pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide. Ryan Patrick Quinton, 29, was charged with DUI, first degree vehicular homicide, laying drag, reckless driving, and a failure to maintain his lane over the December 29, 2013 crash which claimed the life of 25-year-old Kali Shay Dobson. He was sentenced to 15 years, but only two to three months of that sentence will be behind bars, with the rest of his sentence on probation. He will also lose his license for five years. Quinton also pleaded guilty to another incident of drunk driving in May 2014, just months after the crash. Quinton had a blood-alcohol level of 0.114, well above the legal limit in Georgia of 0.08 for over 21s, when he lost control of the Pontiac Firebird and careened down an embankment on Highway 5 near Old Canton Rd in Georgia. Dobson, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was ejected from the car which landed on top of her. She died at the scene. Just last week Dobson's family came out in support of Quinton, saying he was like their own child. 'He is my son and a brother to my daughters now and an uncle to my grandbabies. We support him in any way we possibly can,' Dobson's grieving mother, Linda Jordan, told The Marietta Daily Journal. 'We can’t stand to see something happen to him. We’re behind him. Whatever it takes, we’re right there for him.' Jordan said the family had already suffered enough and would struggle to cope with a lengthy court case. 'We shouldn’t have to endure all this, too,' Jordan said. Heartbroken: Linda Jordan (right), the grieving mother of Kali Dobson (left), said she will always back Dobson's groom, Ryan Quinton . Heartbreaking: Kali Dobson is pictured on her wedding day in Georgia - just hours before she was killed . Devastated: Ryan suffered minor injuries in the crash and underwent treatment in hospital . After the horrific crash, Quinton ran to the road where, with his clothes torn and covered in blood, he flagged down help. Chris Thomas told Channel 2 that he was driving along Ball Ground Highway when he spotted Quinton wearing a shredded tuxedo and stumbling along the road. 'His shirt was all torn up and he was . bleeding,' he said. 'He had blood all over his face and blood coming out . of his hands and stuff and just looked bad. And it scared me to death.' He comforted the sobbing man as they waited for emergency responders. He held the Quinton's hands and they prayed together. 'There . was nothing that could be done,' Thomas said after returning to the . crash site. 'The car was on top of her. You couldn't even see her.'

'What . should have been the greatest, most beautiful day of their lives is the . end of one and what could very well be something hard for this young . man to get over. I pray that he will.' Happier times: A Facebook image shows Dobson's engagement ring . Friends and relatives expressed their heartbreak on Facebook pages and shared photos of the couples grinning and dancing at the reception just hours before the tragedy. The wedding photographers, Still Pearl Photography, also shared stunning images of the beautiful bride before her vows and dancing happily with her new husband afterwards. Patsy Jordan, a Cherokee School Board member, who once worked with Dobson’s mother, told the Marietta Daily Journal that the community was stunned by the tragedy. 'It’s traumatic,' Jordan said. 'Just to think she just got married and started on her beautiful journey of life and it just ended so suddenly. It was just hard to wrap my brain around something like that.' Jordan said she Dobson, who had sisters and was close to her new sister-in-law, had a beautiful singing voice.

"A police department employee will be fired and two suspended after being identified by a Justice Department report as sending racist emails, the mayor of Ferguson told reporters. Mayor James Knowles made the announcement Wednesday after Attorney General Eric Holder said the report showed police created a 'highly toxic environment' in Ferguson. 'Let me be clear, this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the Ferguson Police Department or in any department in the city of Ferguson,' Knowles said at the conference. Scroll down for video . Not tolerated: Ferguson Mayor James Knowles announced the firing of one police department employee identified among those who sent racist emails . Seven emails included in the report showed police and court officials making racist jokes, including one that said Obama wouldn't remain president long, remarking 'what black man holds a steady job for four years.' The mayor did not take any questions at the presser, and though Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson had been expected to attend, no explanation was given for his absence. The Justice Department investigation into Ferguson police began in August after the shooting of unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown by a white officer sparked national protests. Analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed African-Americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, an unnamed department official said. The Department of Justice report also found that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were black. According to figures recorded between 2012 and 2014, blacks were also twice as likely to be searched than whites during traffic stops, though contraband showed up more during searches of white drivers. A Justice Department investigation has found patterns of racial bias in the Ferguson police department and at the municipal jail and court. The full report will be publicly released March 4 . Justice Department staff interviewed hundreds of average citizens as part of the six-month probe, concluding that a large portion of Ferguson's population mistrusts the local police force and considers it illegitimate . Report will show that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were African-American . Holder also said that charges for minor violations such as 'manner of walking in roadway' disproportionately affected black residents and were used 'not as a public service, but as a tool for raising revenue.' Nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of African Americans in Ferguson, New York and Cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what President Barack Obama called 'simmering distrust' between police and communities. Black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops, compared to their white counterparts. Justice Department officials found from 2012 to 2014 that black motorists in Ferguson, Missouri, were more than twice as likely as whites to be searched in traffic stops, even though they were 26 per cent less likely to be found carrying contraband. African-Americans were 68 per cent less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by a municipal court judge. And from April to September of last year, 95 per cent of people kept at the city jail for more than two days were black, the six-month inquiry found. Of the cases in which the police department documented the use of force, 88 per cent involved blacks, and victims of the 14 dog bites recorded by the department all were black. Overall, African Americans make up 67 per cent of the population of Ferguson, about 10 miles north of downtown St. Louis. The Justice Department plans to use the findings to negotiate policy changes with Ferguson officials and enter a consent decree, or to sue the city to force change. Previous federal investigations into police departments have resulted in such changes as reporting arrest data to the Justice Department and installing federal monitors to oversee operations. The report's findings vindicate critics who have cited a pattern of abuse in Ferguson. But they are unlikely to restore full trust in the Ferguson police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict Brown's killer, officer Darren Wilson. After a separate investigation, the Justice Department decided not to pursue federal charges against Darren Wilson, who has said he acted in self-defense. Civil rights attorney Jerryl Christmas, who has represented people who have clashed with Ferguson police and city officials, said he was not surprised by the findings, and he hopes to see Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson fired. 'We already knew all this was going on. The problem is nobody is being prosecuted, nobody has been terminated,' Christmas said. Jackson did not respond to a request for comment. Among the emails was one sent sent by a Ferguson police or municipal court official in 2008 that said Obama would not stay in office long because, 'What black man holds a steady job for four years?' Another electronic missive, written in 2011, included an offensive joke: 'An African-American woman in New Orleans was admitted into the the hospital for a pregnancy termination. Two weeks later she received a check for $5,000. She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from. The hospital said, ""Crimestoppers.""' Ferguson Committeewoman Patricia Bynes said she was outraged by that and other racially tinged emails found in the investigation. Biased: The investigation found Ferguson officers  too often charged blacks with petty offenses . 'The fact that police officers and municipal court officials are using their public emails to tell racial jokes, that just reeks of arrogance and ignorance,' said Bynes. 'It's astounding. They think they are untouchable. The taxpayers have been paying for that racial bias.' A separate report to be issued soon is expected to clear Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson of federal civil rights charges in the Brown killing . The official said that in Ferguson's court system, African-Americans were less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and made up 95 percent of people held longer than two days in the Ferguson jail. The Ferguson Municipal Court issued the majority of its warrants for minor violations such as parking, traffic and housing code violations. The physical tussle that led to Brown's death began after Wilson told him and a friend to move from the street to the sidewalk. Ben Crump, the attorney for the Brown family, said that if the reports about the findings are true, they 'confirm what Michael Brown's family has believed all along.' 'That is that the tragic killing of an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager was part of a systemic pattern of inappropriate policing of African-American citizens in the Ferguson community.' Since 2010, according to the federal agency, Ferguson courts have raked in more than $442,000 in fines for failure to appear, which amounted to a quarter of the court's annual revenue, reported the St Louis Post Dispatch. The onerous 'failure to appear' charge, which disproportionately affected those living close to and below the poverty line, was dropped by the city in September. Mayor James Knowles made statements earlier expressing dissatisfaction with the Justice Department investigation, according to USA Today. 'I'm not comfortable that Eric Holder announced that there would be wholesale changes before he started collecting any evidence,' Knowles said. 'If the DOJ has some serious findings, I hope they will provide that to us.' John Gaskin III, a St. Louis community activist, praised the findings, saying 'Ferguson police have to see the light in how they deal with people of color. 'It's quite evident that change is coming down the pike. This is encouraging,' he said. 'It's so unfortunate that Michael Brown had to be killed. But in spite of that, I feel justice is coming.'","Ferguson mayor James Knowles announced the termination at a press conference Wednesday .

As the day wore on and the pain did not go away, Amanda, from Rutherford in New South Wales, texted her sister - Rachael - who told her to go to the sick bay. When Rachael, 27, visited her later in the day, she became concerned when Amanda complained there was 'something in my head' and she needed to get it out. The 27-year-old told that's life! Amanda's forehead did look swollen so she took her to hospital, where doctors did some tests and found nothing wrong with her. They sent the sisters back home with painkillers for Amanda - who is a mine truck driver - to take. But her condition did not improve. The 28-year-old spent the next two days in an agitated state, with her boyfriend - Nathan - reporting she could not sleep. On Christmas Day, Rachael told Daily Mail Australia her father had left messages to say her sister had been re-admitted to hospital. It took specialists weeks to diagnose Amanda's condition, which caused her to experience mood swings . Amanda before the tumour took over her body and drove her to take up a knife and stab herself in the head to relieve the pressure of her headache . Frantically, she rushed to be at her sister's bedside but nothing prepared her for what she would see when she walked into Amanda's room. 'She had blood on top of her head, she was strapped to the bed and rocking back forth while they were trying to do the lumbar puncture,' Rachael said. The condition mostly affects young women who end up in being misdiagnosed and are admitted into psychiatric care or display behaviour so erratic they are kept in intensive care, according to the ABC. The tumour found on the ovary is named a teratoma, which could possibly have teeth, hair or brain tissue. This tricks the body's immune system into attacking the brain. Her father told Rachael that Amanda had tried to stab herself in the head with a knife. 'She was so distraught about the pressure on her head that she had tried sucking it out with a vacuum prior to doing it with a knife,' Rachael told Daily Mail Australia. The situation had escalated so much that the police had to be called to calm Amanda down before she was taken to hospital. When the tests from the lumbar puncture came back, doctors diagnosed her with encephalitis. Encephalitis happens when the brain becomes swollen and inflamed from a virus. But after days of treatment it was clear Amanda was not responding, falling into a psychosis where she did eat or sleep. Surgeons found an 8cm tumour on Amanda's right ovary, which had hair and teeth inside it . Amanda and partner Nathan who stayed with her throughout the ordeal in hospital . One time Rachael fed her sister water and she spat it out at her. Amanda would also throw abuse at her loved ones and hospital staff. Things got so bad that Amanda was transferred to the psychiatric ward at Sydney's Mater Hospital where she could be supervised by a nurse 24 hours a day. Her behaviour became increasingly worse, to the point where she was yelling and being aggressive towards Rachael and staff, but in the next moment she was staring into space. Before her illness, Rachael described her sister as 'very outgoing'. 'She was always the one to have a comeback. She was very cheeky,' Rachael told Daily Mail Australia. '[She] was a completely different [person], it wasn't her at all.' For weeks, Amanda's condition had specialists puzzled but finally they got their answer. After performing an ultrasound on her abdomen, doctors found a benign tumour on her right ovary containing brain matter, which was causing the immune system to attack her brain. One nurse likened it to 'a monster growing inside' of Amanda. Her condition, ovarian teratoma encephalitis, is believed to only affect one in seven people. Surgeons removed the 8cm tumour on her ovary, but there was another surprise inside it - hair and teeth. But it was a long road to recovery for the truck driver who spent another two months in hospital and went through a brain-injury rehabilitation clinic. Amanda told Daily Mail Australia she had no memory of the weeks she was affected by her tumour. 'I don't remember anything from first week of hospital to nearly the February after that,' she said. 'I don’t remember waking up until mid-February. That was when I was able to think on my own.' Despite the months that have passed, Rachael thinks her sister is still not back to the Amanda she knew. 'She's not Amanda she was prior to getting sick. She's not 100 per cent I don't think.'

"Anthony DeNicola died after suffering an apparent heart attack while locked in a McDonald's restroom . A widow is suing McDonald's after her husband suffered a fatal heart attack in the restroom - and no-one was able to help him because the door was 'dead-bolted from the inside'. Anthony DeNicola died after suffering an apparent heart attack in June 2013 at the fast food restaurant in Brooklyn, New York. In a $10million lawsuit filed by Anna DeNicola in Brooklyn Supreme Court last week, it is alleged that medical assistance to save Mr DeNicola was delayed because the one-stall restroom was shut with a slide lock. The 67-year-old grandfather, a part-time truck driver, had been meeting friends at the 86th Street branch for breakfast near his home in Bensonhurst before a fishing trip. He went to use the restroom, but when he had not returned several minutes later, his friends went to check on him. They received no answer when they knocked on the door. Emergency services were called, but it took firefighters around 15 minutes to open the door - and Mr DeNicola had already died. His son Anthony DeNicola Jr. said employees 'told them there's no way to get in, there's nothing they can do'. The 38-year-old told The New York Post: 'If somebody could have opened the door, they could have started CPR on him until emergency workers got there. 'What if somebody had been able to open that door? He'd still be here.' He added his late father had been planning a surprise retirement party for his wife, but instead, his funeral was held on that day. The family's lawyer, Stephen Spinelli, said there was no way to open the door to the restroom from the outside and employees at the restaurant were not helpful. He added the restaurant has 'a duty to offer their customers a safe environment'. The 67-year-old had been meeting friends at the 86th Street branch (pictured) near Bensonhurst, Brooklyn . McDonald's Franchisee Paul Hendel told MailOnline: 'Our family-owned restaurant business has proudly served the Bensonhurst community for over 19 years and is committed to ensuring the safety of all our customers and employees. 'We were deeply saddened by the loss of our guest Anthony, who visited our restaurant regularly.' He added: 'As this is a legal matter, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.'","Anthony DeNicola died after suffering an apparent heart attack in 2013 .

"It was a call that changed his life. After a decade without speaking to her, Dan Watson was contacted by his mother Lynn from Ireland last year after she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lung cancer. The 34 year old Sydney man resolved to turn over a new leaf after hearing the shocking news and decided to hike a staggering 5,000 kilometres across Australia for charity. ‘I was in a bad place at the time. I realised the only way I was going to make it through the other end of the tunnel was to do something selfless. I had to put others first,’ Dan told Daily Mail Australia. Dan Watson, 34, has embarked upon a 5000km solo mega-walk from Perth to Sydney with nothing but a custom made trolley to carry the bare necessities . Watson resolved to make the journey after he spoke with his mother Lynn (pictured) after a decade without contact . In a bid to repair his relationship with his mother, Dan embarked on the inspiring mega-walk from Fremantle to Sydney to raise money for the Cancer Council NSW and national mental health charity SANE. ‘My mother phoned last year from Ireland to say she needed me. She was going through her third round of chemotherapy. I knew it was very serious,’ he said. The Sydney advertising worker said he had blamed his parents for the anxiety and depression that has plagued him throughout his life, but the walk offered him a means of mending his familial fences. ‘The thought of losing out on the chance to settle our differences made me sick to my bones. I needed to show her I still cared.’ Watson arrives to Melbourne with 'Blue Steele', a trolley his friends named to give it more personal value . Watson said he had to remind himself that while trip was physically exhausting, it was trivial compared to what his mother was enduring . Dan said the biggest hurdle of the walk was the Nullarbor Desert, a vast and barren swathe of land in South Australia . Before starting the journey, Dan had a custom built trolley made to cart necessities like clothing and food. 'My friends named it Blue Steele. That way it had a human quality and I was more likely to look after it.' He said the biggest hurdle of the walk, which is set to come to a close this weekend when he arrives at Bondi Beach, was the Nullarbor Desert - a vast and barren swathe of land in southern Australia. ‘It's extremely arid and hot. Towards the end of the desert I began to lose my nerve. I was famished, as there were virtually no supermarkets for food.’ ‘I started to get this foreboding feeling of regret, that it was all a waste. I just about lost my marbles. 'But I had to tell myself it was only temporary, that my suffering was trivial compared to what my mum was going through.’ Dan said he lost over 20kgs over the journey and was left 'looking like a malnourished marathon runner' He is set to complete the mammoth hike this Sunday when he arrives at Bondi Beach . Watson said he expects to reach his goal of raising 20,000 for the Cancer Foundation NSW and SANE, a national mental health charity . While he was lean going into the journey, Dan said he lost over 20kgs. ‘I began the journey at about 77kg. By the end of the Nullabar I was about 55kg. I looked like a malnourished marathon runner,’ he said. He expects to reach his goal of raising $20,000 when he completes the mammoth hike this Sunday at Bondi Beach.

"According to some accounts, the wealth of the ancient Roman empire was reflected in the very fabric of the city - with buildings of sparkling white marble at its centre. Even the founder of the Roman empire, Emperor Augustus claimed that he had 'found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble'. But new research by historians at the University of California Los Angeles has now cast doubt on this boast. Scroll down to explore ancient Rome in 3D . This reconstruction by historians at the University of California shows how Rome would have looked under the rule of Augustus and reveals that many of the buildings were made from brick (shown in grey) while only a few temples were constructed from marble (pink) Using architectural computer modelling software they have been able to reconstruct the entire city to reveal how it would have looked during the rule of Augustus between 44BC and 14AD. The Pantheon, Trajan's Market and the Colosseum have remained standing for nearly 2,000 years. Scientists claim to have found a 'secret' ingredient in Roman concrete that helped it endure the elements. Using X ray beams at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), researchers were able to study a reproduction of Roman volcanic ash-lime mortar. In the concrete walls of Trajan's Markets, constructed around 110 CE, this mortar binds cobble-sized fragments of tuff and brick. Scientists looked at the mineralogical changes that took place in the curing of the mortar over a period of 180 days and compared the results to 1,900 year old samples of the original. The team discovered that the volcanic ash creates a crystal structure that prevents tiny cracks from spreading. They also found that the use of strätlingite crystals in the material showed no corrosion, with their smooth surface suggesting stability. They found that in fact only a small proportion of the buildings in Rome at the time were converted from brick into marble. Indeed, the few buildings that were built from marble were hidden from view within the city landscape, meaning many historical discriptions of the city's beauty were perhaps exaggerated. Their discovery suggests that the claim attributed to Augustus may have been more of a metaphor than a literal boast. Dr Diana Favro, who led the work, said: 'Many scholars have looked at Augustus’ claim from a political standpoint, as a metaphor for him transforming a republic into an empire. 'I wanted to see if Rome literally transformed under his rule. Given the literary descriptions and artwork, I thought these glittering marble temples on high would be very visible, but they were not.' Dr Favro used information from archaeological and historical records to produce the computer model that can show how the city evolved during Emperor Augustus' rule. Buildings constructed from marble were shaded with pink while those that were made from brick were shaded brown. Those under construction were yellow. When the researchers examined the model, they found just a few buildings were clad with marble, including the Temple of Venus and the Basilica Julia. Dr Favro found that when viewed from the street level, however, these buildings were not widely visible. Shortly before Augustus came to power, the Carrara marble quarries on the northwest coast of Italy were opened, and this was thought to have made marble a popular building material. Augustus commissioned several large marble structures, some of which took 40 years to complete. As a result, massive marble blocks were constantly being moved through the city, causing congestion in the streets. Marble-paved public spaces, which used to only be found in sacred temples and houses of the elite, were also added throughout the city. The 3D model (above) allows researchers to explore the city down to the street level and see how it changed between 44BC and 14AD . The Basilica Julia in the Roman Forum was one of the few buildings to be constructed from marble in Rome under Emperor Augustus . Dr Favro said this may be why Rome earned its reputation as a city of marble. She said: 'Because they saw construction taking place constantly, I believe people really did think that Rome had been transformed into marble. 'But in reality, the city did not greatly transform.' Many artworks, like the painting above, and historical accounts depict Rome under Augustus as being dominated by marble buildings .","Emperor Augustus boasted about how his rule left Rome 'a city of marble' while historical accounts said it glittered .

"Almost half of savers who chose to cash in their pensions as part of the biggest reforms in a century will be making an 'irrational decision', according a financial watchdog. On April 6, over-55s will be allowed to cash in all or part of their pension, rather than being forced to buy a guaranteed monthly income for life. The Treasury has pledged to offer appointments to help them decide what to do with their money. Next month over-55s will be allowed to cash in all or part of their pension - but experts are predicting chaos when the changes come in as the Treasury advice service is not yet up and running . However, the Financial Conduct Authority is warning that up to 40 per cent of savers who cash in their pensions will be 'irreversibly worse off'. And in some cases they even say people who cash in will be left destitute as they enter old age. Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA, told the Telegraph: 'In many cases it may not be in the member's best interests. 'We need to ensure that those who are considering it are fully aware of the potential benefits they are giving up.' The warning comes amid concern that some savers still cannot book an appointment with the Government’s pension guidance service – despite just one month to go before the reforms. Insurance firms say they are being contacted by floods of frustrated customers who are unable to even book a face-to-face or telephone appointment . Experts are predicting chaos when the changes come in, with the ‘Pension Wise’ service still without a telephone number or booking service. Insurance firms say they are being contacted by floods of frustrated customers who are unable to even book a face-to-face or telephone appointment . Richard Jones, of Scottish Widows, said: ‘I am concerned the Government is over-reliant on its website. Many people will want face-to-face or telephone guidance. ‘I am worried they are not going to be able to cope with the initial surge. ‘We have had customers calling since the start of the year who want to talk to the Government about what they want to do in April but they can’t. Thousands of customers who are trying to figure out what to do and cannot even book an appointment yet.’ Scottish Widows, which corners 10 per cent of the retirement market, has recruited an extra 400 staff to deal with queries about the pension reforms and expressed their dismay that the Government had hired fewer than that themselves. Only 300 official experts will be on hand to help hundreds of thousands of savers make the right decisions about their pensions when major reforms kick in. Many will have little or no previous expertise in pensions, which could lead to huge delays and many missing out on proper guidance. Job adverts being placed by Citizen’s Advice have revealed that, while it essential that applicants have good numerical and communication skills, no pensions knowledge is required.","On April 6 over-55s will be allowed to cash in all or part of their pension .

"An attorney for a former Marine found guilty in the shooting deaths of American Sniper author Chris Kyle and another man has filed an appeal. Eddie Ray Routh was convicted of capital murder in the 2013 deaths of Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a rural shooting range, after jurors rejected his insanity defense. Prosecutors hadn't sought the death penalty, so Routh was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Routh's attorneys said after the February 24 verdict they would appeal. Appeal: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, is filing to appeal his capital murder charge after he was sentenced to life in jail . Killed: Routh fatally shot Chris Kyle, left, and Chad Littlefield, right, with multiple bullets in an attack in 2013 . J. Warren St. John, one of Routh's attorneys, said the notice of appeal was filed on Tuesday. St. John also filed a motion for a new trial, arguing the conviction and sentence were contrary to law and evidence. The case drew extra attention due to the film based on Kyle's memoir. Routh, 27, was emotionless as the jury read their verdict on Tuesday night: that he had not been insane when he opened fire on Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield in February 2013. They had taken him to a shooting range to help him settle back into society after he left the Marines. After the verdict, Littlefield's brother-in-law, Jerry Richardson, turned to Routh and said: 'You took the lives of two heroes, men that tried to be a friend to you. You became an American disgrace.' As the Littlefield family also spoke out on the Today show on Wednesday morning, jurors stepped forward to say they had 'no doubt' that Routh knew what he was doing at the time of the murders. Heartbroken: The strain showed on Taya's face ahead of the guilty verdict on Tuesday evening . Families: Deby Kyle, Chris Kyle's mother (right) is seen leaving the courtroom after the verdict, alongside Judy and Don Littlefield (left), whose son Chris was killed at the same time . The verdict came as interest in Kyle's career as the U.S. military's deadliest-ever sniper reached fever pitch thanks to Oscar-nominated film about his life, 'American Sniper'. Ahead of the trial, Routh's lawyers had argued that the popularity of the movie, which grossed $300 million at the box office, would mean he could not get a fair trial. And speaking on Good Morning America on Wednesday, the jurors admitted some of them had seen the movie - but insisted they had put that out of their minds when making their decision. 'It gave me a better outlook on Chris' role as a Marine,' one of the jurors, Barrett Hutchinson, said. 'But as far as the actions that took place on February 2, Chad was still in the picture and Chad was not in that movie. 'I took the fact that Chris was a marine out of my mind and looked at him as a person, looked at Chad as a person, looked at Eddie as a person and, you know, tried to make reasonable judgment.' An attorney representing Chris Kyle's wife is arguing that a judge was mistaken in awarding a $1.8 million defamation verdict to former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura over the way he was portrayed in the book American Sniper. In a brief filed Wednesday in the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Taya Kyle's lawyer wrote that the verdict should be reversed and the court should rule in Kyle's favor. At minimum, attorney John Borger wrote, Kyle should be granted a new trial. Ventura, a former pro wrestler and former Minnesota governor, sued Chris Kyle for defamation in 2012 after the best-selling author wrote in his book that he decked Ventura at a California bar because the former governor made offensive comments about SEALs. Ventura testified that he never made the statements and that the confrontation never happened. A federal jury sided with Ventura last summer, awarding him $500,000 for damages and recommending $1.3 million for 'unjust enrichment,' or how much money Kyle improperly made from the claim. U.S. District Judge Richard Kyle granted the unjust enrichment, finding it was 'reasonable and supported by a preponderance of the evidence.' But Borger argued on appeal that the unjust enrichment award based on alleged defamatory speech is unprecedented and violates the First Amendment. Borger also argued that Ventura didn't prove the account was either 'material falsity' or 'actual malice,' and as a result, he didn't meet the legal threshold for a defamation claim. Borger said the judge also erred in giving instructions to the jury. 'A properly instructed jury would not have rendered a verdict in Ventura's favor,' Borger wrote. Kyle, a former SEAL regarded as the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, was killed in 2013 at a Texas shooting range. A former Marine was convicted in his death last month. Loved: Taya Kyle, pictured with her husband Chris, paid tribute to him in an emotional Facebook post on Wednesday morning, just hours after a Texas jury found his killer guilty of murder . Caught: Routh is pictured in the back of a police car after he fled the scene of the murder in Kyle's truck before he was eventually caught. He claimed he shot the two men because he feared they would kill him . Confession: Routh, pictured hours after the killings, confessed to the shootings almost immediately . Also on Wednesday, Chad Littlefield's family spoke out about the verdict. 'It was an answered prayer,' Judy Littlefield told the Today show. 'We've waited a long time to hear that. We feel justice has been served.' Routh's brother-in-law added that he never once believed Routh had been insane. Routh's attorneys had tried to prove he was in a psychotic state at the time of the killings. 'It was all an act,' Jerry Richardson said. 'I taught him in high school and... that's just the way he was. He never grew up. He was still just opposite defiant, and he had nothing wrong in the mind except for the drug use.' Chad's father Don remembered his son as a 'quiet man' and 'a good listener' who met Kyle at their children's soccer practices. The two men shared an interest in working out and helping veterans, Don said. Chad himself was not a veteran but wanted to help others. 'Chris served overseas and Chad served when they came back,' Mrs Littlefield explained. Mr Littlefield added: 'His motto was pass it forward.' Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, testified in the trial but has not spoken out since the verdict. She was seen in the courtroom on Tuesday but did not return when the decision was read.","Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday for shooting dead 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield .

"The former girlfriend of a British soldier killed fighting ISIS extremists revealed last night he hoped to rekindle their relationship when he returned from Syria. Ex-Royal Marine Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, was hit by mortar fire while fighting alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. Jemma Weston, who  dated Mr Scurfield while they were at college in Nottingham five years ago and remained close friends with him, said he was an 'amazing man' and she would miss him for the rest of her life. She said: 'The last time I spoke to him, just a few months ago, he said, 'I want to come back and I want to come back to you'.' She added: 'I'm so sad that will now never happen.'

'Going to Syria was his way of doing an unselfish act,' she said. 'He was doing it to help other people and to make a difference, I think. 'It was his way of giving something back. When we last spoke I asked him if he would be all right and he said 'Yeah, I'll be fine'. He told me 'This is what I've got to do'. Mr Scurfield's family, who live in a former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, paid tribute to him yesterday saying: 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.' Miss Weston, who met Mr Scurfield at college in Nottingham, said he would have wanted to make a difference . Konstandinos Erik Scurfield (kneeling) pictured with Jordan Matson (second from right), a former US soldier . Mr Scurfield (pictured), one whose fellow-fighters said he 'gave his life combating terrorism for his nation' Last night video footage emerged of the Afghanistan veteran in Syria wearing combat gear, jeans and a black T-shirt. He says: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine. He had been training with the US Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline. But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities. His one-way ticket rang 'alarm bells', officials said, and his luggage, phone and laptop were examined. The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of Islamic State, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland. It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. It also emerged that he was questioned by police last October on suspicion of going to Syria to fight jihadists. He was preparing to fly from the US to Turkey after contacting a Kurdish group on Facebook. He was returned to his unit in Arbroath, Angus, but decided to leave the Armed Forces before Christmas so he could travel to the war-torn region to fight. Mr Scurfield, known as Kosta to his comrades, is the first Briton to be killed while fighting IS in Syria. The former drama student, who had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines aged 21, was described by his comrades as 'Kosta's one-man army' who raised the morale of fighters. John Foxx, who served alongside him in a team of foreign fighters nicknamed the Chappies, said: 'He was hands down one of the greatest human beings I have ever met. From beginning to end he was 100 per cent about helping everyone else.' Last night a fellow Royal Marine said: 'He was very angry about the Middle East and the Islamic State. 'As a unit we had been on standby several times but nothing happened and he was frustrated that the UK was standing back. He was a very focused and good Marine, but the Islamic State was his priority.' Mr Scurfield decided to quit the Army to join the Kurdish peshmerga after befriending fighters in the region on Facebook. Fellow fighters in Mr Scurfield's 'Lions of Rojava' group have posted tributes to him online today . Mr Scurfield was described by family friends as 'strong-willed', with a 'deep sense of duty and honour' He left his base in November, telling his parents, both 49, and his three siblings that he was going to provide 'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine. Mr Foxx added: 'He would always volunteer to be on the ambush team, spend the night on the [defence fortification] or go on any assault.' Jordan Matson, a former US soldier also fighting with the Kurds, described Mr Scurfield as a 'disciplined warrior'. He added: 'Kosta wanted nothing more than to bring the fight to the enemy.' In recent weeks, Mr Scurfield's father, archaeologist Christopher Scurfield, and his mother Vasiliki – a writer and teacher – became increasingly concerned and contacted their MP for help. Dan Jarvis, Labour MP for Barnsley Central, said: 'They came to me a few weeks ago very worried for their son's safety and tragically it appears their worst fears have been realised.' Mark Campbell, a pro-Kurdish rights campaigner who broke the news to the family, said: 'It was very, very emotional, [his mother] was literally in tears for the whole conversation.' He said the Peshmerga wanted to bury Mr Scurfield as 'one of their comrades in arms, as a hero'. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield died while fighting with the Kurdistan People's Protection Units (YPG) in the Al-Hasakah province on Monday . It is believed that more than 100 western fighter have joined the Kurds in Syria in the fight against ISIS. Pictured are ISIS militants parading through the streets of Raqqa . Schoolfriends of Konstandinos Erik Scurfield say they are mourning a 'real character' and remembering his 'cheeky smile'. Classmates from Royston High School, where he studied until 2006, said they are hoping to organise a reunion event in his memory. Emma Hyman, 24, said his school friends have found it difficult to match the fun-loving actor who was loved by everyone in his year with the pictures they have seen of him over the last couple days in military poses wearing combat fatigues. School friends of Mr Scurfield say he was always popular in his youth and wasn't one to get into fights . Miss Hyman said: 'He was such a people-person and when he went into the forces it was a big surprise. He wasn't a fighter. 'He didn't get into any fights at school or anything like that. You put people in groups - certain things they might do with their lives and I would never have had him down as becoming a soldier.' She said he also had long hair at school, where he was an extremely popular student and was also very clever - in the top sets for everything. She said he came to Royston High, which no longer exists, in his early teens from Nottingham and was immediately noticeable because he did not have a Barnsley accent and was 'really well-spoken, very polite and very respectful'. She said: 'Everybody loved him because he was a real character. He was one of those people who you couldn't find anything negative at all to say about him. He was friendly and funny and really laid back. He had such a cheeky smile. Miss Hyman added: 'We're trying to organise something so we can all get together and remember him. It's at the early stages at the moment. It's a shame we are going to all come together in these circumstances.'","Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was killed fighting Islamic State on Monday .

"This is the man who spent two years touring the UK in a quest to find the perfect pie. Author Martin Tarbuck, from Wigan, Lancashire, had his fingers in a total of 314 pastries on his search for the best the country has to offer. The 41-year-old judged each pie on a number of  important criteria - purveyor, premises, purchase, place, pastry, presentation, package, palate, price, and portion - as part of his research for a book on British pies. Scroll down for video . Martin Tarbuck ate 314 pies over the course of 700 days to find Britain's best pastry . A humble meat and potato pie from a bakers in Cumbria topped the chart, with Martin describing it as 'softer than an angel crying on your tongue'. The pie-mad author said: 'Sometimes I go looking for the pie, sometimes the pie finds me. Sometimes it's a shop recommendation, sometimes I just hit a particular town or city and see what it has got to offer. 'People, towns, cities and counties are proud of their pies and love to make and eat their own regional variations of them. 'It was my staple diet for 700 days, although I was prepared to mix it up a bit in the interests of research. There were also pasties, chunky steak pies, breakfast items, and chicken and mushroom pies.' The crowning winner set him back £1.15 from Greens Bakery and Confectioners in Barrow, Cumbria, and was awarded a heartwarming 61 points. Martin Tarbuck's book Life of Pies . Reviewing it, the father-of-one said: This is what I've been searching for! 'Externally it doesn't look at all spectacular but once I open it up I'm left in awe as to how they pack it all in. 'Layer after layer of thick spud slice expanding like a concertina. It looks like one of those penny drops at the fairground where the chutes zig zag. 'Absolute pastry perfection. I'm in love.' The 41-year-old's love of pies originates from his hometown - arguably the pie capital of the UK. 'It is the duty of a Wigan man to sample as many pies as is humanly possible from around the world,' he said. 'For many decades large swathes of professional and amateur commentators alike have laughed at the town of Wigan and mocked its inhabitants for being pie eating simpletons. 'Nevertheless what I discovered during my research is that pies are not necessarily a Wigan thing. They are a national treasure where each area has its individual intricacies and delicacies. 'You know the way Hugh Hefner parades around his Beverley Hills mansion in his dressing gown surrounded by a bevy of poolside beauties? 'Well that's how I feel when you put pies in front of me through my eyes, there's no ugly ones and each and every one of them deserves to be loved equally.' The Wigan native crowned a humble meat and potato pie from a bakers in Cumbria as Britain's best . And after years of practice in eating them, he has firm rules as to how they should be consumed. Martin said: 'A pie has to be completely encased for a start - otherwise there's no chance of eating it with your hands, and the top crust should be the decorative invitation to the party that lies within. 'Oh and if that pastry falls apart, then so do I. With rage.' Martin has penned a book on finding the perfect pie - with in depth reviews of each and every one he has sunk his teeth into. Martin addeed: 'I feel duly obliged to say that pies, brilliant though they are, should only be consumed in moderation.'","Author Martin Tarbuck ate 314 pies whilst conducting research for book .

"For PBS science correspondent Miles O'Brien, seeing on film the aftermath of the freak accident that resulted in the amputation of his left arm above the elbow proved more difficult than he had anticipated. He had an early look at the documentary, Miles O'Brien: A Life Lost and Found, narrated by his friend, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. It premieres on CNN next Tuesday at 9pm. 'I was a little bit taken aback by how much it affected me emotionally,' O'Brien said. 'We all want to talk about this linear, analogue thing — here's when you grieve, here's when you do therapy, here's where you get back to work. But that's not how we all live.' Scroll down for video . Amputee: PBS science correspondent Mile O'Brien (center) lost his left arm above the elbow last February after an accident while on assignment in Asia . Alarming diagnosis: A heavy case of equipment fell on his left forearm, casing acute compartment syndrome - a condition where his swollen muscles blocked blood flow in his arm . O'Brien, 55, used to be CNN's top science correspondent until the network laid off his entire unit. He appears on the network as an occasional analyst, such as during coverage of last spring's missing Malaysia Airlines plane, but does most of his freelance work now for PBS NewsHour. He was on assignment for PBS in Japan and the Philippines in February 2014 when a heavy case of equipment fell on his left forearm. It caused a nasty bruise, but not enough to stop O'Brien from working. He wanted to finish his stories and escape for a few days on a beach. The following night, his pain increased and O'Brien sought medical attention. He was diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome, a condition where his swollen muscles blocked blood flow in his arm. As he was getting ready for surgery, he searched the Internet for details on a diagnosis he had never heard before, and grew alarmed when words like 'life-threatening' and 'amputation' popped up. Fateful trip: In Febraury 2014, O'Brien (pictured) traveled to Japan and the Philippines to report on 3D printing when the accident occurred . Illusion: Waking up after the amputation, O'Brien could feel his left arm, but it was only a phantom limb . Denial: O'Brien continued working on his stories after being discharged from the hospital and didn't tell his family back home about the amputation . Waking up after surgery, O'Brien's first inclination was that he caught a break. He could feel his left arm, the fingers on his hand. But it was an illusion, a phantom limb. His arm was gone. He checked out of the hospital two days later and spent more than a week in a Philippines hotel, finishing his PBS stories. In an extreme form of denial, the divorced father of two told no one what had happened, even his children. They were dark days, and he told Gupta he even considered suicide. 'I had never lost an arm before,' he said, drily. 'I wasn't sure how that would go.' Two weeks after the amputation, he wrote in a blog post- typed with one hand with the help of a voice recognition software: 'Life is all about playing the hand that is dealt you. Actually, I would love somebody to deal me another hand right about now — in more ways than one.' During an interview on the Today Show in March 2014, about a month after his accident, O'Brien described what happened to him as 'mind-boggling.' Unstoppable: The 55-year-old reporter has learned how to ride a bicycle one-handed with the help of a special contraption (pictured) O'Brien had never been the sort of person who reached out for help. And he wanted to prove to himself he could move forward and still do his job. When he found out about the amputation through the February blog post O'Brien had written, Gupta was worried. 'I wasn't surprised by Miles' reaction,' he said. 'My concern was, was this his form of therapy or was he delaying the inevitable psychological crash by not dealing with it emotionally?' O'Brien has tried to prove he can maintain his active life beyond work, with some missteps. He started running, but losing an arm affected his balance and he took some nasty spills. He broke his nose one time when he reached to break his fall with an arm that was no longer there. A woman who came upon him was horrified — look what happened to his arm! — and O'Brien had to explain he didn't lose it in the fall. With the help of a prosthetic arm, he completed a 300-mile bike ride to honor his late sister, Gupta pedaling by his side. The licensed pilot has also been testing out how to fly again with his new disability. Growing pains: The divorced father of two has been learning how to perform simple everyday tasks like cutting a bagel and getting dressed on his own . He's learning about the oddities of pain in a phantom limb, how to work with new prosthetics and how to negotiate simple tasks — getting dressed, cutting a bagel — that he never had to think twice about before. When filming the CNN special, O'Brien knew what Gupta was up to when his friend asked him to read on camera some of the emails that Gupta had sent to him a year ago. He was trying to make him cry. It worked. The emotional journey, still not completed, has been one of self-discovery. He's learned that there's no weakness in asking for help. He realizes what loved ones and even strangers think of him, and it has been overwhelming. 'If I had to trade it — that arm for the knowledge and the love that I feel?' he said. 'I'll go with the love. It's a hell of a way to learn a lesson.'","O'Brien, 55, had his left arm amputated above the elbow in February 2014 after a heavy bag fell onto his forearm .

"Pathology test results have confirmed the brutal killing of pregnant mum Kris-Deann Sharpley and her seven-year-old son, Jackson, was a murder-suicide carried out by her grandfather. The bodies of 27-year-old Ms Sharpley, her son and her father, Derek, were found inside their family home in Biddeston, Queensland, on Monday morning. Friends of murdered mum Kris-Deann Sharpley said she was thrilled by the pending arrival of her daughter, who she had even given a name, and showed no signs of the trauma that was about to tear a family apart. Murdered mum Kris-Deann Sharpley was thrilled by the pending arrival of her second child, who she planned to name in honour of her mother, before she was brutally killed. 'Everything seemed to be fine,' Corinne Kaiser, a close Sharpley family friend, told The Chronicle. Derek Jackson, 52, who was found dead in his Biddeston home, had a history of criminal behaviour and mental health issues . Ms Kaiser last spoke to Ms Sharpley on Sunday evening, hours before she was killed. Ms Sharpley was set to name her daughter Amber Elizabeth Rose in honour of her mother, Elizabeth Roslyn, who died years earlier, according to the Courier Mail. A grandfather whose body was also found at the scene was well known to police and had a long history of mental illness. Derek John Sharpley, 52, was found dead of gunshot wounds to the head in the same room that his grandson Jackson's body was found tucked into a bed inside the home, west of Brisbane in Queensland. His 27-year-old daughter Kris-Deann Sharpley, who had moved to the Queensland town in 2011 to care for him following her mother's death, also died of gunshot wounds to the head and was found in the bathroom. Detective Inspector David Isherwood would not confirm the details of Mr Sharpley's criminal history, but told Daily Mail Australia that there had been no recent incidents. 'They [the family] are known to police and in regard to criminal history; the reality is that while he has a criminal history, it's not recent history,' Inspector Isherwood said. 'But he has got a criminal history and there is no doubt that he has had mental health issues.' His daughter Kris-Deann Sharpley (left), who had moved to the town to care for him following her mother's death, was found dead in the bathroom while her seven-year-old son (rigth) Jackson's body was found in a bed . Derek (left) and his daughterKris-Deann (right), were found dead from gunshot wounds to the head in their bathroom on Monday. Mr Sharpley is believed to have attempted suicide in the past and had a history of substance abuse. 'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' Inspector Isherwood said. Mr Sharpley is believed to have shot himself after killing his daughter and grandson, however detectives have been unable to determine the young boy's cause of death after preliminary pathology results returned inconclusive. Inspector Isherwood said there were no signs of physical injury on the child's body and that police were awaiting further results before making any conclusions about how he died. 'There are a couple of issues, they [forensic pathologists] think, with the decomposition. You'd think that with strangulation there would be lesion marks on the neck. What often happens in a lot of bodies in that case is that the head is tilted forward and you get bruising in the front of the body,' Inspector Isherwood said. 'Suffocation is very hard to prove, so the issue we've got is we really don't know'. Detective Inspector David Isherwood told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Sharpley 'was not the owner of a registered firearm', but would not release any other information about the gun used to kill the two adults . Detectives have been unable to determine Jackson's (pictured) cause of death after preliminary pathology results returned inconclusive. Suffocation and strangulation are still being investigated . The owner of the high-calibre gun used to kill both adults, which was found lying on a bed, has also been an unclear aspect of the case. Inspector Isherwood told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Sharpley 'was not the owner of a registered firearm', but would not release any other information about the gun. He said detectives would return to the address on Thursday to obtain any more evidence that could be relevant to the case. It comes after revelations that Kris-Deann  was on maternity leave and excitedly awaiting the birth of her little girl who she'd chosen to name Amber Elizabeth Rose after her late mother when she was slain, her sister-in-law Sara Turnball told the Courier Mail. All three bodies were found by Kris-Deann's (left) sister Tara on Monday evening when she came to the house to pick up some belongings . Detectives will return to the address on Thursday to obtain any more evidence that could be relevant to the case . All three bodies were found by Kris-Deann's sister Tara on Monday evening when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs. Tara, who is also pregnant, was accompanied by her boyfriend Allan Brown and had to climb through a window to gain access to the house. Mr Brown told the Courier Mail that Tara screamed out: 'They've been murdered, they've been murdered.' The scene at Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road home was so grisly it distressed first-response police officers, according to Detective Inspector David Isherwood. A dog barks behind a gate at a house in which the bodies of a man, a woman and a young boy were found in Biddeston, west of Toowoomba, Queensland . Police guard a house where the bodies of the relatives were found on Monday night . 'Two of the victims, both the adult male and female, had very serious wounds to their bodies,' he said. 'Both appear to have been shot in the head.' 'At this point in time there's nothing to suggest there was any incident that occurred in terms of a disturbance.' 'Two people that live in the town heard three distinct gunshots.' The gunshots were heard on Sunday night but locals presumed it was someone shotting an animal. Kris-Deann Sharpley was on maternity leave and excitedly awaiting the birth of her little girl . Kris-Deann shared this photo of her son Jackson and a scan of her unborn child Amber on Facebook before she was killed . 'There is no evidence that the house has been broken into when the police arrived they had to force entry into the premises. It would appear that the house was secure. The first person who attended the residence had to climb in to gain entry.' 'Police attended a Biddeston Southbrook Road address around 6.50pm after the bodies of a man, woman and boy were located. The three aged 52, 27 and 7 respectively, were all known to each other,' Queensland Police said. The shooting happened on the corner of Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road and Biddeston-Southbrook Road at Biddeston - more than 150 kilometres west of Brisbane. 'There are no concerns for public safety,' a police spokesman said. Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14. Forensic officers took photographs after arriving at the scene on Monday night . Forensic officers are seen outside the house where the bodies of a man, a woman and a young boy were found .

'That's the law': Appearing on Channel Nine's Today breakfast show on Thursday, model Jesinta Campbell was asked about her views on the imminent executions of Bali Nine ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . They were convicted for smuggling heroin into Indonesia from Australia in 2005. 'It's so sad. I mean, watching all the footage play out on the news... it breaks your heart because you can't help but feel for their families and they are two humans at the end of the day,' Jesinta said of the polarising situation. She did however stress that despite being strongly against the death penalty herself, the laws in Indonesia regarding drugs are widely known. 'But, like a lot of Australians believe, at the end of the day unfortunately, Indonesia has these rules and if you break them these are the consequences. 'It's so sad, I do not agree with the death penalty, but that's their law.' Sharing her thoughts: 'It's so sad. I mean, watching all the footage play out on the news... it breaks your heart because you can't help but feel for their families and they are two humans at the end of the day,' Jesinta said of the polarising situation . Jesinta is a regular on Today, offering her intelligent opinions on everything from serious current affairs to light-hearted topics. The likely area on Death Island where Chan and Sukumaran will take their final breaths is called, Nirbaya. Found in the island's remote centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. On Wednesday, Black Sabbath rocker, Tony Iommi, wrote a letter to Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair. The lead guitarist wrote a letter to President Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair. 'I appeal to you, as a forgiving man, to take note of their transformation,' Tony Iommi wrote in a letter to President Joko Widodo about the two Australian drug smugglers on death row. 'They are now reformed men who are making a positive difference to the lives of their fellow prisoners. 'For this reason, I would ask that you stop the execution of Andrew and Myuran. 'Please allow them to serve out life sentences where they contribute to the well-being of Indonesia and make good for the error of their previous ways.' Controversial topic: Chan and Sukumaran have since been moved from Kerobokan Prison after 10 years on death row, to Nusakambangan, or 'Death Island', where they will be executed by firing squad . Making the journey: The likely area on Death Island where Chan and Sukumaran will take their final breaths is called, Nirbaya . This comes as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop used parliament to directly plead with the Indonesian president. Ms Bishop told parliament on Wednesday that Indonesian authorities were preparing for the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. 'On behalf of the parliament, I respectfully ask of the Indonesian president that he spare the lives of these two Australian citizens,' Ms Bishop said. She said she had spoken with the two families on Wednesday morning. 'As you can imagine they are devastated but they are just living day by day,' she said. A plea for clemency was rejected in January but since then the government has been seeking a permanent stay of execution. Ms Bishop said there were grounds for clemency and the government believed there were still legal avenues open to the pair. 'The grounds are that both men have shown immense remorse for their grave crimes and... have undergone an extraordinary rehabilitation'. Social justice: On Wednesday, Black Sabbath rocker, Tony Iommi, wrote a letter to Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair . In the Senate, Attorney-General George Brandis said the government had made at least 22 representations to Indonesian officials since January in a bid to save the two men. That included letters and phone calls from Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Ms Bishop and the Australian Federal Police. ASIO chief Duncan Lewis and Attorney-General Department secretary Chris Moraitis had also been sent to Indonesia to plead for the pair. However the Indonesian ambassador has defended his government in a letter responding to a Senate attempt to save the Bali Nine duo. Nadjib Riphat Kesoema said the decision not to pardon the pair was very difficult for President Joko Widodo on both a personal and humanitarian level. However, the drug problem had 'blossomed into a national emergency' and required strong law enforcement. 'Most tragically, drugs and their traffickers and producers have denied too many people including children of their right to life,' he wrote. Mr Kesoema said both cases had been granted due process of law and all legal avenues had been pursued. He defended the court's decision to impose the death penalty and said separation of powers meant the government could not meddle in judicial processes. The upper house had argued the sentences should be commuted to a prison term due to the pair's genuine remorse and rehabilitation. Chan and Sukumaran were transferred to Nusakambangan island on Wednesday to await their execution.","Jesinta Campbell spoke about the imminent executions of Bali Nine duo .

"Dozens of young people have been seen risking death or potential serious injury by playing 'chicken' at a level crossing. CCTV footage shows youngsters jumping over barriers at Grays level crossing in south Essex when they are down because a train is about to approach, and racing over the tracks. Others have been seen risking their lives by walking along the tracks to get to the exits or jumping off the platform. Scroll down for video . People have been captured on video racing over a level crossing at Grays in Essex, before barriers close . In the last month alone 260 incidents have been recorded and police are calling for people to pay more attention to their safety on the crossing, rather than risk death by taking foolhardy shortcuts or playing 'chicken' as they race to beat the barriers. Authorities said if incidents continue they will have to consider closing the crossing because the number of people putting themselves at risk is 'simply too high.' More than 100 trains use the crossing every single day. Steve Cassidy, Network Rail area director, told the Clacton Gazette: 'It may be tempting to shave a minute or two off your journey but this a busy main line and people are putting their lives at risk by walking on the track or trying to beat the barriers. Police and train officials have warned the crossing could be closed if people keep risking their lives . Some people may think that taking a shortcut along the tracks isn't really a risk, that they can get out of the way of the train but fatality figures show that isn't the case. Waiting at a crossing can sometimes be frustrating but ignoring safety measures can result in tragic consequences, something we want to prevent.' In one piece of footage youngsters are seen ducking under the barriers and racing across the crossing before a train comes while another rides a bike across the closed section. Another clip shows a passenger walking along the tracks after a train has left to exit the station. In one incident a person dressed in a cap (bottom centre) is seen jumping over railings alongside a train . They then run alongside the train on the tracks in an incident which could have  lethal consequences . After running along the tracks the person then jumps over the barrier where groups of people are waiting . Police said they will increase patrols at the crossing over the next few weeks to try and prevent as many people as possible using it in a risky way. Council leader Councillor John Kent said: 'Network Rail has made it clear that – as a last resort – they may have to close the crossing, simply shut it down. I do not want that to happen. But everyone who uses it must play their part too.' British Transport Police said it will be cracking down on people who misuse the level crossing, endangering their own lives and that of other people. Mark Hook said: 'Is it really worth risking a criminal record, or even your life, just to save a few minutes on your journey?'

"A lesbian has created a unique sex toy, which also serves as a means of at-home artificial insemination. Stephanie Berman, a reproductive health expert from Boston, came up with the clever concept, which she named the Semenette, after examining the other available methods of at-home fertilization open to her and her wife. 'The only options other than going to a doctor's office would be with a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe,' Ms Berman told Refinery29 about her creation, which retails for $139.99. Scroll down for video . Loving mother: Semenette creator Stephanie Berman (pictured) and her wife Kiersten Marie welcomed their beautiful baby daughter Isabella in March . Breaking with tradition: Unlike a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe, which can also be used as a means of artificial insemination, the Semenette (pictured) is also intended to pleasure the user . 'We started using those types of things and quickly realized it was as awful as it sounds. 'There is nothing romantic or sexy and fun about trying to impregnate your wife with a turkey baster.' Moving on up: Ms Berman is hoping to release a second version of the unique sex toy later this year . The mother-of-one began looking into alternative designs, which would use the same pump-based technology as a turkey baster - one of the more traditional at-home means of artificial insemination - but also enable the user, and their partner, to enjoy the process of impregnation. And while Ms Berman initially intended for the toy, which comes complete with a pump, to be used by lesbian couples, she explained that it will actually serve as a great fertilization aid for anyone who might not be able to get pregnant using traditional means - and who does not want to go through IVF. 'When my wife and I wanted to start a family, we thought about our options and weren’t necessarily happy with any of them,' she added. 'I started thinking, what if I could recreate the technology that a turkey baster would provide, but in the form of a sex toy? 'That would be the perfect scenario - it would not only allow both partners to be really involved in the process, but it would allow for privacy and authenticity and intimacy.' Ms Berman and her wife Kiersten Marie, who used the Semenette when conceiving their one-year-old baby daughter Isabella, have received an outpouring of support and praise from a variety of people from different communities. Thus far, the entrepreneur's unique creation has been used by transgender and transsexual couples, men with erectile dysfunction and even heterosexual couples, who, Ms Berman explained, still 'enjoy the sensation' of using the Semenette. The Turkey Baster Method is widely thought to be the most common means of at-home artificial insemination. Tradition: A turkey baster (pictured) can be used as a means of at-home insemination . While some women choose to use a traditional turkey baster, a needle-less syringe will also serve the same purpose. The method involves women using semen from their boyfriend or husband, or from a willing donor, which they then inject into themselves using a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe. Women who are eager to use this method are advised to attempt it on the day of ovulation and the 2-3 days before ovulation. While the success rate of the turkey baster method is thought to be reasonably high, some women, like the Semenette's creator Stephanie Berman, have complained that it causes discomfort, and it is not known to be particularly enjoyable for the user. However, the method is still favored by women who do not wish to undergo IVF. Indeed, the product has proved so successful that the businesswoman has launched a new crowdsourcing campaign on Indiegogo.com in the hopes of funding the Semenette 2.0, which will come in a wider variety of colors, shapes and sizes, according to its website. 'Up to this point, we [have] manufactured 500 units in three realistic colors, Vanilla, Cinnamon and Chocolate,' Ms Berman explains on her Indiegogo page. 'With your contribution, we will manufacture the Semenette V2 in new non-realistic color options (tell us what color you want to see), make different sizes of the toy, larger bulbs... and use a softer silicone to enhance the comfort and feel of the toy.' And Ms Berman insists that the Semenette should not just be viewed as a means of insemination - but can also be used by couples, or single people, who are looking to get a bit more creative in the bedroom. 'I’ve had people use this at bachelorette parties, and they put alcohol in it,' she added to Refinery29. 'You have to take into consideration what you’ll be introducing into the body. A lot of people will use lubricants... 'It sort of depends on what your desires are, but the most common things in there are probably lubricant or other stuff that's okay to be put on or in the body.'","Stephanie Berman wanted to come up with a way to get her wife pregnant, without having to use a 'turkey baster or a needle-less syringe'

"He was born a healthy little boy, with his whole life ahead of him. But at the age of just one, Zach Parnaby's bright future was cruelly cast into doubt when doctors diagnosed the toddler with a crippling genetic disease. Just after Christmas Zach's parents Lindsey and Ben Parnaby were given the devastating news that their son has a rare illness, which had been unwittingly passed on in their genes. The condition, known as Krabbe Luekodystrophy, which affects one in 100,000 people across the world, will cause Zach to gradually lose the ability to walk, talk, see or hear. His doctors have warned his parents, he is unlikely to live beyond his fourth birthday. When he was just 17 months old, doctors diagnosed Zach Parnaby, pictured with his mother Lindsey, with the rare genetic Krabbes disease, which will gradually cause the toddler to lose the ability to walk and talk . Doctors have warned Zach's parents Lindsey and Ben that their son is unlikely to see his fourth birthday. Determined he will make the most of the time he has left, the couple have compiled a bucket wishlist . On the 16-point list was a wish to sit in a fire engine and meet the cartoon character Fireman Sam. As well as the cartoon characters and other entries including swimming in the sea and taking a boat trip, the family are aiming to help find a cure for the genetic illness . Now, the couple have vowed to raise awareness of their son's disease, while also compiling a bucket list of things the 20-month-old must see and do in the time he has left. So far, Zach has already met his favourite cartoon character, Fireman Sam, and taken a ride on Thomas The Tank Engine. He has enjoyed a boat trip, been given his own pet puppy and met some of the Newcastle United squad. But his parents, both 29, from Spennymoor in County Durham, are determined he will fulfil the list. Still to come is a swim in the sea, riding a bike, meeting a real bear as well as Mickey Mouse, and feel a waterfall wash over his head. Zach's parent's Lindsey and Ben Parnaby have compiled a 16-strong wishlist for their son, of things for him to do and see in the time he has left. The list includes: . 1. Find a cure for Krabbes disease . 2. For Krabbes disease to be screened for at birth . 3. To meet Mickey Mouse - booked . 4. To ride in a fire engine and meet Fireman Sam - done . 5. To swim in the sea . 6. To build a snowman - done . 7. Go sledging . 8. Meet a real bear (I love bear's and this was one of my first words) 9. To meet Santa . 10. To ride a bike . 11. Meet a famous person - done . 12. Ride on a red London bus . 13. Take a boat trip - done . 14. Own my own dog - done, Sam the puppy comes home soon . 15. See a waterfall and swim near it if it's safe . 16. Take a ride on Thomas The Tank Engine - booked for March 22 . But, while each entry on the list has its own importance for Zach and his parents, their top wish is to help find a cure for Krabbes disease. Mr and Mrs Parnaby argue it is vital that all children are screened for the disease at birth. They have so far raised a staggering £4,000 to help their son realise the bucket list. Mrs Parnaby said: 'The things we are generally doing with Zach aren't out of the ordinary. 'They are things we would have done with him anyway while he was growing up, but we just have to squeeze it in to such a short space of time while he is aware. 'We want him to enjoy it and be aware of what is happening. 'Sadly his symptoms have been very rapid. We don't know what the future looks like but we have to take each day as it comes. 'Every little cold could be it, we just don't know. 'We know Zach is not going to see four, five or six. 'The doctors told us he may have between 18 months and four years.' She said the family are hoping to visit London soon to tick off more of Zach's list, including a ride on a red open top bus and the London Eye as well as meeting Disney star Mickey Mouse and characters from Frozen. 'We want him to ride a bike, it's something every child should do, but the practicalities of all of the wishes are quite difficult,' Mrs Parnaby added. 'I don't know if we can find a bike sit that will work for him.' The 29-year-old said if her son had been screened for Krabbes disease with a pin-prick test at birth, it may have allowed time for a potentially life-saving bone marrow transplant. Doctors have told the family the procedure was too expensive. Mrs Parnaby first noticed her son was struggling to walk last November, and took him to see a GP. They suspected Zach was going through a 'phase', but a month later his condition appeared to be deteriorating and reaching a the point where he could only crawl. In their quest to do as much as they can with their son, Mr and Mrs Parnaby organised for him to meet some of the Newcastle United squad. They are pictured here with attacking midfielder Remy Cabella . Zach, now 20 months, was also given the chance to meet Steven Taylor, left and Jack Colback, right . Mrs Parnaby, said: 'Sadly his symptoms have been very rapid. We don't know what the future looks like but we have to take each day as it come' His mother took him to Darlington Memorial Hospital four times, before doctors ordered an MRI scan. The toddler was referred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, where on Christmas Eve a specialist revealed Zach was seriously ill. Krabbes disease is typically diagnosed in the first year of life. It is a genetic condition that causes patients to rapidly regress to a point where they have little to no brain function. Those diagnosed with the condition rarely live beyond the age of two, many dying as a result of respiratory infection or brain fever. Symptoms of Krabbes disease include: . In general, the earlier a child is diagnosed with the disease, the more rapid its progression. Those who are first diagnosed at ages two to 14 will become severely incapacitated, and generally die by the age of two to seven. Source: United Leukodystrophy Foundation . The formal diagnosis of Krabbes disease was made three weeks later. 'I don't know what was going through my head when the doctor told us on Christmas Eve,' Mrs Parnaby said. 'You just don't eve expect to be told this when your son has been happy and healthy for 17 months. 'If we had learned of this disease from an earlier point it wouldn't have been easier but it would not have been such a shock thinking everything was fine and normal for all that time.' She said up to the point where doctors diagnosed the disease, Zach was a 'normal' baby, going to play group three times a week. 'He was such a clever and active baby, going to water babies till he was 14 months old,' she added. 'If we were given the option at birth to be screened and found out he had it then we would have had the option of a bone marrow transplant, which could have given him a normal life. 'It's too late now.' 'We had 17 months of thinking he was fine. It only takes a heel pin-prick test. 'I asked why they don't do it and they told me it was due to cost. Cost does not come into it with the lives of children.' A fundraising page for Zach reads: 'Myself, Ben and our family have made an agreement that Zach's life will continue as normal but in the short time that we may have we plan to achieve a lot, we have therefore created a bucket list for him that we hope people can support and assist us in achieving where possible. 'There is no treatment for this disease however if diagnosed early then there are potentially life-saving options available to those children. We are told that Zach's symptoms are too progressed for this to be an options, however if detected early enough he may have been.' To donate to Zach's wishlist quest, visit his fundraising page here.

"Rock legends can be a narcissistic bunch. But David Bowie appears to have taken things to a new level. The star, 68, has snapped up an entire collection of masks by a British artist which are replicas of his own face. He now plans to add them to an official archive documenting his career. His attention was reportedly drawn to the items by a team he employs to monitor the art world for pieces inspired by his life. Iconic: David Bowie has snapped up an entire collection of masks, pictured left,  by a British artist inspired by his face. Pictured right: Image from Bowie's Aladdin Sane LP cover . Some masks had previously been on sale as part of a Bowie exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum for £125, but speculation is the star paid much more for the ones he purchased. The masks were made from an original cast of the glam rock star’s face taken in the seventies to promote his film The Man who Fell to Earth. After lying unused for several decades, the cast was rediscovered by London-based artist Mark Wardel who began making replicas of Bowie’s face for fans, decorating them with designs including the classic lightning bolt look used on the cover of 1973 album Aladdin Sane. Wardel was recently contacted by Bowie’s agents who said the man himself was interested in purchasing all the others that he had in his collection. He has now bought up a set of six masks for an undisclosed figure. When asked if Bowie paid well for the pieces, Wardel replied: ‘Yep he did.’ The artist revealed: ‘I had a call before Christmas from Bowie’s agent saying the man himself was interested in buying some of my masks. ‘I wondered how he knew I had them but I was told Bowie employs people to keep a look out for people making images or art work of him. Bowie now plans to add the masks to an official archive documenting his career after being alerted to them by a team he employs to monitor the art world for pieces inspired by his life . ‘I was told not to worry as Bowie loves the mask and wants to buy them for his archive. ‘I spent days making two of them and sent them off to New York and got a message back saying Bowie loved them and thought they were gorgeous. He now wants to buy the whole set. ‘Because of Bowie’s interest I have now had to take them off the market. I am now making more to send to him and I will have a re-launch of them with an exhibition.’ A touring exhibition of items from Bowie’s archive has been arranged by the Victoria and Albert Museum. The David Bowie Is exhibition brings together more than 400 objects from the David Bowie Archives for the first time – including handwritten lyrics, original costumes, photography, set designs and album artwork from the last five decades. The pieces are currently being shown in Paris.","David Bowie, 68, bought set of masks which are replicas of his own face .

"British aid money may have been used to help corrupt regimes stamp out political opposition, a damning report warns today. The study by the government’s aid watchdog warns that a £52 million programme to help strengthen Bangladesh’s security services could have been used to target opponents of the regime. British aid money was used to train detectives in tracking mobile phones and analysing call data – skills which researchers warned could be used to ‘monitor and suppress political opposition groups’ in the country where corruption is endemic. A report claims British aid money may have been used to help corrupt regimes stamp out political opposition. Pictured: Police stand guard following demonstrations in the Democratic Republic of Congo . The Department for International Development (Dfid) initially said the officers involved were not involved in political activity. But when the Independent Commission on Aid Impact warned it would go public on its concerns, the project was scrapped. Dfid last night insisted there was ‘no evidence’ that funding had been misused. The commission’s report reveals that Dfid also funded training for the Bangladeshi police in taking fingerprints - including fingerprinting 40,000 convicted prisoners. But researchers questioned the value of the scheme in a country where fingerprint evidence is not admissible in court. The new study raised widespread concerns about the use of British aid to help so-called fragile states strengthen their police and security services. In Sudan, a programme to strengthen local police had to be abandoned in 2013 amid concerns about police brutality towards street children. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) a similar programme was scrapped last year after a United Nations report accused the Congolese national police of involvement in illegal killings. Today’s study gives the overall programme its second-lowest ‘amber-red’ rating, meaning that it is performing ‘relatively poorly’, with ‘significant improvements’ needed to achieve value for money. The report acknowledges the importance of trying to improve policing in some of the world’s poorest countries, where corruption and police brutality are often rife. The study by the government’s aid watchdog warns that a £52 million programme to help strengthen Bangladesh’s security services could have been used to target opponents of the regime . But it says that Dfid’s projects are ‘not making enough of a difference to the lives of the poor’. Watchdog chief Graham Ward said a ‘significant rethink’ was now needed to make the projects ‘more realistic and effective’. The study was scathing about a project to build ‘model police stations’ in a range of countries, including Nigeria, Bangladesh, Malawi, Sri Lanka and the DRC. The initiative was meant to raise standards by establishing beacons of good policing. The new ‘model’ stations were given extra cash for training and equipment. In Bangladesh, 15 of the new police stations were built. But the report finds that ‘perceptions of police performance are, by most measures, worse in model police stations than the national average’. The proportion of people saying they have been the victim of crime increased by 48 per cent in the period, while the proportion forced to pay bribes to police officers more than trebled. The study found there was ‘little evidence’ of improvement in police standards in Nigeria and the DRC – and warned that the model police stations were too expensive to ever be replicated across the country. However, the study did find some evidence that Dfid projects were helping reduce crime against women and girls in some countries. Dfid last night defended its strategy of investing in police and security forces. A spokesman said there was ‘no evidence’ that funding in Bangladesh had supported police repression of political dissidents. The spokesman said the project had been dropped following a ‘risk review’. She also defended the fingerprinting project, which she said would aid the detection of crime and reduce the reliance on forced confessions. She added: ‘Security and justice are the most challenging sectors we work in and Dfid focuses on countries with the biggest potential for improvement. We have made good process particularly in helping women and girls gain access to justice, but where concerns about human rights and instability become too high, we have no hesitation in shutting programmes down.’ But Labour said the report showed ministers had ‘no strategy’ for dealing with the issues.","Reports says £52m for Bangladesh’s security services used incorrectly .

"A family are furious after staff refused to allow their soya and dairy intolerant toddler to eat his special packed lunch in the restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot. They had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to dairy and soya, and planned to buy food for themselves from the zoo restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros (pictured with their son) had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot . But they were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead. The family refused and left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and vowed never to return. Osteopath Alex, 32, said: 'We explained the situation and as it was very cold outside I thought he would be understanding. 'I even said that if they had any dairy or soya-free food, we would buy that for Elliott. 'They didn't, but he still insisted he could not eat his lunch in the restaurant. The couple had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to lactose and soya . The couple had planned to buy their own lunch at Wingham Wildlife Park's restaurant (pictured) 'To be honest, we were pretty upset because it seemed totally unreasonable. It's not as if the place was packed because there were plenty of places to sit. 'I wasn't prepared for Elliott to have to eat his lunch outside in the cold and told the owner that we had two choices - either we were allowed to sit indoors or we would have to leave. 'But he wouldn't budge so we left after spending £30 to get in and having a visit that lasted just a couple of hours.' Alex, of Broadstairs, Kent, added: 'It was actually Coral's 32nd birthday and we thought it would be a nice day out, but sadly it wasn't. 'We had been to the park before with a young niece and enjoyed the experience but this time we just felt angry and hurt and certainly won't be going back.' Markus Wilder, curator of the animal collection, disputed the family's claim there was no options for their son at the cafe. 'We have a menu of 55 items and there are only ten of them that contain soya or dairy,' he said. 'Any of our cooked meals he would have been fine to eat; we have jacket potatoes, burgers...' But the family were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead . The family left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and have since vowed never to return . Mr Wilder said the family had been asked to leave the restaurant due to the park's strict policy but claimed they had been offered their own private room instead. 'We're only a fairly small park, and we have fairly limited seating so we have a policy that you cannot eat outside food from outside in the restaurant. It applies across the board. 'The trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch, then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused. 'It just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days. 'In this case, I spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors, but the mother, in particular, still wasn't happy. 'We also have covered areas outside for people who bring their own food. 'We are looking at expanding the food range to accommodate more needs but our animals must come first and we can't direct funding away from them.'","Alex and Coral Pouros  paid £30 to take son Elliot to Wingham Wildlife Park .

"Overly ambitious, feasible or simply just a scam - whatever your view on the Mars One mission, it has at least inspired people to think of colonising other worlds. And now a sketch for the project has revealed the habitat the first astronauts on Mars could reside in - if they ever get there. It includes living quarters, a laboratory, a greenhouse and even a holodeck to give the crew the best conditions possible on the red planet. Hover cursor over the image below to zoom in . Danish space architect Kristian von Bengtson revealed his sketch for Mars One's habitat on the red planet (shown). The concept includes living quarters, a laboratory and even a holodeck. There are two habitats in total, one for 'living' (left) and one for 'work' (right). Credit: Kristian von Bengtson/MarsOne . The concept, drawn up by Mars One's Capsule and Outpost Manager, Kristian von Bengtson from Denmark, consists of two long cylindrical inflatable habitats - with a total area of 2,150 square feet (200 square metres). In February 100 people - including five Britons - were shortlisted for the questionable Mars One mission, which claims it will send people to live on the red planet. They are hoping to be chosen to be among the final crew of four who are set to begin their new lives in just 10 years time - and ultimately die on Mars. The team is scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a gruelling seven-month journey from Earth. 'The large cut in candidates [from 200,000 to 100] is an important step towards finding out who has the right stuff to go to Mars,' said Bas Lansdorp, co-founder of the Dutch Mars One mission. 'These aspiring Martians provide the world with a glimpse into who the modern day explorers will be.' The Mars 100 Round Three candidates were selected from a pool of 660 candidates after participating in personal online interviews. They include 50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round. At the front, each has a module to which a lander can attach and the crew can enter. One of the habitats is designed more for living, while the other seems to be geared more towards work. In the residential habitat, there is a kitchen for food preparation with a total area of 320 square feet (30 square metres). Moving further into the habitat and you come to a social area of a similar area, which has a ‘holodeck’ to keep the crew entertained. This appears to consist of screens on the walls of the habitat, to simulate being in another environment. Further along, are the private crew quarters, measuring about 65 square feet (six square metres). And finally, the crop section, which grows the food the astronauts will need to survive, is found at the end. It has a watering system and humidity controls to keep everything in working order. In the ‘work’ habitat, there is a laboratory and science section for various experiments - including an insects cabinet and biology laboratory. There’s also a storage area to keep cargo, while the section is also curtailed by a crop system as well. Mars One made headlines around the world in February when it revealed the final longlist of 100 applicants who will train on Earth for a one-way mission to the red planet in 2025. But the proposed mission has been widely criticised ever since it was first announced in 2011 - and experts have said this latest announcement does nothing to silence the sceptics. Lack of funding, no signs of development and an overly ambitious ‘reality TV’ approach have all been cited as reasons that Mars One will never be more than a pipe dream. ‘You have to applaud the ambition, but sadly the whole project feels very much like wing-and-a-prayer stuff when you start to look into the details,’ Giles Sparrow, author of Mars: A New View of the Red Planet, told MailOnline. ‘They say they can put a first crew on Mars for $6 billion [£3.9 billion], which is a shoestring budget compared to the Apollo programme which cost $25 billion [£16.2 billion] - and that was in 1960s money!’ It could be you: Pictured are some of the Mars One hopefuls, who will be spending eight years in training ahead of what they think will be a mission to Mars, although the mission has been widely criticised for the lack of a feasible plan to actually get to the red planet . In the sketch the habitat has a social area with a ‘holodeck’ to keep the crew entertained. This appears to consist of screens on the walls of the habitat, to simulate being in another environment - so it'll likely be a bit more primitive than the holodeck used in Star Trek (shown) Dr Lewis Dartnell from the Space Research Centre at the University of Leicester added: ‘‘There are a large number of technological considerations for safely sending a human mission to Mars. ‘These include the long-term reliability of life-support systems and how to grow sufficient food and for a balanced diet, and these necessary technologies are not yet mature enough or well-tested in less risky situations -such as on a moon base. ‘But even the first step of securing enough large rockets to launch the mission to Mars has not been demonstrated by Mars One.’ However CEO and co-founder of Mars One responded to the criticism, telling MailOnline he believed they ‘have a good plan and we can overcome the challenges.’ Later in February, though, the production company Endemol announced they would no longer be making an accompanying TV show for the venture. This would have documented the training and lives of the astronauts on the red planet. Mars One said they were now working with a new production company to record the colonists’ progress. The latest sketch seems to be a bit different to previous concepts shown by Mars One. This one shows habitats and a rover on the surface. Who will build these habitats is not quite clear, although they appear to bear some similarity to SpaceX's proposed Red Dragon capsule .","Danish space architect Kristian von Bengtson revealed his sketch for Mars One's habitat on the red planet .

"Beef has been wiped off  restaurant menus across Mumbai after its state government said it will now enforce laws making possession of the meat and the slaughter of cows illegal. But steak and kidney pie will continue to be served up at one of India's oldest British Raj-era clubs in defiance of the ban. The law was passed by the state of Maharashtra around 20 years ago, but not implemented until now by a new Hindu nationalist administration. Still on the menu: The British Raj-era Royal Bombay Yacht Club (above) in Mumbai has vowed to continue serving steak and kidney pies despite a state-wide ban on the possession of beef or the slaughter of cows . Violators could face a fine and up to five years in prison. Residents expressed outrage on Twitter using the hashtag #BanBeef - which topped the social network's trends, appearing more than 22,000 times in less than 24 hours. But panicked steak lovers will have a safe haven at the Royal Bombay Yacht Club, Mumbai, which will continue to serve its steak and kidney pies to customers. The 170-year-old club has said it will keep steak on the menu by sticking to its original recipes using 'buff' - buffalo meat - rather than beef for the pies. Club president Ardhendu Bose felt pessimistic about the ban until he realised that the leaner buffalo meat used in their recipes would leave the club's menu intact, he told the Daily Telegraph. On Wednesday night, the club served both steak and kidney and steak and onion pies, with parsley potatoes and sautéed cauliflower to reassured customers. 'I spoke to my vice president and said ""we should do something, we don't want to get into trouble"". 'But he said buffalo is allowed, so we'll carry on as usual', he said. Loophole: The 170-year-old club has said it will keep steak on the menu by sticking to its original recipes using 'buff' - buffalo meat - rather than beef for the pies . The 112-year-old Taj Mahal Palace Hotel removed beef from the menus on Wednesday, according to chief sommelier Abhas Saxena - including its 'really sought-after' Chateaubriand steak. Mr Saxena said: 'Beef has been on the hotel's menu for many years. 'Our signature restaurants were affected by the ban so we will have to look again at the dynamics of their menus. 'Our Chateaubriand, the tornado - a cut of meat - the tenderloin, the veal, all of that has been removed. It will definitely affect our business.' He added: 'We still need to understand the thought process behind the ban. 'There are many segments of society being affected by this - from the folks who grow the cattle, to us who would be selling it.' Hindus, who make up 80 per cent of India's 1.2billion population, consider cows sacred. But large numbers of the population - particularly the extremes of the international elite and the poor - eat beef.","Ban passed 20 years ago, but only enacted now by new Hindu nationalists .

Djoko Hariutomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar placed his hand on Andrew Chan's shoulder and smiled for the camera, and then appeared in a second photograph with his hand on the shoulder of Sukumaran who was captured gazing up at the officer. The Bali Nine duo were then taken on a two hour flight to the port town of Cilacap and transferred to Nusakambangan island where they are expected to face a firing squad in an area known locally as 'Death Valley', a lush green clearing amid citrus orchards and banana palms. The spot is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan, which is also known as 'Death Island', and it is the place where just under seven weeks ago the Indonesian Government executed five  drug smugglers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand upon the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan inside the plane before take off for the Australian Bali Nine kingpin's final flight to the island where he will be executed . Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before their take off from Denpasar airport for the two hour flight to 'death island' The family of condemned Australian drug smuggler Andrew Chan, his mother Helen (centre) and brother Michael (wearing pink shorts) arrive at Yogyakarta airport on Thursday to make the five hour drive to Cilacap in central Java and take a boat to Nusakambangan island where Chan is waiting to be executed . Myuran Sukumaran's mother Raji (right) and sister Brintha (centre) on the tarmac at Yogyakarta, the closest main airport to the port town of Cilacap to which they will drive on Thursday afternoon to visit him in Batu prison on Nusakambangan island where the Bali Nine duo was transferred to under high security this week . Last place on earth: This is Nirbaya, also known as 'Death Valley', the place where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will likely be taken for their executions and located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells . This is the spot to which the Indonesians took five foreign drug smugglers this year, tied them to three metre poles and executed them each with 12-member firing squads at around 12.40am local time  on Sunday, January 18 . It is not known how the prisoners destined for execution will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan Island off southern central Java . This weather beaten hut in Nirbaya or Death Valley sits near the sport where foreign drug smugglers were executed in January and where the Australian Bali Nine duo may be taken soon and put to the firing squad . Final journey: The jungle and rainforest of Nuskambangan prison island looms over the Barracuda armoured personnel van carrying Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as they arrive off the police boat on Wednesday following their final plane flight, from Bali to Cilacap in southern Java . And this place, up a winding dirt track just 3km from where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells, is likely to soon be their last place on earth. Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south. At around 12.40am on January 18 this year, five drug traffickers were reportedly shot by firing squads in or around this place. Shackled and handcuffed, Andrew Chan cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Korobokan prison in Bali to their final destination, Death Island . Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in central Java, Indonesia, only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside Kerobokan prison on the island of Bali . This is the exterior of Batu prison on Nuskambangan island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran ahead of their scheduled execution by firing squad . Indonesia executed a total of six drug traffickers on January 18, but Vienamese woman Tran Thi Bich Hanh met her fate on the mainland of central java at a place called Boyolali. The five executed at Nirbaya on Nuskambangan were Brazilian Marco Archer Moreiea, 53, who smuggled 13kg of coaine in hangliding equipment to Bali in 2004, Dutch national Ang Kiem Soei, who ran an Ecstasy factory, Namaona Denis, 48, Indonesian woman, Rani Andriani, 38, and Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, 38, a Muslim who elected to be buried on the island. The lead up to execution in 'Death Valley' has been well documented. Under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in Indonesia's criminal act of 1964, the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out. They are reportedly allowed three 'last requests' but these may only be in the form of final statements, such as that from Ms Andriani who wrote, 'Submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'. Channel One Indonesia took a camera to Nirbaya (above) on Nusakambangan pirson island  prior to the first round of executions which took place in January and completed death sentences for one Indonesian woman and four men from Brazil, Nigeria, Malawi and the Netherlands . Port of no return: Sodong port (above) on Nusakambangan Island was the dropping off point on Wednesday for the Australian Bali Nine duo before being taken by road on to the prison where they are currently being held in isolation . Dressed in simple, white clothing, they are accompanied by a physician, clergy and an 'execution attorney' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled  for each prisoner. In the case of Nirbaya, the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth. At a clearing, three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner. When the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready, the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing, sitting or kneeling for their execution. A black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to 'calm down' before the execution takes place. Although a clergyman of the prisoner's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites, Brazilian Marco Archer was reportedly denied access to Cilacap's Catholic priest Charles Burrows and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner, but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to Nirbaya.","The likely place on the island for the Bali 9 duo's execution is called Nirbaya .

"Anti-drugs lessons in schools may encourage pupils to try illegal substances rather than steer clear of them, Government experts have warned. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said there was evidence that raising awareness could be counter-productive. Its report said prevention classes that have been taught for generations were ‘ineffective at changing behaviour’ and ‘may even increase the risk of drug use’. Scroll down for video . Anti-drugs lessons in schools may encourage pupils to try illegal substances rather than steer clear of them, Government experts have warned (file picture) The board, which hit the headlines in 2009 after its then-chairman Professor David Nutt was fired for suggesting that alcohol and tobacco were more harmful than many illegal drugs, passed its findings to Home Secretary Theresa May last month, the Daily Telegraph reported. It urged the government to cut funding unless there is good evidence that anti-drugs initiatives, such as 2003’s ‘Talk to Frank’ campaign are working. The report also said that hard-hitting school talks by policemen may make drugs appear ‘sexy’ to teenagers, while adverts that intended to conjure a ‘fear’ of drugs were also criticised as potentially counter-productive. Many schools have already switched to behaviour-led measures that help children to avoid peer pressure, but experts have urged for faster and more wide-covering progress. Its report said prevention classes that have been taught for generations were ‘ineffective at changing behaviour’ and ‘may even increase the risk of drug use’ (file picture) However, the report does concede that there is growing evidence of the importance of teaching drug prevention as part of a broader strategy to improve national health. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Preventing and reducing drug misuse is a key part of our drug strategy and there are positive signs our approach is working. ‘There has been a long term downward trend in drug use over the last decade, the number of heroin and crack cocaine users in England continues to decline, and more people are recovering from their dependency now than in 2009-10. ‘Our evidence-based approach recognises the importance of having a range of prevention initiatives to give individuals the confidence to resist drugs. We welcome the ACMD’s advice on this important issue.’","Experts warn anti-drugs lessons may encourage pupils to try substances .

"His daughter is barely clinging onto life after a suspected drug overdose. But Bobby Brown appeared on a talk show today selling his barbecue sauce - and saying that Bobbi Kristina was 'doing really well'. The pre-recorded segment of Queen Latifah was accompanied by a brief on-screen warning that the interview was 'previously recorded'. But it was not shown throughout the segment, which was broadcast on network affiliate stations around the country. Daily Mail Online has reached out to Sony Pictures, which produces the Queen Latifah show to ask why it was aired. Warning: Viewers were told briefly when Bobby brown arrived on the Queen Latifah show that it was made before his daughter was found drowned in her bath tub . In the course of his appearance, Brown said that his daughter was 'great' and busy working on her music. He joked about how he doesn't like working out and said that Bobbi Kristina had 'the voice of her mother'. But the decision to air it regardless will be seen by many to be in bad taste. Bobbi Kristina is currently unconscious in an Atlanta hospital room after she was found unresponsive in her bathtub on January 31 in a chilling echo of how her mother Whitney Houston died. Her family have said she is 'still fighting' but reports have claimed that she could suffer from serious brain damage if she ever manages to leave the hospital. Pictures this week showed Brown, 46, looking forlorn with his eyes puffy beneath a beanie as he grappled with the tragedy that has befallen his family. Distraught: Bobby Brown earlier this week in a state of apparent distress and exhaustion after visiting his daughter . Promotion: Brown was on the show to push his range of barbecue sauces. But since his daughter's drowning he has been at the hospital where she is fighting for her life . But on the Queen Latifah show he seemed relaxed and in good humor. With a smile on his face, Brown cooked some shrimp and rice for Latifah to show off his range of barbecue sauces, which he launched last summer. Brown said: 'Smell it! 'When you smell good food, that's when you go into a place to eat, when you can smell it from outside. Fresh peppers and herbs and garlic.' Asked how things are going with his family, Brown said: 'Everybody's great. 'Two of my sons are working on LPs. They drive me crazy, but, you know. They do their thing and I just stand to the side. 'My oldest daughter LaPrincia is still in school getting her masters and I'm so proud of her. Cooking: Brown was also seen working on his range of sauces before making small talk with Queen Latifah . Together: Bobbi Kristina and her father Bobby brown pictured together when she was younger . Ordeal: Bobbi Kristina is in hospital while her boyfriend Nick Gordon is at odds with her father . 'Bobbi Kristina, who everybody knows, she's doing really well. 'Working on her music, I'm so proud of her. I am so proud of her. She has the voice of her mother and the legs of her father.' Brown added that his late wife's performance album had just come out - it was released in November last year - and that he was thinking of quitting music. He said: 'I've decided to, I don't know, the music business has gotten so strange that I plan on recording probably the last album and I'm gunna call it. 'I'm 45 years old. Forty five years old! I feel it one good last album and I want to go and sit with my grandchildren and just chill. 'You have to understand, I've been doing this for almost 35 years, my legs are tired. I love dancing and singing, it's just the workout part. 'Alright, alright, two miles is enough, to be on a treadmill and lifting weights. It's all cool to be healthy but, it's not really cool when you don't wanna do it no more.' Brown added that he was also working on his memoirs so 'people know the truth about my life'. Latifah's show was cancelled in December last year although new episodes were scheduled to run until the end of March.","Bobbi Kristina Brown is fighting for her life after being found face down in bath tub of her Georgia home .

"If the thought of running on a treadmill makes you shudder, then you may soon have an excuse to avoid it altogether. US researchers claim they have found  a hormone that mimics the effects of exercise, allowing people to lose weight and regulate their blood sugar. The hormone, dubbed MOTS-c, has been proven to work in mice and clinical trials on humans could begin in three years. US researchers claim they have found a hormone that mimics the effects of exercise, allowing people to lose weight and regulate their blood sugar. The hormone, dubbed MOTS-c, has been proven to work in mice and clinical trials on humans could begin in three years . The discovery of MOTS-c - a molecule that acts as a signal for the body - was made by scientists at the University of Southern California. MOTS-c works by increasing insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to more effectively process glucose sugars, researchers claim. Insulin is a hormone that moves the sugars from food into the blood stream. Resistance to insulin can be triggered by a poor diet and may lead to type 2 diabetes. The hormone mainly targets muscle tissue, where it restores insulin sensitivity, counteracting diet-induced and age-dependent insulin resistance. The hormone may give people yet another excuse to avoid the gym. But researchers say its real benefits are in tackling age-related diseases, such as diabetes . 'This represents a major advance in the identification of new treatments for age-related diseases such as diabetes,' said Pinchas Cohen,a researcher at the University of Southern California. MOTS-c works by increasing insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to more effectively process glucose sugars, researchers claim. Insulin is a hormone that moves the sugars from food into the blood stream. Resistance to insulin can be triggered by a poor diet and may lead to type 2 diabetes. The hormone mainly targets muscle tissue, where it restores insulin sensitivity, counteracting diet-induced and age-dependent insulin resistance. To test the effects of MOTS-c, the team injected the hormone into mice fed a high-fat diet, which typically causes them to grow obese and develop a resistance to insulin. The injections not only suppressed both effects in mice, they also reversed age-dependent insulin-resistance, a condition that precedes diabetes. 'This discovery sheds new light on mitochondria and positions them as active regulators of metabolism,' said Changhan Lee, assistant professor at USC Davis and lead author of the study. MOTS-c is unique among hormones in that it is encoded in the DNA of mitochondria - the 'powerhouses' of cells that convert food into energy. Other hormones are encoded in DNA in the nucleus. While all of the experiments on MOTS-c to date have been performed on lab mice, the molecular mechanisms that make it work in mice exist in all mammals, including humans. The MOTS-c intellectual property has been licensed to a biotechnology company, and clinical trials in humans could begin within the next three years, researchers said.","The MOTS-c hormone has so far been proven to work in mice .

"The English don’t actually care much for music,’ said Sir Thomas Beecham, the great 20th-century conductor and noted wit, ‘but they love the sound it makes!’ This week the sound that has filled our concert halls and all the spaces where music-lovers gather has been of loud cheering. When it was announced on Tuesday that Sir Simon Rattle will be coming home from Germany in 2017 to run the London Symphony Orchestra, whoops of delight could be heard all the way from London’s Barbican Centre, where the LSO play, to Menlove Avenue,Woolton, the middle-class suburb of Liverpool where Rattle was born 60 years ago. The most remarkable English classical musician since the celebrated Beecham, Rattle has scaled the highest peaks. Appointed CBE at the ripe old age of 32, he was knighted seven years later, and elected principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, the world’s most formidable orchestra, at 44. Conductor Sir Simon Rattle is to join London Symphony Orchestra as music director . In an age of overpaid footballers and gruesome shows like The X Factor, an age when the mediocre wear garlands tossed by dullards, here is a man who has truly earned his laurel crown. When he received the weighty badge of the Order of Merit last summer (‘Don’t try conducting with this thing on!’ the Queen told him at the investiture) it was formal recognition that he belonged to the best of the best. Now the man who conquered the world is coming home to join our leading orchestra and, what’s more, he sees his role not just as a conductor but as an ambassador, an educator, whose duty is to boost musical talent wherever he can. ‘Frankly,’ he says, ‘what goes on in the primary school is going to be just as important as what goes on in any concert hall.’ Knowing Rattle as I do, this was no throw-away remark. Talk of greatness is usually misplaced. There are never many truly great performers in any field. So when they do come along it is our duty to recognise the special gifts that lift them above the pack. We could call it the Federer distinction. Roger Federer is a great tennis player, perhaps the greatest; Andy Murray is merely very good. In the performing arts it can be difficult to describe what greatness looks like because, unlike in sport, there are no clear winners and losers. Over time, however, you have a sense of those who achieve it. Laurence Olivier, for instance, was a great actor. Rudolf Nureyev was a great dancer. Frank Sinatra was a great singer. And Sir Simon Rattle is unquestionably a great musician. Born on the same road in Liverpool as John Lennon, Rattle was at primary school when The Beatles took off like a rocket. No magical mystery tours for him, though. The Rattler, as he is known, was a bookish child, who played the piano and was later a percussionist in the National Youth Orchestra. ‘I tried to interest him in cricket and football’, said his father Denis, ‘but he always seemed to have his head in a music score.’ Sir Simon (right), whose youngest child with Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kožená (left), 41, is seven months old, has directed the Berlin Philharmonic since 2002 . Denis Rattle, originally from Kent, was a businessman who taught English in his retirement. At Oxford University, where he knew Sir Edward Heath, he had played in a jazz band, so he did nothing to discourage his son’s enthusiasm for music. When Denis and Pauline Rattle took their son to see the comedian Al Read at the Liverpool Empire, the five-year-old stopped the show. So many members of the audience were amused by the sight of a curious little boy leaving his seat to peer into the orchestra pit that Read had to tell him: ‘Come on, lad. I’ve got a show to do!’ The young Rattle never set foot in Liverpool’s football ground Anfield or Everton’s Goodison Park as his father might have wished but he was a regular at the city’s wonderful Philharmonic Hall where, in 1966, his life changed for ever. Gustav Mahler’s mighty Second Symphony, the Resurrection, despite its challenging discords, made him realise even then, aged 11, that he wanted to be a conductor. And now he was determined to learn how. He studied music scores his sister brought home from the library; he pored over composers’ writings on orchestration. He would write down the percussion parts of big orchestral pieces, gather friends and family, and hand out those parts so he could conduct his impromptu orchestra while a record of the music played in the background. When he was 15, he cajoled enough musicians together to form a proper orchestra and stage a charity event at Liverpool’s College Hall. It was a resounding success. Rattle’s days as conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra are the stuff of legend. When he went there aged 25 in 1980 he was, musically speaking, barely out of short pants and the orchestra was at best lacklustre. When he left 18 years later as a knight of the realm, the CBSO was acclaimed as one of the world’s finest orchestras, and had a magnificent new home. Symphony Hall, which opened in June 1991 as a result of Rattle’s persistence and enlightened cross-party political co-operation, remains the best concert hall in Britain. So when people talk about the cultural development of Birmingham, and Rattle’s substantial part in it, they are not fibbing. The question is: what can he do for London and Britain? The signs are promising. There is a clear will to build a concert hall worthy of London’s unrivalled reputation as a city of culture and Rattle knows, for he is no fool, that his appointment can only assist the process. In the City they are no fools either. Everybody understands that, with Rattle at the helm of such a fine orchestra, the LSO could become world-beaters not only in public performances but also in the world of music education. Rattle sees his role not just as a conductor but as an ambassador, an educator, whose duty is to boost musical talent wherever he can . Rattle once described how moving it was to bring deaf children into rehearsals in Birmingham, and see how they responded through vibration alone to the experience of a Beethoven symphony. In Berlin he wasted no time in working with children from the city’s less well-off backgrounds, involving them in dance collaborations with the Berlin Philharmonic. Some musicians, brought up in the old school, were sceptical but not for long. ‘What Simon wants’, musicians used to say, ‘Simon gets’. Which is why his return to London is so thrilling, and so important. In a world of show-offs and halfwits, here is a man with the faith and willpower to move mountains: not on his own behalf but for an art form itself. He believes that great music can transform lives. Describing Leonard Bernstein, the great American conductor and educator, who wrote West Side Story in his spare time, a musician once said: ‘Lenny reminds you why you wanted to become a musician in the first place.’ That is Rattle’s talent too but how he achieves it is hard to pin down. It is the conductor who makes all the difference as to whether a performance sinks or swims. What you see as he steps on to the podium, is the tip of a vast iceberg of activity involving planning, preparing, rehearsing, managing schedules and endless background work to understand the music. This is what helps make Simon Rattle one of the world’s greatest, says his biographer Sir Nicholas Kenyon: ‘He is a meticulous planner, has a fantastic insight for the right combination of pieces in a concert programme and is a brilliant pacer and galvaniser of rehearsals, knowing exactly what he has to achieve and motivating his players accordingly.’ But it still fails to explain his achievements. When his performances take off, musicians and audiences alike would rather be nowhere else. It isn’t so much a matter of his technique with the conductor’s baton, or bringing in the trombones when they’re feeling left out as something undefinable. In 1999, a critic memorably described him on the podium: ‘Sometimes he bent to his knees, puffed his cheeks and mimed a straw-chewing yokel to encourage a proportionate rustic attitude in his players. That was especially during Beethoven’s “Pastoral” Symphony...During the pizzicato interlude in Mahler’s Second Symphony, he dropped his hands to his sides and encouraged his band just to pluck ’n’ swing.’ What audiences see in Rattle is a man who feels that, for as long as he is conducting it, that piece is the most important thing in the world. Musicians, hardly sentimental, are happy to follow him because every concert is an adventure. As Rattle says: ‘Always the journey, never the destination’. His genius, as it always will be with the greats, is that he possesses an alignment of mind and heart that cannot be taught. ‘Simon can achieve things in a performance,’ a Berlin musician said last week, ‘that can never be learnt.’ Now he is coming home for what he calls ‘one last challenge’. To which we can only cry: ‘Hurrah!’","Sir Simon Rattle to join the London Symphony Orchestra as music director .

"Gone are the days of Pamela Anderson running in slow motion through the surf. A British company has invented the world's first lifeguard drone - which could soon replace the human lifesavers on a beach near you. The drones, carrying cameras and rubber rings, can be sent out by lifeguards from the shore, and can allegedly rescue drowning holiday makers quicker than humans, who'd have to battle through the waves. Amin Rigi, 28, co-founder of RTS Ideas, launched the business in Iran but has moved to London after gaining start-up support and will present a prototype next month. Complete with lights and thermal cameras for night rescues, the drones could appear on holiday beaches in time for summer, even aiding with rescues of ships and yachts in trouble. 'At the moment many people talk about bad drones and drones that are spying and killing people but I think everything has a good side and a bad side,' said Rigi. Pamela Anderson in 1990s TV show Baywatch: Many fans fondly remember her trademark red swimsuit . 'People should see the good side to drones where they can save lives' he said. 'The drones can reach people stranded at sea far quicker than lifeguards and can deploy three buoyancy aids in one flight.' Rigi and his business partner partner Amir Taheri, 27, hope that one day the drones will be stationed on floating platforms where they can be charged from solar energy. The drones can reach people  far quicker than lifeguards and can deploy three buoyancy aids in one flight . 'This is the future of lifeguards I believe,' Rigi said. 'In a competition, we found a lifeguard could perform a rescue in 90 seconds, but the drone took 20 seconds. That 70 seconds could be the difference between life and death. 'Finding people is hard with rescue teams. Moving in boats, you don't get good vision.But the drones' range and height can spot a drowning person, which is really helpful for ships. Eventually the drones may be stationed on floating platforms where they can be charged from solar energy . 'A rescue team could take 10 to 12 minutes where a drone could take one minute. Basically this increases the efficiency and decreases danger to lifeguards. RTS Ideas, based in Tech City, in Shoreditch, east London, are also hoping to develop a drone that can perform mountain rescues. In one of the UK's main holiday hotspots, Cornwall and Devon, more than 8,500 people were caught up in beach and sea rescue dramas last year. Research showed that a lifeguard could perform a rescue in 90 seconds while the drone took just 20 seconds . The inventors are hoping to decrease the number of people that drown by up to 60 per cent . Perranporth alone had 1,000 incidents, according to the RNLI. 'We haven't any contacts for Cornwall yet but hopefully we can deploy this at beaches in the UK and right around the world,' said Rigi. 'We're looking forward to hopefully decreasing the number of people that drown by up to 60 per cent with new technologies, where our drone is one of those technologies. 'We're not totally using autonomous drones in the first stage. The company hopes to deploy their invention at beaches in the UK as well as around the world . 'We're using human intelligence on one side and the abilities of this technology to save lives quicker and more efficiently.' Charlie Johnstone, a surfer who works in Porthtowan, said: 'I'm not sure how they're going to be programmed and how the drones would react to different people. But Jemima Barry, who works on Seaton beach, thinks the idea could take off. She said: 'As long as it wouldn't take over the lifeguards and ruin their jobs then it's a good thing. 'So long as the lifeguards were still there - because you still need humans who know what to do.'","British company invents a drone to rescue holiday makers in trouble .

"He is fashion's lifelong enfant terrible who created that iconic conical bra for Madonna. And now Jean Paul Gaultier is set to unveil an exclusive retrospective of work  at an internationally renowned charity gala event after forty years in the fashion industry. Jean Paul Gaultier, who has created pieces for Beyonce, Kylie Minogue and Beth Ditto, will unveil his work at the Life Ball catwalk in May, twenty years after he first showed there. Scroll down for video . Jean Paul Gaultier, who has been celebrated in the fashion industry for 40 years, will unveil an exclusive retrospective of work at an internationally renowned charity gala event in May . Proving his worth as one of the industry's most esteemed designers, the 62-year-old joins a hallowed hall of famed designers who have exhibited there, including  John Galliano and Julien Macdonald. With gold as this year’s Life Ball theme, taking inspiration from the exquisite baroque Vienna Secessionists, the couture show will follow the vibrant and ostentatious theme with a bevy of internationally acclaimed supermodels set to walk for well-connected Jean Paul. In true opulent style, Jean's catwalk will be inspired by the Vienna Secession building. The glitzy ball is the biggest charity event in Europe supporting people with HIV or AIDS. The iconic French designer has been extremely active in the continued fight against HIV and AIDS for many years and was notably given amfAR’s Award of Courage in 2010. Jean Paul, pictured with actress Gemma Arterton, joins a hallowed hall of famed designers who have exhibited there, including John Galliano and Julien Macdonald . He designed outfits for Madonna during the nineties, including the famous cone bra for her 1990 Blond Ambition Tour, right, and curated her entire Confessions Tour wardrobe in 2006 . Known for being inspired by strong female muses, including Dita Von Teese, who was one his show's muses, Gaultier says he set out to change the image of women as passive, subservient characters . Speaking about the event, Life Ball founder and activist Gery Keszler said: ‘It is phenomenal to have Jean Paul on board for this year’s catwalk show. 'The fashion show has become one of the lasting images of the Life Ball opening ceremony and it is fantastic to have such an icon help us with Life Ball 23. 'Jean Paul has long been an activist in our ongoing fight against HIV AIDs, it is always wonderful to have active supporters who truly wish to change the face of modern day AIDs as part of the Life Ball. 'This year’s event is certain to be bigger than ever with unbelievable attendees and performers and incredible projects that we are working with.' Jean Paul's show will be watched from the front row by actress Charlize Theron, who will attend on behalf of her foundation Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project. Theron will join a bevy of A-list celebrities and performers, who pour into Vienna annually to help fight against HIV at the world’s largest AIDS event. Jean Paul's famous fans and friends include Naomi Campbell, left, who walked in his 2015 Haute Couture Spring-Summer show this year, and Rihanna, right, wearing one of his dresses to the Grammys . The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project, based in her home country of South Africa, is dedicated to addressing HIV AIDS in adolescents across sub-Saharan Africa through education, grant giving, networking and community outreach. Theron will give a keynote speech at the First Ladies Luncheon at the Belvedere Castle in Vienna ahead of attending the Life Ball, where she will present the work of her organisation and her vision for and AIDS-free generation. Charlize Theron will join a bevy of A-list celebrities and performers at the event, which helps raise money to fight AIDS . Jean Paul has previously spoken about how his love of fashion first began. At school, while the other boys played football, he drew sketches of women in fishnet tights. He said: 'My teacher made me put my hand out and hit me, she then pinned the sketch on my back and made me parade around the class. She wanted to humiliate me. But in the end, all the boys were saying ""can you do a sketch for me!"". 'It showed me that it could be a passport and it could open doors and people could love me. So I went on to sketch and sketch and sketch and then made clothes.' His schoolboy dream led him to become a catwalk pioneer, introducing latex and S&M to the world of high fashion.

"A middle-aged accounts manager claims he was forced by a female boss to dress up as Father Christmas while working at Dow Jones because he was older than everyone else (stock picture) A middle-aged accounts manager claims he was forced by a female boss to dress up as Father Christmas while working at Dow Jones because he was older than everyone else. James McClellan, 53, claims he was forced out of the company because of  sexism and ageism at the hands of a younger female manager. He is now suing the financial news and publishing giant claiming he was sidelined as an accounts payable manager for the company in London, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch. In documents lodged at the Central London Employment Tribunal, the father-of-three from Maidstone in Kent, said he was painted as a 'misogynist' and told by his manager Azmina Airi that he underestimated 'the girls'. But he insists he was just raising 'grave concerns' his team was being overstretched, and said he was made to feel singled out by Ms Airi. In the statement he said: 'At our first meeting she informed me that she had been observing me and was of the view that I was 'rigid and stuck in my ways'. 'I found this offensive suggesting that she was judging me on the basis of my age and her pre-conception of how set in their ways a middle aged person is. 'At Christmas 2013 she demanded that I dress up as the secret Santa. I was given no option and again felt that I was being discriminated against on the basis of age. I found the experience uncomfortable.' He added: 'She selected me because I was the 'nice old buffer' everyone liked. I would be happy to suffer the embarrassment.' Mr McClellan began working at Dow Jones in May 2011 to manage accounts payable. In documents lodged at the Central London Employment Tribunal James McClellan, said he was painted as a 'misogynist' and told by his manager Azmina Airi that he underestimated 'the girls' In October 2013 Ms Airi joined the team and became his manager, overseeing the roll-out of a new payroll system. But Mr McClellan raised concerns the team could not cope with the new demands being placed on them. He said: 'The team were at their very limits and subjected to, what I considered, dangerously high levels of stress. I was concerned for the welfare of my team.' He said the team had to take on pension administration responsibilities, but he felt they 'did not have the capacity training or skills to take this on at this time' He is now suing the financial news and publishing giant claiming he was sidelined as an accounts payable manager for the company, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch . He said: 'I raised this with her and asked her to defer these incremental changes until the project was ended and there would be more time to get this done properly. 'She flatly refused stating that I was being deliberately uncooperative and that I underestimated the ability of 'the girls'. 'I found this very offensive as she was implying that as a middle aged man I was a misogynist with little respect for the abilities of women. ' I find this an offensive stereotype.' He said the pair had meetings to clear the air, 'but because of her discriminatory views of me as a middle aged man she was completely unwilling to listen to my concerns'. He branded the workplace an 'ageist environment'. He said his job had been made impossible and he resigned in February last year. He is claiming constructive dismissal, age and sex discrimination, and whistleblowing. Dow Jones deny the allegations. The tribunal continues.","James McClellan 'was forced out of Dow Jones by sexism and ageism'

"A fare dodger who was caught forging his own first class train tickets has been ordered to pay back £17,000. Mark Mason, 44, parked in executive car parks and enjoyed luxury travel across the country for free using the fake first class rail and parking tickets. A search of the fraudster's home revealed a sophisticated forgery set-up which included fake and genuine tickets, glossy photographic paper, computers and printers, as well as craft knives, scissors and a cutting board. Fare dodger Mark Mason parked in executive car parks and enjoyed first class travel using tickets he forged at home. Pictured: Four of Mason's fake seasons tickets, which allowed him to travel from Doncaster . Now Mason has been ordered to pay back £17,884 over six months after he was convicted of fraud charges relating to 85 tickets used over a period of 21 months. At a proceeds of crime hearing Mason, a contract worker, was told failure to pay will result in a default sentence of 12 months in prison. Detective Constable David Williams, a financial investigator said: 'This sentence sends a clear message to anyone thinking of trying to evade payment of train fares and parking that it really isn't worth it.' A search of the fraudster's home revealed a sophisticated  set-up to make the fake train travel and parking tickets, including a software package which allowed him to design the counterfeit tickets (pictured) After raiding Mason's home, police found fake and genuine tickets, glossy photographic paper,  printers, as well as craft knives, scissors and a cutting board, which were all used in the ticket-making process . Mason, of Hatfield, Doncaster, in South Yorkshire, was sentenced to six months in prison suspended for two years. He has also been ordered to carry out 240 hours unpaid work and a 12-day restorative justice course at Sheffield Crown Court. The British Transport Police investigation began in autumn 2013 when East Coast Trains station support staff saw Mason's black Vauxhall Meriva car on several occasions in the Executive Car Park at Doncaster train station. Various ticket discrepancies were noted including an expired ticket and tickets with wrong colours, no date and time printed, incorrect emblems and incorrect value paid. Replicating the real tickets, Mason used  software to change the details on the ticket in order to get free travel. He included the type of ticket, the date, the price, the journey and the printing date (pictured) But inspectors noticed various ticket discrepancies, including an expired ticket and tickets with wrong colours, no date and time printed, incorrect emblems and incorrect value paid . Mason used the software to forge the back of the train ticket in meticulous detail (pictured). He has been ordered to pay back £17,884 over six months after he was convicted of fraud charges . BTP was informed and in December an officer spotted the car and approached Mason when he returned to his vehicle later that day. He was arrested on suspicion of fraud offences and a search of the car revealed 10 further tickets believed to have been forged. Forensic examination of the computer devices found at his home revealed Mason had used the computers to produce forged travel and parking tickets. The offences were committed between March 24, 2011, and December 19, 2013. At a proceeds of crime hearing Mason, a contract worker, was told failure to pay will result in a default sentence of 12 months in prison.

"A son took the stand in his mother's murder trial Wednesday to testify against his father. Pelle Wall testified in a Salt Lake City, Utah courtroom and described how happy and energetic his mother, Uta von Schwedler, had been in the year before she died, a death that was initially thought to be a suicide but is now believed by authorities to be a carefully plotted out murder on the part of her ex-husband and Pelle's father, John Wall. Pelle also described his father's erratic behavior in the hours after his mother died, including a moment when he sat down on his son's bed and said to the young man, then still a teenager, 'What if I killed her and I don't remember?' Scroll down for video . Pelle Wall (above) took the stand in the murder trial of his mother, Uta von Schwedler, in a Salt Lake City, Utah courtroom on Wednesday . Pelle testified against his father John Wall (above), who is accused of killing his ex-wife and staging it to look like a suicide . According to the Deseret News, John had a very tempestuous relationship with his ex, and Pelle testified he would often say negative things about the woman in front of their children, telling them 'Uta's a bad parent' or 'Uta's making my life difficult.' He said on the stand the two would often argue when it came to the children, and that the last time he saw the two together, John rolled up his car window and drove off with the couple's four children in the middle of a conversation that the two were having in von Schwelder's driveway. Uta Von Schwedler (above) was found in her bathtub on Sept. 27, 2011 with multiple cuts to her body and a high level of Xanax in her system . The next morning Pelle said he father was nowhere to be found, and when he returned home from school that afternoon he said the man had a large cut above his eye. Von Schwedler was found in her bathtub later that day with multiple cuts to her body and a high level of Xanax in her system. That night, John woke his son up while he was sleeping and began displaying 'erratic behavior,' saying 'Uta's dead and they think I did it.' He then asked his son, 'Am I a monster?' and 'What if I killed her and I don't remember?' Pelle testified that his mother had never taken any prescription pills or antidepressants to his knowledge, remembering her as 'happy' and 'energetic.' He also said that while his father initially seemed sad following the death of his ex-wife, that soon turned 'more toward anger, hatred.' He also noted that after his parents first divorced, while he was still in elementary school, the children spent most of their time with their father, but that had changed in the years leading up to his mother's death, with custody split between the two parents, something that angered his father. The 21-year-old has long believed his father killed his mother, moving out of his home when he turned 18 and petitioning the court to remove his three younger siblings from his father's care shortly after. John, a pediatrician, has pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder.","Pelle Wall took the stand in the murder trial of his mother, Uta von Schwedler, in a Salt Lake City, Utah courtroom on Wednesday .

"Four people have been sentenced to death in Tanzania after  brutally murdering a young albino woman in order to harvest her body parts as good luck charms. Zawadi Mangidu, 22, was killed in north-western town of Geita by a group that included her husband, who is among those due to be executed. There is no guarantee the death penalties will ever actually be carried out, however, as the east African nation has had a moratorium on executions for the past 21 years. The conviction comes just days after Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete promised to end a wave of killings of albinos, saying the witchcraft-related murders are shaming Tanzania. Innocent victims: More than 40 albinos have been killed in Tanzania since 2007 - but the government insists it is taking action to end the murders . Activists say attackers have killed at least 75 albinos in Tanzania since 2000 to use their body parts in rituals. 'We will not allow things to escalate as they did in previous years,' Kikwete said in a national address on Monday. 'I believe that with close cooperation between the government and society, we will succeed in ending these killings of persons with albinism and rid our nation of this shame.' There are about 200,000 albinos in Tanzania, most of them easily recognisable as they lack pigment in their skin, eyes and hair. Witch doctors often tell clients that albino body parts will bring them luck in love, life and business. Similar beliefs exist in other African societies, but activists say attacks on albinos are particularly prevalent in Tanzania, where one in every 1,400 people is affected, compared with one in 20,000 in the Western world. Activists say attackers have killed at least 75 albinos in Tanzania since 2000 to use their body parts in rituals . At least 50 people died and dozens were hurt in heavy rains and floods in Tanzania's northwest, a senior official said Wednesday. Torrential rains, hail and high winds hit Kahama district in Shinyanga region late on Tuesday, injuring at least 82 people. 'At least 50 people are now confirmed dead,' Shinyanga's regional commissioner, Ally Rufunga said. 'More bodies of victims believed to have been swept by floods were found in the area and others died in hospital while receiving treatment,' he said, updating a previous death toll of 38. A statement from the office of President Jakaya Kikwete expressed his 'shock and extreme grief' at the disaster. Officials said an estimated 3,500 people in the region, a poor farming area south of Lake Victoria and near the Serengeti game reserve, had been affected by the flooding. 'It is a false belief that if someone has the body part of a person with albinism, this will bring success in business, fishing and mining activities. This is what has been fuelling this ongoing evil,' Kikwete said. Tanzanian police on Monday banned a planned demonstration by the Tanzania Albinism Society in the country's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, citing security reasons. But Kikwete said he had agreed to meet albino leaders next week to discuss possible solutions to the killings. Kikwete said more than 40 albinos have been killed since 2007 but insisted that his government was taking action to end the murders. He did give details on how the government would stop the killings. The murders have been concentrated in gold-rich regions and fishing communities surrounding the country's Lake Victoria area where superstitious beliefs are rampant. Activists say most attacks are not reported to the police.","Zawadi Mangidu, 22, was killed by a gang in north-western town of Geita .

"Home helps must stay for at least half an hour with frail pensioners under new rules to end the scandal of ‘drive-by’ visits. Updated guidance published yesterday insists that calls last for at least 30 minutes if they are offering personal care such as washing or dressing. The advice, published by NHS spending watchdog NICE, said 15-minute drop-ins should only be considered in certain cases such as checking if someone has taken their medication. Better care: Health watchdog NICE has published new guidelines in bid to stop 'drive-by' visits of carers (stock photo) In a sign of how bad things have become, guidelines have to spell out the care offered to the elderly – telling home helps to leave enough time to ‘talk to the person’. Care workers are also reminded to treat people with ‘empathy, courtesy, respect and in a dignified way’. The move marks a victory for the Daily Mail, which has highlighted care visits lasting as little as five minutes as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Last month a Mail investigation revealed that 70 per cent of councils are still allocating visits of just 15 minutes – with six authorities offering 200,000 slots of just five minutes. Some staff were even told not to chat because it wastes time, while visitors are sometimes poorly trained contractors or ill-suited to the job. In crisis: The recommendations come as Local Government Association say funding for social care is 'in crisis' (stock image) The guidance called on councils to ensure home care workers ‘have time to do their job without being rushed or compromising the dignity of the person who uses services’. It also attempts to stamp out the conveyor belt culture under which pensioners can be seen by ten or 15 different carers in a fortnight, saying ‘continuity of care’ must be a priority. Last night care minister Norman Lamb called on councils to adopt the guidance as soon as possible, saying that many authorities were ‘complicit’ in providing poor care. However, the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said money was just too short to end 15-minute care visits once and for all. Chairman David Sparks said funding for adult social care is ‘in crisis’. GPs are being urged to visit the elderly at least once a year to check they are not too cold, NICE guidance says. Meter readers could also check the temperature in pensioners’ homes and alert surgeries, it advises.","NHS watchdog NICE published new guidelines for caring .

"Roman Catholic Cardinal Edward Egan, the former archbishop of New York who played a prominent role in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, has died at the age of 82. The Archdiocese of New York says Egan died on Thursday afternoon at a New York hospital after suffering a heart attack. He was appointed as leader of the archdiocese by Pope John Paul II in 2000, succeeding the late  Cardinal John O'Connor. Scroll down for video . Prominent figure: Cardinal Edward Egan, who was archbishop at the time of the 9/11 attacks, has died . Egan oversaw a major financial overhaul of the archdiocese which drew criticism and applause after he inherited a $20 million deficit. Within two years he was forced to dramatically cut spending and lay off staff to stabilize the accounts. As archbishop during the September 11 terror attacks, Egan anointed the dead at a lower Manhattan hospital and presided over many funerals for victims - sometimes three a day. He also took to Ground Zero to distribute rosaries to the many grieving families who were searching - often in vain - for their loved ones among the rubble. Egan bristled at the suggestion that he was more a manager than shepherd. In a 2001 interview with The New York Times, he said, 'I am about, first and foremost, serving 413 communities of faith,' he said, referring to the archdiocese's parishes. He was a scholar of church law and spoke Latin fluently. John Paul chose him to help with the massive job of reviewing a revised canon law code for the global church. A native of Illinois, Egan retired as New York archbishop in 2009. Announcing Egan's death, New York's current cardinal, Timothy Dolan, wrote: . 'My dear people, I am saddened to tell you that our beloved Cardinal Edward Egan, the Archbishop of New York from 2000-2009, has gone home to the Lord. Pope Benedict XVI (left) greets Cardinal Edward Egan as they celebrate Mass at St Patrick's Cathedral in 2008 . 'Thank God he had a peaceful death, passing away right after lunch today, with the prayers and sacraments of his loyal priest secretary, Father Douglas Crawford, in his residence at the Chapel of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. He was rushed to NYU Langone Medical Center where he was pronounced dead at 2:20 pm this afternoon. 'Join me, please, in thanking God for his life, especially his generous and faithful priesthood. 'Pray as well that the powerful mercy of Jesus, in which our Cardinal had such trust, has ushered him into heaven. 'My sympathy to his natural family, who will grieve for their uncle, and to you, his spiritual family here in the Archdiocese of New York. I'll keep in touch as our arrangements are made.

The stolen car, a blue Mk1 1972 Ford Escort Mexico, was taken from the Trackspeed Classic car showroom in Portsmouth Road, Ripley, Surrey. The vehicle has the number 27 on its side and the registration plate DAD 422K. Its owner, Mark McCracken, had been storing the vehicle at the showroom and says it was his 'pride and joy'. The 46-year-old  said: 'It is the jewel in the crown of my collection. I fear it will be cut down and sold for parts - the body alone is worth £80,000 and the engine £40,000.'

"There's a new true detective in town. A Texas police department has hilariously spoofed Matthew McConaughey's Lincoln car commercials, adding their own spin to reflect a night on the squad. McConaughey's ads are famous for the Academy Award-winning actor staring pensively through his window, contemplating life's existential mysteries or just talking about how much he loves his car. Sgt. Larry Wise of the Cedar Hill Police Department in Texas hilariously spoofed Matthew McConaughey's Lincoln Car ads, adding his own spin to reflect a night on the squad . McConaughey's ads are famous for the Academy Award-winning actor staring pensively through his window, contemplating life's existential mysteries or just talking about how much he loves his car . 'Sometimes you gotta go back to actually move forward, and I don't mean go back and reminisce or chase ghosts,' he says in twisty dialogue that would make his True Detective character Rust Cohle proud. Cedar Hill Police put Sgt. Larry Wise behind the wheel of a cop van for the parody, and at first Wise repeats McConaughey's dialogue word for word, in the same pensive deadpan voice. But things soon veer off from their original course. While McConaughey wonders about 'going back to where you came from', Wise talks about taking 'a big step back,' like 'from winning rookie of the year to getting a couple of reflection days off'. Wise pretends to nod off for a second as he wonders 'Who am I? Why am I still on duty? What is this on my fingers and why won't it come off? Is it mystery pocket goo from that last guy I searched?' A prisoner makes a guest starring appearance, asking Wise if he's okay because he's only going five miles an hour. Wise's response? 'That's pretty good for an Explorer' 'You don't get into police work because it makes sense,' Wise then says. 'You do it cause you thought it really looked cool on TV, or cause med school was out of the question.' As McConaughey drives under the bright city lights, its gas stations and flashing sirens that reflect in Wise's window as he ponders yet another night on the job. 'I like being in here,' he says in the video. 'Driving around all night long contemplating the important questions in life like ""Who am I? Why am I still on duty? What is this on my fingers and why won't it come off?""' 'Is it mystery pocket goo from that last guy I searched?' And, in the spoof, a prisoner makes a guest starring appearance, asking Wise if he's okay because he's only going five miles an hour. Wise's response? 'That's pretty good for an Explorer'. The video was posted on the Cedar Hill Police Department's Facebook page to celebrate hitting 4,000 Facebook likes. Lt. Colin Chenault told Daily Mail Online that he, Wise and fellow officer Kaleb Hazard came up with the idea after watching Jim Carrey's spoof of the ads on Saturday Night Live. The video has more than half a million views and has been shared over 12,000 times. Chenault attributes the success to the fact that the video humanizes police officers. 'I think people want to laugh at us and see us as real people,' he said. 'We want people to remember this video, it sheds a light not just on our city but on other officers as well, and remember that police officers are normal people like you and me.' 'We laugh at the same things and we want people to see us as they are - we just do a different job.' Both Chenault and Wise said they are happy they've created a something that is much more positive and comedic than the recent controversial videos featuring policemen around the country. 'Police officers don't like to be stereotyped either,' said Wise. 'So when something bad happens in another city, you're always going to have that percentage of the public, no matter what, think we're all corrupt and can't do anything right.' He added that to be able to put something out to humanize policemen and prove they're 'not all the same', and get such a response from the public, was 'outstanding'.

But these eerily pneumatic 'women' are in fact realistic dolls, designed, moulded and painted to fulfill the every desire of customers around Europe.

Owner Thierry Reverdi and employees Eric and Raphaela take light-weight aluminium 'skeletons' and painstakingly add 'flesh', eyes, features, hair and clothes to bring the dolls as close to life as their customers want. The Dreamdolls website describes their products as 'a range of realistic dolls of a quality and an exceptional beauty'. But it declares that although 'planned for sexual use' the 'lovedolls' are 'also used as realistic mannequins for photo studios for the catalogues of lingerie'. The company also insists that many of their customers are collectors who see the plastic models as works of art. Each custom-made doll which makes up the more expensive US Edition range takes them a week to make, from pouring the stain-proof and non-stick silicone into moulds to painting on layers of make-up.

Once the figure is released from the mould, Eric checks the mannequin for imperfections and flexibility before the human details are added. Raphaela pops the glass eyes into the sockets, and glues the separately moulded silicone ears to the side of the mannequin's head. She also has the job of hand-painting the dolls' faces, adding glossy red or plum-coloured lipstick, creating come-hither smoky eyes and adding polish to its nails. The US Edition consists of four models: Angela (long blonde hair and blue eyes), Désirée (long black  hair and blue eyes), Ginger (short red  hair and green eyes) and Scarlet (long brown hair and green eyes). Each one is just over five feet tall, and breast size and skin colour can be changed to suit the customer. All the moulded silicone ears are placed in a box, to be glued to the mannequins' heads . Raphaela draws on smoky eye make-up on to one mannequin, made of silicone over an aluminium frame . This large-breasted dummy is given an extra layer of blusher by Raphaela before being sent out . These mannequins are ready to have their synthetic hair applied to add another element of realism . The dolls also come with an internal heating system - which the company points out must be turned off before washing. Other models can be varied, with a range of skin, eye colour and cup sizes ranging from a C to an EE breast size.

Johanna said her second book was inspired by visits to her grandparents and the surrounding woodland on the Isle of Arran, in Ayrshire . Following the success of her debut book  she has created a follow up called Enchanted Forest: An Inky Quest & Colouring Book . The new colouring book takes readers on a inky quest of 60 illustrations through an enchanted forest to discover what lies in the castle . She said the new book was inspired by childhood visits to her grandparents on the Isle of Arran in Ayrshire. Ms Basford said: 'Enchanted Forest takes its inspiration from the woodlands that surrounded my grandparents' house on the Isle of Arran. 'The woodlands were wild, unpredictable and scary and I love the playful way children see the world, as if through a wonderful lens that turns the mundane magical. 'In Enchanted Forest, tree stumps become curious little dwellings, rivers flow into treasure laden caves and at the heart of every forest lies an enchanted castle.' As well as drawings to colour the book also features hidden objects to be found along the way including wild flowers and animals . Ms Basford added: 'Every piece I create starts life as a simple pencil sketch, evolving into a rambling pen and ink drawing usually spanning several sheets of paper. 'For me, computer generated graphics can feel cold and soulless whereas hand drawing captures a sense of energy and character which no pixel can ever replicate.' The new colouring book takes readers on a inky quest through an enchanted forest to discover what lies in the castle at its heart. As well as drawings to complete, colour and embellish, there are hidden objects to be found along the way including wild flowers, animals and birds, gems, lanterns, keys and treasure chests.

"A zebra crossing in China has managed to get the locals cross. People's Daily reported that town planners in Chenzhou, a city of around 4.6 million people in southern China, built three sets of zebra lines which lead to a triangle-shaped traffic island planted with palms trees and a hedge. Ridiculed by Chinese online users, Chenzhou authorities said they would revamp the design. Tree-point turn: Anyone trying to cross the intersection in Chenzhou is advised to take some shears . Local residents joked that in order to get to the other side of the road they have to  risk their life by walking around the island, or, better yet, fly past like ninjas. The crossing is located on the intersection of Longquan Road and Dongfeng Road, a semi-residential part of the city. A local police spokesman confirmed they had received several complaints about the traffic island and its bizarre zebra crossing connections. Wheel of Fortune: The locals have an auspicious nickname for the intersection, but they have to risking their lives walking around it every day . 'Normally zebra crossings are supposed to bring convenience to the pedestrians and make sure that pedestrians are safe,' said the spokesman. 'However we passed a report onto the council because this strange combination brings pedestrians into potential danger as they are forced to walk around it when crossing the intersection.' A local resident said: 'We call it the ""Wheel of Fortune"", and it's a bit of a joke around here because when they built it they obviously weren't thinking properly.' No man's land: The division built the crossing while the park and gardens division planted the garden. It seems the two government bodies didn't communicate . The amusing design is resulted by a no-man's-land between local governmental functions. A spokesman for the local council said the road division is in charge of building the zebra crossing, but  the park and gardens division, who designs traffic islands, ended up making a complete garden surrounded by hedge.","The crossing is located in a semi-residential area in Chenzhou .

"In the history of human invention, there's nothing that matches the car. We rely on them every day. To do our jobs, drop the kids off at school, or take an elderly relative shopping. Cars mean freedom and independence, and most importantly of all, convenience. But years of crazy parking rules have made many law-abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals, and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses. We all know the story. You return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen. Or maybe you run a local shop, and customers have dried up because what you sell costs less than the parking fee. Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (left) and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (right) have vowed to end the 'war on the motorist' with their new 'common sense' approach . In 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end. That meant not only changing the rules, but changing attitudes, because under the previous Government councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny, treating them like cash machines on wheels. This included spying on and filming drivers going about their daily lives. Where if you made a mistake it would mean an expensive bill in the post. If you protested it could mean a doubling of the original fine, or an angry bailiff knocking on your door. And all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by Parliament. Residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence. The minister says they want to see 'fairness and balance' restored to the system so parking no longer generates profit . These rules have now been changed during this parliament. Local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area, including charges and the use of yellow lines. Parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued. They have also vowed to end the industrial use of CCTV 'spy cars' to enforce on-street parking . We are bringing back common sense. Very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute 'grace periods' for council-controlled parking, whether it's on or off-street, paid or free. It means you won't get fined for being a few minutes late. We're also ending the industrial use of CCTV 'spy cars' to enforce on-street parking. The new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post, but ensure public safety as CCTV will still be used to protect schools, bus lanes and red routes. Why have we done this? Because we want see fairness and balance restored to the system. As a result it will no longer possible to use parking to generate profit and we're cracking down on the use of aggressive bailiffs. And in another victory for common sense parking at an out-of-order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay. There are also occasions where shoppers and drivers receive a fine and appeal because they genuinely believe they've done nothing wrong. We'll be trialling a new system so if this happens to you, you'll receive a 25% discount even if the appeal is lost. These changes are great news for drivers but they are good news for town centres and business too. People supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce. Under the previous administration life became unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring. We're ending this pointless war on motorists so that you don't feel like a criminal just for parking your car.","Move comes from Eric Pickles and transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin .

"David Cameron was facing a growing Tory mutiny over defence spending last night, amid claims the Foreign Secretary said there were ‘no votes in defence.’ Conservative MPs are plotting a major rebellion next week when the Commons debates calls for the UK to honour its commitment to spend at least two per cent of national income on defence. The Prime Minister lectured other Western leaders over the need to hit the target during last year’s Nato summit in Wales. Conservative MPs are plotting a rebellion against Prime Minister David Cameron next week when the Commons debate will call for the UK to honour its commitment to spend at least 2% of its income on defence . But Mr Cameron has refused to guarantee that the spending pledge will continue after the election, and – to the anger of many MPs – Tory sources say it will not feature in the party’s manifesto. Instead, the Prime Minister has said only that a future Tory government would protect the defence equipment budget and maintain troop numbers. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond was yesterday reported to have warned Tory MPs there are ‘no votes in defence’. Aides to Mr Hammond, a former defence secretary, said they ‘did not recognise the comments’, adding that the minister is a staunch supporter of defence spending. But former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said the reported comments were symptomatic of the view of the party leadership. Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, said: ‘There is a view at the top of the government – I don’t think the Prime Minister shares it – that defence isn’t a vote winner. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured) was reported to have warned Tory MPs there are ‘no votes in defence’ ‘But what they have to understand is that defence is part of the DNA of the Conservative Party. And that’s true even in constituencies which don’t have a garrison. ‘Conservative voters instinctively believe that defence of the realm is the first priority of government.’ ‘And if people around the country do not see that is the case they will ask themselves what is the Conservative Party for?’ ‘We are following through a Lib Dem promise to spend 0.7 per cent on aid but we won’t commit to defence spending. People are asking is this the right order of priorities?’ Rory Stewart, chairman of the Commons defence committee said: ‘The fundamental point is the world is unfortunately more dangerous now than it has been in the past 20 years at least. ‘That means major powers like Britain have to spend more on defence.’ Fellow Tory James Gray said it would be a major error for Britain to drop its guard at a time of increased Russian aggression and the growing threat from Islamic State. Mr Gray said: ‘The people of the UK want to see strong defence of the realm, and they see the attacks carried out by ISIS and the Russian Bear bombers over Brighton and they realise the world is an extremely dangerous place. And they want the government to step up and hold to the promise they made at the Nato Summit.’ Conservative MPs now plan to use a Commons debate next Thursday to force a vote on the issue. A senior Tory MP last night said there was a ‘determination’ to force a vote, despite pressure from Downing Street to avoid a damaging split in the run-up to the election. Although the vote will not be binding on Government policy, defeat would be embarrassing for the Tory leadership and increase the pressure on ministers to back the spending target. China is to boost its military budget by 10 per cent this year to £94billion, making it the world’s second-biggest spender on defence. Last year, it spent £85billion, compared with Britain’s £37.4billion – but that is still only around a third of what the US spends. Beijing is seeking to assert itself as a growing power and officials say the money is to modernise the People’s Liberation Army – the world’s largest standing military force. China's growing force: Only the US spends more on defence . The US fears that China considerably understates its actual defence spending. Beijing has recently taken a more assertive stance on territorial disputes with Japan and other neighbours, leading to a rise in regional tensions. In response, Japan and India have increased their military budgets.","David Cameron is facing a growing Tory mutiny over defence spending .

"Step out onto the surface of the planet 30 Ari b in daylight and you would see not one, not two, not three suns in the sky - but a remarkable four stars, all of which are in its system. The amazing discovery, the second of its kind, suggests that planets in four-star systems are much more common in the universe than thought. And studying the system could reveal the effect multiple stars can have on a planet - and whether they make them more likely to turn into 'hot Jupiters'. Nasa astronomers in California have found a planet in a multi-star system. 30 Ari b (illustration shown) has four stars in its system - two sets of binary stars. In this image the primary star is in the foreground and its companion to the left, while the planet is in the middle and the other two stars are top right . The planet, studied by an international team of scientists led by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), had previously been known to exist. However, scientists had thought the planetary system had three stars - not four. The newfound four-star planetary system, called 30 Ari, is located 136 light-years away in the constellation Aries. The primary star is known as 30 Ari B (upper case), and the planet is 30 Ari b (lower case). The system's gaseous planet is enormous, with 10 times the mass of Jupiter, and it orbits its primary star every 335 days. The primary star has a relatively close partner star, which the planet does not orbit. This pair, in turn, is locked in a long-distance orbit with another pair of stars about 1,670 astronomical units away - one astronomical unit is the distance between Earth and the sun. Astronomers think it's highly unlikely that this planet, or any moons that might circle it, could sustain life. The exoplanet, a gas giant, orbits its primary 'yellow' star in about an Earth year's time. Its primary star, called 30 Ari B, orbits the newly discovered small 'red dwarf' star. This pair of stars is itself locked in a long-distance orbit with another pair of stars, known as 30 Ari A. The fourth star, found using instruments fitted to the Palomar Observatory in San Diego, marks only the second time a planet has been identified in a quadruple star system. The first four-star planet, KIC 4862625, was discovered in 2013 by citizen scientists using public data from Nasa's Kepler mission. This latest discovery is important, though, because it suggests that one in 25 sun-like stars are in a quadruple system, whereas previously they were thought to be much rarer. 'About four per cent of solar-type stars are in quadruple systems, which is up from previous estimates because observational techniques are steadily improving,' said co-author Dr Andrei Tokovinin of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The four stars and one planet of the 30 Ari system are illustrated in this diagram. This quadruple star system consists of two pairs of stars: 30 Ari B and 30 Ari A. The gas giant planet (red), 30 Ari b (lower case), orbits one of the stars in 30 Ari B about once a year. The newly discovered star is shown in green . Were it possible to see the skies from this particular world, the four parent stars would look like one small sun and two very bright stars that would be visible in daylight. This is not the case for all multi-star systems; in some, the other stars are so distant and dim that they would only be visible at night. One of the stars in sky of 30 Ari b, if viewed with a large enough telescope, would be revealed to be a binary system, or two stars orbiting each other. In recent years, dozens of planets with two or three parent stars have been found, including those with 'Tatooine' sunsets reminiscent of the Star Wars movies. Finding planets with multiple parents isn't too much of a surprise, though, as binary stars are more common in our galaxy than single stars. 'Star systems come in myriad forms. There can be single stars, binary stars, triple stars, even quintuple star systems,' said Dr Lewis Roberts of JPL, lead author of the new findings appearing in the journal Astronomical Journal. The fourth star, found using instruments fitted to the Palomar Observatory (pictuerd) in San Diego, marks only the second time a planet has been identified in a quadruple star system. The first four-star planet, KIC 4862625, was discovered in 2013 by citizen scientists using public data from Nasa's Kepler mission . 'It's amazing the way nature puts these things together.' The newly discovered fourth star in the Ari 30 system is a companion of the primary star the planet orbits, and lies at a distance of 23 astronomical units from the planet - about the distance of Uranus to our own sun. However, despite it being relatively close, the newfound star does not appear to have impacted the orbit of the planet. The exact reason for this is uncertain, so the team is planning further observations to better understand the orbit of the star and its complicated family dynamics. In addition to this discovery, made by studying hundreds of stars each night for stellar companions, the astronomers also identified a triple-star system called HD 2638. A planet in this trio of stars is a hot Jupiter that circles its primary star tightly, completing one lap every three days. Scientists already knew this primary star was locked in a gravitational tango with another star, about 0.7 light-years away, or 44,000 astronomical units. That's relatively far apart for a pair of stellar companions. The latest discovery is of a third star in the system, which orbits the primary star from a distance of 28 astronomical units - close enough to have influenced the hot Jupiter's development and final orbit. 'This result strengthens the connection between multiple star systems and massive planets,' said Roberts.","Nasa astronomers in California have found a planet in a multi-star system .

"Iowa mom Melody Lauer has a personal motto she is trying to pass on to others: 'If you have baby on one side, it’s best to have gun on the other.' The 30-year-old  mother-of-three from Des Moines and former gun shop worker has started a new safety class that claims to teach women how to carry a firearm and their child at the same time. Despite being a gun enthusiast, Lauer maintains her controversial class does not encourage women to conceal a weapon, but shows them how to do so properly. 'I have seen a huge insurgence in young mothers, mothers of young children, wanting to get into firearms,' Lauer told ABC 6. Scroll down for video . Mom-and-gun enthusiast: Des Moines mother-of-three Melody Lauer has started a new gun safety class to show women how to 'responsibly' carry a firearm and their child at the same time . Armed: The 30-year-old mom first got her gun permit at 21 and quickly became obsessed with weapon safety . Family first: Melody - who has children aged nine months, three and six - feels safer carrying a gun so that she can protect her kids .

Lauer continued: 'And what's happening is we don't have instructors that are addressing their needs. 'So they just do it. They don't do it right and then they end up having an accident.' The class is called 'Babywearing and Carrying' and the first seminar was in February. Lauer says it has quickly become quite popular and is being hailed the first of its kind. 'To our knowledge, nobody is doing this yet,' Barry Snesll, who runs Crossroads Shooting Sports shooting range in Des Moines, said. 'The interest was so great that she actually had to turn off or shut off the registration. 'Otherwise, we would have had two-three times as many people here.' Safety: Lauer's motto is iIf you have baby on one side, it’s best to have gun on the other' Pro-gun: Mother-of-three Lauer said parents should be responsible enough to learn to carry a weapon safely . Safety: Lauer became dedicated to learning the correct safety measures associated with firearms . Lauer got her gun permit at 21 to appease her husband, who said he would be more comfortable with her increasing travel commitments for work if his wife were armed. She became dedicated to gun safety and learning how to use the weapon properly. The idea for a class was then recently borne out of tragedy, she said. 'The idea for the class came out of hearing about the kid in Idaho who shot his mom recently,' Lauer told Yahoo! Parenting. 'That touched me in a very deep way because my daughter was 2 at the time. 'I thought, there’s no reason this should happen. We are adults and can be responsible.' Because of the popularity in Des Moines, Lauer is now looking at ways to expand, and perhaps plan a weekend event.

"A North Carolina lottery winner is being sued by the store owner who sold her the ticket after allegedly agreeing to split the $1 million jackpot. Mother-of-five Eva Reyes, 53, is accused of promising USA Liquors owner Laxmi Bhardwaj half the winnings because he loaned her the money to enter an Emerald 10 scratch card in January.

"Nicola Tweedy, 54, died two days after she had her varicose veins operated on at the Norfolk and Norwich hospital . The death of a woman days after she underwent surgery on her varicose veins could have been prevented, her husband has today claimed. Nicola Tweedy, 54, had the operation at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in March last year and was discharged the same evening. But two days later the mother-of-two was found apparently asleep in her chair at the family home in Pulham Market, Norfolk. When her family failed to rouse the classroom assistant, they called an ambulance. Despite the best efforts of the paramedics called, Mrs Tweedy died. A post-mortem examination later confirmed she had suffered a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot which reached her lungs. An inquest heard staff at the hospital failed to ensure Mrs Tweedy was fully aware of the risk of suffering a blood clot during the operation, because of an 'oversight'. Her husband, Chris Tweedy, 53, said he is now considering taking civil action against the hospital, claiming he believes his wife's death could have been prevented. The postman, who lives with the couple's two children, said: 'They were required to avoid harming her and, tragically, in my opinion, they did not.' South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon said the case was a 'tragedy' which should prompt improvements. He added: 'It is clear to me that more could and should have been done to mitigate the risks of what was deemed to be appropriate surgery for Mrs Tweedy, most crucially to place Mrs Tweedy and her family in a position to make a fully informed choice about whether to proceed with the operation. 'Any hospital treating over half a million people each year will occasionally not do everything perfectly. People are only human. 'But in the post-Mid Staffs world, when things have been less than perfect, patients and families now expect - and frankly are entitled to expect - much greater openness.' Consultant vascular surgeon Robert Brightwell admitted to the inquest in Norwich that a thrombosis risk assessment had not been completed. That meant the 54-year-old was not fully informed about the dangers of the surgery, including the increased risk for those with a high body mass index. Nurse Susan Brown said she accepted it was 'an oversight' and that a checklist had not been completed on the patient's discharge notes. Coroner Jacqueline Lake gave a narrative conclusion that Mrs Tweedy died following a 'rare but recognised' risk of surgery, adding she will write a report so that future deaths may be prevented. She said she was satisfied that the operation itself had been conducted appropriately. But raised concerns that Mrs Tweedy had not been given the correct leaflets on her care. Speaking after the inquest Mr Tweedy said his family's lives had been 'damaged beyond repair'. He described his wife and his 'happy, smiling soul-mate'. Mrs Tweedy's husband, Chris, 53, who lives with the couple's two children, said he believes his wife's death could have been prevented . A post mortem examination revealed Mrs Tweedy died of a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in her lungs . He added: 'Nicky was a happy, smiling, laughing, easy going, fun loving person all of her life. 'She was someone who loved, cared for, guided, supported and helped so many people throughout her life. 'In my opinion, the Norfolk and Norwich  would have done nothing to learn the lessons from my wife's death, and to materially revise their protocols and procedures, which they have subsequently done, without my formal complaint and, even after that, without the very considerable pressure I have placed upon them, both personally and through other organisations. 'In the United Kingdom thousands of patients die a preventable death every year from hospital acquired venous thromboembolism. 'Many thousands more have to live with the life changing consequences. 'That, in my opinion, is a national scandal.' A hospital spokeswoman expressed sympathy to the Tweedy family. She added: 'Mrs Tweedy died of a rare but recognised complication of surgery, estimated to occur in approximately 0.01 per cent of cases, in other words one in 10,000 patients. 'While it is possible to reduce the risks of surgery they can never be eliminated entirely. 'The trust commissioned an independent review in order to identify any ways in which we could improve our services. 'Once we have the coroner's recommendations we will review these to identify any further opportunities for improvement.' Lawyer Sharon Allison, of Ashton KCJ which represented the family, said: 'My client and his family are understandably devastated beyond words at their loss. 'They have many questions relating to the hospital's protocols concerning blood clotting risks.' An inquest heard how a pre-surgery risk assessment was not completed, meaning Mrs Tweedy was not fully aware of the risks of suffering a blood clot during her operation .","Nicola Tweedy had an operation on her varicose veins last March .

"Saudi Arabia is beheading criminals at an unprecedented rate - almost half of them for non-violent drugs crimes, the human rights charity Amnesty International has warned. The Arab state is believed to have executed 38 people so far this year, treble the number in the same period in 2014 and a sign its new King Salman is showing no mercy to offenders. Now Amnesty has sounded the latest of several warnings over the country's 'unfair' justice system and harsh punishments. Regime: Some 38 people have already been beheaded in Saudi Arabia this year. King Salman (above meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron) was crowned in January and shows no sign of leniency . The charity's Saudi Arabia researcher, Sevag Kechichian, told Adam Withnall of The Independent: 'Almost half of this year's executions have actually been for non-violent drugs-related offences. 'There's no real rhyme or reason for this upsurge in executions, and in a way this makes it all the more alarming.' The Saudi authorities insist there is a surge in the number of executions because . Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under Saudi Arabia's version of Islamic sharia law. No mercy: King Salman pictured in January . One diplomatic source told the AFP news agency the surge in beheadings had started long before the reign of King Salman, who was crowned in January after the death of his half-brother King Abdullah. 'The Saudi authorities want to show everyone they are strong, people can rely on them to keep the security and the safety in the kingdom,' said the source. The insider claimed the aim was to deter all forms of violence but the policy is linked to the kingdom's fight against the Islamic State group. In September, Saudi Arabia began air strikes against the terrorists in Syria as part of the US-led coalition, raising concerns about possible retaliation inside the kingdom. Security officers arrested three Saudis who allegedly acted 'in support of' the group when they shot and wounded a Dane in November. But Mr Kechichian said: 'The current rate has been truly unprecedented. It would... be a stretch to say that this is an attempt to deter violence.' The United Nations has said many Saudi trials are 'by all accounts grossly unfair' and that confessions are obtained under torture. Amnesty's annual report last week made a similar warning. 'Courts continued to impose death sentences for a range of crimes, including some that did not involve violence, such as ""sorcery"", adultery and drug offences, frequently after unfair trials,' it said. Trickle of news: Individual beheadings are only discovered when confirmed by the Interior Ministry (above) 'Some defendants, including foreign nationals facing murder charges, alleged that they had been tortured or otherwise coerced or misled into making false confessions in pre-trial detention.' Those executed have included five Pakistanis, an Indian, two Jordanians, two Syrians and a Yemeni, with few foreign governments willing to appeal publicly for clemency from the oil-rich state. Three beheadings in a single day on Tuesday - one for rape and two for murder - took the total so far this year to 38, according to an AFP tally.","Amnesty International says Arab state has beheaded 38 people this year .

"It's an age-old adage, but looking on the bright side of life can be good for your health, scientists said today. Adopting a positive mental attitude lowers the risk of suffering a heart attack, requiring surgery and even death. That is according to a new study by a group of scientists at University College London. The research found after suffering a heart attack or angina, the most pessimistic patients were twice as likely to suffer a more serious health condition in the next four years, compared with the most optimistic patients. These conditions include a more severe heart attack, heart surgery or death. A new study by researchers at University College London has found optimists are less likely to suffer a heart attack, heart surgery or die in the years after suffering an initial heart attack or angina . In the UK, 2.3 million people are living with coronary heart disease, the major cause of heart attacks and unstable angina ( the type that doesn't occur upon exertion but strikes randomly, and persists even at rest). Meanwhile in the US, around 375,000 people die each year from coronary heart disease. Scientists surveyed the mental attitudes of 369 patients, who were admitted to hospital with unstable angina and heart attacks. They monitored the patients' health over the next 46 months. Led by British Heart Foundation professor Andrew Steptoe, the team noted their findings could be linked to a number of physical and psychological impacts of being optimistic. Half of the most pessimistic patients who smoked were still smoking one year after going into hospital. In contrast, 85 per cent of the optimistic smokers had quit their habit entirely, a year on. Smoking has long been known to be a major risk factor for heart attack and angina, with an estimated 22,000 deaths each year from cardiovascular disease linked to smoking. The research comes ahead of No Smoking Day next Wednesday, when the British Heart Foundation will call on smokers to quit for good. The study also showed that optimistic patients are more likely to increase their consumption of fruit and vegetables, a year after their heart attack or angina. The study found pessimists were more likely to smoke and live an unhealthy lifestyle - factors linked to poor heart health . Forty per cent with a positive outlook were eating the recommended five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Meanwhile only 20 per cent of the most pessimistic patients were eating the required amounts, 12 months after their hospital admission. Lead author of the research, Professor Steptoe, said: 'Our research shows that optimistic people are more likely to take advice about lifestyle changes on board, like quitting smoking and eating more healthily – this results in better outcomes after a patient suffers from unstable angina or a heart attack. 'Our findings could be used to identify pessimistic patients and encourage them to make the necessary changes to their lifestyle that can ultimately lead to better health.' Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the BHF,  said: 'The next steps for this research would be to show psychotherapy like cognitive behavioural therapy to improve optimism can improve the outcomes for pessimistic people. 'Suffering from a serious condition like angina or heart attack can take a drastic emotional toll, which we know can lead to depression, further lowering the chances of a full recovery after a heart attack. 'If you're living with a heart condition and struggling to cope, we would urge you to contact your GP who can put you in touch with the necessary support.' Although noting a more optimistic approach promoted a patient's recovery by encouraging a healthier lifestyle, researchers did not find optimistic people were more physically active. In the past depression has also been linked to poor outcomes for heart patients. This study found pessimistic patients were twice as likely to have depressive symptoms a year after suffering a heart attack or unstable angina. The scientists hope their findings will help identify the patients most at risk of suffering serious health complications in the years after recovering from heart problems. The study was published in Psychosomatic Medicine. There are two types of angina, called stable and unstable angina. The symptoms of these two types are similar, but there are some important differences. Attacks of stable angina usually occur when the heart is forced to work harder, for example during physical activity or emotional stress. In some cases, the pain can also develop after eating a meal or during cold weather. These are known as angina triggers. The symptoms of stable angina usually improve if you rest for a few minutes. Unstable angina is more unpredictable. It can develop without any obvious triggers and can persist even when you are resting. Attacks of unstable angina may last longer than a few minutes and do not always respond to treatments used for stable angina.

"Eminent psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, known to TV audiences as Dr. Phil, is on his way to Atlanta, Georgia to help the beleaguered boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina, Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively. On the eve of Bobbi Kristina’s 22nd birthday yesterday Gordon, whose social media presence had become increasingly desperate and erratic tweeted, “I’m so hurt I wanna do myself in, I know I have to strong [sic].’ In an insight into his spiraling mental state, on Tuesday he tweeted ‘You all blame me but I tried my best and it wasn’t good enough sorry. ‘ Earlier he tweeted the simple plea to Bobbi Kristina, ‘I love you soooooooo much plz wake up.’ Through it all, he has not been allowed to visit with her, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated . On the edge: Nick Gordon was seen on outside North Fulton Hospital near Atlanta, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken after she was found unconscious face down in her bathtub . A helping hand: Dr. Phil is concerned about Nick Gordon and his on his way to offer assistance . It is five weeks since Bobbi Kristina was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the Roswell, Georgia, home she and Gordon, 25, shared. The only daughter of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother’s death in eerily similar circumstances. The singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near Los Angeles on 11 February 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre Grammy awards party. But unlike Houston’s death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina’s near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21-year-old as a criminal investigation. Two weeks after being admitted to Atlanta’s Emory Hospital Bobbi Kristina was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection. Instead she was given a tracheotomy. But any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Gordon, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived on the scene. But other than this, few details have emerged. There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub. Nick and Bobbi Kristina in happier times. Gordon has been banned from seeing her by the Brown family . In addition to this she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Just two weeks ago Gordon was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the Bobbi Kristina and his Georgia home – a home owned by Houston until her death – as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining CCTV footage from security cameras located at the Roswell residence. Lawyers for Gordon had tried to argue that the warrant issued on February 12 was an infringement of their client’s privacy but they subsequently dropped the case. Meanwhile the nature of Gordon and Bobbi Kristina’s union has come under intense scrutiny. Both have referred to each other as ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that Gordon – who was unofficially adopted into the family by Houston when he was 14 – has married the girl who he once knew as a ‘sister.’ In his most recent tweets Gordon who had previously called Bobbi Kristina his ‘wife’ refers to her as his ‘fiancée.’ What is clear is that, in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life, her life had become increasingly chaotic. Just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty and drove headlong into a gray Ford Taurus. The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia. Gordon too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months. Police were also called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there. A security guard at the gated community where Bobbi Kristina lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people ‘hitting each other and swinging’ outside the three-bedroom townhouse. Officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation. Speaking to Daily Mail Online a former boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina who remains a close friend, Zach Jafarzedeh gave an insight into the torrid pair. He said: ‘Nick has a short temper and Bobbi can be difficult. ‘It was a tug of war, because they are both very stubborn people. Bobbie is very sweet, giving and caring, but she wants all of you, everything. ‘And Nick like space, that’s where a lot of the tension between them came from.’ He revealed that Gordon was ‘getting a little wild.’ He said: ‘He was getting into car accidents. He’s been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years. He’s got a need for speed. He’s getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [from Bobbi, sole inheritor of Whitney’s estate] and crashing them life and right. ‘He had a couple of Chevrolet Camaros. He liked fast cars, BMWs, that kind of thing. He cares, but he wasn’t slowing down.’ Against this backdrop, hostilities between Gordon and Bobbi Kristina’s father, Bobby Brown, and other family members have publicly exploded with Gordon an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure. Gordon has accused Brown of only being after his daughter’s money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return. Bobby Kristina’s aunt Marion ‘Pat’ Houston is the executor Whitney’s estate estimated at between $12 and $20million trust She took out a restraining order against Gordon in March citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in Bobbi Kristina because of her money. According to Pat the tweets, including one that read ‘Loam I got bigger guns than you. Watch them react to this,’ were specifically aimed at threatening her. Pat, who was one of Whitney’s managers, has made no secret of her disapproval of Bobbi Kristina and Gordon’s ‘sibling’ relationship having turned into something romantic. In increasingly erratic tweets Gordon has raged against singer Bobby Brown accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years. He has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both Whitney, who struggled with drug abuse, and Bobbi Kristina fell on his shoulders and that, now just 25, it was too great a duty to bear.","On the eve of Bobbi Kristina’s 22nd birthday yesterday Nick Gordon's tweets have become increasingly desperate and erratic .

"Head of children's social care: Andy Couldrick, 52, allegedly thwarted a former police officer’s attempts to raise concerns about child abuse by Asian men . A council chief who backed the Baby P social workers and has been accused of silencing a whistleblower over the Oxford child sex ring scandal has been promoted to a top job in local government. Andy Couldrick, 52, was head of children’s social care at Oxfordshire County Council when he allegedly thwarted a former police officer’s attempts to raise concerns about child abuse by Asian men. But in 2011 – after his controversial intervention, which was detailed in an official report earlier this week – Mr Couldrick was appointed chief executive of Wokingham Borough Council in Berkshire on £155,000 a year. It has since emerged that Mr Couldrick has attacked politicians and the media over their ‘disgraceful treatment’ of social workers in the Baby P child abuse scandal. Following a documentary about Baby P late last year, he wrote on Twitter: ‘Media and politicians “responding to public mood?” I think not. ‘Conspired to create moral panic and witch hunt. Many should feel ashamed. Disgraceful treatment of social workers confirmed.’ He also described a 2014 Panorama documentary, which considered whether parents had lost their children unfairly thanks to secret family courts, as ‘a shameful piece of journalism’, adding: ‘Such a poor, partial, sensationalist piece of journalism, offering no right of reply for my authority. Shame on you Panorama.’ Tragic case:  Mr Couldrick has attacked politicians and the media over their ‘disgraceful treatment’ of social workers in the Baby P (pictured) child abuse scandal . Details of his promotion will deepen controversy over the Oxford grooming case, which saw men of mainly Pakistani origin targeting white underage girls in care on an ‘industrial scale’. On Tuesday, a Serious Case Review report revealed how a council worker who wrote a series of emails warning of child abuse by Asian men in Oxfordshire was silenced after a complaint by senior officials about his attitude. New role: The head of Thames Valley Police, Sara Thornton (pictured) - whose officers failed scores of girls - has been promoted to a £185,000-a-year job in charge of the country’s chief constables . The worker, an ex-detective, repeatedly raised concerns with the director of children’s services and other officials at the county council in 2007 after seeing a 13-year-old in bed with an adult. He also reported a stream of men going into a flat every night and emerging in the early hours. But instead of dealing with his complaints, a senior council official complained about his behaviour and his manager apologised for the ‘unprofessional way’ in which he had acted. Sources have claimed that the senior council official who had asked a colleague to complain about the emails was in fact Mr Couldrick. The men were eventually jailed in 2013 after being found guilty of a string of sex offences, including 25 offences against the child whose case the council worker had tried to highlight. The report, by the Oxfordshire Safeguarding Children Board, said: ‘This episode is one that agencies must learn from.’ However the head of Thames Valley Police, Sara Thornton – whose officers failed scores of girls – has been promoted to a £185,000-a-year job in charge of the country’s chief constables. And on the eve of the report’s publication, Mr Couldrick’s former boss at Oxfordshire County Council – Joanna Simons – was offered £600,000 in a generous redundancy package. Mr Couldrick said in a statement: ‘I deeply regret that we didn’t have the correct information to enable us to see the patterns and the whole picture during this period. If we had, we could have done something about it and stopped it then and there.’ Crime chief: Anthony Stansfeld has questioned why sex offenders’ race was not deemed relevant in the Oxford grooming scandal report . An elected crime chief has questioned why sex offenders’ race was not deemed relevant in the Oxford grooming scandal report – despite evidence from victims claiming it had discouraged police from acting. Anthony Stansfeld, Police and Crime Commissioner for Thames Valley, said the Serious Case Review pulled punches compared to a report on the Rotherham child sex abuse case. Mr Stansfeld told the Mail: ‘The theme running through child abuse in many areas has been the Pakistani heritage of the majority of perpetrators. As the Rotherham report says, council staff did not report issues for fear of appearing racist.’ The SCR report concluded that there was ‘no evidence of any agency not acting when they should have done because of racial sensitivities’. But one of the victims quoted in the report said: ‘The police wouldn’t touch them with a barge pole. They were scared. They didn’t want to confront people because they were scared of being called racist.’ Mr Stansfeld went on to say: ‘The review details what went wrong in Oxford. It does not go into why it happened.’ However Maggie Blyth, chairman of the Oxfordshire Safeguarding Children Board, defended the report, saying: ‘I am confident that there has been no stone unturned.’","Andy Couldrick, 52, was head of children's social care in Oxfordshire .

"Bad teacher: Carissa Bryant, 33, a sixth-grade teacher from Iowa, has been charged with public intoxication for allegedly showing up to class drunk . A sixth-grade teacher from Iowa has been arrested on suspicion of showing up to class drunk. The Marshall County Sheriff's Office says 33-year-old Carissa Bryant, of Marshalltown, was arrested Wednesday and charged with public intoxication. Police say they responded to a report from Marshalltown Community School District of a possible intoxicated teacher at Leninhan Intermediate School. Testing at Marshall County Jail showed Bryant had a blood alcohol level of 0.19, more than twice the legal limit in Iowa. The 33-year-old educator was later released from jail after posting $300 bond. District spokesman Andrew Potter says Bryant has been placed on administrative leave pending investigation. Police say the case has been referred to the Marshall County Attorney's Office for further review. Sheirff's deputies were called to the school after administrators received a tip that a teacher at Lenhihan may be intoxicated. The deputy who responded to Leninhan Intermediate School noted that the married mother of one smelled like alcohol, had bloodshot eyes and was slurring her words . Chief Sheriff's Deputy Steve Hoffman told Times Republican that a colleague of his smelled the odor of alcohol on Bryant's breath. The 33-year-old, who is married and has a son, had bloodshot eyes and was slurring her words. According to police, Bryant, who teaches language arts and social studies, admitted she had been drinking before the start of school Wednesday morning.","Carissa Bryant, 33,  charged with public intoxication after test showed her blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit .

"They may look like they are from different families, but believe it or not Jayden and Xavier Boughey are actually twins. The adorable 11-year-old boys, who hail from Auckland in New Zealand, were born with contrasting skin tones - Jayden has a dark complexion and Xavier is white. And as if questions over the colour of their skin wasn't enough for the young fellas, they also have the added complication of having different birthdays - with Jayden being born on November 6 and Xavier coming into the world after midnight, making his birthday November 7. Scroll down for video . Jayden and Xavier Boughey may look like they are from different families but they are in fact twins . The gorgeous 11-year-old boys also have different birthdays after Xavier (right) was born after midnight . The beautiful boys, who look strikingly alike despite their obvious differences, have their parents to thank for their mishmash of genes. Their mother, Helen Castles, 32. brings the dark skin to the family, which she inherited from her grandmother, who is Samoan. Their father is the complete opposite - Phil Boughey, 36, has a white complexion and fair hair. When the pair found out they were expecting twins, they wondered how their children would look, but could  never could have dreamed of the conclusion. 'We were surprised for sure - the running joke is because they were made in the Bahamas that Helen had the local Bohemian milkman stop by one day when I was at work to make the brown one,' their dad Phil Boughey told Daily Mail Australia. 'But we don't really see it as a huge deal they just look different like any siblings can.' Their parents joke that because the boys were conceived in the Bahamas the local milkman dropped by to make the 'brown one' Xavier (left) is carefree and Jayden (right) is responsible and as the oldest of the two is a born leader . Now the boys have just started a new school, Sacred Heart, and are tasked with the unenviable challenge of trying to explain to their peers that they are related. 'They do get a lot of people believing they are not twins especially school kids,' he said. 'We make sure they are in different classes at school too because Jayden is the stronger one and Xavier will just sit back and ride on the coat tails of Jayden - so we have had to pull him out of the clouds.' The odds of a mixed race couple having twins of different colours are a million to one. Skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together. If a parent is of mixed race, their eggs or sperm will contain a mixture of genetic codes for both black and white skin. However, if both the egg and sperm contain all white genes, the baby will be white. And if both contain just the versions necessary for black skin, the baby will be black. But the boys embrace the attention they get for looking so different. 'They think it's perfect - they think it's great because they are twins but they are individual and celebrate different birthdays,' their proud dad said . Sometimes Xavier gets jealous of his brother's bronze skin. 'We went out fishing in the boat the other day and Xavier and I had to put sunscreen on while Jayden just lay there with his shirt off getting tanned without any sunblock,' he said. According to their father, the boys have contrasting personalties but do have a strong twin bond. 'They are best friends and always will be,' he said. 'Xavier has a very dry sense of humour whereas Jayden is more outgoing and takes the lead as the older boy,' he said. 'Whenever I'm away for work he will always be responsible and make sure the house is locked up whereas Xavier is carefree and relaxed.'

Lucy and Maria Aylmer, who looks completely different  told ITV's Good Morning Britain that their classmates did not believe them when they told them they were twins. Their mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and in a genetic quirk, together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin.","11-year-old Jayden and Xavier Boughey are twins with different looks .

"Killed: Charley Saturmin Robinet (seen here in his mugshot from 2000) was killed in a scuffle with LA police on Skid Row on Sunday, prompting protests . The homeless man who was shot dead by the LAPD is from Cameroon - but could not be deported back to his home country because of the red tape. The man, who was killed on Los Angeles' impoverished Skid Row when he allegedly tried to grab the holstered pistol of an officer while police arrested him on Sunday, was from Cameroon, authorities have confirmed. However, attempts to deport him had failed - because the Cameroonian government refused to respond to repeated requests for travel documents. It has already been revealed the man - whose violent death sparked outrage across America - served 15 years behind bars using the name Charley Saturmin Robinet. His deception was discovered a couple of years ago, when he was due to be deported back to France. But French authorities realized he was not who he was claiming to be, and rescinded the papers, according to the Los Angeles Times. Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, told the newspaper they repeatedly contacted authorities in Cameroon, who failed to respond to their request for a travel document. Because they were unable to get the documents, the man known as Robinet could not be deported and was released from prison. He served around 13 years in prison for the crime, in which he, an accomplice and getaway driver stole $33,500 in a bid to pay for acting classes at the Beverly Hills Playhouse. Warning graphic content . Shot dead: Charley Saturmin Robinet, circled in red, was gunned down by the Los Angeles Police Department on Sunday. Above is the moment directly after the fatal scuffle, after police had backed away . Prayers: The community came together last night at a vigil for the man they knew as 'Africa' Shock: Many feel angry at how the man died on Sunday, an incident which was caught on camera . Officials now say Robinet stole the identity of a Frenchman with the same name and birth date to apply for a French passport in the 1990s, when he came to the U.S. to pursue an acting career. Foreign nationals are usually deported after serving their sentences, but because of a 2001 Supreme Court ruling on the rights of 'stateless' people, Robinet was set free. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Virginia Kice said she couldn't immediately comment on his immigration history. Under the terms of the man's release, he was required to provide reports to his probation officer at the beginning of each month, . Deputy U.S. Marshal Matthew Cordova said he failed to do so in November, December and January, leading to the issue of a federal warrant - which triggered the fatal clash with police. Proof? Police say this frame shows Charley Saturmin Robinet, circled center, reaching up for a police officer's gun during the fatal encounter on Sunday in Los Angeles . These latest revelations came as the community came together for a vigil for the man known as 'Africa' or 'Cameroon' to those living in the Skid Row area. Many have been horrified by his death. The shooting was caught by an onlooker on a video that went viral, leading to protests and calls by civil rights activists for a special police commission hearing on the use of force. The head of the Union Rescue Mission, outside which Robinet was shot, told Reuters that Robinet had been living in a tent outside the mission for weeks and had a history of violent, erratic behavior. He went by the street name of Africa and lived among one of the largest homeless communities in the United States, with more than 3,000 people. On Monday LAPD Chief Charlie Beck confirmed the footage from body cameras worn by an officer and a sergeant provided a 'unique perspective' of the incident. However, he said that the force would not be releasing the video yet. According to the LA Times he also would not be drawn on what the footage actually revealed. 'At the end of the investigation into this officer-involved shooting ... we will release the complete investigation through the inspector general's office,' Beck said. 'If there is a criminal proceeding in this or if there's a civil proceeding in this, we will make all evidence available through those proceedings.' Killing: This is the moment police fired shots at Charley Saturmin Robinet, who is obscured from view in the above frame by an officer. The LAPD have claimed he was trying to take an officer's gun . Before the fatal shooting: He was being confronted over reports of a robbery before five shots were fired . The three officers who fired their weapons at Robinet were veterans of the Skid Row beat who had special training to deal with mentally ill and other people in the downtrodden area, said Beck. But a rookie officer who cried out that the man had his gun, leading to the shooting, had considerably less experience. The LAPD didn't immediately say how much training he had received in dealing with mentally ill people. All officers must go through at least an 11-hour course. Police Chief Charlie Beck said some of the veteran officers had 'completed our most extensive mental illness training over a 36-hour course.' Initial signs showed the officers used what they had learned during the confrontation, despite the outcome, he said. Shooting: The attack took place in the Skid Row district of Los Angeles, which is known for its large homeless population . 'Damaged gun': The LAPD said this image shows the officer's pistol after the encounter. LA police chief Charlie Beck said damaged magazine and a partially-discharged bullet prove there was a struggle over it . 'The way you have conversations, the way you offer options, the way that you give some space, the body language that you portray, the way that you escalate, all of that is part of the training,' Beck said on Monday. 'I will make judgment on that when I review the totality of the investigation, but on the face of it, it appears they did try all of that.' The shooting was captured on video but exactly what happened remained unclear. The footage has been viewed by millions of people online. Several dozen people rallied Tuesday in protest of the shooting. There was a moment of silence, and participant Patrisse Cullors declared the shooting site to be 'sacred ground.' A memorial at the site of the shooting features white roses placed over a tent, blankets and clothing belonging to the man known as 'Africa.' Angry protests: People walk through skid row in protest against the killing of a homeless man by police in Los Angeles on Tuesday . The specialized training came under the nationwide Safer Cities Initiative, designed to tone down encounters between police and people on the streets. Footage showed the homeless man reaching toward the rookie officer's waistband, Beck said. The officer's gun was later found partly cocked and jammed with a round of ammunition in the chamber and another in the ejection port, indicating a struggle for the weapon, Beck said. 'You can hear the young officer who was primarily engaged in the confrontation saying that ""He has my gun. He has my gun,'' Beck said. 'He says it several times, with conviction.' The three other officers then opened fire. The man who was shot was black, as is the rookie officer who was just short of completing his probationary year on the force, police said. Senseless: People protest against the killing in Los Angeles in the Skid Row area of the city . The violence had echoes of the August police shooting of 25-year-old Ezell Ford, whose death in a struggle with Los Angeles officers brought demonstrations in the city. Ford was unarmed. Police said he was shot after reaching for an officer's gun. Video was taken came from multiple perspectives, including two witnesses recording from their phones and cameras worn by two of the officers who fired their weapons. Beck said officers had arrived to investigate a robbery report and the homeless man refused to obey their commands and became combative. A security camera outside a homeless shelter about 75 feet away showed the man pushed over a neighbor's tent and the two people had a dispute. When officers arrived, they tried to speak to the suspect. He turned and jumped into his tent, and officers appeared to pull it up and over him to roust him from inside. The man jumped out flailing and kicking before ending up on the ground. In memoriam: This carboard plaque pays tribute to Charley Saturmin Robinet, who was known as Cameroon or Africa by locals . Beck said officers didn't know if the suspect was arming himself. Stun guns 'appeared to have little effect, and he continued to violently resist,' Beck said. One witness began filming from a closer perspective. As the man took swings, four officers wrestled him to the ground. The struggle became blurry and distant, but shouting could be heard, followed by five apparent gunshots. The Los Angeles Police Department's inspector general and the city's district attorney are investigating the shooting. Two of the officers suffered minor injuries, including the rookie officer, who is on crutches. All four officers are on paid leave.","Authorities in LA confirm the man shot dead was from Cameroon .

"A new robot that moves just like a salamander has been created by engineers. The robot, called Pleurobot, walks and swims in a life-like way that mimics the shy amphibious creatures. It was developed by recording 3D X-ray videos of short-ribbed salamanders - Europe's largest salamander - allowing researchers to track 64 points on the animal skeleton. Scroll down for video . The robot, called Pleurobot, (pictured) walks and swims in a life-like way that mimics the shy amphibious creatures. It was developed by recording 3D X-ray videos of short-ribbed salamanders - Europe's largest salamander - allowing researchers to track 64 points on the animal skeleton . Scientists behind the robot, which has 27 movable joints, believe it could be used to help palaeontolgists understand how extinct animals like the dinosaurs moved. A video released by Google's Boston Dynamics sparked complaints after an engineer kicked one of its dog-like robots to show off its ability to remain upright. Viewers said the robot had been mistreated and claimed the employees were being cruel. It sparked a debate about whether it was possible to be cruel to a robot. Ethicists and robotics experts waded into the argument to explain the only way it could be unethical would be if the robot could feel pain. Others pointed out it is impossible for robots to have feelings. They say as it is able to cope with a range of different terrain and squeeze through relatively small spaces, the robot could also be used to help search for people trapped in disaster zones. And they added that the robots highly flexible spine also allows it to swim in water, but only if it is given a waterproof skin. Professor Auke Jan Ijspeert, a researcher at the biorobotics laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EFPL), has been leading the development of the robot. According to the group's website: 'Because of its low centre of mass and segmented legs it can navigate over rough terrain without losing balance. 'With a waterproof skin it can also swim. 'Those features may one day enable Pleurobot to help in search and rescue operations. 'On the other hand, salamanders are a good living analog for the first tetrapods that made the transition from water to land. 'In the future, we plan to use Pleurobot's design methodology to bring early tetrapods to ""life"".' Its engineers say that because it is able to cope with a range of different terrain and squeeze through relatively small spaces, the robot (pictured) could be used to help search for people trapped in disaster zones . Salamanders are remarkable creatures capable of regenerating limbs and researchers at University College London (UCL) recently identified the biological pathway involved. Called ERK (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases), the pathway must be constantly active for salamander cells to regenerate - a process not seen in the same way in other mammals. Although a long way from achieving the same feat in humans, the discovery could help researchers unlock the ‘regenerative potential’ of cells across other animals. Scientists behind the robot, which has 27 movable joints, believe it could be used to help palaeontolgists understand how extinct animals like the dinosaurs moved.

"Shaun Harrison, Sr, 55, was charged with allegedly shooting a student in the face 'execution style' A father-of-eight minister and former dean of students at a Boston high school was charged for allegedly shooting one of his students in the face 'execution-style'. The unnamed Boston English High School student survived and told police he had been selling marijuana for Shaun Harrison, Sr. for the past several months, according to Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Michael Bradley. Bradley said the student had been told by Harrison, 55,  that they were on their way to a house where the student could pick up marijuana and girls on the night of the shooting. After Harrison's home was searched on Thursday police found an illegally-owned rifle and shotgun in his bedroom, which Bradley said the minister had told police were weapons he had inherited from his father. Harrison only began working at Boston English High School at the beginning of January and served as a 'community or family outreach coordinator,' school spokeswoman Denise Snyder told the Boston Globe. She said he was unofficially recognized as the 'Dean of Students'. Harrison's defense attorney Kernahan Buck said he also ran anger management and substance abuse programs at the high school. He has since been fired from the high school, according to interim school superintendent John McDonough. The Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Harrison was an ordained Baptist minister who left the church, of which he was a member, in 2012 to form his own non-denominational church. The father-of-eight is an ordained Baptist minister and was the 'dean of students' at Boston English High School. The student allegedly told police he was selling marijuana for Harrison for the past several months . Rev. Opal Adams, an associate pastor at the church, told the Boston Globe that Harrison did anti-violence work with young people in the community. Harrison's sister Susan believes he was 'setup'. 'My brother is a good man and I don't know how this happened,' she told the Boston Globe. Harrison's son Jeremy, an anti-violence activist who worked to keep kids off the street, was arrested after shooting his girlfriend in the head while cleaning his illegally-owned firearm in 2013. She was critically wounded, according to the Boston Herald. Harrison was charged on Thursday with assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and battery and unlawful possession of a firearm. His bail was set at $250,000 cash. Harrison ran anger management and substance abuse programs at theschool, where he has since been fired .","Shaun Harrison, 55, allegedly told student they were heading to a house where the teen could pick up weed and girls .

"Shoppers have found venomous redback spiders hiding in bags of Australian-grown green grapes in four separate instances over the past two weeks. And grape suppliers admit the spiders are difficult to eliminate because they have the ability to hold their breath when sprayed with insecticide. A mother found a spider in a bag of Thompson Seedless grapes she bought at the Woolworths in Thornleigh, in Sydney's northwest, on Thursday. This comes after another man found two redbacks in a bag of grapes he bought at a Gold Coast Woolworths on Tuesday and a woman in Auckland, New Zealand found a redback in a bag of imported Australian grapes she purchased from the Woolworths-owned Countdown supermarket chain less than two weeks ago. Scroll down for video . Gold Coast woman, Leigh Alexander-de Jersey, said she was shocked to find a redback amongst grapes she bought from a fruit shop at Southport Park Shopping Centre on the Gold Coast on Friday .

A mother found a spider in a bag of Thompson Seedless grapes she bought at the Woolworths in Thornleigh, in Sydney's northwest, on Thursday. And another Gold Coast woman, Leigh Alexander-de Jersey, said she was shocked to find a redback amongst grapes she bought from a fruit shop at Southport Park Shopping Centre on the Gold Coast on Friday. 'It wasn't until I had picked it up by a leg and it started to wriggle around and turn that I realised what it was and dropped it real quick,' Ms Alexander-de Jersey told Daily Mail Australia. 'I initially thought it was just a part of the grape stem. 'It had been in the fridge for a few hours prior to me washing them, we think that has possibly slowed it down a bit and luckily for me it was a bit lethargic.' This comes as Gold Coast man Mike O'Neill said he found two redbacks in a bag of grapes he bought at the Australia Fair Woolworths at Southport. A Woolworths spokeswoman said they were investigating the Thornleigh and Southport incidents, but would not reveal the names of the grape suppliers for each supermarket . Auckland woman Debbie Bellingham was forced to call New Zealand's biosecurity hotline after finding a redback spider in a bag of imported Australian grapes she purchased at Woolworths-owned Countdown . 'There was a redback spider crawling on my hand,' Mr O'Neill told the Gold Coast Bulletin. 'I flicked it off – it was a bit comical because I'm absolutely terrified of spiders.' And Auckland woman Debbie Bellingham was forced to call New Zealand's biosecurity hotline after finding a redback spider in a bag of imported Australian grapes she was going feed her three-year-old-daughter, the New Zealand Herald reported. 'My daughter came down to me and goes, ""Mummy, there's a funny looking spider in the grapes, it's black and sort of orangey-red,""' Ms Bellingham told the Herald. An Australian grape supplier, who wished to remain anonymous, said redbacks were prevalent in the grape industry but they were very difficult to eliminate. 'The redbacks live on the timber, the wood of the vine,' he said. 'Growers do take every precaution to make sure they're limited by a spraying insecticide, but the unfortunate thing with redbacks is they have the ability to hold their breath for 10 hours. An Australian grape supplier, who wished to remain anonymous, said redbacks were prevalent in the grape industry but they were very difficult to eliminate . 'When they know the insecticide is being sprayed they hold their breath making the insecticide useless.' He said the only thing that definitively kills redbacks is keeping the grapes at freezing temperatures for 24 hours. 'It's something that can't be eliminated it just needs to be heavily scrutinised,' he said. 'Every precaution is taken it's just virtually impossible to eliminate 100 per cent.' Australian Table Grape Association's chief executive Jeff Scott said it was 'not normal' for redbacks to be found amongst grapes.

"Spy chiefs have been told by MPs to recruit middle-aged mothers because they are 'emotionally intelligent' and skilled at relationships. The Intelligence and Security Committee said MI5, MI6 and GCHQ should start advertising on the Mumsnet website. An inquiry by the MPs and peers on the committee found that action was needed to break through the 'permafrost' of middle-aged men dominating the ranks of the intelligence agencies who have a 'very traditional male mentality and outlook'. Hermione Norris plays a former MI6 officer - called Ros Myers - who joins an MI5 counter-terrorism division in the TV show Spooks . Across the three agencies, women make up 37 per cent of the workforce but hold only 19 per cent of the most senior roles. Labour's Hazel Blears, who sits on the ISC, said yesterday that recruiting a greater number of women would make the security services better at their job. She highlighted the particular skills mothers have in building relationships – a vital talent for spies trying to recruit informants. 'Women who have had children and brought their families up, they have valuable life experience,' the former Home Office minister said. The dominance of men, by contrast, 'can reinforce a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career', she said. Women deliver a 'more consultative, collaborative approach'. Labour MPs Hazel Blears said more women spies were needed . Mrs Blears said: 'If all intelligence professionals are cut from the same cloth – sharing similar backgrounds and characteristics – then they are likely to share 'unacknowledged biases' that will circumscribe both the definition of problems and the search for solutions.' According to the inquiry, her view that women can make for a better working environment for spies was backed by Sir Iain Lobban, the former director of GCHQ, the listening agency. 'I find that the discussions are deeper, I think they are more emotionally intelligent and, if you like, I think there is more intuition in the room,' he said. Mrs Blears said the need for MI6 officers to be able to deploy abroad – sometimes at short notice – could be a problem for women with children. She added: 'There is a bit of testosterone in the system that says, 'Tickets, money, passport – we all have to get there'. And if you've got children, finding 24-hour childcare is often very difficult.' Mrs Blears also revealed that the BBC TV drama Spooks had made it harder for MI5 to recruit women . A string of its female characters met a grisly end, such as being blown apart trying to rescue a Home Secretary from a bomb. Daniel Craig and the Italian actress Monica Bellucci pose during a photocall on location for the shooting of the 24th James Bond movie 'Spectre'  in Rome . In a report out today the ISC will call for a number of reforms to be introduced within the next 12 months across the agencies, including culture change, help for women who have had children to stop them being sidelined and career advice. Targeted recruitment should also be carried out, including through websites such as Mumsnet, it recommends. Ms Blears said: 'Changing the culture is the one area that is most difficult to articulate and, crucially, to take action on, but if you want change, that is where to start. I’d make a great spy. I go totally unnoticed everywhere I go, but I have a keen eye for detail. Nobody suspects a woman in mum boots of anything underhand. If they need someone whose special skill is getting melted chocolate down her dog-haired jumper and not noticing, I’m their woman. I’ve always said that a crack team of Mothers could knock most governments into a cocked hat. I would LOVE to be a spy. And no one would suspect me. I am too boring and frumpy. Well I’m not signing up. I’ve watched Spooks. Everybody I get attached to dies a horrible death. 'It is clear to us there are those at middle management level - referred to by some people as 'the permafrost' - who have a very traditional male mentality and outlook. 'This can reinforce a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career and does not fully recognise the value of a more consultative, collaborative approach. 'We therefore recommend that there is a real focus on identifying and tackling the barriers that can exist at middle management level, so that women and men can fully achieve their potential in a supportive team ethos.' The Committee hopes that this report and the specific recommendations it contains will galvanise support for, and lead to further concerted efforts to create, a more gender diverse workforce in the agencies.' Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who conducted a similar investigation into women in the CIA, said improving diversity would help in the response to threats to national security. She said: 'As Ms Blears rightly says diversity should be pursued - not just on legal or ethical grounds, important as these are in their own right - but because it will result in a better response to the range of threats that threaten national security. 'Much of what is said in this report echoes and reinforces my own work on the director's advisory group on women in Intelligence at the CIA. 'I am sure we will all benefit from close cooperation on these vital issues between our two countries.'","Parliamentary committee says more women spies needed to keep UK safe .

"Derek Jackson, 52, who was found dead in his Biddeston home, had a history of criminal behaviour and mental health issues . A grandfather whose body was found alongside his slain seven-year-old grandson and heavily pregnant daughter in a suspected murder-suicide, was well known to police and had a long history of mental illness. Derek John Sharpley, 52, was found dead of gunshot wounds to the head in the same room that his grandson Jackson's body was found tucked into a bed at his Biddeston property, west of Brisbane in Queensland. His 27-year-old daughter Kris-Deann Sharpley, who had moved to the Queensland town in 2011 to care for him following her mother's death, also died of gunshot wounds to the head and was found in the bathroom. Detective Inspector David Isherwood would not confirm the details of Mr Sharpley's criminal history, but told Daily Mail Australia that there had been no recent incidents. 'They [the family] are known to police and in regard to criminal history; the reality is that while he has a criminal history, it's not recent history,' Inspector Isherwood said. 'But he has got a criminal history and there is no doubt that he has had mental health issues.' Mr Sharpley is believed to have attempted suicide in the past and had a history of substance abuse, according to The Courier Mail. Police have stopped short of dubbing the incident a murder-suicide, but have said it is unlikely another party was involved. His daughter Kris-Deann Sharpley (left), who had moved to the town to care for him following her mother's death, was found dead in the bathroom while her seven-year-old son (rigth) Jackson's body was found in a bed . 'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' Inspector Isherwood said. Mr Sharpley is believed to have shot himself after killing his daughter and grandson, however detectives have been unable to determine the young boy's cause of death after preliminary pathology results returned inconclusive. Inspector Isherwood said there were no signs of physical injury on the child's body and that police were awaiting further results before making any conclusions about how he died. 'There are a couple of issues, they [forensic pathologists] think, with the decomposition. You'd think that with strangulation there would be lesion marks on the neck. What often happens in a lot of bodies in that case is that the head is tilted forward and you get bruising in the front of the body,' Inspector Isherwood said. 'Suffocation is very hard to prove, so the issue we've got is we really don't know'. Detective Inspector David Isherwood told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Sharpley 'was not the owner of a registered firearm', but would not release any other information about the gun used to kill the two adults . Detectives have been unable to determine Jackson's (pictured) cause of death after preliminary pathology results returned inconclusive. Suffocation and strangulation are still being investigated . The owner of the high-calibre gun used to kill both adults, which was found lying on a bed, has also been an unclear aspect of the case. Inspector Isherwood told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Sharpley 'was not the owner of a registered firearm', but would not release any other information about the gun. He said detectives would return to the address on Thursday to obtain any more evidence that could be relevant to the case. It comes after revelations that Kris-Deann  was on maternity leave and excitedly awaiting the birth of her little girl who she'd chosen to name Amber Elizabeth Rose after her late mother when she was slain, her sister-in-law Sara Turnball told the Courier Mail. All three bodies were found by Kris-Deann's (left) sister Tara on Monday evening when she came to the house to pick up some belongings . Detectives will return to the address on Thursday to obtain any more evidence that could be relevant to the case . All three bodies were found by Kris-Deann's sister Tara on Monday evening when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs. Tara, who is also pregnant, was accompanied by her boyfriend Allan Brown and had to climb through a window to gain access to the house. Mr Brown told the Courier Mail that Tara screamed out: 'They've been murdered, they've been murdered.' The scene at Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road home was so grisly it distressed first-response police officers, according to Detective Inspector David Isherwood. A dog barks behind a gate at a house in which the bodies of a man, a woman and a young boy were found in Biddeston, west of Toowoomba, Queensland . Police guard a house where the bodies of the relatives were found on Monday night . 'Two of the victims, both the adult male and female, had very serious wounds to their bodies,' he said. 'Both appear to have been shot in the head.' 'At this point in time there's nothing to suggest there was any incident that occurred in terms of a disturbance.' 'Two people that live in the town heard three distinct gunshots.' The gunshots were heard on Sunday night but locals presumed it was someone shotting an animal. Kris-Deann Sharpley was on maternity leave and excitedly awaiting the birth of her little girl . Kris-Deann shared this photo of her son Jackson and a scan of her unborn child Amber on Facebook before she was killed . 'There is no evidence that the house has been broken into when the police arrived they had to force entry into the premises. It would appear that the house was secure. The first person who attended the residence had to climb in to gain entry.' 'Police attended a Biddeston Southbrook Road address around 6.50pm after the bodies of a man, woman and boy were located. The three aged 52, 27 and 7 respectively, were all known to each other,' Queensland Police said. The shooting happened on the corner of Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road and Biddeston-Southbrook Road at Biddeston - more than 150 kilometres west of Brisbane. 'There are no concerns for public safety,' a police spokesman said. Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14.

"A family of mountain lions who live in a national park were caught on camera in extreme close up gnawing on a dead deer. The images showing kittens P-32 and P-33, along with mother P-19, were unveiled Wednesday on Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area's Facebook page. The big cats were photographed tearing limbs, chomping and lapping up the bloody feast at the California park. First to arrive: Kitten P-33 is seen at the kill site. Her brother and mother reportedly arrived one hour later . Why hello there! P-33 peers up at the sky while inside the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area . Chowing down: Kitten P-33 gnaws on the deer carcass at the California park in February. At the time the photos were taken, P-33 was 15 months old . Feast: P-33 digs into her prey. A park ranger has said the animal had to use her carnassial teeth to make cuts . A National Park Service Ranger, identified by KTLA as Kate Kuykendall, wrote on Facebook that a remote camera was used for the images. She said that the feline family was snapped close to the line that separates LA County from Ventura County in the Santa Monica Mountains. Kuykendall wrote: 'Kittens normally stay with their mother until they are about one to one and a half years old. 'One of the siblings, P-34, had already dispersed and it appears that these kittens may have also left their mom since the photos were taken in mid-February. 'This is P-19’s second litter and we've been tracking all three kittens since they were four weeks old. Lapping it up: P-33 licked one of the deer's leg during her meal. According to the National Park Service, mountain lions eat one deer weekly . Family meal: Mother P-19 (left) and her son P-32 (right) join in on the meal at Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area . All together: The three mountain lions were caught together in remote camera images . 'Since we started studying these animals in 2002, we have not tracked any male mountain lions that have successfully dispersed out of the Santa Monica Mountains.' Kuykendall wrote online that P-19 and P-32 arrived at the kill site approximately one hour after P-33. A caption for an image that showed kitten P-33 tearing the carcass said 'Mountain lions feed on deer by entering the abdominal cavity first and eating the insides, such as the liver and the heart.' Kuykendall also explained on Facebook the mechanisms that allowed P-33 to chow down. She wrote 'Notice how P-33 turns her head to the side while she bites through the deer hide? 'She is using her carnassial teeth, which are modified molars and premolars that act as shears to cut through the tough hide and meat. Mother and daughter: P-19 (closest to the camera) is seen with P-33 at the kill site . Approach: P-19 faces the camera - with meat left over from the deer carcass on the ground next to her . 'These sharp teeth are excellent at cutting and tearing flesh. 'Cats do not chew their food, so they actually use these carnassial teeth to tear and cut their meat up into smaller pieces to swallow whole.' On its website, the National Park Service says 'mountain lions typically eat about one deer per week, along with other smaller prey, and the animals in the Santa Monica Mountains are no exception.' Male and female mountain lions have general home ranges of approximately 200 and 75 square miles, respectively, according to the agency. The animals face threats that include roads and construction, as well as ingesting rat poisons, the National Park Service says. Information on visiting the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area can be found here. In the wild: Kitten P-33 is seen perched on rocks at the kill site . Out of the corner: Mother P-19 pokes her head out in the darkness .

"A Victoria Cross awarded to Private James Towers (pictured) after he demonstrated incredible bravery in the First World War is to be auctioned for £160,000 . A Victoria Cross medal awarded to a soldier who volunteered for a suicide mission during the First World War is to be auctioned for £160,000. The honour, the highest decoration for valour in the face of the enemy, was awarded to Private James Towers after he bravely volunteered for the mission at Mericourt near Lens, France, on October 6, 1918. The soldier, from Preston, Lancashire, stepped forward as the sixth man to dash out in front of enemy machine gun posts and get a vital message to a cut-off platoon 150 yards in front of him. He put himself forward despite witnessing the five previous runners - including his best friend Private Frank Dunlop - get shot down just minutes earlier. During his mission, he managed to evade bullets and even startled a German machine gun nest when he leapt across an embankment and landed just five feet away from them. They were so surprised they failed to launch bullets until after he had fled. The solder eventually made it to the lost platoon, gave the orders to the commanding officer and dug in with them for the night. Using his knowledge of the location of the German machine gun posts, he led them safely back to the British lines at dawn the next day. For his incredible act of courage, he was awarded the Victoria Cross and it was presented to him by King George V at Buckingham Palace upon his return to Britain. It was left to his family when he died, aged 79, in 1977, and later sold at auction in 1983. It has been owned by a private collector for the last 30 years but is now going to be sold on again at an auction in London later this month. As well as the Victoria Cross, four other medals of his will also be auctioned including his British War and Victory medals, his Coronation 1937 medal and his Coronation 1953 honour. The collection has been given an estimated guide price of between £130,000 and £160,000. David Erskine-Hill, of auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said: 'James Towers had watched five comrades die as they tried to get through to the lost platoon yet he still volunteered to take the message. 'This was cool, calculated courage from a man prepared to risk his own life to stop his fellow soldiers from being cut off. Through a combination of athletic prowess and sheer good luck he got away with it. 'His is a great story of gallantry and survival.' Tory peer Lord Ashcroft currently owns the world's largest collection of Victoria Cross medals and is likely to bid on the one awarded to Private Towers. Private Towers tried to join the army as an underage 17-year-old but enlisted again after he turned 18. He joined the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and went to the Western Front in December 1916 before being sent to Mericourt near Lens. The Victoria Cross (far left) has been kept by a private owner for 30 years along with Private Towers' other medals: British War (second left) Victory (centre)  Coronation 1937 (second from right) and Coronation 1953 . In an interview in a local Lancashire newspaper given years later, Private Towers said: 'I joined up as a youngster for a bit of fun, but it didn't turn out like that. We were young men made old before our time.' Regarding the brave act for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross, he said he had to try and get a message to a group of 30 comrades that the battalion was ready to withdraw from the ruined village of Mericourt. He put himself forward after a volunteer was requested to go into No Man's Land and lead the men back. Private Towers, who had daughter Marion with his wife Ethel, said: 'I had to go to the help of these lads, after all, they were my pals. 'Five men tried to get through and I was the sixth. I made a dive and got through. The worst part was that I didn't know where our chaps were. In a run for about 150 yards I went within five yards of one of Jerry's machine-guns. It was my lucky day.' The recommendation for his Victoria Cross states: 'In spite of heavy fire opened on him as soon as he moved, he went straight through from cover to cover and eventually delivered the message. His valour, determination and utter disregard of danger were an inspiring example to all.' After the war, Private Towers returned to work at his parents' farm and went on to run a milk distribution business in Lancashire. He attended a number of Royal dinners held in honour of Victoria Cross winners. After one such event at the House of Lords in 1929, he reached his local railway station at 5am the following morning, walked three miles home and went out on his milk round at 7.30am. Private Towers' medal collection will auctioned by Dix Noonan Webb on March 25. Cambrai, north France, during the First World War . Private James Towers was part of the 2nd Cameronian (Scottish Rifles). The group were occupying the ruined village of Mericourt, near Lens, France, in October 1918 when the battalion was ordered to withdraw troops. Mericourt was situated to the east of the Beaurevoir Line and troops were dispatched in early October to capture the  Line - the third line of defences of the Hindenburg Line - and the surrounding areas. The Beaurevoir Line was the last of a series of German defensive lines and consisted of thick barbed wire entanglements and well-sited machine and anti-tank gun bunkers. The original attack on the Hindenburg Line launched on September 29, 1918, had planned to encompass the Beaurevior Line as well, but was not successful. British and Australian troops were ordered to break through the Beaurevoir Line on October 3, 1918. However, on October 6, 1918, orders were issued for the village of Mericourt to be evacuated. The message failed to reach a party of 30 British soldiers, who were surrounded by German machine gun posts. It was at this point a volunteer was requested to dodge firefight to take the message directly to the B battalion. Private James Towers was successful and the group was led back to the British lines. Two days later, British and Canadian troops broke through the Hindenburg Line at the Second Battle of Cambrai. The collapse forced the German High Command to accept that the war had to be ended.","Victoria Cross given to 'suicide mission' hero now up for sale for £160,000 .

"A West Australian radio boss who says she keeps a jar of free condoms in the office for staff has been defended by former employees. Southern Cross Austereo general manager Linda Wayman told a conference in Perth last week that 35 per cent of her staff were either on maternity leave or covering those on leave. Ms Wayman said there was a big jar of condoms at work and she encouraged people to have protected sex. Chief executive Rhys Holleran said Ms Wayman's comments were made 'tongue in cheek' while former colleagues defended her as a 'supportive boss' in the wake of widespread condom controversy. One of Southern Cross Austereo's senior executives Linda Wayman told a conference on Thursday that 'We do have a big jar of condoms at work. I'm not lying, I'm not exaggerating' It is allegedly vital for Ms Wayman to prevent pregnancies amongst her staff members. 'That is a big area of focus for me, encouraging people to have sex with condoms,' she said . 'We do have a big jar of condoms at work. I'm not lying, I'm not exaggerating,' she said, according to Mumbrella. 'I do encourage people regularly, to have sex with condoms.That is a big area of focus for me, encouraging people to have sex with condoms.' To emphasise the impact on the company, Ms Wayman told the audience that one third of her 100 staff members are either on maternity leave or covering for someone who has just had a child. She also allegedly told the Mumbrella Perth conference that she has reservations about the entitlements that new mothers receive when re-entering the workforce. Ms Wayman also said she didn't agree with the union push that women returning from maternity leave should come back part-time automatically because it was an idealistic and anti-commercial stance, however maternity contracts played an important role in developing young talent. The radio boss said she believed in flexible working arrangements but they were difficult to arrange in the 24-hour media industry. 'I've been in the same position myself twice and it is very, very tough,' she said. 'There's no such thing as a work/life balance, it's bulls**t - you just do it. 'You make the decision and do the best you can, and as a leader, I do the best I can to help women and men who have made those decisions as well.' Ms Wayman told the audience that of her 100 staff a third are either on maternity leave or covering for someone who has just had a child to emphasise the impact on the company . However, Ms Wayman's comments, which drew laughter and applause at the conference, attracted criticism after they were reported on Thursday. Former employees jumped to her defence, describing her as a supportive boss. Perth TV reporter Lisa Fernandez told AAP Ms Wayman was 'tremendous' when she fell pregnant at the start of her two-year contract at radio station Mix 94.5. 'She said ""don't even worry, we will make this work, we will help you all we can"",' Ms Fernandez said. 'She always came in to check that I was getting home OK on time to see the baby and she would always check in with me to say ""is everything OK?"".' Ms Fernandez said Ms Wayman's door was always open to talk about any sort of parenting issue and she would bend over backwards to help employees, such as letting them leave early or getting them into a job-sharing role. Fairfax Media 6PR breakfast presenter Basil Zempilas tweeted he had never seen a boss more supportive of women in the workplace than Ms Wayman. Ms Wayman said that she has reservations about the entitlements that new mothers receive when re-entering the workforce, calling them 'idealistic and anti-commercial' Southern Cross Austereo's CEO Rhys Holleran said that Ms Wayman's comments were not intended to be taken seriously . Southern Cross Austereo's CEO Rhys Holleran defeneded Ms Wayman, insisting that her comments were not meant to have been taken seriously. 'Clearly these remarks were made ""tongue in cheek"",', Mr Holleran said in the statement. 'Linda is one of our most highly recognised and awarded General Managers. 'She has an exemplary record as one of Perth's most compassionate advocates on all issues surrounding equality of women in the workforce.' Another SCA Perth staff member, who preferred not to be named, told Daily Mail Australia that the reports are sad and not a true reflection of the General Manager's attitude towards women in the work force. 'Linda is a great advocate for women's issues so this is so unfortunate,' the SCA employee said. 'She is highly respected and wonderful in her role.'

"An FBI informant sent to infiltrate a California mosque has revealed how his handlers encouraged him to have sexual relations with Muslim women if it meant getting better intel. Craig Monteilh was known to members of the Irvine Islamic Center in Orange County as Farouk al-Aziz, a French Syrian who was a devout and, at times, radical Muslim. However he was really a petty criminal with forgery convictions who was hired by the FBI to go undercover as part of an intelligence surveillance operation after 9/11. Monteilh went public with the operation after his cover was blown in 2007, which exposed some of the government's little-known methods of anti-terrorism policing. Now, in a new interview has given more details about what his mission entailed. Mole: Craig Monteihl, a petty criminal, was recruited by the FBI as an informant as part of post-9/11 surveillance operations. He went undercover as a radical Muslim for 15 months at an Orange County mosque . Speaking with HuffPost Live on Monday, Monteilh said he was paid to seek out potential threats and gain 'personal information' about such people. Agents sought him out after he spent some time in prison for using fraudulent checks. His mission was to obtain email address and phone numbers of anyone suspicious and get the names of any of their associates, which he would then feed back to his FBI handlers. He also planted some recording devices and was taught 'how to be Muslim', he claims. 'The FBI trained me in the tenets of Islam, in the elementary principles of Arabic, and just to blend into the community and to slowly integrate myself as a Muslim male,' Monteilh told HuffPost Live. However Monteilh's was taken one step further when he claims to have been told to become intimate with some of the women he was mining for information if it meant getting more from them. Scene: Monteilh started attending the Irvine Islamic Center in Orange County (pictured) saying his name was Farouk al-Aziz, a French Syrian who was a devout and, at times, radical Muslim . 'I portrayed myself as a unmarried male, although I was married,' he said. 'Within the Muslim community, they would help me to get a bride, so they would introduce me to single Muslim women. 'I would go out on dates and things like that. '(My FBI handlers) instructed me, if I was getting good intel, to allow it to go into sexual relations.' In a previous interview with The Guardian, Monteilh confirmed he had sex with at least one of the women he was surveying. Monteilh claims he received $177,000 tax free from the government for the 15 months of work he did, which equated to over $11,000 each month. Regret: Monteilh says he now realizes he was motivated by money and was spying on innocent people . Ironically, senior officials at the Irvine Islamic Center contacted the FBI when Monteih started speaking of jihad and plans to blow up buildings as part of an entrapment technique. In 2007 the center filed a restraining order against Monteilh, ending the mission. In retrospect, Monteilh says the money distracted him from what was actually happening. 'I began to be conflicted because I was spying on innocent people. They were not involved in criminal activity,' he said. ' 'They were not espousing terrorist rhetoric, but I was still spying on them and giving the FBI the information they wanted.' After Monteilh went public with what he'd done, the FBI defended its tactics, claiming such operations had prevented further terrorist atrocities in the wake of 9/11. Steven Martinez, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said that in certain circumstances, if there is evidence of a crime, FBI agents may 'conduct an activity that might somehow involve surveillance in and about a mosque.' He added: 'I know there's a lot of suspicion that that's the focus, that we're looking at the mosques, monitoring who is coming and going. That's just not the case.'","Craig Monteilh spent time in prison for using fraudulent checks .

"While the world is divided over whether 'that dress' is blue and black, or white and gold, Nasa has been involved in a colour controversy of its own. This time the debate involves Mars – the so-called 'red planet' – which conspiracy theorists believe is in fact more blue and green. They argue the space agency has manipulated the colour of images from Mars to appear red, orange and pink, in what they claim is an attempt to mask life on the planet. Scroll down for video . The debate has raged since the 1970s when Nasa's Viking 1 lander became the first spacecraft to touch down on the red planet/ Its initial images revealed what appeared to be a blue sky (right), but in reality Nasa says the planet has a red/orange sky. On the left is a processed image of what Nasa believes Mars to look like . The sky on Earth is blue because of a phenomenon known as 'Rayleigh scattering', in which blue particles of light are scattered around by the atmosphere. On Mars, the reverse effect takes place. The dust in the atmosphere scatters the red particles of light, makes the sky appear red. Nasa claims the sky appeared blue because Viking's filtered images still had to be calibrated with the right colour balance. The debate has raged since the 1970s when Nasa's Viking 1 lander became the first spacecraft to touch down on the red planet, according to a report by Alan Boyle in NBC News. Its initial images revealed what appeared to be a blue sky, similar to that seen on Earth, raising hopes that there may be Martian life. Viking team member Carl Sagan announced at a press conference soon after: 'Despite the impression on these images, the sky is not blue...The sky is in fact pink.' The sky on Earth is blue because of a phenomenon known as 'Rayleigh scattering', in which blue particles of light are scattered around by the atmosphere. On Mars, the reverse effect takes place. The dust in the atmosphere scatters the red particles of light, makes the sky also appear red. Nasa claims the sky appeared blue in the first Martian images because Viking's filtered photographs still had to be calibrated with the right colour balance. Nasa sometimes uses different filters to depict Mars. The left image shows Mars as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope in July, 2001. Centre is Mars as seens by the Hubble Space Telescope in March, 1997. On the right is the red planet as seen by the Mars Global Surveyor in February, 2006 . The left version is the raw, unprocessed view as it is received directly from Mars. The centre is a guess of the 'natural' colour that humans would see if they visited Mars. The right version shows the result of white-balancing, which interprets the scene as if it were viewed under Earthlike lighting conditions . But not everyone is convinced. Ron Levin, a researcher at Lockheed Martin stated in areport: 'An excess of red is found on all of the Martian blue and green panels. 'Such extreme illuminations are shown to be incompatible with the grey panels. 'It appears that the true raw image data have been modified prior to publication to convert the blue and green pixels to grey, rendering a grossly changed image.' Conspiracy theorists have made wilder claims, with one writing: 'The images were falsely reddened to make it appear there was no life, no green algae or lichen on the plane.' Today both the Opportunity and Curiosity rover have patches of colour attached to their instruments that are used in to adjust the reflected colour to a true likeness. Is this what Mars really looks like? A mosaic from Nasa's Curiosity rover shows Mount Sharp in raw colour.  Nasa says raw colour is similar to the way the scene would look 'in a typical smart-phone camera photo' Pictured is the same scene after it has been given a white-balanced colour adjustment that turns the sky blue. Nasa sometimes does this to simulate Earth-like lighting, making it easier to analyse the geology . As a result, pictures of Mars are usually altered to provide a red and pink tinge caused by the iron-heavy dust that fills the atmosphere. But even Nasa admits this isn't an exact science. Colour balance is a highly subjective and no two spacecraft use the same exact filters. As well as this, people often perceive colours differently – as shown by the famous black and blue dress. To clear up the debate, Nasa usually releases a number of different types of Mars imagery, which include the raw file, unprocessed colour pictures and true-colour versions. To add to the confusion, the Curiosity rover recently found that the interior of Mars' rock 'Telegraph Peak' is in fact blue/grey.

"A Danish sexology professor is calling for students to view pornography films in class as part of changes to the country's sex education curriculum. Professor Christian Graugaard said the changes would help students understand the differences between what they see in pornography and the reality of sex. His suggestion echoes similar calls made in Britain last year  by a government-backed sexual health forum, which said youngsters must be taught that pornography does not reflect real life. Danish students could soon be watching pornography films in class in order to teach them the differences between what they see on screen and the reality of sex . Mr Graugaard told public broadcaster DR: 'Instead of having sex education be boring and technical, where you roll a condom onto a cucumber, I'd rather have us educate our children to be critical consumers who see porn with a certain distance and reflection,' according to The Local. He added that teenagers attempting to copy what they saw in pornography was a 'recipe for broken necks and disappointment'. Denmark is known for its liberal attitudes to pornography - it was the first country to legalise it, and a recent survey showed three quarters of Danish men, and a third of Danish women, regularly watch it, The Local reported. Early last year in Britain, a document drawn up by sexual health charity Brook, the PSHE Association and the Sex Education Forum issued new guidelines for sex education in schools. The guidelines, criticised by an education campaigner for 'taking children's childhoods away from them' - also called for students to be told about the dangers of 'sexting' - sending explicit text messages - and sharing sexual photos and images. Pupils must instead be taught the difference between real-life relationships and the distorted world of X-rated films. This could involve playing card games in class to decide whether various sexual scenarios belong on ‘Planet Earth’ or ‘Planet Porn’ and a greater emphasis on relationships, sexuality and staying safe, rather than just the 'mechanics' of reproduction.","Danish sexology professor calls for students to be shown porn at school .

"He had gone on daytime television to try to win over the women voters he struggles to appeal to. Nigel Farage had even been given a list of ‘women-friendly’ policies to show how he could cater to the audience of Loose Women. Then he went and said it was a ‘fact of life’ that women will earn less than men when they return to some jobs after childbirth. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage today faced the wrath of the Loose Women, as they challenged him about his smoking, drinking, the state of his marriage and why he is the most hated man in Britain . The Ukip leader appeared on the ITV show as part of an effort to soften his image and tackle the idea that the party struggles to appeal to female voters . The Ukip leader said new mothers should expect to be paid less in City jobs because they will ‘find themselves behind the rest of the pack’. He told the ITV daytime panel show: ‘If you’re a doctor, a lawyer, a researcher, you’re a woman, you have a baby, you take six months or a year off. You are not disadvantaged at all in that job. ‘But there are other jobs in which if you take six months off and come back you find yourself behind the rest of the pack and earning less money. That is a fact of life. It’s difficult to change that.’ Labour’s business spokesman Stella Creasy was one of those who objected to the comment. She wrote on Twitter: ‘Sorry, @Nigel_Farage said what?! Just a fact of life is it women earn less after kids? No it’s an injustice and we can change it.’ Linda Robson: 'I don't really know much about politics but can you tell me why you've been voted the most hated man in Britain?' Mr Farage: 'That's quite a compliment isn't it' Jane Moore asked him why he had dropped his immigration cap. She said he was a 'bit flip-floppy'. Mr Farage: 'The cap is a nonsense.' Asked about his drinking, Mr Farage said: 'I only spend five or six hours a day in the pub, that's all I do. I can't see what all the fuss is about.' Nadia Sawalha told him: 'If I was your wife I would be giving you a bad telling off for that, what does your wife think?' Before his appearance, Mr Farage was shown outside the studio sipping from a Loose Women mug while smoking a cigarette. He joked that he felt like he was going into the lion’s den and begged the presenters to have mercy on him. Actress Linda Robson, one of the show’s panellists, asked Mr Farage why he had been voted ‘the most hated man in Britain’. He began replying: ‘If you look at the political class we’ve got, by which I mean the people that go to the same handful of schools, all go to Oxford, all do the same degree...’ He was then challenged with the comment: ‘Well you’re one of them. You went to public school,’ but Mr Farage went on: ‘You look at these political figures, they are all like cardboard cut-outs. They are all playing safe, they are all scared of the media. I’m not, I’m a bit like Marmite. People either like me or don’t like me.’ He said all politicians are fundamentally ‘selfish’ and neglect their families. He said: ‘The other three big leaders are very good at coming on programmes like this and saying what wonderful family men they are, how they do the school run and when the babies were little they changed all the nappies and did the night feeds. Maybe that’s true. All I can say is, it’s pretty much impossible to do that.’ During the 10-minute showdown on daytime TV, Mr Farage was tackled over 'flip-flopping' on immigration, his private education, his unhealthy lifestyle and his admission that he would be a poor Prime Minister . Linda Robson asked him: 'When do you get to spend time with your wife and you children?' Loose Women pannelists Andrea McLean and Jane Moore grilled Mr Farage about his policies and lifestyle . Nadia Sawalha told Mr Farage should would not put up with his drinking if she was his wife . Farage was also challenged about whether he has any 'guilt' about being seen as a beer-swilling, chain-smoking figure . His comments came after his second wife, Kirsten, last week told the Daily Mail she felt like a single mother because he is never home. When challenged about whether he has any guilt about being seen as a beer-swilling, chain-smoking figure, he joked: ‘I only spend five or six hours a day in the pub, that’s all I do.’ But Nadia Sawalha, who was another panellist along with Andrea McLean and Jane Moore, told him: ‘If I was your wife I would be giving you a bad telling off for that.’ He responded: ‘I get up at five o’clock in the morning, I’m rarely home before midnight. I think at lunchtime I deserve a sherbet.’ On his way to the studio Mr Farage was photographed with a sheet of paper with the heading ‘Women-friendly policies’. The briefing note included, ‘Remove 5 per cent VAT from sanitary products’, along with previously announced policies such as extra NHS staff. Mr Farage did not talk about the policy on the programme. Nigel Farage joked he spends 6 hours in the pub . Nigel Farage joked that he spent up to six hours a day in the pub as he was challenged about the impact of his drinking on his family life. He was asked whether he has any 'guilt' about being seen as a beer-swilling, chain-smoking figure. He joked: 'I only spend five or six hours a day in the pub, that's all I do. I can't see what all the fuss is about.' But Nadia  Sawalha told him: 'If I was your wife I would be giving you a bad telling off for that, what does your wife think?' She told him that working long hours, smoking and drinking was not a 'good example' for the public. But Mr Farage repeated his recent admission that he rarely sees his family as a result of his work. 'I get up at five o'clock in the morning, I'm rarely home before midnight. I think at lunchtime I deserve a sherbet.'","Ukip leader appears on daytime TV to soften image with female voters .

"A man is in police custody after he arrived at his lawyer's Fort Myers office claiming he had killed a man in self defense and that the man's body was outside in his pickup truck. John Marshall, told his lawyer that a neighbor had approached him with a gun and that he had fatally shot the unnamed man in a scuffle earlier on Wednesday afternoon, said Robert Harris, Marshall's attorney and owner of the Harris Law Firm. Marshall, 52, had a swollen lip, a freshly missing tooth, another tooth that is chipped and what looked like two broken thumbs, Harris said. John Marshall, pictured right in a previous mugshot,  told lawyer Robert Harris that a neighbor had approached him with a gun and that he had fatally shot the unnamed man in a scuffle earlier on Wednesday afternoon . Marshall's green pickup sat for much of Wednesday afternoon at the back of Marshall's law firm with crime scene tape around it and a dead body in the back . He told Naples Daily News that Marshall looked 'like he'd been in a fight for his life.' Marshall told Harris he'd been at one of his properties in Bokeelia when his neighbor had come at him with a gun. Marshall said his neighbor pistol-whipped him, knocking out a tooth, and said the two ended up in a wrestling match on the ground, each man squirming for the gun. After killing his neighbor Marshall said he brought the man to the attorney's office because he didn't know who else to trust. Harris called 911 shortly after his client arrived at the law firm about 4 p.m. Harris said the man was cooperating with authorities.

"Many of us pass urine without thinking – or looking – at the colour of it. But perhaps it’s time to take note, because our pee can say a lot about our health, according to one doctor. Speaking on ITV’s This Morning, Dr Chris Steele explained what each shade of pee – from clear to red to green and blue – tells us about the body. He lined up test tubes of a range of colours of urine, from clear through to dark yellow, to red and blue. His first piece of advice is to look at the colour of urine while peeing, rather than when it has hit the toilet bowl. Scroll down for video . Dr Chris Steele, a GP and resident doctor on ITV's This Morning, said people should look at the colour of their urine while they are peeing, not when the urine has hit the bowl and is diluted in water . Red and dark red urine (pictured) could be caused by certain foods like beetroot or drugs like laxatives. However, it could be due to blood in the urine, signalling an infection, or tumours or kidney stones . He told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'You should look at the colour in the stream that you’re passing, not when it’s in the toilet bowl, because it gets diluted in two litres of water.’ When asked if this would be a bit difficult for women, he replied: ‘You can even catch it if you’re worried.’ And when thinking about the colour of our pee, it's important to remember how food, drink and medication could be affecting it, he added. He said: ‘Laxatives can cause a darkening colour of the urine. Always think about what you’re putting in your mouth, could that be affecting things?’ An example of this is asparagus and food colourants that can turn the urine blue or green. Meanwhile, urine that is frothy and foamy could be a warning sign someone is eating too much protein and needs to cut back, he said. ‘It could be due to protein. Maybe you’re on a high protein diet. Or it could be due to infection.' Next, he explained what each shade of pee means, in terms of health. Clear urine could be a sign of a ‘good hydrated person’, Dr Steele said. However, it could be because they are taking diuretic medicine which is making them pass water frequently. The diagram, created by the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, shows that urine should be straw coloured or pale yellow. If it is darker, it suggests the person is dehydrated . He added: ‘They might be drinking diuretic-type drinks, such as coffee and alcohol. They can cause this effect.’ He explained that the kidneys have two main functions: the first being to filter out toxins, create waste matter, and get it out of the body. The second is to balance fluid in the body; the fluid gained from drinks and metabolic reactions in the body, and the fluids lost through sweat. A deep yellow coloured urine means the person is more dehydrated. He said: ‘In the morning you might notice your urine is darker coloured than in the evening. 'This is because in the night you’ve just been laying there doing nothing and your kidneys have been working concentrating the toxic effects. If a person's urine is brown, it could be a sign of liver disease. If it is red, it could contain blood . Orange urine is normally a sign of dehydration, but could be a liver or bile duct disorder. Blue or green urine is normally due to food dye or medication . ‘Deep yellow urine could be a sign of liver problems which cause jaundice of the skin, eyes, and the urine to become more yellow.’ But the most important colour to look out for is a pink or light red colour. If a person has red-coloured urine, it could be because they ate certain foods the night before. Dr Steele said: ‘Beetroot, blackberries, blackcurrants even rhubarb [are all common culprits]. Food colourants are powerful and can get through the kidneys.’ However, it could be a more serious sign of infection from the kidney travelling down through the bladder and urethra. It could also be due to a tumour, or kidney stones. ‘But the commonest reasons for red urine is cystitis - or urinary tract infections,’ Dr Steele said. ‘This causes excess blood to come out into the urine.’ A person with dark red urine is deeply dehydrated, he warned. ‘We’re talking about patients with liver disease,' he explained. Foaming or fizzing urine is usually a sign of too much protein in the diet, or a kidney problem .","GP Dr Chris Steele advises people to check the colour of their urine .
Check the colour mid-stream, rather than when the pee has hit the bowl .

"Children who spend a lot of time playing video games do better at school, an international study has suggested. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said there was strong evidence that playing computer games on handheld consoles like Nintendo DSs and Sony PSPs had 'positive effects on learning'. It said many games 'incorporate good learning principles' and can 'hone problem-solving skills'. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said there was strong evidence that playing computer games had 'positive effects on learning' Girls are more likely to get higher marks at school because teachers like them more, an international report has found. Teachers consistently give better results to girls even when they perform similarly in international tests, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said. It suggests that teachers have a 'gender bias' towards girls because they are well behaved and listen in class. 'Girls' better marks may reflect the fact that they tend to be 'better students' than boys: they tend to do what is required and expected of them, thanks to better self-regulation skills, and they are more driven to excel in school,' the study says. But this may harm girls' future career prospects, the OECD suggests, because bosses  reward people based on what they  can do rather than their school grades. Students who play one-player video games between once a month and almost every day perform better in mathematics, reading, science and problem solving than students who hardly ever play games, the OECD said. But the evidence shows that playing computer games only helps children at school if they are not competing against other people over the internet. Boys are much more likely than girls to play computer games – but often get caught up in shoot 'em ups and other online competitions against other players, the study said. This means that playing on the computer at home helps girls more than boys. The report said: 'The gender gap in video gaming translates into a performance advantage for girls.' However, it also warns that the 'addictive nature of gaming' has its downsides. It said: 'Students who play video games excessively might not be able to focus on their work at school, may be less willing to spend time on school work at home, might develop sleep problems, and might be less perseverant if there are no immediate rewards for their efforts, like those offered in gaming.' Today's shock research comes after Boris Johnson claimed video games were helping children become 'nicer, kinder and more well-balanced' than their parents – and was even helping to cut crime. Students who play one-player video games between once a month and almost every day perform better in mathematics, reading, science and problem solving than students who hardly ever play games . The London Mayor ridiculed claims mobile phones and handheld games consoles were turning youngsters into 'lidless lizards'. Mr Johnson said he understood people's concerns when they saw their children 'bathed perpetually in the light of the screen gazing like lidless lizards at whatever depraved and corrupting material they can find'. But Mr Johnson said: 'I see no evidence whatever that tech is coarsening or depraving the young people of today. Boris Johnson has praised video games for making today's teenagers more sociable than their parents . 'In fact I would say that on the whole the younger generation are nicer, kinder, more well-balanced and more emotionally literate than my lot ever were.' The London Mayor added: 'And when you consider the very steep falls in crime that we are seeing not just in London but across the developed world and when you consider that crime is overwhelmingly committed by young men you have to wonder whether there is a correlation - a link between the tech boom and the rise in civility. 'What do they suffer from, the young men who are so foolish as to get sucked into crime? Anger, low self-esteem, a sense of social exclusion - a feeling that no one much cares about them. 'And what do they get from these gizmos – endless opportunities for self-expression, communication - the myriad pipette drops of self-affirmation that come with the selfie and the text and the shared video.' Today's OECD's report also warns against the growing divide between girls and boys in science and maths. It blames gender stereotypes and girls' lack of confidence for putting them off the core subjects. The report - using research from international tests in reading, maths and science to examine gender differences in education - argues that parents, teachers and employers all have ingrained 'biases' that they are passing on to youngsters. Across the 64 nations examined, women are much less likely to consider careers in science and maths-based subjects and to have the same self-confidence as boys in these areas. Overall, less than one in 20 girls considers working in science, technology, engineering and maths, compared to one in five boys, despite the sexes achieving similar results in international science tests.","OECD report finds computer games have 'positive effects on learning'

"Burglars have broken into the office of one of Michael Schumacher's top doctors, raising fears they have stolen medical data that reveals the true extent of his condition. A laptop was among the items stolen in the break-in at the surgery of Dr Johannes Peil, 60, who has been one of the F1 star's physicians for many years. Mr Peil is also part of the 15-strong team of medics currently caring for Schumacher, 46, at his home on lake Geneva following his catastrophic ski accident in the Swiss Alps in 2013. Scroll down for video . Fears for his privacy: Burglars have targeted the offices of Michael Schumacher's top doctor Johannes Peil (left), raising concerns they have taken  medical data that reveals the true extent of the star's injuries . The clinic in Bad Nauheim in Germany was broken into between Saturday afternoon and Monday morning through an open cellar door. Dr Peil's other prominent patients include Nico Rosberg and Tibetan spiritual leader The Dalai Lama. Money, some perfume and prescription forms were also stolen. Last year, a helicopter rescue worker who treated Schumacher hanged himself in a Zurich jail cell after being arrested for stealing details of his condition which he tried to sell to news organisations. Schumacher spent months in a coma following the accident before being transferred to a rehab clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland. He was then moved to a medical suite built into his mansion in September. Road to recovery: Schumacher (pictured with wife Corinna in 2004) was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France when the accident happened in December 2013 . Since then, a news blackout has fallen over his condition, but insiders report he remains mute and unable to move. Last month, it was revealed that Schumacher had sold his Norwegian mountain holiday home for £2million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries. The sale of the retreat, in Trysil, north of Oslo, comes after it emerged last year that his family was planning to build a £10million 'hospital' room for the star at their home in Switzerland. Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened in December 2013. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But shortly after 11am, he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. Liquidating his assets: Michael Schumacher's family has sold his Norwegian mountain holiday home (pictured) for £2million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries . It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident. Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry, Prosecutor Patrick Quincy, closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out. He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run. At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. Since September last year he has been looked after by medical experts at his home in Gland, Switzerland.","Laptop among items taken in raid on surgery in Bad Nauheim in Germany .

"Yesterday saw the Countess of Wessex tour the set, accompanied by the Mexican First Lady, Angélica Rivera. Now Kensington Palace has announced that Downton Abbey is to have a second royal visitor, this time, the Duchess of Cambridge. Kate, 33, will travel to Ealing Studios in London, where she will be shown around the set and introduced to cast members, among them Dame Maggie Smith who plays the formidable Dowager Countess. Scroll down for video . Going to Downton: The Duchess of Cambridge is to visit the set of Downton Abbey next week . Other cast members due to be introduced to the Duchess include Phyllis Logan, who plays Mrs Hughes, and Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern who play the Earl and Countess of Grantham. The Duchess, who is eight months pregnant with her second child, will also watch a scene being filmed and be shown a walkway crammed with memorabilia detailing the history of Ealing Studios. The cast are currently filming series six of the long-running ITV drama, with cast and crew splitting their time between Ealing and locations such as Highclere Castle in Berkshire which stands in for the eponymous Downton Abbey. Downton is, of course, no stranger to royal visits having previously hosted the Countess of Wessex and, in 2011, royal in-laws Carole, Michael and Pippa Middleton. Royal visit: Yesterday saw the Countess of Wessex and Mexico's Angélica Rivera pay a visit to the set . Visitors: Pippa Middleton has visited the set and the Duchess of Cornwall is a 'Downton addict' Meeting the royals: Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern are among cast members who will meet Kate . The drama also boasts several royal fans, among them the Duchess of Cornwall who confessed to being a 'Downton addict' when she met cast member Lesley Nichol (Mrs Patmore) last year. Another fan of the drama is the Duchess of Cambridge who, in 2011, told Jessica Findlay-Brown, who played Lady Sybil that she and Prince William are both avid viewers. One royal who is yet to visit is the Queen, although she did get a taste of life on set when she visited the cast of Game of Thrones in Belfast last year. Although Her Majesty declined to sit on the infamous Iron Throne, she did reference the TV series during the 2014 Queen's speech.

Downton creator Julian Fellowes has also been known to write the royals, albeit historical ones, into the series with the 2013 season including a storyline about Edward VIII and his first great love, Freda Dudley-Ward. The story focused on Lady Rose's debut which, in the series, was staged at Buckingham Palace and, in one scene, saw her dance in the arms of the future king who was played by Oliver Dinsdale. His father, George V, also made an appearance in the 2013 Christmas episode, with the Queen's grandfather portrayed by Guy Williams.","The Duchess of Cambridge will visit the set of Downton Abbey next week .

"Lewis Lowe, pictured, stole the £60,000 Porsche 911 Carrera GTS from outside solicitor Paul Ackroyd's home and took it on a 100mph joyride . A car thief wrote off a lawyer's luxury Porsche during a 104mph police chase - not realising it was a model so rare it was one of only four in Britain. Lewis Lowe, 24, stole the 2011 911 Carrera GTS in broad daylight after spotting the car parked on the driveway of personal injury specialist Paul Ackroyd who at the time was on a family ski-ing holiday in Austria. Just half an hour later, Lowe, of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, was spotted by police driving the £60,000 car - described as Mr Ackroyd's 'pride and joy' on the M60, and a six-mile high speed chase commenced along the motorway. Lowe weaved in and out of traffic at 100mph, forcing cars to move and slow down dangerously, before he attempted to move on to the A666 towards Bolton at the same speed. The high-powered vehicle eventually slewed out of control and ended up in bramble bushes on the embankment where it was damaged beyond repair. Tragically, it later emerged father of three Mr Ackroyd, 46, had been planning to take his 11 year old disabled son Edward on a road trip in the Porsche around the Scottish Highlands on return from the skiing trip, as the boy's disability meant he had not been able to go to Austria. At Manchester Crown Court, Lowe was jailed for two years after earlier admitting aggravated vehicle taking, burglary, dangerous driving and driving without a licence and insurance. After the case Mr Ackroyd a founding partner of a law firm in Rochdale said: 'I got a call when I was away on holiday from the tracking company. You just feel so helpless. The first thing I wanted to know was whether they had been on the house or just stolen the car. It was devastating to find that they had been in the house as well. 'It had taken me a long time to find that car. There were only four on the market and it had taken me nine months to find the right one. I love motoring and cars are my passion. It was the special edition so it was a really special car. I only bought the car in October last year and the kids loved it. 'Edward is terminally ill with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and he in particular adored the car. In many ways I bought the car because of him. He couldn't come on holiday with us in January so the two of us were going to do a grand tour of the Scottish Highlands in the car. 'It is only a car but it meant so much to him. It has been very upsetting. I drive a Volvo estate as my everyday car and the tour in Scotland wouldn't be the same in that car.' The court heard the theft occurred at 1pm on January 23 after opportunist Lowe spotted the Porsche and sneaked around the outside of Mr Ackroyd's cottage in Oldham to establish it was empty. He smashed through patio doors and helped himself to iPods, a PlayStation3 and the keys to the car before driving away in it. Lowe broke into Mr Ackroyd's home, stole electronic goods as well as his 'pride and joy' Porsche 911 . Mr Ackroyd was planning to take his terminally ill son on a driving holiday around Scotland in the car . The car, pictured, was written-off after Lowe lost control at 100mph and crashed into an embankment . Shortly afterwards Mr Ackroyd who had a tracking device fitted inside the Porsche, got a call from a vehicle tracking company who said his car was on the move. Prosecuting, Juliette Berry said: 'The police having received information about the stolen car saw it on the M60 in Prestwich. Officers from the Tactical Aid Unit notified other colleagues. 'The defendant realised the police had seen him and while still on the motorway accelerated away and drove in and out of traffic. They activated the emergency equipment and a pursuit commenced. He tried to negotiate to the slip road at 100mph, left the road and hit the embankment causing the vehicle to stop. The airbags were deployed and the vehicle was damaged. Lowe tried to flee on foot but soon gave himself up to officers and admitted he had stolen the vehicle earlier that day. The tracking device fitted to Mr Ackroyd's car later provided evidence that Lowe had also sped through a residential 30mph zone in the country town of Slaithwaite at 82mph and he hit a top speed of 104mph before the crash. Miss Berry added: 'The Porsche was worth £60,000. I understand it is particularly rare. There were only four in the country and the impact upon Mr Ackroyd has been significant. He was on holiday with two children. The third child is disabled and was unable to go. Father and son had planned a road trip around the Scottish Highlands in the vehicle and were unable to do that and his son was very upset.' In a statement, Mr Ackroyd said his children are now reluctant to stay at his home as they don't feel safe and he has been forced to increase security. Defending Lowe, who has 10 previous convictions for 20 offences, Sara Haq said: 'He expresses that he fully embraces a custodial sentence because he acknowledges at the time of the offences he was not coping with life in the community and custody provides him with the stability he can't find in the community. The defendant is glad to be there. 'He accepts that he was looking for something to steal that day and came across a house that was clearly unoccupied with an attractive vehicle on the driveway and he took the opportunity.' Sentencing Judge Maurice Greene said: 'There were only four in the country of this particular type of car. You were tempted by this vehicle and drove it away. You were seen by the police but decided to try and escape because you were, I suspect, looking for the excitement of driving at speed. 'A £60,000 vehicle was written off which was devastating for Mr Ackroyd as it was his pride and joy and we also heard about how his children feel about the intrusion to his house. That's the traumatic effect a house burglary has. It's not always what is taken but the intrusion to a place people are entitled to feel safe. It is really by luck more than anything else neither you nor other people were killed.' Lowe was jailed for two years at Manchester Crown Court, pictured, after admitting the theft . After the case Detective Constable Adam Frank said: 'It is a miracle that Lowe did not kill either himself or someone else. He drove in such a reckless way and at such dangerous speeds that if he had crashed into another car, I have no doubt we could be talking today about a fatality. 'He also showed no signs of slowing down or giving himself up until he crashed into an embankment, suffering only the indignity of some scratches from the brambles he tried to run through and the cuff marks when we arrested him. 'I am pleased to see Lowe behind bars, not least because he is a burglar who could still be out there today targeting people's homes. I am sure the streets are much safer with this reckless and foolhardy individual behind bars. 'But also for the family who have suffered tremendously from Lowe's actions. He invaded the sanctity of their home, stole their property and wrecked a very expensive car. I know from speaking to them just how traumatic this has been for them, to the point where the three children have been so badly shaken up they refuse to now stay in their own home. 'That is the type of crippling effect burglars like Lowe can have so I am really pleased he has been convicted and is now firmly behind bars where he belongs.'","Lewis Lowe stole the incredibly rare Porsche 911 GTS on January 23 .

"Three fraudsters who used the names of more than 200 dead children to launder profits from an attempted £1m VAT fraud have been jailed for more than 16 years. Saheed Oyeneye, 35, Rasaq Omotunde, 38, and Oluwakemi Adesaogun, 38, all from south east London, set up hundreds of bogus online HMRC accounts to ‘get rich quick’ off the public purse. The Nigerian-born adopted false identities of hundreds of unsuspecting victims, mirroring the tactic employed by the assassin in The Day of the Jackal, as part of his plot to shoot French president Charles de Gaulle. Rasaq Omotunde, 38 (left) and Saheed Oyeneye, 35, (right), both from south east London, were part of a fraud gang who used the names of more than 200 children to launder profits from an attempted VAT fraud . In a scenario similar to that of the Frederick Forsyth novel, the trio men stole the identities of more than 200 dead British babies, before using their names to bombard the government with tax repayment applications. They also adopted the identities of sports personalities, including cricketers and rugby union stars, by scouring the internet for their personal details and cobbling together a fake profile. The three men also targeted thousands of  members of the public as they attempted to swindle £1m, Southwark Crown Court was told. In total, the gang managed to pocket around £250,000, which was banked across hundreds of accounts which had been set up under false names. But the trio were rumbled early on by HMRC and did not pay out more than three-quarters of the money. When their homes were searched, investigators discovered the personal details of more than 200 dead children were stored on computers, the court heard. At the peak of the fraud, the thieves were using more than 20 internet cafes to register up to 301 new accounts a day. Pictured: Oluwakemi Adesaogun . At the peak of the fraud, the thieves were using more than 20 internet cafes to register up to 301 new accounts a day. Oluwakemi Adesaogun, 38, from Woolwich, was the third member of the group . Oyeneye, from Hither Green, Omotunde, from Sydenham and Adesaogun, from Woolwich, all pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud. Today, Judge Stephen Robbins jailed Oyeneye for five and a half years, Omotunde for six years and Adesaogun for five years. After the sentencing, Christopher Gill, Assistant Director, Criminal Investigation, HMRC, said: ‘This trio thought they were running a high-tech and sophisticated fraud using a series of addresses and internet cafes to set up accounts using stolen data. ‘They bombarded the system with applications for tax repayments from these fake accounts, in the hope of getting rich quick. ‘These fraudsters thought the anonymity of the internet would protect them.' He added: 'This case demonstrates that we can and will track down and prosecute those who attack our online systems. ‘This was nothing but a common repayment fraud attempt which our systems quickly identified as bogus. HMRC shuts down the vast majority of bogus repayment applications.’ The trio will face confiscation proceedings at a later date but most of the money has already vanished. The book's protagonist - the Jackal - trawls three village graveyards looking for the headstone of a baby boy who, had he not died, would have been about the same age as the assassin. Taking the details of the late Alexander James Quentin Duggan to the Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths, the Jackal buys a copy of the deceased's birth certificate - all the proof he needs to successfully apply for a passport.","Trio, from south east London, set up hundreds of bogus HMRC accounts .

"She arrived in a flurry of cream silk and tipped a wink to the royals as her car pulled up on Horse Guards Parade. Today, Angélica Rivera was back in a cream ensemble as she said her farewells to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace this morning. The moment came at the end of the three-day state visit from Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto and his glamorous wife, with the couple set to spend the afternoon in Aberdeen before flying home tonight. Scroll down for video . On their way: The Queen emerges from Buckingham Palace with President Enrique Peña Nieto . President Peña Nieto, 48, and Ms Rivera, 45, began the visit with a ceremonial welcome on Horse Guards Parade. There, they were treated to a 42-gun Royal Salute and a traditional procession along the Mall, with the Queen travelling with President Peña Nieto in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach. Behind them came the Duke of Edinburgh and Ms Rivera who chatted happily as they waved at the crowds from their seats in the Australian State Coach. Ms Rivera, a former soap star, was then squired on a tour of the Royal Collection by a clearly charmed Duke of Edinburgh, with the pair seen deep in conversation as they inspected a saddle presented to Prince Philip during a visit to Mexico in 1975.

Ms Rivera's whirlwind tour also included a solo visit to the set of Downton Abbey alongside the Countess of Wessex yesterday, and a dinner at London's Guildhall. Meanwhile, her husband spent much of yesterday locked in talks, with Nick Clegg visiting the president at Buckingham Palace in the morning and Ed Miliband following in the afternoon. In between meetings, President Peña Nieto travelled to Downing Street for a meeting with the Prime Minister, during which the issue of human rights was raised. But the Mexican leader was back at his wife's side for last night's dinner at the London Guildhall, where they were joined by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and his wife Birgitte.

On arrival, the couple were welcomed with a  Royal Salute fired from the cannons at the Tower of London during which a total of 62 shots were fired - the basic 21-gun Royal Salute, plus another 20 because the Tower is a royal palace and a further 21 for the City of London. The Mexican National Anthem was then played and President Peña Nieto was invited to inspect a Guard of Honour before making his way inside. At the end of the banquet, both President Peña Nieto and Lord Mayor Yarrow made speeches - in President Peña Nieto's case, for the second night in a row. The Mexican couple, who are currently in Aberdeen meeting with the Secretary of State for Scotland, Alastair Carmichael MP, will spend the afternoon touring the Robert Gordon University. During the visit, they will be introduced to academics and be shown a demonstration of the Drilling and Advanced Rig Training simulator.
